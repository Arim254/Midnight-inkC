On Wednesday, President Trump signed the legislation directing the Department of Justice to release those files.\n                \n                    Mehmet Eser/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mehmet Eser/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   New releases from Jeffrey Epstein's estate shine additional light on the array of powerful figures who kept ties to the disgraced financier after his criminal charges came to light.   Spread throughout the roughly 23,000 documents released by the House Oversight Committee last week, emails and texts show Epstein courted prominent politicos from both sides of the aisle, impressed academics and used his connections to push back on negative stories about his alleged crimes.   Epstein's career as a wealthy financier who gave money to universities and other causes put him in many elite circles.   Those circles did not entirely close to him after he pleaded guilty to state charges of solicitation of prostitution and of solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18 in 2008.   \n   Reading through the text messages and emails released, the people who consulted with Epstein rarely acknowledged the severity of the crimes that required him to register as a sex offender, though simply corresponding with Epstein does not implicate individuals in his criminal activities, convicted or accused.   \n   There's an apparent letter of recommendation for Epstein from linguist Noam Chomsky, calling him a \"highly valued friend,\" that recalled how Epstein connected him with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak — another frequent Epstein correspondent.   \"Jeffrey constantly raises searching questions and puts forth provocative ideas, which have repeatedly led me to rethink crucial issues,\" the letter reads.   There's advice Epstein gave to Steve Bannon, Trump's former strategist, about ways to build a far-right political movement overseas.   \"If you are going to play here, you'll have to spend time, [E]urope by remote doesn't work,\" Epstein wrote in 2018. \"Lots and lots of face time and hand holding. Europe can be a wife not a mistress.\"   Former Harvard University president and onetime Treasury Secretary Larry Summers is documented numerous times having intimate personal chats with Epstein, including asking for romantic advice and joking about women's intelligence.   \"I yipped about inclusion,\" wrote Summers in 2017. \"I observed that half the IQ [in the] world was possessed by women without mentioning they are more than 51 percent of population....\"   \n   Summers resigned as Harvard's president in 2006 after arguing that women may be innately less capable in math and science.   \n   In the week since the latest Epstein emails release, he has resigned from the board of OpenAI and abruptly left his teaching role at Harvard, as the university announced a probe of \"information concerning individuals at Harvard included in the newly released Jeffrey Epstein documents to evaluate what actions may be warranted.\"   Summers isn't the only high-profile Democrat who found themself in varying degrees of Epstein's orbit. Kathryn Ruemmler, former White House counsel in the Obama administration and current chief legal officer for Goldman Sachs, messaged with Epstein before and during Trump's first term.   \"Trump is living proof of the adage that it is better to be lucky than smart,\" she wrote in August 2015.   \"I regret ever knowing Jeffrey Epstein,\" Ruemmler told The Wall Street Journal in 2023.   More than a thousand mentions of Trump   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A protester holds a sign related to the release of the Jeffrey Epstein case files outside the Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Nov.12. President Trump signed the congressional legislation that directs the Department of Justice to release the files late Wednesday evening.\n                \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Trump promised to release the Epstein files on the campaign trail but largely stonewalled the effort this year since he returned to office, frequently calling the push for more transparency around the Epstein case a \"hoax\" perpetrated by Democrats.   In a Wednesday Truth Social post announcing the signing of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, Trump said Democrats were using the issue to distract from what he says are victories for his administration.   \"Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\" he posted.   The president has the authority to release the files without congressional action.   Trump is a frequent subject of emails and text messages in the latest file tranche — well over a thousand different mentions — though mainly the subject of Epstein's near-obsession with his presidency, as the latter positioned himself as a Trump whisperer of sorts to his powerful associates.   \n   This week, after an abrupt reversal that led to the near-unanimous approval of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the president has now called for Democrats mentioned in Epstein's communications to be investigated by the Justice Department.   \"I will be asking A.G. Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.   Other Republicans are going on the offensive too — highlighting revelations that Epstein was texting Democratic Del. Stacey Plaskett of the U.S. Virgin Islands during a House Oversight Committee hearing with Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen in 2019.   Comparing the newly released messages with the video of the hearing, minutes after Epstein suggested Plaskett ask Cohen things about the Trump Organization, Plaskett posed similar questions.   An effort to censure Plaskett in the House failed Tuesday. In a floor speech, Plaskett defended her actions as receiving information from a constituent and said it was \"not public knowledge at that time that he was under federal investigation.\"   Amid the partisan finger-pointing around the Epstein files, some of Epstein's accusers are imploring the president not to make things partisan and focus on the other powerful people that they say haven't faced scrutiny — regardless of political party.   What's next for the government's Epstein files?   Within 30 days of Trump signing the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the attorney general is supposed to make \"all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" available in a searchable and downloadable format.   That includes information that relates to Epstein, his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell and \"individuals named or referenced in connection with Epstein's criminal activities.\"   There's also a focus on information regarding plea deals and decisions not to charge Epstein for other alleged crimes, as well as documents pertaining to his 2019 death by suicide in federal custody.   \n   Over the summer, the FBI put out a memo that said their files include \"a significant amount of material, including more than 300 gigabytes of data and physical evidence.\"   Some of that includes photos and videos of Epstein's accusers, including minors, and disturbing material that will not be made public. The bill from Congress also says anything \"that would jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution\" can be withheld or redacted, too.   With Trump's ordering of the investigation into Democrats and financial institutions mentioned in the Epstein correspondence, it is unclear how much of the Justice Department's files will be released, to what extent they will be redacted and when they ultimately will be made public.\n",

Jason Crow, D-Colo., Chris DeLuzio, D-Pa, Maggie Goodlander, D-N.H., and Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., and Sens. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., where the lawmakers address members of the military and intelligence communities and said, \"You can refuse illegal orders,\" repeating the phrase several times before saying, \"You must refuse illegal orders.\"   \n   The lawmakers, all of whom come from military backgrounds, said, \"This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens.\" The video, posted to Facebook, also says \"right now the threats of our Constitution aren't just coming from abroad but right here at home.\"   Asked during the daily White House briefing if he wanted execute members of Congress, Leavitt said: \"No.\"   \"The sanctity of our military rests on the chain of command, and if that chain of command is broken, it can lead to people getting killed. It can lead to chaos, and that's what these members of Congress who swore an oath to abide by the Constitution are essentially encouraging,\" Leavitt said.   The president also reposted a series of comments from users on Truth Social, including posts that said the Democrats should be hanged, the actions were an insurrection and they should all be indicted because of the video.   In the video Democrats didn't call out any specific actions that military or intelligence officials have been told to carry out, but they said that the Trump administration is \"pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens.\" They added that military and intelligence personnel swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution.   \n   \"Right now the threats to our Constitution aren't just coming from abroad, but right here at home,\" they said. \"No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution.\"   They ended the video by telling those in the military and intelligence officials, \"Don't give up the ship,\" referring to the famous last words of James Lawrence, a Navy Captain during the war of 1812, to keep fighting and not surrender.   Members of the military do swear an oath to the Constitution and are trained that \"following orders\" is not a defense for illegal acts.   The lawmakers issued a joint statement to Trump's response, saying in part, \"We are veterans and national security professionals who love this country and swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. That oath lasts a lifetime, and we intend to keep it. No threat, intimidation, or call for violence will deter us from that sacred obligation.\"   \"Every American must unite and condemn the President's calls for our murder and political violence. This is a time for moral clarity,\" they said.   House Democratic leadership — House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, of New York, whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California — called for Trump to remove the posts and for Republicans to condemn them.   \"We unequivocally condemn Donald Trump's disgusting and dangerous death threats against Members of Congress and call on House Republicans to forcefully do the same,\" they wrote.   \"We have been in contact with the House Sergeant at Arms and the United States Capitol Police to ensure the safety of these Members and their families,\" the statement adds. \"Donald Trump must immediately delete these unhinged social media posts and recant his violent rhetoric before he gets someone killed.\"   Trump hasn't deleted the social media posts. \n",

    "body": "\n      President Trump signed a bill to compel the release of the Epstein files. NPR's A Martinez asks journalist Vicky Ward what stands out to her from what's been released so far and what could come next.   \n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  We go now to Vicky Ward. She's an investigative journalist who profiled Jeffrey Epstein for Vanity Fair in 2003, and she has been following this story ever since. Vicky, we just heard some of what we're still learning about Jeffrey Epstein from the documents released by Congress. What has stood out to you so far?VICKY WARD: I think what stood out is, how - I mean, I was surprised how obsessed Jeffrey Epstein was with Donald Trump for years and years and years after they had reportedly stopped speaking in 2004. The fact that over 50% of the emails that were put out last week by Congress that came from the estate were Epstein discussing Donald Trump, I think, was very, very telling.I thought it was also very interesting that the email Jeffrey Epstein sort of sent to himself, a kind of memo, if you will...MARTÍNEZ: Yeah.WARD: ...And he then forwarded on to the journalist Michael Wolff in 2019, the year when it sort of became clear that the noose was tightening around Epstein, the year when - just right after the Miami Herald had done its brilliant series about him, when Congress was starting to bang the drum, saying why has this man avoided justice for so long...MARTÍNEZ: Yeah.WARD: ...Epstein sits down and he writes this sort of memo, and in it, he documents what he thinks are - Trump has done financially, back in 2004.MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. It's like he's angered or hurt by their friendship breakup.WARD: Yes.MARTÍNEZ: Yeah.WARD: Well, I think the other email to that end that was interesting to me was the one in 2011 when he wrote to Ghislaine Maxwell, have you noticed the dog that didn't bark yet? It's Donald Trump. And I thought that was interesting because you have to remember the context of that. Spring 2011 was when Virginia Roberts Giuffre first publicly spoke to a newspaper, and that photograph of herself with Prince Andrew and Ghislaine Maxwell in the background, supposedly taken by Jeffrey Epstein, was first published in the Mail on Sunday.MARTÍNEZ: Yeah.WARD: And the reason that I, you know - and the articles at that time talked about the men that Virginia Roberts had met through Epstein, Trump was not named, but he was mentioned as somebody who was in Epstein's circles. And the reason I mention all of this is because Epstein did believe that - he believed, doesn't mean it's true - that the person who went to the Palm Beach law authorities, who went to the local police and told them about the girls was, in fact, Trump...MARTÍNEZ: Oh, wow.WARD: ...And that after this - after relations between them soured over this acquisition of a mansion.MARTÍNEZ: Vicky, it's worth noting that President Trump could have ordered these files to be released on his own without needing an act of Congress. So when we think about what's left in the files, do you think that there is anything there that could lead to criminal charges for someone - for someone that's in these files or do - is it, what we have left at this point, just shaming by Epstein association?WARD: I think the latter. I think if there were really going to be criminal charges, those would have been brought already. I don't - I think you've seen the women on Capitol Hill, the survivors, how are increasingly gaining their power, finding their voices, and I'm sure that they would not have rested if there was someone out there who they believed criminal charges needed to be brought against.But I do think that all the people who were complicit around Jeffrey Epstein, who knew what was going on, who stayed in touch with him, as your reporter pointed out, knowing that he was a convicted sex offender, are likely to be shamed and embarrassed, as they should.MARTÍNEZ: One more thing. Just a few seconds to go, Vicky. Do you think the Epstein victims in this process so far are getting as close to healing as they can possibly get?WARD: Yeah. I spoke to one of them yesterday, and she said, it feels like a victory. It feels like we've been seen and people care about us for the first time.MARTÍNEZ: Investigative reporter, Vicky Ward. Vicky, thank you.WARD: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Nearly all of them voted to force a release of the Epstein files after President Trump reversed his position. But even before that vote, a handful of Republicans signaled a willingness to take on the president over a different contentious issue. NPR's Andrea Hsu explains.ANDREA HSU, BYLINE: Back in late March, President Trump signed an executive order directing around 20 federal agencies to end collective bargaining rights for most federal workers, citing national security concerns. The move outraged the unions.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)EVERETT KELLEY: This isn't about safety or security.HSU: Everett Kelley is president of the American Federation of Government Employees. They represent the lion's share of the roughly 1 million employees affected by the order.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KELLEY: It's about silencing workers who are courageously standing up to this nonintegrity, to his nonaccountability in the government.HSU: The White House explained that unions have been obstructing agency management, and said that's dangerous in agencies with national security responsibilities. According to Trump, that includes the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency. Later, he added NASA and the National Weather Service. Since January, the American Federation of Government Employees has been hostile to Trump's agenda. It's filed lawsuits to block mass layoffs, the dismantling of agencies and, yes, the termination of its union contracts.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KELLEY: This executive order is plainly retaliatory. The executive order says plainly that they are taking this action because AFGE is standing up for our members.HSU: And here's where House lawmakers come in. Democrat Jared Golden of Maine introduced a bill.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JARED GOLDEN: The Protect America's Workforce Act, which would overturn President Trump's executive order.HSU: It would also restore any collective bargaining agreements canceled since March. Within days, the bill had gained enough Republican co-sponsors to pass in the House, but getting it to a vote was another matter. Leadership wasn't on board. So Golden turned to the same procedural tactic House lawmakers used to force a vote on the Epstein files - the discharge petition. Two hundred eighteen signatures guarantees a vote. Golden spoke at a press conference in July.(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)GOLDEN: If every member who signed on to this bill would join us, we could overturn this union-busting action and show America that this body will protect workers' rights, no matter what.HSU: And this week, Golden got to 218 with Republicans Nick LaLota and Michael Lawler of New York signing the petition on Monday. In a statement posted to his website, Lawler wrote, supporting workers and ensuring good government are not opposing ideas. Now, a date for the House vote has not yet been set, and if the bill passes, it would move on to the Senate, where it's far less clear there are enough Republicans willing to defy the president.

President Trump has decided that the U.S. will completely boycott the conference over what he considers the discriminatory treatment of Afrikaners by the South African government. They are the largest subset of the country's white minority, and Afrikaners ran South Africa's government for much of the 20th century and famously oversaw the racist system of apartheid until 1994.   Trump has repeated false claims that the South African government is stealing land from white farmers and that there is an ongoing \"white genocide\" and \"extermination\" of Afrikaners, even taking the unprecedented step of offering refugee status to Afrikaners who want to flee. The first 59 Afrikaner refugees arrived in the U.S. in May.   \n   South African officials — including President Cyril Ramaphosa — have said Trump's claims are untrue and point to official government data showing that attacks against rural Afrikaners are rare, and that the country's Black majority bear the brunt of South Africa's rampant crime.   \n   Lindie Koorts, a historian at the University of Pretoria, said the false narrative has strained some of the progress made in post-apartheid South Africa, as Afrikaners whose ancestors perpetrated apartheid adjust to being a political minority.   \"This is a minority that used to be protected by apartheid laws\" who now don't have the same job security and other economic benefits, said Koorts, who is an Afrikaner. \"It turns into something of existential dread, and that is very, very easily manipulated by the right wing.\"   Here's what to know about the history of the Afrikaners.   Who are Afrikaners?   Afrikaners descend from colonists of mostly Dutch but also German and French origin who landed on the tip of Africa in the 17th century. Many passed through the resupply station established by the Dutch East India Company in present-day Cape Town, an ideal midpoint along the sea routes between Europe and Asia.   Some Afrikaners later moved inland to form large farming colonies as their population grew on the continent. They also became known as Boers, which translates to \"farmers.\"   \n   Disputes between British colonists and the Boer settlers who spoke Afrikaans led to the Boer War, which occurred at the turn of the century. The British forces won, but Afrikaners remained the majority of South Africa's white population after the war and gained control of South Africa's government in the early 20th century.   In 1948, the Afrikaner-led government began to implement apartheid, a system of institutionalized racial segregation that benefited whites. Black people and other non-white South Africans were displaced and dispossessed. Apartheid ended in 1994 with the formation of a new, democratic government led by anti-apartheid activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Nelson Mandela.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                In a joint 1990 press conference, former South African President F.W. de Klerk shakes hands with anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela, who would become the first democratically elected South African president after apartheid.\n                \n                    Rashid Lombard/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Rashid Lombard/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Apartheid helped consolidate wealth among several generations of South Africa's white minority, but its fall stripped them of their political power and has shifted race relations in the country, said Daniel Magaziner, a professor of African history at Yale University.   \"Afrikaners — as white people — do quite well since 1994, but they do lose their political privileges, and so there is a rise in a sense of grievance and nostalgia for what has been lost since they lost their political control over the territory,\" he said.   Magaziner said there remains in South Africa a strong cultural association of Afrikaners with farming, even though most Afrikaners now live in the suburbs or urban areas.   \"But this idea that they're being targeted on farms is something that has a very big afterlife and is one of the reasons the Trump administration claims that these are people worthy — uniquely worthy — of being granted refugee status,\" he said.   Some Afrikaners say they're facing discrimination   Some Afrikaners say they are at risk of having their land stripped away or even facing physical violence and death because they are white, a claim that's been widely disputed by other Afrikaners, South African officials and Ramaphosa.   Right-wing South African groups such as AfriForum have attacked a new federal land expropriation law, which replaces another law from the apartheid era. Critics say the new law lets the government take land from private citizens without compensation.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Afrikaner refugees from South Africa arrive at Dulles International Airport in Virginia on May 12.\n                \n                    Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Under the law, the government can only seize land without paying for it in limited circumstances, such as if the land is not in use. The government must also first attempt to strike a deal with the owner. Most commercial farmland in South Africa is still owned by the country's white minority, who make up about 8% of the population.   \n   AfriForum has also claimed there are widespread murders of white Afrikaner farmers, which it says law enforcement is doing too little to combat, though South Africa's government denies this. And the group has slammed politicians who've continued to sing the apartheid-era song, \"Kill the Boer,\" something Ramaphosa said does not represent the policy of the government.   AfriForum CEO Kallie Kriel told Newzroom Afrika that he wanted the South African government to condemn the song and recognize \"that we are seeing tortures that accompany these murders and declare it a priority crime.\"   \n   The claims have been boosted by some of Trump's allies in the U.S., including Elon Musk, who is from South Africa. In a dramatic Oval Office meeting in May, Trump surprised Ramaphosa with a video montage and news clippings showing what Trump claimed was widespread violence and discrimination against white farmers.   \"You do allow them to take land — when they take the land, they kill the white farmer, and when they kill the white farmer, nothing happens to them,\" Trump said to Ramaphosa, who immediately disputed it.   \n   This year the Trump administration began offering refugee status to Afrikaners, even as the administration cut the total number of refugees it would admit to an all-time low.   How South Africa is responding to claims of discrimination against whites   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump holds up a news article as he discusses what he claims is the widespread killing of white Afrikaners in South Africa, during an Oval Office meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in May. South African officials say the claims are false.\n                \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Ramaphosa and other South African officials say attacks on farming communities are rare. National police data shows that there were six murders on farms in South Africa during the first three months of this year.   Most crime victims in South Africa are Black — not white — officials say. Of the six farm murders from January to March, five of the victims were Black and one was white. South Africa's police minister said earlier this year that farm murders have a history of being \"distorted and reported in an unbalanced way.\"   Many Afrikaners have also disputed the idea that they're being persecuted. A number of Afrikaner journalists, professors and others signed a public petition, saying they rejected the idea that Afrikaners were \"victims of racial persecution in post-apartheid South Africa\" and didn't want to be \"pawns\" for American politicians.   \n   The group said South Africans of all races were facing a slew of problems. \"To cherry-pick white suffering and elevate it above others is dishonest and harmful,\" the petition reads. \"It feeds extremist ideologies that perpetuate division and have inspired real-world violence, including mass shootings.\"   Koorts, one of the signatories, said the allegations of a \"white genocide\" are not true and that Afrikaners have had to do a lot of work to reckon with the violent and racist history of apartheid.   \"What we now see is our story being taken out of context, being twisted for an American audience to make Americans fearful of multiculturalism, of multiracialism, of making Americans fearful of essentially becoming a white minority,\" she said. \"Don't. Please don't. That is not our story. That is a twisted version of our story.\"\n",

Now that the bill has been signed by the president, there's a 30-day countdown for the Justice Department to produce what's commonly known as the Epstein files.   \"This bill is a command for the president to be fully transparent, to come fully clean, and to provide full honesty to the American people,\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Wednesday.   \n   Schumer added that Democrats were ready to push back if they perceive that the president is doing anything but adhering to \"full transparency.\"   In a social media post Wednesday as he announced he had signed the bill, Trump wrote, \"Democrats have used the 'Epstein' issue, which affects them far more than the Republican Party, in order to try and distract from our AMAZING Victories.\"   The swift, bipartisan work in Congress this week was a response to the growing public demand that the Epstein files be released, especially as attention focuses on his connections to global leaders including Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, who has already been stripped of his royal title as Prince Andrew over the matter, and many others.   There is plenty of public anticipation about what more the files could reveal. Yet the bill will most likely trigger a rarely seen baring of a sprawling federal investigation, also creating the potential for unintended consequences.   What does the bill do?   The bill compels Attorney General Pam Bondi to release essentially everything the Justice Department has collected over multiple federal investigations into Epstein, as well as his longtime confidante and girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for luring teenage girls for the disgraced financier. Those records total around 100,000 pages, according to a federal judge who has reviewed the case.   \n   It will also compel the Justice Department to produce all its internal communications on Epstein and his associates and his 2019 death in a Manhattan jail cell as he awaited charges for sexually abusing and trafficking dozens of teenage girls.   The legislation, however, exempts some parts of the case files. The bill's authors made sure to include that the Justice Department could withhold personally identifiable information of victims, child sexual abuse materials and information deemed by the administration to be classified for national defense or foreign policy.   \"We will continue to follow the law with maximum transparency while protecting victims,\" Bondi told a news conference Wednesday when asked about releasing the files.   \n   The bill also allows the Justice Department to withhold information that would jeopardize active investigations or prosecutions. That's created some worry among the bill's proponents that the department would open active investigations into people named in the Epstein files in order to shield that material from public view.   Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a longtime Trump loyalist who has had a prominent split with Trump over the bill, said Tuesday that she saw the administration's compliance with the bill as its \"real test.\"   \"Will the Department of Justice release the files, or will it all remain tied up in investigations?\" she asked.   In July, the FBI said in a memo regarding the Epstein investigation that, \"we did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\" But Bondi last week complied with Trump's demands and ordered a federal prosecutor to investigate Epstein's ties to the president's political foes, including Clinton.   Still, Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who sponsored the bill, said \"there's no way they can have enough investigations to cover\" all of the people he believes are implicated in Epstein's abuse.   \"And if they do, then good,\" he added.   \n   The bill also requires the Justice Department to produce reports on what materials it withheld, as well as redactions made, within 15 days of the release of the files. It stipulates that officials can't withhold or redact anything \"on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.\"   Who could be named?   There's a widely held expectation that many people could be named in case files for investigations that spanned over a decade — and some concern that just because someone is named, that person would be assumed guilty or complicit.   Epstein was a luminary who kept company with heads of state, influential political figures, academics and billionaires. The release of his emails and messages by a House Oversight Committee investigation last week has already shown his connections with — and private conversations about — Trump and many other high-powered figures.   Yet federal prosecutors follow carefully constructed guidelines about what information they produce publicly and at trial, both to protect victims and to uphold the fairness of the legal system. House Speaker Mike Johnson raised objections to the bill on those grounds this week, arguing that it could reveal unwanted information on victims as well as others who were in contact with investigators.   Still, Johnson did not actually try to make changes to the bill and voted for it on the House floor.   For the bill's proponents, a public reckoning over the investigation is precisely the point. Some of the survivors of trafficking from Epstein and Maxwell have sought ways to name people they accuse of being complicit or involved, but fear they will face lawsuits from the men they accuse.   Massie said that he wants the FBI to release the reports from its interviews with the victims.   Those reports typically contain unvetted information, but Massie said he is determined to name those who are accused. He and Greene have offered to read the names of those accused on the House floor, which would shield their speech from legal consequences. \"We need names,\" Massie said.\n",

Beeping and buzzing, they push pallets of bananas and beans, canned goods and condiments to loading bays where trucks load up and deliver the food to local food pantries.   \n   With the holidays approaching, it's high season at the Greater Boston Food Bank. But this year is even busier than usual. A spike in demand from the recent reduction in SNAP food benefits has yet to abate, even though most SNAP payments have resumed. And many expect the need for emergency food will continue to climb.    \"This is just the beginning,\" says warehouse lead Adrian James, driving out of the cooler with another full pallet. \"Who knows how bad it could get.

CEO Catherine D'Amato says she's focusing on fundraising, hoping to buy more food, and is trying to \"sustain as much as possible for as long as possible.\" But, she says, \"This is not a matter of one and done.\"   \n   The GBFB is just one of many food banks and pantries around the nation feeling the strain, with no expectation of a reprieve anytime soon. Even if they catch up from this month's funding crisis, the Trump administration's Big Beautiful Bill Act is set to shrink federal SNAP spending by billions of dollars over the next couple of years.   At the same time, federal cuts to other safety net programs like Medicaid, affordable housing and health insurance subsidies are expected to compound the pressure on food banks and pantries that provide produce, meat, dairy and dry goods to millions of low-income U.S. residents.   \"More people will lose benefits and they will increasingly need to turn to the charitable food sector, and that will turn need up again and again and again as those changes go into effect,\" says Linda Nageotte, president of Feeding America, a national network of food banks, pantries and meal programs.   The result will feel \"like a tsunami, which is going to just wipe out people,\" says Harvard School of Public Health professor Sara Bleich, who worked on food security and nutrition for the Obama and Biden administrations. \"It's going to have a generational impact, and it's just heartbreaking.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Greater Boston Food Bank is rebuilding inventory since the recent spike in demand due to the disruption in SNAP payments. They're bracing for demand to remain high for the foreseeable future.\n                \n                    Tovia Smith/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Tovia Smith/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Food banks and pantries already are leaning more on help from state and local governments and private donations. But it's unrealistic, they say, to expect charitable organizations to scale up enough to compensate for cuts in federal programs, which historically have provided nine times what charitable food organizations deliver.    \"I'm anxious and I'm not sleeping,\" says Eric Cooper, CEO of the San Antonio Food Bank in Texas. He's trying to remain hopeful that demand will decrease, but that may be \"naive\" of him, he says, as he's \"still sending out more [food] than what's coming in.\"   \n   Cooper says his inventory is less than half what it usually is the week before Thanksgiving, and rising costs are making it difficult to restock. He locked in his holiday turkey purchase a year ago, he says, but prices went up so much, the vendor would no longer honor the deal. He's also had to hire extra drivers to pick up food, and he's paying staff overtime.   Meanwhile, donations from his annual fall fundraising campaign, which usually carry him through the holidays, already are used up.   \"We're just not going to be able to fill that need,\" he says.   At the Facing Hunger Food Bank in Huntington, W.V., CEO Cynthia Kirkhart also isn't seeing a dip in demand. She too is paying overtime to her employees who worked 18 days straight without a day off.   The work is taking an emotional toll. One day this month, cars were still lined up waiting for food at one of her mobile pantries when there was little left to offer.   \"It came down to a bag of potatoes,\" Kirkhart recalls.   There were two families in one car. Her staff offered the bag, and told them, \"This is all we have.\" They asked the families to split it.   \"That's soul searing,\" Kirkhart says.   Trump administration officials say the cuts to SNAP are intended ensure the program is \"sustainable for future generations\"  by cracking down on \"proven cases of waste, fraud and abuse.\" In a statement to NPR, a spokesperson said, \"The President is doing something about it.\"    \n   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                As they grapple with higher demand, food banks around the nation are also faced with hire costs, including hiring extra truck drivers to transport food to pantries.\n                \n                    Tovia Smith/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Tovia Smith/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Back at the Greater Boston Food Bank, Richard Green, director of the Saint Matthew's pantry in Dorchester, heaves big bags of food into a box truck.   \"We can't keep up with it,\" he says between throws.   Green has been volunteering for the pantry for a decade, and calls feeding the hungry his \"mission.\" He doesn't buy into the doomsday predictions, nor does he blame the federal government. The government, he says, is just doing its job.   \"The government has to be vigilant and make sure that everybody that's on SNAP is eligible to be on SNAP,\" Green says. \"You'd be a fool if you didn't think that a lot of people would be taking advantage of it.\"   \n   Still, he doesn't expect demand will let up any time soon. He's working on setting up new systems to make it easier for his pantry to take donations online. \n",

Congress failed to extend enhanced tax credits that have helped millions of Americans on Affordable Care Act plans cover their plan costs since 2021.   Senate Republicans have promised a vote on the enhanced subsidies before the end of the year. But open enrollment for these plans is already underway and consumers are facing sky-high prices and little certainty about whether they'll get relief.   And making matters worse, insurers have raised prices on these plans because they predict that without the tax credits, healthier people may not sign up in 2026, leaving them a sicker, costlier pool of customers. Premiums on the marketplaces are rising by an average of 26% next year, according to health policy organization KFF. That's the largest rate increase since 2018.   \n   There's less than a month to go before the Dec. 15 deadline to sign up for a plan that begins Jan. 1. If Congress doesn't act before then, some people may have to choose between paying far more than they're comfortable with or forgoing insurance altogether.

She buys coverage on the ACA marketplace because her employer is too small to have health benefits. She says her current premiums are affordable for her at $275 a month but will go to $1,250 in 2026 without the tax credit.   Going without insurance is really not an option for her. In October, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. So she's rushing to get in as much treatment as she can before the year ends, but she'll still need coverage for follow-up appointments next year.   Since she works in the medical field, she says she knows the insurance industry is part of the problem here. But she says people like her need help now, and lawmakers need to understand that.   \"For them, a thousand bucks is probably nothing. It's probably what they blow on dinner.

That's $54,000 a year, plus potentially spending up to $15,000 for their out-of-pocket maximum.   Bixon says he knew he'd have to pay for health care out of pocket after retiring from his career as a small business owner. \"But,\" he says, \"in my wildest dreams, I never thought a number close to $70,000 a year would be the cost that I'd be facing.\"   \"It's a very daunting amount of money,\" he says.   What scares Bixon even more is that prices could keep going up: \"Twelve months from now, we could be having the same conversation and I could be looking at another 20% or 30% increase.\"   \"I wonder if I'm going to be able to live out my days and enjoy my retirement and not run out of money,\" he says.   Still, Bixon isn't willing to risk living without insurance before becoming eligible for Medicare at 65. He has spent his entire adult life saving and investing for retirement and says he \"can't risk getting wiped out by long-term hospitalization.\"   \"I just don't understand how the leadership in this country can find that acceptable for working-class Americans — people who started businesses, helped employ other people, paid taxes — now [are] looking at these kinds of health care costs,\" he says.

He was kicked off his mother's plan, and his employer won't give him enough hours to get on the employer plan. So he buys his own insurance on the ACA marketplace.   He has bipolar disorder and the insurance, which covers his doctors' visits and prescriptions, has been a game changer for his health.   \n   Having that covered, he says \"has been such a relief. It's just made me feel important and valid, like I deserve to exist or something like that.\"   But without the subsidy, his premium for next year will go from $15 per month to $550, which is nearly half his monthly income.   Without insurance to cover his medication, McKay says, \"I would be in an extremely bad situation of having difficulty maintaining my job, maintaining my house, maybe even having a life-threatening situation, if I were to have a mental health crisis.\"   He says he is considering moving to California or Washington state, where state programs offer more secure coverage.   \"Where along the lines did I not do the right thing?\"   Catriona Johnson, Chapel Hill, N.C.   Before the ACA, 44-year-old Catriona Johnson had to live without health insurance for several years because she had a pre-existing condition. She was born with a congenital abnormality that required multiple surgeries in her abdomen and still requires her to use a catheter every day.   She says that the preventative care she got access to through ACA has increased her quality of health enough for her to earn her Master of Social Work degree.   Currently, she pays $442 a month for her premium with the tax credit, but that is set to go up to $666 next year. Her deductible will jump by $1,000.   Insurance is critical for her as she requires ongoing medical care.   \"I have no idea what I am going to do if I cannot afford care. Just go day by day, keep trying,\" she says.   Johnson says she's always tried to do things right. Despite her serious health problems, she went to college and grad school and has a job. Still, she lives paycheck to paycheck as a contract social worker in private practice, with most of her credit card bills being medical-related — medical supplies, medications, doctors' appointments.    \n   She wonders, \"Where along the lines did I not do the right thing?\"   She worries that the rise in costs for her health insurance will affect her credit, which already happened in her 20s because of medical debt. \"Everything I can't pay — on to the credit card, to worry about another day.\"   To cover an extra $1,300 a month, he'll stop contributing to retirement   Chris O'Donnell, Richmond, Va.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Chris O'Donnell\n                \n                    Chris O'Donnell\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chris O'Donnell\n    \n\n   \n   After he got laid off from his job this summer, Chris O'Donnell, 58, started a freelance business. He gets his health insurance through Virginia's ACA marketplace.    He and his wife currently pay $837 a month for their plan. Without subsidies, the 2026 cost will be $2155 — that's $1,300 more per month.   O'Donnell says he plans to redirect the money he would have saved for retirement to cover the added premium costs. \"This is not the time to be zeroing out my retirement contributions, but what choice do I have?\"   His wife has diabetes and is a cancer survivor, so \"not having insurance is just completely out of the question,\" he says. \"Even if I wanted to go without health insurance, just the supplies for her insulin pump would cost $25,000 a year anyway, so I wouldn't actually be saving anything.\"   He and his wife are seriously considering retirement in a country where health care costs are more stable.   \"If this is the new normal and then you figure, health insurance is going to go up 20% every year, then I don't know that long-term staying in this country is going to be sustainable for us,\" he says.   With the cost more than doubling, she might forgo health insurance   Celeste Jameson, North Port, Fla.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Celeste Jameson\n                \n                    Celeste Jameson\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Celeste Jameson\n    \n\n   \n   For paralegal Celeste Jameson, 41, her monthly insurance premiums will more than double next year, from $266 to $593.   \"I can't afford $593 a month. I just can't, on top of all of my other living expenses,\" Jameson told WUSF.   \n   As a young adult, she suffered from severe abdominal and pelvic pain that went undiagnosed until just over 10 years ago, when she was finally able to get reliable health insurance through the ACA marketplace.   \"I was in and out of hospitals with severe pain, ovarian contusions and everything, with no insurance,\" she said.   The bills piled up. She got into medical debt.   In 2014, after being rushed to the emergency room in \"probably the worst pain I'd ever had,\" a doctor diagnosed her with endometriosis, a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows in other parts of the body.   Once she felt better, she was able to take on regular work as a paralegal. She credits her health insurance with finally helping her get the diagnosis that led to her improved health.   She has not yet renewed her insurance for next year.   \"It scares me to know or to even imagine that I could be back where I was before 2014,\" she said.   \"I'd rather eat nothing but PB&Js than give up my health insurance.\"   Kelly Badeau, Tucson, Ariz.   Kelly Badeau is facing monthly insurance costs of nearly nine times what she is paying now. She currently pays $94 per month for a silver ACA plan after the tax credits, and her 2026 plan will cost an estimated $900.   Before becoming self-employed 10years ago, she had \"bare bones\" insurance with a high deductible through an employer. Her current ACA silver plan \"is the best insurance I've ever had,\" she says.   It has allowed her to take a proactive approach to her health, including annual primary care visits, screenings like mammograms and a colonoscopy, and seeing an audiologist. \"With the ACA, I'm healthier both mentally and physically,\" she says.   She says she doesn't want to drop her current plan. \"I'd rather eat nothing but PB&Js than give up my health insurance,\" she says.   \n   She sold her home last year and says she'll have to use some of that money to pay for health care.   \"I will dip into my savings to make my payments next year,\" she says. \"I don't want this administration to think they can tank the ACA by making us suffer.\"   But Badeau worries that she might have to start cutting corners in her health if she has too many medical expenses and can't afford the co-pays. Her husband may need treatment for prostate cancer soon, and she's on hormone therapy for menopause and blood pressure drugs.   \"I'm just trying to keep my head above water until I can get Medicare, but that's still many years from now,\" she says.   She worries she'll become disabled without health care   Genna Boatright, Siren, Wis.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Genna Boatright\n                \n                    Genna Boatright\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Genna Boatright\n    \n\n   \n   Genna Boatright, 40, has an aggressive case of rheumatoid arthritis and relies on medication to control it.   She is currently only paying $12 a month for her insurance premium because the enhanced subsidy covers most of her cost. But she says without the tax credit, her new premium costs will be $700, based on the numbers she's seeing in the marketplace.   \"And that I absolutely cannot afford,\" she says.   She says her income changed this year, and when she went onto the marketplace to shop for plans, she was pushed to apply for Medicaid. But she was denied Medicaid coverage. So she's continuing to see what is possible and waiting to see if anything changes with the prices.   \"The flood of overwhelm has been real,\" she says. She worries about how she will get coverage she can afford and is \"trying to make it through the days.\"   \"I do worry that without insurance and specialty care and the medication that I'm on, how quickly I will become disabled,\" she says. \"And that's an absolutely terrifying prospect.\"   \n   As a self-employed therapist, her ACA plan is her only option for insurance   Kristine Weidner, Branford, Conn.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Kristine Weidner\n                \n                    Kristine Weidner\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kristine Weidner\n    \n\n   \n   Self-employed as a psychotherapist, Kristine Weidner, 62, says the cost of the plan she buys on the ACA marketplace will nearly triple in 2026. Her current high-deductible plan costs $589 a month, not including dental, and a comparable plan for 2026 will cost $1691 a month.   She's really worried about the cost and about meeting the deductible. \"If I include dental, it will cost more than my housing,\" she says.   And she has \"no other option\" for health care. Going without insurance, she says, isn't a wise choice at her age.   She's also worried the rising costs may impact volume in her business as some clients may forgo insurance and not be able to afford her services.    \"I may need to consider closing my business and returning to the public sector and employer-based insurance.\"   NPR's Margaux Bauerlein and Selena Simmons-Duffin and WUSF's Kerry Sheridan contributed reporting.\n",

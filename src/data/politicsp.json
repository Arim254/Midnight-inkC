If the high court overturns the act's Section 2 — a provision that bans racial discrimination in voting — GOP-controlled states could redraw at least 19 more voting districts for the House of Representatives in favor of Republicans, according to a recent report by the voting rights advocacy groups Black Voters Matter Fund and Fair Fight Action.   And depending on when the court rules in the case, known as Louisiana v. Callais, some number of the seats could be redistricted prior to next year's midterm election.   \n   The analysis comes as President Trump continues to lead a GOP push for new maps in Texas, Missouri, North Carolina and other states that could help Republicans preserve their slim House majority after the 2026 election.   The GOP effort could be bolstered by a Supreme Court ruling that eliminates longstanding Section 2 protections against the dilution of the collective power of racial minority voters.   Many of the landmark law's supporters fear such an outcome after the conservative-majority court didn't rule last term on the Louisiana case, and instead scheduled a rare second round of oral arguments, which is expected to focus on the constitutionality of Section 2's redistricting requirements.   \n   A ruling gutting Section 2 could have a cascading effect on congressional maps in mostly Southern states where Republicans either control both legislative chambers and the governor's office or have a veto-proof majority in the legislature — and where voting is racially polarized, with Black voters tending to vote Democratic and white voters tending to vote Republican.   If mapmakers in those states are no longer required under Section 2 to draw districts where racial minority voters have a realistic opportunity of electing their preferred candidate, Louisiana, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, North Carolina and Texas could end up with fewer Democratic representatives in Congress. Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee could lose all of theirs, the report finds.   \n   As much as 30% of the Congressional Black Caucus and 11% of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus could also be lost.   It all leads to a possibility of Republicans cementing one-party control of the House for at least a generation, says Cliff Albright, co-founder and executive director of Black Voters Matter Fund.   \"Part of the point that we're trying to make with this report is that what happens in the South doesn't just stay in the South,\" Albright adds. \"This racial gerrymandering has the ability to not just disempower, disenfranchise Black voters and to eliminate Black elected officials and Latino elected officials. What happens in these states impacts the entire country.\"   How the Supreme Court overturning Section 2 could lead to a redistricting \"free-for-all\"   In the Louisiana case, a lower court ordered the state's Republican-controlled legislature to draw a new congressional map after a group of Black voters sued under Section 2.   Section 2 \"ensures all communities of color can still participate equally in the voting process and elect candidates who reflect their interests,\" says Alanah Odoms, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, whose attorneys are helping to represent those Black voters. \"And if communities of color are not able to do that, we stand to lose what I think most of us believe is so fundamental to our democracy, which is equal participation, equal opportunity.\"   \n   The court-ordered map, which was in effect for the 2024 election, led to Democrats picking up a second seat in Louisiana.   A group of self-described \"non-African American\" voters, led by Phillip Callais, has argued, however, that the race-based redistricting the court ordered to get in line with Section 2 is unconstitutional. Just as the Supreme Court ruled against race-based affirmative action at colleges and universities in 2023, they argue, the court should put an end to race-based political mapmaking under Section 2.   In seeking a rehearing in the Louisiana case, the Supreme Court asked all sides in the case to consider whether the state's \"intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.\"   \n   In one of their latest briefs to the high court, Republican state officials in Louisiana now argue against using race \"in any form\" when redistricting.   And in a major shift from past administrations, the Justice Department under Trump agrees that Section 2's protections against racial discrimination are no longer constitutional.   Two years ago, the Supreme Court rejected a similar argument by Alabama Republicans.   \"The court could reaffirm the Voting Rights Act as it did in 2023 in Allen v. Milligan,\" says Atiba Ellis, a professor and an associate dean at Case Western Reserve University's law school. \"But many observers — and I am one of them — have been concerned about the court becoming more and more cynical about race-conscious remedies to address longstanding civil rights wrongs. And this decision has the potential to be the tipping point where the court declares unconstitutional or heavily restricts the ability for Congress to create remedies that promote multiracial democracy.\"   That kind of decision coming amid the ongoing mid-decade congressional redistricting war between Republicans and Democrats, Ellis adds, could set the stage for a true \"free-for-all\" — pointing also to the court's 2019 ruling that partisan gerrymandering is not reviewable by federal courts.   \n   \"It is one thing for politicians on both sides of the aisle to use the power that they have to engage in unprecedented power grabs. But the most important check on those grabs has been the prevention of racial discrimination,\" Ellis says about Section 2. \"Absent the federal law that would prevent that discrimination, I think the consequences could be tremendous and could be felt for decades.\"   The window of time to pass new congressional maps before the midterms is closing as state deadlines draw nearer. Louisiana's top election official, Secretary of State Nancy Landry, has asked the Supreme Court to rule in this case by early January 2026 to avoid disrupting the state's current schedule.   \n   But the timing remains unclear for the Supreme Court, which usually releases decisions for major cases toward the end of its term in June.   The court has confirmed that it plans to discuss early next month if it will take up a North Dakota case about whether private individuals and groups — whose lawsuits have been the main way of enforcing Section 2 — can continue to sue. Republican state officials in Mississippi have also raised that issue in another redistricting case on direct appeal to the high court.   Edited by Benjamin Swasey\n",

Over this past weekend, hundreds more employees were fired.\n                \n                    Dustin Chambers/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Dustin Chambers/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Around 600 workers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were cut over the long weekend, as part of a wider push by the Trump Administration to slash the size of the federal workforce during the government shutdown.   It was not a smooth process. On Friday, more than 1,300 CDC employees were notified that they had lost their jobs. Many of them were furloughed because of the shutdown, and found out only after Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, posted on X that \"the RIFs have begun.\"   The next day, around 700 employees got emails revoking these reduction in force notices, according to numbers compiled by the National Public Health Coalition, a group of former CDC employees.   \n   Aryn Melton Backus, a health communication specialist with the CDC's Office on Smoking and Health who has been on administrative leave for months, was one of them. It was the third time this year she's received a termination notice.   \"We have no idea why certain programs were eliminated and others were saved,\" Backus said in a press conference held Tuesday by NPHC. \"At this point, it seems like the chaos and lack of transparency is the point.\"   In a Tuesday court filing, the Department of Health and Human Services attributed some of the firings and rapid rescindments to \"data discrepancies and processing errors.\"   When the dust settled, around 600 CDC staffers were cut over the weekend, according to the former CDC employee group and AFGE Local 2883, a union that represents CDC workers.   \n   Those fired include CDC staff who brief Congress, those working on health statistics and chronic disease. It also affected CDC support staff, such as those at the CDC library, those who provided mental health support after an attack at the CDC's main campus in August, and human resources staff who were called back from furlough to lay off colleagues and members of their own team.   HHS declined to confirm numbers or groups affected by this round of layoffs, but Andrew Nixon, director of communications, said staffers that were terminated were \"designated non-essential.\"    \n   The court filing states that, on October 10, a total of 982 employees were purposefully cut from HHS, which includes agencies such as the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, in addition to CDC.   The national federal workers union is contesting the legality of these and other layoffs.   \"These illegal firings of our union members during a federal government shutdown is a callous attack on hardworking Americans and puts the livelihoods, health and safety of our members and communities at great risk,\" said Yolanda Jacobs, a health communications specialist at CDC and president of AFGE Local 2883, speaking at a union press conference on Tuesday.   The recent round of cuts add to the stream of workers leaving the CDC this year due to earlier rounds of firings, early retirements and resignations. The CDC has lost around 3,000 employees, or a quarter of its staff, since January according to the union.   The entire staff of the CDC's Washington office was eliminated in the recent cuts, upending a longstanding support system for Congressional representatives.   \"CDC has worked directly with Congress for decades to help constituents by providing data, expertise and insight when needed,\" said Dr. John Brooks, who retired last year as chief medical officer for the CDC's Division of HIV Prevention, at the NPHC press conference. \"These firings mean Congress no longer has a means of direct access to the agency it funds when it needs information or briefings.\"   Outside of the Washington office, CDC policy experts that help develop briefings and answer questions from Congress have also been eliminated, according to NPHC.   Overall, the cuts to CDC staff and budget under the Trump Administration undermine the nation's public health infrastructure, Brooks says. \"Many experts, including myself, are concerned that we are no longer well prepared for the next big outbreak or disaster because of the Trump administration's continued erosion of our nation's ability to respond to public health emergencies.\"   \n   State and local health departments are feeling the effects. When faced with problems such as outbreaks of food poisoning or hospital infections, they've traditionally reached out to the CDC for help.   \"Sometimes that help might be — we're going to send some people to help you investigate this. Sometimes that might be talking to somebody who's the world's expert on a specific type of infection or exposure,\" said Dr. Karen Remley, a former CDC official and former health commissioner for Virginia, at the NPHC press conference. \"Now, there's nobody to answer the phone.\"   In an email, Nixon of HHS described the federal health infrastructure as a \"bloated bureaucracy,\" and said: \"HHS continues to close wasteful and duplicative entities to streamline the agency for the American people.\"\n",

That is, economic growth was pretty flat for millennia, and then, around 1800, it points upward toward the sky.   It's no secret that this inflection point — where the stick's handle and blade meet — was the Industrial Revolution. That was a crucial turning point in the history of humankind, when we left economic stagnation behind and began seeing monumental improvements in the economy and our standard of living.   But why around 1800? Why did economic growth continue propelling upward after that point? And why was Britain the first society to experience this revolutionary change?   \n   The economic historian Joel Mokyr, a professor at Northwestern University and Tel Aviv University, was co-awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize in economics this week for his decades of research trying to answer these questions. (The economists Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt share the other half of the 2025 prize \"for the theory of sustained growth through creative destruction.\")   For Mokyr, a crucial reason why Britain became the epicenter of the Industrial Revolution in 1800 has to do with science and technology. True, many societies before Britain had seen scientific breakthroughs and technological progress. And sometimes, Mokyr finds, that led to some economic growth. However, no society saw its economy catapulted into a kind of sustained escape velocity away from stagnation before.   Mokyr centers his explanation on why Britain was different by highlighting how it embraced science, technology and disruptive change. He puts a lot of emphasis on the role of the Enlightenment, or the intellectual awakening in science, philosophy, politics and other realms that swept Europe during and around the 18th century. It was a movement that revolutionized intellectual and political life and helped speed up technological progress.   But that still doesn't explain why it was specifically Britain that became the epicenter of the Industrial Revolution. Other European nations, including especially France, also experienced the Enlightenment.   \n   Mokyr's research suggests that Britain was different because, essentially, the Brits operationalized the Enlightenment in the real economy more than other nations. It wasn't just that scientists, philosophers and other thinkers had big intellectual breakthroughs. In Britain, these scientific discoveries and a new way of thinking filtered down to a skilled class of mechanics and entrepreneurs and other \"tweakers and tinkerers\" who put new ideas to practical use in the economy. In this way, \"macro inventions\" — or big, paradigm-shifting scientific discoveries — fed a slew of practical \"micro inventions\" that practitioners used to incrementally reshape the economic machinery of society, boosting productivity and rocketing economic growth to the moon.   So, yeah, science and technology are super important for economic growth. But the crucial ingredient, according to Mokyr, was that there was also a skilled population of workers and entrepreneurs who were willing and able to put those advances into real use in the economy. Mokyr also emphasizes that British political institutions — in particular, its Parliament — were more open to the disruptive changes (or \"creative destruction\") these new technologies unleashed, which often challenged the power and prosperity of entrenched interest groups.   And here is where the other Nobel winners this year, Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt, help color in more of the picture. They place creative destruction at the center of their popular mathematical model of economic growth.   Creative destruction is an idea that's associated with the late Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter. It refers to the healthy process of new technologies, products and businesses replacing outdated ones in a market economy. This process of change involves older businesses shrinking or even dying and, often, workers losing their jobs. So, yeah, there are losers in the process, and, throughout history, elites and interest groups have sought to block creative destruction. But economists, including Aghion and Howitt, theorize it's a crucial process for economic growth.   \n   It's a lot to chew on as the globe grapples with the rise of a new wave of disruptive technologies, including artificial intelligence. But the Nobel winners' work suggests that embracing this technological disruption — and finding ways to operationalize these big breakthroughs in the real economy — will be crucial for the hockey stick's blade to keep pushing upward.   Anyways, we're happy to say that Joel Mokyr has been a guest on Planet Money before. Check out our episodes: When Luddites attack and Imagining a world without oil. Mokyr also provided inspiration for a fictional audio drama we made once, long ago called \"The Last Job.\"   And, if this history-of-ideas type story is the kind of reading you're into, may I encourage you to click here to preorder the Planet Money book. There's a whole chapter on what causes economic progress and the role of technology, among other things. It gets into more depth than we have space for here. It has some fun visuals, too.

U.S. District Judge Susan Illston will hear preliminary arguments on Wednesday in a case brought by the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), which together represent more than 800,000 federal workers.   In a brief filed with the court Tuesday, the unions accuse the Trump administration of \"using federal employees as pawns to impose political pressure on the Administration's perceived opponents in Congress.\"   \n   They ask the court for a temporary restraining order to pause the implementation of layoffs already underway and stop any additional layoff notices from being sent out.   \n   \"It's an illegal abuse of power designed to punish patriotic civil servants and put pressure on Congress,\" AFGE president Everett Kelley said in an interview with NPR's Morning Edition on Oct. 1.   The Trump administration has argued the court lacks jurisdiction to hear the case. From their standpoint, the steps the president has taken are fully within his authority as head of the executive branch, and any pause would be inappropriate.   \"The President, through [the White House Office of Management and Budget], has determined that agencies should operate more efficiently and has directed them to consider steps to optimize their workforces in light of the ongoing lapse in appropriations,\" attorneys for the administration wrote in their brief to the court. \"A TRO would prevent agencies from taking steps to implement this policy priority.\"   The hearing comes as the Trump administration has commenced a new round of layoffs, known as reductions-in-force, or RIFs. On Friday, at least seven different agencies sent RIF notices to more than 4,000 federal employees, according to a status update from Stephen Billy, a senior advisor to the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Noting that the situation is \"fluid and rapidly evolving,\" Billy cautioned that the numbers could change.   \n   On Tuesday, the Trump administration provided a new status update with a slightly lower count, but again emphasized that \"agencies are continually finalizing their RIF plans.\"   \n   Trump says layoffs affect \"Democrat-sponsored programs\"   The lawsuit was originally filed in response to a memo issued by OMB a week before the shutdown. It urged agencies to use the lapse in funding as an opportunity to consider laying off employees who work on programs and activities not consistent with President Trump's priorities.   In the days since, Trump has blamed Democrats for the shutdown and claimed that his administration had no choice but to permanently cut some federal jobs due to the lapse in Congressional appropriations, a radical departure from past shutdowns in which the government has only temporarily furloughed employees.   Trump has simultaneously called the shutdown an \"unprecedented opportunity\" given to him by Democrats to reshape the government.   \"We're ending some programs that we don't want. They happen to be Democrat-sponsored programs, but we're ending some programs that we never wanted and we're probably not going to allow them to come back,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday. \"I think they made a mistake. I think they made a big mistake.\"   \n   The latest RIFs target the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services at the Department of Education; the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at the Department of Housing and Urban Development; the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy at the Department of Energy; as well as parts of the Internal Revenue Service, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), among other agencies.   More than half of the 1,300 CDC employees who received layoff notices on Friday subsequently had those notices reversed over the weekend, according to AFGE. In a declaration filed with the court on Tuesday, Thomas Nagy, an official at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which includes the CDC, confirmed that due to \"data discrepancies and processing errors,\" RIF notices were erroneously issued to nearly 800 HHS employees.   \n   Unions: Trump cannot use shutdown to cut programs   The federal employee unions argue in their complaint that OMB and its director Russell Vought take the \"legally unsupportable position\" that the lapse in appropriations eliminates federal agencies' legal requirements to carry out programs Congress had previously funded.   The unions allege the memo issued by OMB before the shutdown unlawfully directs agencies to disregard their own authorizing statutes.   The unions also take issue with guidance the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) subsequently put out, which informs agencies that employees needed to implement RIFs could be directed to work during the shutdown. The unions say this is a violation of the Antideficiency Act, the law that bars federal agencies from spending money during a shutdown, with only narrow exceptions including work that involves \"the safety of human life or the protection of property.\"   \"Administration of a RIF is in no way necessary to protect life or property from imminent harm,\" the complaint states.   The unions have asked the court to declare that both OMB and OPM have exceeded their statutory authorities and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner, and to invalidate any actions that may come from the memos and guidance issued.   Trump administration says the court lacks jurisdiction   The lawsuit originally named OMB and OPM, along with their directors, as defendants. It was later amended to include more than 30 federal agencies.   In its response to the complaint filed Friday, the Trump administration urged the court to reject the unions' demands for a temporary restraining order, arguing that the court lacks jurisdiction to hear a case involving federal employment issues. The government points out that Congress created a federal agency, the Merit Systems Protection Board, to handle such matters, although its independence has been compromised under the current administration. It is also almost entirely shut down at the moment.   \n   Attorneys for the government further argued that any decisions to RIF employees were being made by the agencies in accordance with proper procedures, noting that 26 agencies named as defendants in the lawsuit had yet to announce RIFs.   For Judge Illston, another chance to weigh in on federal layoffs   This is the second case involving the Trump administration's mass layoffs that Illston is presiding over this year. In May, the Clinton-appointed judge indefinitely paused Trump's sweeping overhaul of the government, finding that the president had failed to obtain authorization from \"his co-equal branch and partner, the Congress,\" as required by law.   \n   \"Agencies may not conduct large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force in blatant disregard of Congress's mandates, and a President may not initiate large-scale executive branch reorganization without partnering with Congress,\" Illston wrote in her decision.   The Trump administration appealed the ruling, eventually asking the Supreme Court to weigh in. In a decision issued on its shadow docket, the Supreme Court lifted Illston's order, allowing the Trump administration to resume layoffs while the lower courts consider whether the RIFs being carried out by agencies are lawful.   Subsequently some agencies, including those within HHS, finalized RIFs that had already been announced. But many others said they would not be making further staffing cuts given the large number of federal employees who resigned or retired this year. In fact, some agencies have since hired people back.   \n   Although the Trump administration has characterized the latest round of RIFs as a consequence of the shutdown, many federal employees have told NPR they believe the layoffs are merely a continuation of the president's efforts to slash the federal government – an effort that has been well underway since January.\n",

Now that provision is in danger of being struck down, too.   Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act aims to ensure that minority voters are not shut out of the process of drawing new congressional districts. When the law was passed in 1965 there were just six African-American, four Hispanic and two Asian or Pacific Islander members of the House of Representatives. None of the identified representatives were from the Deep South.   \n   This Congress started out with 63 African-American, 51 Hispanic, and 21 Asian or Pacific-Islander representatives or delegates in the House. Much of that change has been driven by the rules of the road under the Voting Rights Act.   All of that could change, however, if the court removes the guardrails to redistricting that it endorsed just two years ago. Indeed, if the Supreme Court either nullifies Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act or makes it much more difficult to enforce, recent studies indicate that Democrats could lose as many as 19 congressional seats in the process, putting control of the House effectively out of reach for the foreseeable future.   \n   Specifically, at issue in Wednesday's case is a 5-to-4 Supreme Court ruling from just 28 months ago, which  upheld the Voting Rights Act's framework for drawing new congressional district lines every 10 years.   That case was from Alabama, where the state had refused to create a second majority African-American district until ordered to do so by the Court.   Wednesday's case is from Louisiana and has a nearly identical fact pattern. African-Americans comprise roughly 30% of Louisiana's voting population, but, of the state's six congressional districts, there is only one where they can, and do, routinely prevail in electing a candidate of their choosing.   \n   For years, the state legislature fought creating a second district where minority voters could win. But after the Supreme Court's decision in the Alabama case, the Louisiana legislature saw the legal handwriting on the wall and drew a new map that created a second district in which African-American voters would have a realistic chance of electing the candidate of their choice.   Normally, that would have been the end of the case.   \n   District like \"a snake\"   But a group of 12 self-described \"non-African-American voters\" intervened to challenge the redistricting as racially discriminatory. And at the arguments last March, some of the conservative justices seemed to be having an attack of buyer's remorse.   Chief Justice John Roberts just over two years ago wrote the court's majority decision upholding the redistricting provision of the Voting Rights Act. But when the Louisiana redistricting case was argued last March, he sounded more than a little doubtful.   \n   \"You think the drawing of this district was not predominantly based on race?\" asked the incredulous Roberts.  \"It's a snake that runs from one end of the state to the other!\"   Louisiana's Solicitor General Benjamin Aguiñaga replied that the Supreme Court has long said that partisan gerrymandering is permissible, but racial gerrymandering is not. And here, he said, the motivation was explicitly partisan. The lines, he said, were drawn to create a second minority district and to protect three key Republican incumbents in the House, including Speaker of the House Mike Johnson.   Pressed further, a frustrated Aguiñaga replied: \" It's an election year. We're talking about the speaker of the House. No rational state gambles with those high stakes in that situation.\"   \n   Request for reargument   Amazingly, however, the justices did not decide the case then. Instead, on the last day of the term, they ordered reargument in the case. Only this time they added this question: Does the state's intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district violate the Constitution's 14th and 15th amendments' guarantee of the right to vote, and the authority of Congress to enforce that mandate?   To answer that question, Louisiana has now flipped positions and instead of defending the map its legislatures drew, it is arguing that the redistricting provision of the Voting Rights Act are unconstitutionally discriminatory.   \n   \"The jurisprudence keeps whipsawing us back and forth,\" said Louisiana Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill. She maintains that the Court's Alabama decision \"essentially boils down to, well, if you're engaging in remedial map drawing, you have to think about race, but you can't think about it too much. That is an impossible guideline.\"   But Janai Nelson of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund will try to convince the justices that now is not the time to bail on the last truly effective provision of the Voting Rights Act.   If Section 2 is overturned, Nelson argued, \"it would be utterly devastating. It would allow for racial gerrymandering to happen with very few checks. But to be honest, as horrific, and utterly undemocratic as that result would be,  more concerning is what it would mean in terms of this court's fidelity to what it once called the crown jewel of the civil rights movement.\"   \n   Just why the court ordered reargument in the case is unclear. There are a number of theories.   First, and most obvious, is that the fifth and decisive vote to uphold the provision two years ago was cast by Justice Brett Kavanaugh. In a concurring opinion, he said at the time that there should be some time limit to the redistricting provision. And it may be that he thinks that time has come.   A second possibility is that the court's decision upholding the voting rights law just two years ago was not as firm as it appeared. Indeed, court observers were surprised by the outcome, as Roberts has in the past consistently opposed the Voting Rights Act. And some have theorized that Roberts and Kavanaugh, the two conservatives in the majority, didn't want to rule against the voting law just weeks before the court struck down affirmative action in college admissions as unconstitutional.   \n   A third possibility is that the court was simply unable to reach a majority agreement late in the term, as it was being bombarded by dozens of cases filed by the Trump administration on the emergency docket.   Observers are watching to see what the Court does this time.\n",

Kirk, who died at the age of 31, was a prominent ally of the president and was seen as a leading force in mobilizing young Americans to vote for him. His death has become a rallying cry for many Republican leaders and activists, who have pledged to continue his work.   Trump, who was personally close to Kirk – as were his son Don Jr. and Vice President Vance – praised Kirk's political impact during a ceremony held in the Rose Garden at the White House on Tuesday afternoon.   \n   \"We're here to honor and remember a fearless warrior for liberty, beloved leader who galvanized the next generation like nobody I've ever seen before,\" Trump said, adding that the ceremony fell on what would have been Kirk's 32nd birthday.   \"Charlie is attaining a far more important milestone,\" he added. \"We're entering his name forever into the eternal roster of true American heroes.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump speaks with Erika Kirk, Charlie Kirk's widow, during the Medal of Freedom Ceremony on Tuesday in the White House Rose Garden.\n                \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The Presidential Medal of Freedom is considered the highest civilian honor given by the U.S. government. Previous recipients include members of Congress, activists, as well as scientific leaders and cultural icons.   Kirk's death has ignited a broader discussion around the causes of political violence, with many GOP leaders placing blame on \"far left\" groups for fueling such violence. Without naming specific groups, Trump echoed those claims in his remarks Tuesday.   \"We've watched legions of far-left radicals resort to desperate acts of violence and terror because they know that their ideas and arguments are persuading no one,\" Trump said. \"They know that they're failing. They have the devil's ideology and they're failing.\"   But as the threat of political violence grows, data show an increase in violence committed by people who have been influenced by a mix of different extremist ideologies.   \n   At the time of his death, Kirk had developed a following of millions online, espousing socially conservative Christian beliefs. Critics of Kirk decried much of his rhetoric as offensive, including his opposition to transgender rights and past comments that the 1964 Civil Rights Act was a \"mistake.\"   Kirk's supporters denounced those who raised criticism after his death, resulting in some losing their jobs, and comedian Jimmy Kimmel was temporarily pulled from the air for his comments.   Within the Turning Point movement, the late activist was both regarded as an influential political figure and a seasoned youth organizer.   \n   He founded Turning Point USA in 2012 at the age of 18 to engage college and high school students in conservative ideas. More than a decade later, the organization has grown into a national player in Republican politics, with hundreds of chapters around the country and a reported revenue of nearly $85 million – along with a slew of sister organizations, including its advocacy group Turning Point Action, which worked with the Trump campaign on voter turnout efforts last year.   \n   The award ceremony comes just weeks after tens of thousands of supporters gathered in Glendale, Ariz., for Kirk's public memorial, where he was repeatedly labeled a political \"martyr.\"   It's a characterization that Trump repeated on Tuesday, as did Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, who held back tears as she accepted the award on her husband's behalf.   \"God began a mighty work through my husband and I intend to see it through,\" said Erika Kirk, who has since been named the new CEO of Turning Point. \"The torch is in our hands now.\"   The 36-year-old faith-based entrepreneur has played a key role in shaping the next phase of her husband's organization, pledging to continue many of his efforts, including the campus tour he had just begun when he was assassinated.   \n   Since Kirk's death, Turning Point has also reported receiving tens of thousands of inquiries to start new chapters at schools around the country.   Near the start of her remarks, Erika Kirk made a point to highlight the organization's student network, calling it \"the heartbeat of this future and of this movement.\"   \"Everything that Charlie built, you guys are the legacy holders of that,\" she added. \"You are living proof that his mission did not die with him. It lives through you.\"\n",

Janet Mills delivers her State of the State address, Jan. 30, 2024, at the State House in Augusta, Maine. Mills has announced a run to unseat Susan Collins in the U.S. Senate.\n                \n                    Robert F. Bukaty/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Robert F. Bukaty/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Maine Gov. Janet Mills announced Tuesday that she'll enter the race to defeat Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, a top target in national Democrats' bid to regain the Senate.   Mills was recruited by Democratic Senate leaders after her high-profile confrontation with President Trump in February over transgender athletes, a dispute that triggered a wave of retaliatory moves by his administration against the state. The exchange is featured in her launch ad.   \"My life's work has prepared me for this fight and I'm ready to win,\" Mills says in the video. \"This election will be a simple choice: Is Maine going to bow down or stand up? I know my answer.\"   \n   In an interview, Mills said the interaction was a \"jaw-dropping\" moment that showcased Trump's monarch-like aspirations. She said it also pushed her to consider running for a Senate seat that she previously hadn't wanted.   \"When I was a little girl growing up in Farmington, my father always said you have to stand up to bullies. You can't let them have their way or they'll never stop,\" she said. \"And I think that's what's going on in Congress right now ... Congress is not standing up to him. Susan Collins is not standing up to him.\"   She added, \"I don't think I could forgive myself if I didn't give everything I've got to change what's going on in a very dysfunctional government in Washington.\"   To defeat Collins, Mills will first have to navigate a potentially bruising primary. The contest already features more than half a dozen candidates, including two, Jordan Wood and Graham Platner, who are taking a more progressive tack. Platner is also channeling Democratic voters' disillusionment with party leaders and has framed Mills' candidacy as an example of their unwillingness to part ways with the \"same old, tired playbook.\"   Platner's candidacy, endorsed by independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, is part of a national trend in which insurgent candidates are taking on Democratic incumbents or those favored by national party leaders. A few days before Mills' announcement, Sanders said in a social media post that \"it's disappointing that some Democratic leaders are urging Governor Mills to run. We need to focus on winning that seat & not waste millions on an unnecessary & divisive primary.\"   \n   Mills, who will be 78 in December, said she looked forward to the primary and is eager to contrast her accomplishments as governor against the other candidates. She highlighted her efforts to steer more of the state budget for local education, expanding Medicaid health coverage for low-income Mainers and providing free meals in public schools. She also noted her long history of standing up for abortion rights, expanding access to the procedure after the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision and making Maine a haven for women who live in states where it's restricted or outright banned.   \"I'm the only candidate in this race who has delivered on those things,\" she said.   Mills has proven a formidable statewide candidate in her two successful runs for governor. In 2022, she defeated conservative firebrand and former Gov. Paul LePage to win her second term, holding her own in Maine's conservative 2nd Congressional District.   A steep climb for Democrats   The U.S. Senate race will present a new and daunting challenge.   Democrats haven't won a U.S. Senate race in Maine since former Sen. George Mitchell won reelection in 1988. Collins has held her seat since 1996. Democrats' ballyhooed and famously expensive bid to unseat her in 2020 sputtered to an 8-point defeat in a state that President Joe Biden carried by 9 points.   Democrats believe Collins is more vulnerable now. The Maine Democratic Party has repeatedly sought to highlight what they see as her diminished influence as chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee amid the Trump administration's bid to consolidate power in the executive branch.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, departs the U.S. Capitol on Sept. 30. Democrats say Collins has lost influence as an appropriator and have attacked her votes to confirm Trump's controversial cabinet picks.\n                \n                    Kent Nishimura/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kent Nishimura/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Her potential ascension to the budget panel was repeatedly highlighted by her campaign in 2020 as a way to sway Maine's fickle — and often decisive — independent voting bloc.   Mills touched on that critique as well, saying Collins' climb to the budget committee was a \"big deal\" but that she hasn't used her position to push back against Trump's bid to wrest more spending authority from Congress.   \n   Democrats have also attacked her votes to confirm Trump's controversial Cabinet picks and to confirm judges they say are hostile to abortion rights.   Mills would be the oldest freshman elected to the upper chamber in modern history if she's able to topple Collins, who will be 73 in December. The governor acknowledged that age will be \"a consideration\" for some voters, but she thinks they'll side with her experience, especially in the Democratic primary.   \"I know I can take on this one last fight and get it done,\" she said.   A crowded primary field    The governor's entry in the race will likely discourage other Democratic hopefuls from running and it may force out already declared candidates.   Wood and Platner have vowed to stay in. Platner, asked recently about Mills' seemingly imminent candidacy, told Maine Public that his campaign won't change its approach much.   \"We're going to undertake the same project, no matter who gets in,\" he said, adding, \"This is a campaign to reshape the Democratic Party.\"   Platner, an oyster farmer and military veteran, has said that his campaign is about building a movement and a political infrastructure that will endure after next year's midterms. His campaign already claims 6,000 volunteers and his town hall appearances have drawn large crowds. It also claims to have raised more than $4 million in a little more than a month.   Wood, a former staffer for U.S. Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., claims his campaign has raised a similar amount over a longer period.   Mills, a former prosecutor, served two stints as Maine's attorney general. The second came between 2013 and 2018 while Republican LePage was governor. The two clashed frequently as LePage, often seen as a Trump prototype, pushed the bounds of executive branch power. Mills would later defeat him in her bid to secure a second term as governor.   \n   \"See you in court\"    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Mills reacts after challenging President Trump over federal law on the issue of transgender athletes in sports as Trump addressed a meeting of governors at the White House on Feb. 21, 2025.\n                \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Win McNamee/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Her fights with LePage set the stage for her February confrontation with Trump during a National Governors Association event at the White House. During the event, Trump called on Mills to obey his executive order banning transgender athletes from participating on girls' sports teams. Mills told him she would follow Maine law, which currently allows the practice. When he threatened to pull Maine's federal funding, Mills told him, \"See you in court.\"   The looming primary contest in Maine is part of a larger pattern of insurgent Democrats in congressional contests running on a brand of economic populism long championed by Sen. Bernie Sanders.   Platner has been particularly critical of national Democrats, including their recruitment of Mills.   \"Running candidates that are picked by D.C., running campaigns that are driven by D.C., I think that's a losing strategy,\" he said during a recent interview. \"I think, what we're doing — which is really trying to build a campaign of Mainers, for Mainers — that's the way we win the state of Maine.\"\n",

Fast-forward to today.   Some of Symington's cancer patients curse at her for suggesting they vaccinate or wear masks to protect their weakened immune systems while undergoing chemotherapy.   \"I actually had a patient's husband say, 'You only want me to mask because you're a liberal bitch.'\"   Symington is among many doctors who say political attacks on science and medicine are affecting their relationships with patients, particularly in rural communities, where physician recruitment already poses a chronic challenge. Increasingly, misinformation and conspiracy theories about health fill a vacuum created by the lack of doctors, adding challenges to care. Meanwhile, the Trump administration's dramatic changes to health, science, public health and immigration policies are making recruitment of overseas talent tougher.   \n   Conspiracy theories   In the sparsely populated mineral and coal mining towns that dot the area around Rock Springs, Symington says disinformation and political rage run rampant. At a recent county fair, for example, she stood for four hours offering free vials of sunscreen to passersby — but got no takers. One woman asked \"Do you want to know why?\" and then told Symington: \"Doctors have been putting cancer-causing chemicals in sunscreen so we'll all get cancer and they'll enrich themselves.\"    Symington says such conspiracy theories and political divisiveness over health and science have worn away at the basic civilities that once made the community feel cohesive. \"'You're a pharma whore,'\" she's told. \"They say it to my face.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The town of Rock Springs, Wyo., has a population of about 23,000, according to the 2020 census.\n                \n                    Charles Paajoe Tetteh for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Charles Paajoe Tetteh for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   A lung cancer patient of Symington's refused vaccination, then died of COVID, still angrily believing the disease to be manufactured political fiction. Symington says until recent years, she'd been on friendly terms with that man, who always offered restaurant recommendations and suggestions for spots to rock hunt, which he knew was her hobby. His transformation is emblematic of a broader shift, she says.   \"It's very difficult, helping someone who scorns your help, or diminishes the value of it,\" says Symington, who is 65 and on the cusp of retirement. \"A lot of us who went into medicine did it because we believed we were helping people.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Dr. Banu Symington has been called crude names by patients when she suggests they do things to protect their health.\n                \n                    Banu Symington\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Banu Symington\n    \n\n   \n   There's also a surge in use of ivermectin — an anti-parasite drug — adding to patients' peril. \"I have patients who are covertly taking ivermectin and then they end up in the intensive care unit because of a complication from the ivermectin,\" Symington explains. They're doing so on the advice of actor Mel Gibson, offered during his January appearance on Joe Rogan's popular conservative podcast.   Physician shortages   Symington is one of only five full-time oncologists in Wyoming. She also runs the only radiation clinic in the southwest corner of the state; the next closest one is about a three-hour drive away, in Utah.   \n   \"When I retire, which may be sooner than I planned because of the atmosphere, I don't think they'll be able to recruit anyone,\" she says.   The doctor shortage was already acute and is contributing to a shortening of the lifespans of rural Americans, says Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association.   \"There are so many workforce shortages that people can't get past the junk on the internet to get to a local doc that they can trust,\" Morgan says. \"The only solution really to combat that with is good science, good data, and make sure that local clinicians are at the forefront,\" disseminating accurate information.   But staffing rural health care has also gotten tougher. For many decades, the U.S. has relied heavily on foreign-born doctors; half the country's oncology workforce, for example, comes from overseas. Now, in large part because of the Trump administration's cuts to science, medicine and research funding, as well as new immigration policies, fewer physicians can — or want to — come to the U.S.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The beauty of the Wyoming landscape attracted Symington to the area 30 years ago.\n                \n                    Banu Symington\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Banu Symington\n    \n\n   \n   Symington says this trend is evident in Rock Springs, too, which feels less hospitable, even to domestic transplants like herself, a white female who grew up and trained in Philadelphia.   \"We had a whole bunch of physicians 30 years ago who had emigrated from Canada,\" she says. \"There are no immigrant physicians here now.\"   Morgan says rural America suffers more from health care workforce shortages, because fewer than 5% of doctors grew up in those communities. Morgan sees fostering more homegrown talent as the key.   \"We need to do a better job of keeping our local, rural kids local in the first place,\" he argues. \"That way they're knowing the community, they're trusted in the community, and they can be a trusted resource.\"   Bias revealed   Dr. Jennifer Bacani McKenney is the type of person Morgan is referring to. Her family medicine practice is attached to the hospital in Fredonia, Kansas, where she was born. Her Filipino parents emigrated from big-city Manila to this tiny farming community of 2,000 people in the 1970s, when her father, a surgeon, was recruited to work there. Bacani McKenney says adapting to the community was difficult for her parents initially, but eventually the community embraced them.   \n   \"If this community had not welcomed my dad — or the country had not welcomed my dad — I would not be here and probably not have the doctors that I recruited here,\" Bacani McKenney says.   Bacani McKenney grew up feeling treated like a hometown girl, but says the spread of COVID-19 also revealed how some of her patients perceive outsiders.   \"My patients were calling COVID the China flu and Kung flu — that kind of thing — and saying about 'Asians needing to go back,' and they would say it to my face,\" she recalls. \"I would say, 'You know, I am Asian, right?' And they go, 'Oh, well, we don't mean you.'\"   \n   Bacani McKenney is also an associate dean at the University of Kansas, where she helps place medical students in rural communities for monthlong rotations as part of their curriculum. Recently, she says more students — many of whom grew up in cities, or are racial or sexual minorities — object to that requirement, complaining that they feel unsafe in the tiny towns. Patients will casually make racist jokes, for example. Navigating that, she tells them, is also part of the job.   \"What we tell the students is, 'You're going to be uncomfortable in lots of situations in medicine.'\"   \n   But Bacani McKenney acknowledges politics makes health care harder to manage these days. She's changed how she talks to patients about vaccines, for example. She suggests familiar ones first, hoping to minimize increasing skepticism about other vaccines, including to prevent COVID or flu.   \"There's something about a pneumonia shot or a tetanus shot — people are like, 'Oh yeah, I know that,'\" she says.   Nevertheless, more patients are pushing back against her vaccine recommendations, especially since anti-vaccine champion Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took the helm as Health and Human Services secretary and began amplifying views unsupported by scientists and doctors. With them, she tries to keep the conversation going over several visits, if necessary. It's the kind of balancing act her job now requires, she says.   \"I think we have to keep doing it. And if people don't like us because we're having that conversation, they'll probably go somewhere else,\" she says. \"But if I don't have those conversations, I'm not doing my job.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Rock Springs, Wyo.\n                \n                    Charles Paajoe Tetteh for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Charles Paajoe Tetteh for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Katie Hayes Luke edited the visuals for this story.

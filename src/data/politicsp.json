The House approved the funds with overwhelming bipartisan support – with one exception.   Just seven House Democrats voted for the bill funding the Department of Homeland Security through September, citing Immigration and Customs Enforcement tactics in Minneapolis and elsewhere.   \"ICE is totally out of control using taxpayer dollars to brutalize American citizens and law-abiding immigrant families,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters Thursday.   \n   Despite the paper-thin Republican majority in the House, the measure still passed 220-207. Democrats saw the vote as an opportunity to rebuke the Trump administration's immigration crackdown after an ICE officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Macklin Good in Minneapolis earlier this month.   The Senate is expected to vote next week on these remaining funding measures as a group, forcing Democrats to choose between approving or opposing the full slate of funding, which also include billions of dollars for defense, health, transportation and housing.   Democrats had attempted to insert more stringent measures to rein in ICE, such as prohibiting the agency from deporting or detaining American citizens, banning officers from deploying excessive force and explicitly preventing them from conducting raids at places of worship, hospitals and schools.   The Democrats who begrudgingly backed the final package said they won dedicated funds to provide body cameras for ICE officers for the first time and allocated more money for oversight and de-escalation training. The final legislation also holds funding for ICE flat, while reducing the budget for enforcement and removal operations by $115 million and cutting detention bed capacity.   \"This bill is not perfect,\" said Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat whose district covers a long stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border. \"However this bill is better than the alternatives of either funding the department under a continuing resolution or shutting down the government.\"   \n   Democratic leadership concluded that these concessions were not sufficient, though they did not stop members from voting in favor of the measure.   The top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., ultimately decided that grave concerns over ICE outweighed gains in the bill, like increases for funding to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Transportation Security Agency and pay raises for air traffic controllers and members of the Coast Guard.   \"We have to deal with what's happened in this country and we cannot turn a blind eye,\" she said. \"Make the decision based on where your heart is and what you believe in.\"   Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., Appropriations Committee chair, said Democrats were ignoring most of the contents of the funding measure, which includes appropriations for a host of agencies Americans rely on.   \"You're voting against the people that will help you in a hurricane or a tornado or disaster of some sort,\" Cole said. \"Why in the world should they be penalized?\"   House members are departing Washington ahead of a forecasted winter storm for a week-long recess, leaving the Senate to finish the appropriations process before the deadline at the end of next week.   Funding ran out for the federal government at the end of last September. The government remained shuttered for a record 43 days as Democrats fought to renew expiring health insurance subsidies. The shutdown ended with a deal to fund three of 12 appropriations packages through September 2026, but only provided a short-term extension through Jan. 30 for the remaining funding categories.   Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said she will be voting in favor of the remaining funding measures, which keep funding mostly flat and stave off the steep cuts the Trump Administration had called for.   \"The suggestion that a shutdown in this moment might curb the lawlessness of this administration is not rooted in reality: under a CR and in a shutdown, this administration can do everything they are already doing – but without any of the critical guardrails and constraints imposed by a full-year funding bill,\" Murray wrote in a statement. \"The hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need.\"\n",

The resolution failed by a vote of 215 to 215, falling short of the simple majority needed for passage. It directed the U.S. to remove any military presence from Venezuela, which would have required the president to seek congressional approval to order such action.   \n   Rep. Brian Mast, the House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman, said the U.S. military completed its Venezuela mission with \"Operation Absolute Resolve,\" the Jan. 3 U.S. invasion and capture of Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro and his wife.   \"'Operation Absolute Resolve' was a law enforcement action to bring Nicolás Maduro, an indicted narco-terrorist with a $50 million bounty, to justice,\" Mast, R-Fla., said on the House floor, echoing a familiar GOP refrain. \"And President Trump finished the job.\"   Ultimately, the war powers resolution led by Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., drew support from all Democrats and two Republicans, Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Don Bacon, R-Neb. Supporters argued Congress should have a say before the U.S. sends additional military forces into Venezuela.   \n   \"I guess the best we can get from the current majority here is that there's never a good time for Congress to assert its war powers. It's either too soon or it's too late,\" McGovern argued. \"Well, I don't think it's too late because we're still dealing with the consequences of this unauthorized, unlawful military strike.\"   Trump's escalation of military action targeting Venezuela has drawn widespread bipartisan unease in Congress, with some Republicans expressing their concerns behind closed doors. Many have complained they were caught by surprise, the administration has not shared enough information about the mission and the plan ahead remains murky.   \n   Massie, however, is not one of them.   \"Our loyalty must be to the Constitution and not to any party,\" Massie argued on the House floor ahead of the vote. \"If our country wants war then Congress must vote on it. We are the voice of the people.\"\n",

Legal battles and protests have sprung up around a surge in federal law enforcement on the streets.   Good's death may have ignited the crisis in the city, but it also exposed a slew of colliding political factors that all came to light at the same time.   In the days before the shooting took place, the city already faced an escalating political conflict between the Trump administration and Democrats in the state led by Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.   \n   During a visit to Minneapolis on Thursday, Vice President JD Vance tried to lower the temperature and redirect frustrations away from federal officials.   \"We're seeing this level of chaos only in Minneapolis,\" Vance said, arguing that the administration has not encountered as much pushback when deploying agents to other liberal cities and states.   \"Maybe the problem is unique to Minneapolis, and we believe that it is,\" Vance added. \"It's a lack of cooperation between state and local law enforcement and federal law enforcement.\"   Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to quell protests in the city, and the Pentagon has put up to 1,500 troops on standby in case of deployment. Vance told reporters the move wasn't needed at the moment, but added that \"the president could change his mind.\"   \n   Local lawmakers, notably Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, have likened the administration's efforts in the city to an invasion.   The conflict with federal officials comes as Minnesota has repeatedly garnered national attention in recent months over a series of other violent incidents that have shaken the area – from a mass shooting at a Catholic school in August to the political assassination of Minnesota state lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her spouse in their home in June.   Fraud scandal brings federal probe   In the days leading up to the shooting, Minnesota Democrats were consumed by a different political fight.   \n   The Trump administration zeroed in on allegations of fraud within the state, pausing federal funds for Minnesota day care centers, citing an unsubstantiated claim that Minneapolis-based organizations, run by Somali Americans, were pocketing millions in public funds.   White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later told Fox News that the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security would be investigating the allegations on the ground, saying it was a \"top priority\" for the administration.   \"President Trump is not going to let Governor Walz off the hook,\" she added.   Minnesota does have a history of previously documented investigations into social services fraud schemes during his time as governor. For example, roughly 78 people have been charged in relation to a $250 million scheme involving a COVID-era nutrition program.   However, in December, the issue garnered additional attention after the administration amplified an unfounded allegation that had largely spread by right-wing social media influencers online.   \n   Walz decried the move, saying in a statement on X that while cracking down on fraud was a serious issue in the state, the decision was part of \"Trump's long game,\" adding he was politicizing the topic.   But the attention exposed a liability for Walz, who announced he would be dropping out of the gubernatorial race, pledging to focus the rest of his term on rooting out fraud in the state.   The decision marked a striking shift for Walz, who had quickly become one of the most well-known faces in the Democratic Party after Kamala Harris picked him as her running mate in 2024.   It's a role that still makes him a threat in Trump's eyes, argues Michael Minta, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.   \"He was one of the main, kind of, attack dogs on Trump during the campaign. Trump didn't like that. Trump seems to take things personally,\" he said, adding that the president's decision to turn up the pressure on Minnesota is \"forcing the hand of Governor Walz, in terms of trying to pursue that third term.\"   \n   \"[Trump is] actually using the government, and the various agencies, in order to go after people – or states – that he feels wronged him,\" he added. \"So Minnesota happens to be one of those states.\"   A larger fight over Minnesota immigration laws   The allegations of fraud arose as Minneapolis was already becoming the focal point for the Trump administration's agenda against both legal and undocumented immigrants in the area.   Just days into the new year, DHS announced it was deploying roughly 2,000 federal agents and officers to Minneapolis, a number that's increased since Good was shot and killed.   \n   Minnesota is home to the largest Somali community in the country.   But the community has also repeatedly faced verbal attacks and threats from Trump. He characterized Somali immigrants as \"garbage\" during a Cabinet meeting in early Dec., adding, \"they contribute nothing. I don't want them in our country.\"   Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat who immigrated to the U.S. from Somalia as a child, has also been a frequent target of the White House. She told NPR last month that Trump's comments about Somali immigrants were \"vile,\" albeit not surprising.   \"He has trafficked in racism, in xenophobia, in bigotry and Islamophobia for as long as he has held office,\" she said.   Since the federal presence has intensified in the Twin Cities, residents have told NPR reporters it's left them feeling fearful for their safety regardless of their immigration status.   Richard Carlbom is the chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. He sees what's happening in his state as Trump trying to \"expand how ICE agents treat American citizens.\"   \"He tried to start by making that experiment successful in Minnesota,\" he said. \"And what he's finding out is that Minnesotans aren't just going to allow it to happen. Minnesotans are resisting.\"   The situation has sparked ongoing legal battles waged by state officials and advocacy groups against the federal government's immigration crackdown and treatment of protesters.   \n   However, the DOJ has also issued subpoenas to top Minnesota Democrats, including Walz and Frey, alleging they conspired to impede federal law enforcement officials. The lawmakers have refuted those claims, arguing that the probe is an act of political intimidation.   DHS has said that officials have arrested more than 10,000 individuals in Minnesota since Trump took office.   Minnesota's midterm future    It's been over half a century since Minnesotans voted red in the presidential election and roughly 20 years since they elected a Republican governor. However, the state doesn't neatly fit the mold of a solid blue state, explained Minta at the University of Minnesota.   \"We have divided government,\" he said, noting that Democrats and Republicans hold the same number of seats in the state House, and Democrats have just a one-seat advantage in the state Senate.   \"It makes politics different here. Democrats don't have these strong majorities,\" he added, referring to states like Illinois and California, states where federal law enforcement has been called in for aggressive immigration operations and places where Democratic governors have complete backing of the state legislature.   Plus, in the wake of the fraud scandal and Walz's decision not to run again, Republicans eye Minnesota as a place to make gains.   \"Minnesotans should be concerned about fraud in their state government because it exploded on Democrats' watch,\" said Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC) Communications Director Mason Di Palma in a statement to NPR.   \"If state Democrats think their fraud problem disappears with Tim Walz's failed reelection bid, they're dead wrong.\"   Minnesota Public Radio's Clay Masters contributed to this report\n",

When it's filled, you need to empty it so you don't get stressed or angry or to do stupid stuff,\" he explained.   Earlier this month, his cup was full – after escalating rhetoric from President Trump and others in his administration about how Denmark hasn't done enough to secure Greenland, that they've been a poor ally.    \"The first time it felt like a punch to the gut,\" said Bager, who has deployed five times to serve alongside Americans, including in Afghanistan and Iraq. \"You can survive one punch in the gut. When it just keeps on going, then it fills you up with sadness, disappointment, anger.\"   \n   So he emptied those feelings into a letter that reads like a poem. He sent it via Facebook to former U.S. Ambassador to Denmark Rufus Gifford.   Dear Rufus Gifford,I’m not writing as a politician.Not as an analyst.I’m writing as a Danish Afghanistan and Iraq veteran.And yes – this brings tears to my eyes.When the U.S. today calls Denmark a poor ally, it feels like a slap in the face to those of us who were actually there.After 9/11, Denmark did not hesitate.We didn’t debate polls.We didn’t calculate politics.We put on our gear.We said goodbye to our families.We kissed our children goodnight and hoped we’d see them again.We stood side by side with American soldiers.We patrolled together.We covered each other.We bled together.And we lost people.Danish soldiers never came back home because we took the alliance seriously – not as words, but as a promise between soldiers.So when Denmark is called disloyal, it doesn’t just hit a country.It hits those of us who wore the uniform.It hits the fallen.It hits the families still paying the price.We don’t expect thanks.We don’t expect applause.But we do expect honesty.And respect for history.Denmark was there when it mattered.And we were not half-hearted.A solider never forgets who stood by his side.Nations shouldn’t either.Thanks for your voice, you have the respect from the Danish people.      \n   \n      Listen: Company Sgt. Maj. Henrik Bager's reads his letter to former U.S. ambassador Rufus Gifford\n   \n        \n                  1:32\n        \n\n\n      Bager never expected a response.   But Gifford did see it.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Former U.S. Ambassador to Denmark Rufus Gifford (L) and Company Sergeant Major Henrik Bager (R) meet for the first time on Jan. 19. Bager sent a letter to Gifford earlier this month expressing his sadness and disappointment at the way in which the Trump administration has been talking about Denmark.\n                \n                    Barbara Sprunt/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Barbara Sprunt/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"I got so emotional when I read it,\" Gifford said. \"It hits me right here – in the heart.\" Bager and Gifford met in person for the first time on Monday, and jointly spoke with NPR.   Gifford said his reaction is borne, in part, from a sense of responsibility. Denmark is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), along with the U.S.    \"You think about the success of this alliance, which is about sticking up for your friends just as much as it is about sticking up for yourself,\" Gifford said. \"You think about Article Five, this idea that if you attack one of us, you attack all of us, which has only been invoked once — and that was after 9/11, which is why Henrik went to Afghanistan.\"   Bager said he served as a squad leader in the Helmand Province in southern Afghanistan in 2009, one of the deadliest battlegrounds of the war.   \"We had the Taliban at our doorstep,\" he said.   His father died during that deployment.   \"I went home, buried him, said goodbye to my sister and mother again, and then I flew back and fulfilled my task,\" he recalled. \"That's how devoted we are when we go out — the Danish soldiers.\"   He said three Danish soldiers were killed and another 22 wounded during his deployment. Denmark had one of the highest per capita death rates among allied countries during the conflict — 43 recorded deaths — a reality that has weighed heavily on a country with a population of roughly 6 million people.    \"For those families who didn't get their soldier home, sitting and listening to this rhetoric being used, it must be more painful, hurtful than it is for me – and I can feel it all the way to my bones,\" he said.   \n   Bager, 47, described how Danish soldiers plan their potential funerals, should the worst happen.   \"What kind of songs we want to have played in the church, what flowers we want to have on the coffin,\" he remembered.   They write goodbye letters, too.   \"A letter for my mom, dad, my sister, my nephews, my kids, my wife — you don't just write one letter,\" he said. \"You want to make it very personal because it's the last words your family will hear from you.\"   Gifford said it's a reminder of the sacrifice Danes have made in the name of the longstanding alliance between Denmark and the U.S.   \"The idea that we would, over the course of one year, create an adversarial relationship with the best friends that we have on the planet is just unthinkable to me,\" he said.   \"Trust is something that takes years to build and you can break it in an instant,\" Gifford added. \"We have been spending decades building trust across borders, in particular with our NATO allies, and it breaks my heart in such a profound way to see the rate at which that trust has eroded in the last year.\"   Bager made a point of acknowledging his American brothers-in-arms.   \"If any American veterans are listening to this, thank you for your service,\" he said. \"I hope that in the future, we can meet up again – hopefully not on the battlefield, but on other missions that are more peaceful. Freedom runs deep for those who fight for it.\"   'All those deaths seem disrespected'   Bager's is one of a chorus of voices in Denmark expressing pain and disappointment with the rhetoric coming from the Trump administration.   Last spring, Vice President JD Vance told Fox News that Denmark was \"not being a good ally\" and not doing enough to defend Greenland. More recently, Trump has ramped up his crusade for the U.S. to acquire Greenland, ignoring Danish sovereignty.   \n   \"A lot of people know people who have served and who have died in Afghanistan,\" said Villads Welling, a 21-year old political science student at the University of Copenhagen. \"And all of those deaths seem disrespected and like they don't matter now because [the Trump administration] is saying that Denmark is not doing enough and they are not a good ally.\"    Peter Jensen, 63, said the casual way Trump has talked about acquiring Greenland is offensive, and throws into question the longstanding relationship and alliances between the U.S. and Denmark.   \"Betrayal is probably the best word,\" Jensen told NPR. \"Someone you trust, someone you'd do your best to back up when needed, and suddenly – they stab your back.\"   Jensen's son and son-in-law are veterans.   \"Having kids going to war, I can tell you, this is heartbreaking,\" he said. \"You thought you were tough. They are young – they [think] they are invincible. But you are older and you know they're not invincible.\"   While Trump once flirted with the idea of acquiring Greenland by force, he ruled it out in a speech Wednesday. But Jensen said damage has already been done.   \"This is not forgotten,\" he said. \"Even if things calm down around Greenland tomorrow, there are already some long-term effects on what has happened here.\"   He's quick to emphasize his anger and disappointment is directed at the White House – not the American people.   \"Remember that we love America, we love you — but the present administration is just making chaos,\" he said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Søren Knudsen, a retired officer with the Danish Army, and his wife Gina Schaar at their home in Køge, Denmark. The couple said they worry the Trump administration's rhetoric about Denmark risks a fundamental change in the relationship between Denmark and the U.S.\n                \n                    Barbara Sprunt/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Barbara Sprunt/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Taking the Stars and Stripes down    Søren Knudsen, a retired officer with the Danish army, said one of the proudest acknowledgments he's received in his 42-year career came after he served as Deputy Commander of a NATO mission in Afghanistan.   \"Upon leaving the mission in 2012, the Americans honored me with The Stars and Stripes that were flown in the face of the enemy,\" he said.   \n   \"That was a great, great honor. If you give your national colors to a representative of another nation – that is not just something you do. That means a lot,\" he said. Knudsen was also awarded a Bronze Star.   He and his wife Gina Schaar, who is American-born, hung the framed flag and plaque proudly in the entrance of their home in Ølby.   \"If you have gotten such a strong token that you were so proud of, you would show it to everyone – the first thing they see when they entered our house was this,\" Knudsen said in an interview in his home.   That changed after Vance's comments last spring, which left Knudsen with a mix of emotions: \"pain, betrayal, sadness.\"   \"I walked down the stairs and said, no way, I'm not going to show this,\" he said, pointing to the wall where it once was displayed. \"It was an award that I got on behalf of my efforts, my country's efforts, my comrades' efforts, and now they say it doesn't matter anymore.\"   Knudsen took the frame down. In its place hangs a painting of a vase with white tulips.   \"I was always so proud that I'm married to a foreigner, and yet he is supporting my country. He is risking his safety and his security in support of a mission that my country has asked,\" Schaar said. \"That was something that strengthened our bond as an international couple, and so it feels even worse to have that disparaged.\"   The couple said they worry the Trump administration's rhetoric about Denmark risks a fundamental change in the relationship between their two countries.   \"It's brute power, and no more history,\" Knudsen, 65, said. \"No more alliances. No more confidence.\"   Schaar added she never thought it would get to this point.   \"I never dreamed that there would be this antagonism between two places that I love.\"   \n   Knudsen, who serves as the vice chairman of the Danish Veterans Association, said it's important for Americans to understand how popular the U.S has been in Denmark.   \"The Danes have felt the U.S. was a beacon and a leader of the free world,\" he said. \"What [Danish soldiers] went out for was defending values alongside America, alongside the nation that we believed in.\"   Knudsen said the present situation is so painful because he believes in the transatlantic alliance, in the economic, security and cultural ties that have bound the U.S. and Denmark together.   \"Gina has taught me this, and I need to stay focused on this – there could be a day where the Stars and Stripes would come up again,\" he said. \"I hope one day there is a comeback.\"\n",

Many scholars of democracy say that these moves are unprecedented in U.S. history and that Trump has pushed the United States toward authoritarianism.    The president and his supporters counter that the Constitution provides for precisely the type of muscular presidency he is exercising and that voters gave him a mandate to enact far-reaching changes to government.   Trump remains popular with his base, but most Americans disapprove of his job performance. The president's critics hope that waning popularity — as well as this year's midterm elections — will provide a stronger check on Trump.   \n   So what has happened so far? From firing inspectors general, to sidelining Congress, to attacking the media to control information, Trump and his administration have moved at warp speed from the moment he was sworn in.   As Year 2 of his second term begins, we wanted to look at just some of the ways the president has expanded his authority beyond what his predecessors have done and how his administration has tested the constitutional foundations of the country.   CHECKS AND BALANCES   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Jackie Lay/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Aided by a pliant Republican-led Congress, Trump and his administration have numerous times stretched the power of the executive branch into areas of governance normally reserved for the legislative branch. His aides have pulled back funds appropriated by lawmakers, who constitutionally control federal purse strings. The president has implemented sweeping foreign tariffs, using existing sources of authority in new, expansive ways. And his administration has remade or demolished whole federal departments.   Other checks on a president's power, such as federal inspectors general and agency appointees who previously were insulated from White House influence, have also been sidelined.

He has intimidated major news outlets, defunded public media and made it increasingly difficult for journalists to report on his government, even threatening to jail reporters who won't identify government sources. The Trump administration has sought to erase parts of American history in the nation's museums, and the State Department was instructed to reject visa applications due to some applicants' alleged roles in \"censorship.\"    Loading... \n      RULE OF LAW   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Jackie Lay/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Trump has bulldozed through a norm separating the White House and the Department of Justice, openly using the DOJ to pursue an agenda of retribution by seeking investigations and prosecutions of his political foes. He has liberally used the pardon power to the benefit of allies, including those who were convicted of violent crimes during the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. Federal judges have accused the Trump administration of defying their orders and rebuked the administration for aggressive immigration tactics and attempts to consolidate Americans' sensitive data. And while Trump says he is overseeing a return of law and order, he frequently uses inciting language himself.

His name and face seem to be everywhere. He receives fawning foreign visitors bearing gifts for him in a newly gold-adorned Oval Office.   And Trump continues to flex his power by mixing policy with the business interests of his family and allies, casting aside any ethical concerns.    Loading... \n      PUBLIC HEALTH AND SCIENCE   The Trump administration has upended the institutions charged with protecting public health and conducting scientific research. Initiatives that once enjoyed bipartisan support and are the shared responsibility of the states and the federal government saw their funding slashed. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. led the overhaul of the children's vaccine schedule, sidelining expert advisers and slashing the number of recommended immunizations. There have been disruptions and turmoil for federally funded research, including at the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The administration abruptly halted USAID's global health work, which had saved millions of lives from scourges like AIDS, malaria and malnutrition over the course of six decades.

At a recent speech in Detroit, even he seemed a bit surprised at everything he's been able to do.   \"I told you we were going to do a lot of things,\" he said. \"Nobody thought it was going to turn out like this. This has been crazy.\"   One big reason is Trump has faced less internal resistance from his staff, Cabinet and the Republican majority in Congress than in his first term.   Back then, Trump bristled at aides who reined in his impulses — and there were a lot of them, says Ty Cobb, an attorney who served as Trump's special counsel in 2017 and 2018.   \n   \"Trump was still learning the levers of government and had not yet determined, as he has now, that he can do whatever he wants if he finds the people who are willing to be loyal to him,\" he said.   Cobb gave examples, saying former chief of staff John Kelly, former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, former ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley would all tell the president \"no\" from time to time. Others he said would stall or parry Trump's demands.   Marc Short puts it a little differently. He was chief of staff for Vice President Mike Pence during the first term. He says initially Trump wanted people with experience, who could give him advice.   \"The second time around, the president knows what he wants and he intentionally put together a team that would execute that,\" he said.   White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said as much in a sit-down with a pro-Trump podcast called The Mom View.   \"There's one star of the show,\" said Wiles. \"There's one most powerful. And our job is to make him the best he can be. And that's what we do, all day, every day.\"   Trump doesn't always listen or do what she recommends, but Wiles added that she doesn't want him to.   \n   Wiles' approach was affirmed by Vice President Vance in an interview with Chris Whipple, an expert on White House chiefs of staff who spent months interviewing Wiles and other top officials for a piece in Vanity Fair.    \"There is this idea that people have that I think was very common in the first administration,\" Vance told Whipple, \"that their objective was to control the president or influence the president, or even manipulate the president because they had to in order to serve the national interest. Susie just takes the diametrically opposite viewpoint, which is that she's a facilitator, that the American people have elected Donald Trump. And her job is to actually facilitate his vision and to make his vision come to life.\"   As a result, Whipple says Trump has faced very little friction as he and his administration moved at light speed to enact an agenda with his wishes guiding the way.   \"He's governing by whim. He's unconstrained,\" Whipple said in an interview with NPR. \"He's certainly without someone who can tell him hard truths.\"   In his second term, Trump is indeed pushing the bounds of what was thought to be established law, citing nearly unlimited Article 2 executive power.   The president signed more executive orders in his first year than in his entire first term. He sent the National Guard into cities in blue states and is threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act. He ordered the prosecution of his enemies and pardoned his supporters, including those convicted of assaulting police. He used emergency powers to impose sweeping tariffs and took military action in Iran and Venezuela, all without congressional approval or even much pushback.   \"Presidents have always had discretion, but Trump has taken it to another level,\" said Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth College.   \"You know, he's pushing on an open door. There's a reason he's able to get away with so much because we've created such a powerful institution, but he's going further than we've ever seen a president go,\" he added.   \n   It appears likely the U.S. Supreme Court will pare back some of the powers Trump has claimed, though with a conservative supermajority he has already notched a lot of wins.   But there may be political costs to being able to do whatever he wants.   Trump's approval rating is at a low point, though his base is still with him. But independent voters have broken away. A new poll from The New York Times and Sienna finds a majority of voters believe Trump has focused on the wrong priorities.\n",

Attorney General Pam Bondi posted online that Nekima Levy Armstrong had been arrested. On Sunday, protesters entered the Cities Church in St. Paul, where an U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official serves as a pastor. Bondi later posted that a second person had been arrested, and FBI Director Kash Patel announced a third.   \n   The Justice Department quickly opened a civil rights investigation after the group interrupted services by chanting \"ICE out\" and \"Justice for Renee Good,\" referring to the 37-year-old mother of three who was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis earlier this month.   \"Listen loud and clear: WE DO NOT TOLERATE ATTACKS ON PLACES OF WORSHIP,\" the attorney general wrote on X.   Cities Church belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention and lists one of its pastors as David Easterwood, who leads the local ICE field office. Many Baptist churches have pastors who also work other jobs.   Church lawyers praise the arrests   Prominent leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention have argued that compassion for migrant families cannot justify violating a sacred space during worship.   Attorneys representing the church hailed the arrests.   \"The U.S. Department of Justice acted decisively by arresting those who coordinated and carried out the terrible crime,\" said Doug Wardlow, director of litigation for True North Legal, which calls itself a public interest civil rights firm, in a statement.   The St. Paul-based nonprofit law firm has taken on religious freedom cases, including filing an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court supporting a Christian counselor who challenged bans on LGBTQ+ \"conversion therapy\" for kids as a violation of her First Amendment rights.   \n   Levy Armstrong, an attorney and longtime activist, had called for the pastor affiliated with ICE to resign, saying his dual role poses a \"fundamental moral conflict.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Vice President JD Vance speaks at an industrial shipping facility on the administration's economic agenda and impacts on the Midwest in Toledo, Ohio, on Thursday.\n                \n                    Jim Watson/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jim Watson/AP\n    \n\n   \n   \"You cannot lead a congregation while directing an agency whose actions have cost lives and inflicted fear in our communities,\" she said Tuesday. \"When officials protect armed agents, repeatedly refuse meaningful investigation into killings like Renée Good's, and signal they may pursue peaceful protesters and journalists, that is not justice — it is intimidation.\"   Vance wants local law enforcement to assist federal officers    State and local elected officials have opposed the crackdown that has become a major focus of Department of Homeland Security sweeps.   Vance arrived in the state less than a month after Renee Good was killed. He has called Good's death a \"tragedy of her own making.\"   Before his Minnesota visit, Vance warned the church protesters: \"Those people are going to be sent to prison so long as we have the power to do so.\"   Later in Minneapolis, he urged state and city law enforcement to help federal immigration officers.   \"We're doing everything that we can to lower the temperature,\" Vance said, adding that he wants \"state and local officials to meet us halfway.\"   Greg Bovino, a U.S. Border Patrol official, said Minneapolis police failed to help federal agents Wednesday who were surrounded by protesters at a gas station. Minneapolis police responded later that they hadn't received any requests from federal agents for assistance on Wednesday.   \n   Protesters appear in court   Levy Armstrong has helped lead protests after the high-profile police-involved killings of Black Americans, including George Floyd, Philando Castile and Jamar Clark. She is a former president of the NAACP's Minneapolis branch.   Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted a photo on X of Levy Armstrong with her arms behind her back next to a person wearing a badge. Noem said she faces a charge under a statute that bars threatening or intimidating someone exercising a right.   \n   Patel posted on X that Chauntyll Louisa Allen, the second person Bondi said was arrested, is charged under a law that prohibits physically obstructing or using the threat of force to intimidate or interfere with a person seeking to participate in a service at a house of worship. Patel said William Kelly has also been arrested.   A message seeking comment was sent to Allen's and Kelly's attorney.   Saint Paul Public Schools, where Allen is a board of education member, said it is aware of her arrest but will not comment on pending legal matters.   Allen and Levy Armstrong are part of a community of Black Minnesota activists.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Cities Church is seen in St. Paul, Minn., where activists shut down a service claiming the pastor was also working as an ICE agent, on Monday in St. Paul, Minn.\n                \n                    Angelina Katsanis/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Angelina Katsanis/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Kelly has defended the protest and criticized the church for associating with a pastor who works for ICE.   In court Thursday, federal magistrate judge Doug Micko granted the women bond and restricted them from traveling outside Minnesota or from going near the church. The government said it would appeal and the women remained in federal custody Thursday afternoon.   Levy Armstrong's attorney, Jordan Kushner, said he offered for her to turn herself in peacefully, but the Trump administration insisted on arresting her.   \n   \"They wanted a spectacle,\" Levy Armstrong's husband, Marques Armstrong, said, recalling around 50 agents came to detain her.   Arrests follow a DOJ civil rights investigation   The Justice Department investigated the church protest swiftly, but found no basis for a civil rights investigation into Good's death.   Administration officials have said the officer acted in self-defense and that the driver of the Honda was engaging in \"an act of domestic terrorism\" when she pulled toward him. Past administrations, however, have moved quickly to probe shootings of civilians by law enforcement officials.   The Justice Department has separately opened an investigation into whether Minnesota officials impeded or obstructed federal immigration enforcement though their public statements. Prosecutors this week sent subpoenas to the offices of Gov. Tim Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her and officials in Ramsey and Hennepin counties, according to a person familiar with the matter.   \n   Judge rejects charges against Lemon   A magistrate judge rejected federal prosecutors' bid to charge journalist Don Lemon related to the church protest, said Kushner, Levy Armstrong's attorney.   Lemon has said he was at the church as a journalist and not a protester.   \"Once the protest started in the church we did an act of journalism which was report on it and talk to the people involved, including the pastor, members of the church and members of the organization,\" Lemon said in a video posted on social media. \"That's it. That's called journalism.\"   Lemon's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement that the judge's action confirms Lemon's work as a reporter was protected by the First Amendment.   It wasn't immediately clear what the Justice Department would do after the judge's decision. Authorities could return to a magistrate judge to again seek a criminal complaint or an indictment against Lemon before a grand jury.   CNN, which fired Lemon in 2023, first reported the ruling.\n",

    "body": "\n      How do Biden-to-Trump voters feel about year one of Trump's second term? A focus group of Pennsylvania voters provides some unique insight.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  OK, with America so polarized, swing voters - meaning those who shift between parties and candidates - are key for determining who wins elections. For a little insight into how some swing voters are viewing the first year of President Trump's second term, we're joined now by NPR's senior national political correspondent Mara Liasson, who observed a unique focus group. Hi, Mara.MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi there.CHANG: Hi. OK, so tell us about what made this focus group so interesting to you.LIASSON: Well, first of all, a focus group is not a poll. It's not a statistically significant sample. But it can provide a lot of information on the why - why voters feel a certain way. So we have a focus group of 14 voters, all from Pennsylvania. They voted for Joe Biden in 2020, then swung to Donald Trump in 2024. And this is part of NPR's Swing Voter Project, and it's conducted by two research firms, Engagious and Sego. NPR is the media partner. And these focus groups are going to occur monthly, so we're going to be bringing you these insights every month.CHANG: Oh, interesting. OK, so the 14 voters, do we know their political leanings?LIASSON: Yes. They are right-leaning. More identify as Republicans and independents than Democrats. But one thing they have all in common is they take a very dim view of both major parties. They were asked to use one word to describe each party. Here's what they had to say about Republicans.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #1: Trump.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #2: Weak.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #3: Conservative.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #4: Bewildered.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #5: Outspoken.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #6: Patriotic.KIMBERLY: Loyal.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #7: Immoral.LIASSON: And here's what they said about Democrats.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #8: Distracted.KIMBERLY: Unprepared.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #1: Panicked.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #5: Sensitive.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #2: Whiny.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #9: Scary.GRACE: Disoriented.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #10: Corrupt.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #11: Weak.LIASSON: So even though most independent voters actually align with one party or the other, their displeasure with both parties are why they move back and forth.CHANG: Clearly. OK. These voters, I understand, were asked a lot of topics in the news, like immigration, Venezuela, Greenland. You listened in. Was there a main takeaway for you?LIASSON: My main takeaway was these voters have not abandoned Trump altogether, but they want him to focus less on foreign affairs and more on the economy. And more importantly, they feel like all the action with Venezuela and Greenland is chaotic, and it's making them economically anxious. Here's one voter, Grace (ph) - only used her first name. And in this clip, you can hear the moderator of the focus group, Rich Thau.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GRACE: When the invasion occurred with Venezuela, no one in America had any idea that that was going to happen. We just turned on the news. They went in in darkness, and it just happened. So now I feel like, what's next? I have this feeling of, I don't know what's going to happen next.RICH THAU: And that's causing economic anxiety for you (ph)?GRACE: Correct.LIASSON: Now, the White House says Trump is going to talk more about the economy, he's going to take weekly trips, but they haven't always been able to get him to focus on that. Voters in our group were frustrated. They said Trump was too focused on Greenland and Venezuela and not getting the Nobel Peace Prize. And even voters who see some good things happening are still unsatisfied, like Kimberly (ph), who's an independent from Philadelphia.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KIMBERLY: Aside from gas being down, aside from the border being closed - those are two great things - but I really don't see the president speaking to working individuals.LIASSON: So you're going to hear that message from Democrats.CHANG: OK. Well, given some of the critical comments we've just heard, were any of the participants regretting their vote?LIASSON: Very, very few - 8 out of the 14 said they disapprove of Trump's job performance, but only two voters said they would vote for Harris if there was a do-over. So what we're going to be watching over the next 10 months is how these mixed feelings shape the midterms. Trump is not on the ballot, but Republicans are, and views of Trump will shape voter choices.CHANG: That is NPR's Mara Liasson. Thank you so much, Mara.LIASSON: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The Trump administration hasn't been able to answer how much data is at risk, what it was used for or why its unprecedented efforts to consolidate data are needed.   Those questions deepened last week, when the Social Security Administration said it discovered DOGE employees at the agency secretly and improperly shared sensitive personal data last year, but once again can't verify the extent of the violations. The admission came in a court filing last Friday, Jan. 16, that made numerous corrections to testimony given by top agency officials last year in a lawsuit alleging that DOGE was illegally accessing Social Security data.   \n   In the filing, Justice Department lawyers representing the Social Security Administration wrote that two SSA DOGE employees were referred to a federal watchdog to determine whether they violated a law barring government employees from using their job for political activity, known as the Hatch Act.   The unnamed employees secretly conferred with a political advocacy group about a request to match Social Security data with state voter rolls to \"find evidence of voter fraud and to overturn election results in certain States,\" the filing said. It remains unclear whether any data actually went to this group.   \"Based on its review of records obtained during or after October 2025, SSA identified communications, use of data, and other actions by the then-SSA DOGE Team that were potentially outside of SSA policy and/or noncompliant with the District Court's March 20, 2025, temporary restraining order,\" DOJ attorneys wrote.   DOGE team members also circumvented IT rules to improperly share data on outside servers, sent a password-protected file of private records to DOGE affiliates outside the agency and had the ability to see data even after a judge temporarily halted access.   In acknowledging the breaches, the Social Security Administration also repeatedly indicated it still has little knowledge of what data was shared and offers little insight into how those incidents occurred.   \n   Plaintiffs in the lawsuit against the Social Security Administration have asked the two courts currently considering the case to incorporate the \"brazen misconduct\" documented in the corrected testimony.\"The unauthorized release of Americans' personal data represents a profound violation of public trust,\" said Richard Fiesta, executive director of the Alliance for Retired Americans, which is a plaintiff in the case along with unions. \"Retirees, workers, and families depend on the Social Security Administration to protect their most confidential information. We have a right to know what happened to our information, who had access to it, and what it was used for.\"   \n   The revelation bolsters the claims of whistleblower Chuck Borges, who alleged that DOGE staffers repeatedly violated internal SSA policies and federal laws, including a decision to copy a dataset of more than 300 million Americans' sensitive information into a virtual database without following required security protocols.   \"It's disappointing to be proven right,\" Borges, who was the chief data officer for SSA until his resignation in August, told NPR in response to the fling. (He has also filed a separate complaint alleging that he was retaliated against for raising concerns and was forced to resign to uphold his ethical and legal obligations.) \"Yes, it's validating, but it's also disappointing because it puts American public data at risk.\"   He said the filing needs to be \"a wake-up call to Congress\" to investigate what data was accessed and what it was used for. An NPR review of the filings and other statements made by DOGE affiliates shines even more light on how Social Security data was used to advance dubious claims of fraud that have influenced key Trump administration policies on immigration, benefits and election security.   This includes the Department of Justice suing 25 states, primarily run by Democrats, for refusing to turn over nonpublic voter rolls that contain sensitive data, including Social Security numbers. Those states and voting rights groups argue that the Trump administration demand violates federal privacy laws and raises questions about what the data will be used for.   \n   \"This filing shows that the government's efforts are really designed not for what they say they are — to enforce federal law — but to chase down conspiracy theories about election fraud,\" said Brent Ferguson, director of strategic litigation at Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit legal center that has intervened in some of the DOJ lawsuits against states to argue that the demand for sensitive voter data is not lawful.   The Social Security Administration did not respond to NPR's requests for additional information.   How DOGE quickly obtained — and misused — sensitive data   In the first month of President Trump's return to office, the Department of Government Efficiency effort sent representatives into federal agencies and demanded unprecedented access to data. At the Social Security Administration, that included roughly 10 people tasked with reviewing what the Trump administration said was massive fraud.   \n   On Feb. 21, a group of plaintiffs filed the lawsuit arguing that DOGE's efforts to obtain Social Security data violated the law and jeopardized the safekeeping of highly confidential information the agency keeps.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Tesla CEO Elon Musk led the informal Department of Government Efficiency.\n                \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   They had reason to be concerned: According to the court filings made last week, on March 3 a DOGE team member sent an \"encrypted and password-protected file\" with the names and addresses of roughly 1,000 people to the Department of Homeland Security, copying DOGE adviser Steve Davis and a DOGE Department of Labor employee. \"Despite ongoing efforts by SSA's Chief Information Office, SSA has been unable to access the file to determine exactly what it contained,\" the DOJ filing admits.   From March 7 to 17, the new filing acknowledged that SSA DOGE employees were using links to share data through an unapproved third-party server. The agency also said it was unable to determine what data was shared or if it still exists, while also standing by previous testimony that IT safeguards and security protocols ensure no outside servers are integrated with SSA systems and that access to data is controlled and tracked. None of that improper activity was publicly known at the time. But on March 20, a federal judge found there was enough other evidence available to temporarily block DOGE's work, calling the virtually unfettered access to data \"tantamount to hitting a fly with a sledgehammer.\"   \n   Borges' whistleblower disclosure alleged that the following day, DOGE officials possibly circumvented the temporary restraining order by directing career staff to restore access for two DOGE staffers and give them even more privileges than before. Those privileges were apparently cut off by the end of March 24. Last week's court filing appeared to at least partially corroborate that claim by offering a \"clarification\" that one DOGE staffer was searching the agency's master database of all Social Security numbers the morning of March 24, the same day officials told the court all access had been terminated.   At the same time, other federal courts also moved to revoke improper DOGE data access at the Treasury Department, Office of Personnel Management and Department of Education. Some of the same DOGE employees at the Social Security Administration were also given additional access to systems at other federal agencies.   Real data, dubious fraud claims   One reason DOGE and the Trump administration sought sweeping access to the government's data stores was to find alleged voter fraud, reflected in a series of moves made in March 2025.   Aram Moghaddassi, a DOGE engineer at the time, was granted access to a Department of Homeland Security data system known as SAVE that is used to check foreign-born individuals' citizenship and immigration status while he was working simultaneously at DHS and SSA.   \"This access is absolutely critical to get detailed immigration status for non-citizen SSNs to detect fraud and improper payments,\" Moghaddassi wrote to SSA officials on March 15, 2025.   Later that week, Moghaddassi wrote to the deputy chief of staff for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis from a DHS email account asking for help with the state's voting data, according to public records obtained by the nonprofit watchdog group American Oversight.   \"We're working on SAVE access for Florida law enforcement now,\" he wrote. \"On our end, Florida voter registration and voting data would be helpful immediately to check for voter fraud.\"   \n   Moghaddassi did not respond to requests for comment from NPR.   Around the same time, according to the new disclosure from the Social Security Administration, two unnamed DOGE Social Security employees were approached by an unnamed political advocacy group earlier in the month with a request to analyze state voter rolls with a goal to \"find evidence of voter fraud and to overturn election results in certain States.\"   One of the DOGE staffers signed a \"Voter Data Agreement\" and sent it to the advocacy group on March 24, allegedly without the knowledge of or approval of anyone else at the Social Security Administration. The filing said the agency has not yet seen evidence that data was shared.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Investor Antonio Gracias at a campaign event in Wisconsin last year. As part of the DOGE effort, Gracias worked at the Social Security Administration and used some of the agency's data to make spurious claims about voter rolls.\n                \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Scott Olson/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The next day, March 25, Trump announced an executive order directing the Department of Homeland Security and DOGE to \"review each State's publicly available voter registration list\" and directed the Social Security Administration to take \"all appropriate action\" to make SSA databases with relevant information accessible to election officials verifying voter registrations.   In the following days, Antonio Gracias, a private equity investor and ally of DOGE leader Elon Musk who was working with DOGE in the Social Security Administration, would push spurious claims about noncitizen voting and the SSA enumeration-beyond-entry, or EBE program, a process that streamlines the Social Security card process for certain categories of immigrants.   \n   Court filings at the time indicated Gracias' work was supposed to focus on death data and reducing improper payments. The temporary restraining order was also still in effect, raising questions at the time about how he acquired that data.   Gracias was copied on Moghaddassi's request for access to SAVE data, and at a March 30 rally in Wisconsin with Musk, claimed that a sample review of Social Security data with voter rolls found noncitizens who were registered and cast a ballot.   \n   Gracias did not respond to interview requests from NPR via his company.   In a series of media appearances in the following weeks, Gracias gave shifting numbers of alleged noncitizens discovered by DOGE, from \"well over a thousand\" who voted in one state to \"thousands\" in a handful of states. But ultimately, he told reporters at the end of April that DOGE had referred just 57 cases for prosecution, and that they \"may or may not have voted.\"    Voting experts say the type of data cross-checking Gracias and the unnamed political advocacy group seek to do is error-prone and legally questionable.   Gracias told a podcast that his team was looking at public voter registration lists, but those typically do not include full or partial Social Security numbers, making data matching much less precise.   \"DOGE has repeatedly made massive data errors,\" David Bier, the director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, told NPR last year. \"I have some doubts that they've discovered anything more than maybe just some poor government data quality tracking or they don't understand the data they're looking at.\"   Formal ties with activists focused on voter fraud allegations   The Trump administration declined to identify the political advocacy group that two DOGE staffers communicated with in a way that potentially violated the Hatch Act. But the request aligns with the goals of several prominent election denial groups that have called for the Trump administration to use its data to force states to remove ineligible voters from their rolls.   In early March, one such group, True the Vote, made public \"An Appeal to DOGE: Audit the Voter Rolls\" in a newsletter and on social media posts on X that tagged Musk and DOGE's account.    \"We have already aggregated and normalized state voter roll data, cross-referenced against multiple sources, and made our code available on GitHub for transparency,\" True the Vote founder Catherine Engelbrecht wrote. \"By combining DOGE's access to federal databases with our assembled voter roll information, we can efficiently identify discrepancies and work toward a cleaner, more reliable election system.\"   \n   The newsletter and posts on X note, \"We've received word that this message is being carried forward. Godspeed.\"   \n   True the Vote filed numerous lawsuits in swing states won by former President Joe Biden in 2020 making unsupported claims of election fraud and played a role in supplying data for the 2000 Mules documentary that was later pulled from the market and resulted in an apology from its creator, Dinesh D'Souza, for falsely accusing a Georgia man of voter fraud.   Englebrecht and True the Vote did not respond to multiple requests for comment from NPR.   Federal officials have also held meetings with activists who were involved in helping Trump try to overturn the 2020 election results. In June, a DHS official gave an online briefing to activist Cleta Mitchell's group, Election Integrity Network, about changes the Trump administration was making to the SAVE data system to identify noncitizens on state voter rolls — before details had been shared publicly.   Other figures who were involved in attempts to overturn the 2020 election results now serve in the administration. They include Pennsylvania activist Heather Honey, whose flawed research into the 2020 election was cited by Trump during his speech on the Ellipse on Jan. 6, 2021. She is now serving as the deputy assistant secretary for elections integrity at the Department of Homeland Security. Former Georgia Republican Party official Marci McCarthy, who pushed debunked claims about the state's voting machines, is the director of public affairs for CISA, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.   For his part, the president continues to repeat the false claim that the 2020 election was rigged — as recently as Wednesday during his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos — and said \"people will soon be prosecuted for what they did.\"   DOGE's data has driven key Trump policies   The unprecedented push to consolidate data access by DOGE, the Trump administration's use of that data to justify policy changes, and what judges have said to be violations of privacy laws, extends beyond voting and Social Security.   \n   In the year since Trump returned to office, DOGE has funneled disparate data from federal agencies in service of the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement crackdown.   \n   The administration's efforts include taking steps to share sensitive Medicaid and IRS data with the Department of Homeland Security (though a federal court has blocked most IRS data sharing for now), as well as overhauling the SAVE data system into a centralized national citizenship tool that links to Social Security Administration records and is currently being expanded to include driver's license information. Borges, the SSA whistleblower, said after the Supreme Court lifted the ban on DOGE access at the Social Security Administration on June 6, DOGE employees transferred a live copy of the country's Social Security database into a cloud server without independent security controls, and Moghaddassi authorized its operation.   Borges resigned on Aug. 29. Soon after, Moghaddassi was publicly announced as the agency's co-chief information officer. As recently as Jan. 18, he was listed as the SSA's representative to the Chief Information Officers Council, but his name has since been removed from that website.   \n   By mid-August, SAVE was updated to allow officials to check whether people are citizens or listed as deceased in federal records using name, date of birth and just the last four digits of a Social Security number. DHS has encouraged states to use SAVE to identify noncitizens on their voter rolls. NPR has reported instances of U.S. citizens being erroneously flagged by the tool since its rollout.   As for Borges, he hopes the American people will get full answers about what happened with their Social Security data. He told NPR that the data the agency maintains \"is a very, very complete record of everybody's personal information\" that can include clues to help identity thieves and bad actors. \"And so that, if it were to get out, it would be a catastrophic risk to the American public.\"    \n   He added, \"The cavalier way in which they're treating this data is honestly quite appalling to me.\"\n",

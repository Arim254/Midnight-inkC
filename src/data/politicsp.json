Speaking while still in hiding within Venezuela's borders, the far-right leader decried Maduro as an illegitimate strongman who had elbowed his way into a third term despite consistent evidence that his administration had rigged the vote.   \"I want to be very clear with this: Regime change was already mandated by the Venezuelan people on July 28, 2024,\" Machado said during an interview with NPR's Ayesha Rascoe on Saturday, citing last year's controversial, closely watched election.   \n   \"The narrative of the regime right now is that if Maduro goes, chaos will come to Venezuela. That's absolutely false,\" she said. \"Venezuela is in profound, total chaos right now.\"   Machado – whom Maduro's regime had barred from running in the race – had backed opposition candidate Edmundo González in the race to steer Venezuela as it suffers through a political and economic crisis that has forced more than one-fifth of its residents to flee the country.   Machado has been one of the staunchest critics of the powerful United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) since it first came to power in the late 1990s. A former legislator in the Venezuelan National Assembly, Machado has been shot at, targeted by federal prosecutors, banned from running for office, and forced into hiding by the government of Maduro, who succeeded PSUV founder Hugo Chávez in 2013.   \"We won by a landslide in the presidential election, and we proved it with over 85% of the original tally sheets. The whole world knows that. Even Maduro's allies know that he was defeated,\" Machado said.   Several Latin American countries, alongside the United States, agree that Maduro manipulated the electoral system in order to maintain his grip on Venezuela's government. The country has been riddled with corruption and, under Maduro's leadership, seen the country descend into economic collapse and a crackdown on free speech.   \n   The Trump administration has accused Maduro of leading a drug cartel and has ordered deadly strikes on boats it says were carrying drugs. The U.S. State Department is offering a reward of up to $50 million for information that would lead to Maduro's arrest.   Machado echoed those claims that Maduro is operating as a cartel head and blamed him for the boat strikes and broader international hostility towards Venezuela.   \"[The cartel] are destabilizing, intentionally, the region and undermining the institutions in the United States, because they have turned Venezuela into the safe haven of the enemies of the United States – Iran, China, Russia, Hezbollah, Hamas, and others,\" she said.   \"So, this is a war that was declared by Maduro, not us.\"   When asked if she would support U.S. military invasion of Venezuela to see Maduro deposed, Machado declined to speculate on whether President Trump would authorize such actions, but she called Trump a valuable ally in recognizing the \"threat\" Maduro presents as a leader.   \"You cannot have peace without freedom, and you cannot have freedom without strength,\" Machado said.   \"When you are facing a criminal structure, they have used violence, all the resources of the Venezuelan people against innocent people. People that are in prison right now that are tortured, persecuted and killed,\" she said. \"We need to stop this because it is a matter of saving lives and the regime has to understand that impunity is over.\"   Machado had dedicated her Nobel Peace Prize to Trump, whom she has supported and called on directly to help steer Venezuela towards democracy.   When asked whether she did so in the hopes that it would inspire Trump to help force Maduro out, Machado said: \"I dedicated it to the people of Venezuela and President Trump because I think it's the correct thing to do.\"   \n   \"I think it is fair, not only for what he has been doing in the last months to solve long and painful conflicts around the world, but precisely for what he's doing right now for the Americas,\" she said, adding that, if and when Maduro is ousted, she hoped to see the fall of other repressive regimes in Cuba and Nicaragua as well.\n",

We have identified funds to do this, and Secretary Hegseth will use them to PAY OUR TROOPS,\" Trump said Saturday in a post on Truth Social.    Active-duty troops risked missing their first full paychecks on Wednesday, October 15.   Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth reposted Trump's announcement on X stating, \"President Trump delivers for the troops.\"    \n   The Defense Department will use \"approximately $8 billion\" of unused research and development funding from last year to pay service members if the government doesn't reopen by October 15, according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly.    In 2024, the federal government spent nearly $192 billion annually in soldier compensation, according to a White House budget summary.  On average, the government paid nearly $7.4 billion each two-week pay period last year. Meaning, the recently identified $8 billion would likely cover one pay period.    President Trump previously said he would ensure active military would be paid despite the shutdown.    \"We will get our service members every last penny,\" Trump said at a Navy event in Norfolk, Virginia, last weekend. \"Don't worry about it.\"   NPR's Tom Bowman and Luke Garrett contributed to this story.\n",

The Trump administration has laid off more than 100 employees at the agency responsible for overseeing the number.\n                \n                    Smith Collection/Gado via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Smith Collection/Gado via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The Trump administration has laid off more than 100 employees at the nation's main mental health agency, NPR has learned.   Current and former employees at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) told NPR about the layoffs, which were part of a government-wide reduction in force. The sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the agency, said the layoffs came late Friday, as the nation's government shutdown dragged on.   Employees were notified of a \"Reduction in Force\" shortly before 8 p.m. ET on Friday, according to a source within the agency who was not authorized to discuss the layoffs publicly. According to the source, administration officials offered no rationale for who lost their jobs:   \n   \"I think the general feeling today is shock — and not understanding why?\" the source told NPR.   That source was aware of dozens of firings. Two former employees told NPR that the total number of employees at SAMHSA who lost their jobs was around 125, though that number was a rough estimate. SAMHSA had employed around 900 people at the start of this administration, but had already lost a third of that number to layoffs in the spring. With this latest round of firings, that number is down to nearly half.    In a statement, the Department of Health and Human Services, which houses SAMHSA, confirmed the cuts.    \"HHS employees across multiple divisions are receiving reduction-in-force notices as a direct consequence of the Democrat-led government shutdown,\" Andrew Nixon, the department's director of communications, wrote to NPR in an email late Saturday.   SAMHSA is responsible for overseeing the new 988 suicide prevention hotline. It also gives out billions in grants for mental health and addiction services. It was created in 1992 through bipartisan legislation signed by then-President George H.W. Bush. In 2024 its budget was about $7.5 billion, most of which went directly to states for programs aimed at mental health issues and addiction.   \n   SAMHSA funds \"are the backbone of behavioral health in this country,\" Rachel Winograd, a psychologist at the University of Missouri-Saint Louis, told NPR earlier this year. \"If those grants were to go away, we'd be screwed.\"   \n   Despite having what many see as an essential role in protecting the nation's mental health, SAMHSA has not been viewed favorably by the current administration. President Trump had proposed slashing its budget as part of his Big Beautiful Bill. And earlier this year, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told Congress that he intended to fold its duties into a new program he calls the Administration for a Healthy America.   CDC in confusion as some cuts reversed   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A sign marks the entrance to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025, in Atlanta. Several key parts of the agency are losing employees.\n                \n                    Brynn Anderson/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brynn Anderson/AP\n    \n\n   \n   SAMHSA was not the only agency to see staff laid off on Friday evening. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also appears to have suffered cuts to staffing, according to two employees who say they were affected by the firings. Both employees were not authorized to speak to the press while the layoffs are being finalized.   \n   But the cuts at CDC seemed to be in flux late Saturday. In an apparent reversal, one employee had their firing undone according to a letter seen by NPR. The letter, from Tom Nagy, the Chief Human Capital Officer at the department of Health and Human Services said the employee's Reduction in Force was \"hereby revoked.\"   The source said they were aware of other reversals at the CDC, but it was unclear how many employees received such letters.   \n   Before the reversals went out, one CDC official who was laid off told NPR that the agency had been the subject of sweeping cuts to staff at offices responsible for disease surveillance, outbreak forecasting, chronic diseases, and immunization and respiratory diseases, to name but a few. \"If you wanted to weaken America's public health capacity without saying it outright, this is how you'd do it — remove the people who connect the dots, steady the ship, and keep the public informed,\" the official who was laid off told NPR.   The New York Times also reported extensive cuts at the public health agency, including two senior officials responsible for overseeing the CDC's measles response team.    The statement from HHS's Nixon did not directly address the CDC cuts or the apparent reversals, but it indicated more cuts could come.   \"HHS continues to close wasteful and duplicative entities, including those that are at odds with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda,\" it said.   NPR's Pien Huang and Jeff Brady contributed to this report.\n",

    "body": "\n      President Trump threatens a massive tariff hike on China, and Americans begin to feel the effects of the government shutdown.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  President Trump said he's confident the Israel-Hamas ceasefire will hold. He's expected to be in Israel Monday to speak to the country's Knesset. NPR senior political contributor Ron Elving joins us. Ron, thanks for being with us.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.SIMON: How big an achievement is this ceasefire for President Trump?ELVING: We are still in the first phase of watching this agreement play out, but even now, it's a significant achievement just getting these parties - Hamas with all its factions, Israel with all its factions - all coming together on an agreement on these terms. So it's an enormously welcome breakthrough. And if it holds up, it would certainly be a highlight of Trump's presidency, perhaps reminiscent of the way the Camp David Accords were the pinnacle of Jimmy Carter's presidency. But we haven't seen the return of the hostages yet. We still don't know whether that will lead to the next steps in the peace plan or potentially unleash more violence. If Trump and his team can keep Bibi Netanyahu on board and if he, in turn, can control his hard-liners, this will indeed be a monument to peace and to Trump and his administration, and they will deserve a great deal of credit.SIMON: Staying with foreign policy for a moment, the president said yesterday he plans an additional 100% tariff on China starting November 1 or sooner. Should we take his words as policy or posturing?ELVING: China announced some new restrictions on the export of rare earths, which are minerals crucial in high-tech manufacturing. Trump erupted with promises of payback. He said he would raise tariffs 100% on everything Chinese. Now, perhaps we should be accustomed by now to this kind of threat from Trump, especially to gaudy numbers like 100%. But Wall Street took it seriously - had its worst day in six months, with deep losses in the midst of what has been a long-running rally for stocks. So what happens next? We've seen this thrust and parry before. Will Chinese President Xi's trip to the U.S. be canceled, and which side will do the canceling? And we wait to see how much this disrupts the most important trading relationship in the world - the relationship between the two largest economic powers.SIMON: U.S. government shutdown heading into its third week. Layoffs of federal workers have begun. When asked by a reporter yesterday how many layoffs he'd authorized, the president said, a lot.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And it will be Democrat-oriented because we figure, you know, they started this thing...UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Can you give us some numbers?TRUMP: ...So they should be Democrat-oriented. It'll be a lot, and we'll announce the numbers over the next couple of days. But it'll be a lot of people, all because of the Democrats.SIMON: I think he's blaming the Democrats. What more can you tell us?ELVING: Yes, he continues to blame the Democrats, and he is openly punishing the people in blue states, whether they're Democrats or not. I think we all know at this point that the impasse between lawmakers in Congress has caused federal workers to be furloughed, but fired? Their jobs are just as mandated by legislation as they were before. They have been assured their jobs were protected and they would get back pay. Now the White House is casting doubt on both.And the cuts are concentrated in some highly sensitive departments such as health and treasury. We've seen the figure of 4,000 already and more, and the aggressiveness of these firings is causing some heartburn among Republicans as well as the targeted Democrats. Republicans have voters who work for the federal government, too, and even more who depend on the government for services and for other things as well.SIMON: Ron, are we reaching the point where enough people are feeling the effects of this shutdown that we can expect some movement to bring it to an end?ELVING: People are feeling it, Scott, at airports, in farm country, wherever people do business with the government in any way or depend on it in any way. Republicans had hoped those people would blame the Democrats and put pressure on them. Some do and some have, but polls show more people are blaming the president and his party. So can there be an end in sight? Yes, when both sides are willing to talk seriously about the coming cuts to health care, cuts that will hurt people in red states as much as in blue states and very possibly hurt them more.Some of Trump's biggest counties have very high rates of dependence on Medicaid. Republicans say they are willing to talk about health care and its costs after the shutdown ends, but if they have ideas and a willingness to address this issue, people who are suffering are very likely to ask, why can't they talk now?SIMON: NPR senior political contributor Ron Elving. Ron, thanks so much.ELVING: Thank you, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Republicans say there's plenty of time to figure it out.   As the government shutdown goes on, there are a lot of mixed messages on Capitol Hill about the health care issue at the center of the fight.   The tax credits that make ACA health care premiums affordable for many Americans don't expire until December, as Republican lawmakers note. But Democratic lawmakers want to see them extended before enrollment begins Nov. 1, and they have made that a condition of voting to reopen the government.   It's not just a battle over political messaging. These are real health insurance marketplaces where real people — 24 million of them — buy coverage. The amount the federal government picks up for their monthly premiums makes a big difference.    \n   Here are five key facts about the policy.   1. The public supports the subsidies   A poll last week found that more than three-quarters of people across the political spectrum are in favor of Congress extending the enhanced ACA tax credits. The poll was conducted by KFF, the nonpartisan health research organization.   \"What we found is 78% of the public — including majorities of Democrats, independents, Republicans and [Make America Great Again] supporters — all think Congress should extend the premium tax credits beyond 2025,\" says Ashley Kirzinger, KFF's director of survey methodology.   Other polls have had similar findings: 72% of voters across political parties supported extending the policy, according to a July survey by Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward. They surveyed two dozen competitive congressional districts and found that support for the policy was high even for those who had no personal connection to these health plans.   In a memo, they wrote: \"Voters don't want to see people losing their health insurance.\"   2. The issue is urgent since open enrollment starts soon   North Dakota's insurance commissioner, Jon Godfread, says the enhanced subsidies need to be extended before open enrollment starts Nov. 1, calling on lawmakers to \"do this now.\"   He's an elected Republican in his state and the president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, a membership organization of state insurance regulators across the United States. \"Red state, blue state, appointed, elected — we have unanimous approval supporting these tax credits,\" he says.   \n   If Congress acts quickly, the marketplaces could possibly show the subsidized rates to those who log in to shop as soon as open enrollment begins. \"Most states, if not all states, had their [insurance] carriers file two sets of rates — one with subsidies, one without,\" he says. \"And so if they do a clean extension of these subsidies, I think most states will be ready to go on that.\"   If Congress misses that deadline, he says, consumers who log in to shop for a plan will see much higher premiums and they may not come back, even if Congress ultimately extends the credits by the end of December.   3. Premiums are set to shoot up next year   When health insurers were setting their rates for 2026, they factored in the rising cost of health care, plus the possibility that the subsidies would expire and drive the healthiest people out of the ACA marketplaces.   When researchers at KFF analyzed 2026 insurance filings, they found that premiums will double for many consumers next year. \"On average, we're expecting premium payments by enrollees to increase by 114% if these enhanced tax credits expire,\" says Cynthia Cox, director of the Program on the ACA at KFF.   Sky-high premiums might drive people to risk it and go uninsured, she says. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 4 million people will become uninsured in the next few years if the enhanced tax credits expire.   4. Most enrollees live in states that Trump won   The people who rely on HealthCare.gov and the other Obamacare marketplaces are people who \"work at a place that doesn't offer them coverage,\" explains Cox, of KFF. \"A lot of times, that's a small business. Or it could be farmers and ranchers. It could be gig workers like Uber drivers.\"   Geographically, more than 3 in 4 enrollees live in states that President Trump won in 2024, according to KFF. Part of that is due to the fact that some Southern states have seen dramatic growth in enrollment recently. \"In six states (Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia and West Virginia), enrollment has more than tripled in five years,\" notes Cox's colleague Emma Wager.   \n   5. The subsidies are expensive for the government   The subsidies that kept costs down for consumers cost the federal government a lot of money. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it would cost the government $350 billion over the next decade if the enhanced subsidies were extended permanently.   Conservative groups that have always opposed the Affordable Care Act are against the enhanced subsidies. A coalition of groups recently argued in a letter to the president that the enhanced tax credits were meant to be temporary during the COVID-19 pandemic and that extending them will exacerbate rising health care costs.   \"While some Americans may be concerned about premiums going up in the short term, removing the incentive for insurers to continue raising their prices will save patients money in the long run,\" they write.   Other Republicans — like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri — have said they support extending the tax credits or coming up with a different plan to prevent dramatic rate hikes for consumers.   Godfread, the Republican insurance commissioner of North Dakota, says that the debate over rising health costs is real and worthwhile, but there's urgency in this moment.   \"That discussion is separate,\" he argues. \"We can talk about the costs of health care and pharmaceuticals, all the pieces — but we've still got to get access to consumers and that's what these subsidies have helped provide.\"\n",

The Smithsonian receives about 62% of its funding from the federal government, which helps support free admission to all of its D.C. museums and the National Zoo.   Its facilities had been able to keep their doors open for the first 11 days of the shutdown by relying on prior-year funds, but those coffers have since run dry.   \n   The Smithsonian is just the most recent entity to find itself ensnared in the ongoing dispute on government funding.   Some national parks around the country have also been forced to close as staff have been deemed nonessential and sent home until Congress can reach an agreement on government funding.   On Friday, thousands of federal employees across agencies including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education began receiving reduction in force notices, informing them that they would be laid off.\n",

Rogers has dipped into her retirement to help the family get through the federal shutdown.\n                \n                    Tegan Wendland/CPR News\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Tegan Wendland/CPR News\n    \n\n   \n   In a way, Stephanie Rogers started preparing for the current moment months ago, when she and her two daughters moved in with her mother about half an hour south of Denver. High prices for everything was certainly one reason.   \"When you added up the numbers between both of our family households, it was going to be something that we could not keep going long term,\" says Rogers, who's 44 and divorced with no child support.   Rogers has been a microbiologist with the Food and Drug Administration for 16 years and is now among hundreds of thousands of federal employees not working. She is also a chapter president with the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU).   \n   Another big motivation for living together? The uncertainty of a new administration focused on shrinking the government, plus Rogers' memory of the last federal shutdown, back in 2018.   \"And we're living in that reality now,\" she says. \"And so that is our decision, to just make sure all of us survive this process.\"   Her mother, Nina Chapman, says she loves having her granddaughters around. \"I was grateful we had a basement.  It was just a wonderful area to put everybody,\" she says.   Planning ahead for life without a paycheck   When the previous shutdown dragged on for 35 days, from late 2018 into 2019, Rogers says she was \"utterly unprepared.\" So she made sure to plan better this time.   In the weeks before this shutdown, as the deadline for the funding lapse approached, she rushed to squeeze in medical appointments. She requested early refills of the kids' medications in case she couldn't afford them without a paycheck.   Rogers also made a painful decision that will carry its own financial cost. \"I had to pull out of my retirement, which has some tax consequences for next year,\" she says.   \n   Rogers has asked for flexibility with her car payment and is thinking twice about extracurriculars for her girls, who are 10 and 12. They might have to skip field trips that cost extra or volleyball games that are a long drive away. And the plan has been to buy only essential food.   \"In fact, we just had our freezer go out,\" she says. \"We lost our meat, and that's just devastating to us because we were counting on that.\"   Rogers has also applied for state unemployment. Furloughed federal workers are generally eligible for that, though they must refund the money when the shutdown ends, and after they get any retroactive pay withheld during that time.   \n   \"We don't know what our future looks like\"   But President Trump has floated the idea that some workers might be denied backpay, despite a law he signed mandating it in 2019. He's also threatened mass firings during the shutdown, a process the administration said had begun Friday. And Trump has talked about permanently cutting \"Democrat programs,\" without saying specifically what that means. Rogers says all of this makes the current shutdown feel very different.   \"It feels terrible,\" she says. \"I don't know if I even have a job when I walk away from this, much less if I will get paid. Do I have health insurance if we don't get back pay? It's a really hard place to be in when you have children who rely on you.\"   Rogers believes she and other federal employees do essential work — such as food inspections — that the general public may only appreciate when they're gone.    But across the federal government, it's been stressful all year. Mass layoffs and funding cuts have left fewer people working longer hours, she says, only to be sent the message now that they're not really wanted.   \"My mother worries about [it] constantly. My daughter has woken up and said, 'Does mommy have a job today?' We don't know what our future looks like,\" she says.   So even though she's in her dream job, Rogers says she's started applying for other positions outside the federal government.\n",

    "body": "\n      Argentina's economy is spiraling. NPR's Scott Simon speaks with economist Monica de Bolle about the Trump administration's plan to rescue it.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  The Trump administration is throwing an economic lifeline to Argentina. Last month, President Javier Milei's party lost crucial provincial elections. In turn, Argentina's currency plunged, and stock prices plummeted. This has jeopardized reforms that Milei, an ideological ally of President Trump, has undertaken to try to balance Argentina's budget and tame its triple-digit inflation. This week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent formalized an agreement to loan $20 billion to Argentina, writing that the United States is, quote, \"prepared, immediately, to take whatever exceptional measures are warranted to provide stability.\" Monica de Bolle is an economist with the Peterson Institute for International Economics who specializes in Latin America and joins us now. Thanks so much for being with us.MONICA DE BOLLE: Thank you very much for having me.SIMON: Just eight months ago, President Milei was at a conservative political conference here in the U.S., waving a chainsaw around on stage to symbolize his efforts to downsize Argentina's government bureaucracy. What's happened since then?DE BOLLE: So Milei has actually been quite successful in downsizing Argentina's government, and he's been pretty successful at enacting some of the other very ambitious reforms that he had planned. Inflation did come down quite substantially. Argentina also had a very high fiscal deficit, and they managed to turn that situation around. The problem is that Argentina is a country that's quite unique because it operates with two currencies, not just one. So they have their own currency - the peso - and they also use dollars in the same way that we use dollars in the U.S.And oftentimes, because of that system, they find themselves in a situation where they don't have enough dollars for the economy to function properly. And one of the things that did spark this dollar shortage was a corruption scandal involving Milei's sister, who is actually a very key figure in his government. So that coupled with the provincial elections in Buenos Aires, which did not go Milei's way, led to the kind of dollar outflows and hence market turmoil that we saw very recently.SIMON: What would the $20 billion in aid the U.S. will provide do for Argentina?DE BOLLE: So it won't really do all that much. I mean, it will resolve temporarily the kind of dollar shortages that they're currently facing, which is making markets very nervous and is having an impact on the exchange rate and on their domestic currency. So the domestic currency is weakening, and when that happens, usually inflation starts to spike again. So what the $20 billion will do is provide relief to that situation. But the problem is that longer term, it doesn't solve the issue that Argentina has because of the nature of its regime. Since it operates with two currencies and since it uses the dollar as if it were their own currency, they will probably face another dollar shortage not too far from where we are now.And in addition to that, the lifeline that the U.S. is giving to Argentina now - so the $20 billion - the idea behind it is that it calms things down sufficiently for Milei to be able to navigate the next few weeks because come October 26, there are going to be legislative elections or congressional elections in Argentina. So there is sort of a bet behind this that, you know, by sort of staving off the turmoil, perhaps that will give Milei a better chance to garner more support in Congress in the upcoming elections, and that in turn would pave the way for the continuation of his reforms.SIMON: There's a long history in Argentina of defaulting on its obligations. I mean, isn't the U.S. taking a big risk here?DE BOLLE: Yes. The U.S. is definitely taking a big risk. If there is one country in the world that has surprised me in terms of the U.S. providing support to it, that country could be no other than Argentina, precisely because of that fraught history.SIMON: There's been criticism, of course, of the decision to provide aid to Argentina, especially among Democrats. Is there an argument to be made that it's in the interest of the United States to advance $20 billion to Argentina?DE BOLLE: There's no economic argument to be made that it is in the interest of the U.S. There is potentially a geopolitical argument to be made as it pertains to China. So China has been, over the past many years, very heavily involved in the region, very heavily involved in Argentina. This, I think, has become an issue now for the administration. So the way I see the motivation for this 20-billion lifeline is to try to get Argentina more into the zone of influence of the United States and away from the zone of influence of China.SIMON: Monica de Bolle from the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Scott Simon speaks to reporter Greg Bluestein about Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who says her party needs to end the government shutdown and work with Democrats on health care.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene told NBC News this week...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE: I'm not some sort of blind slave to the president, and I don't think anyone should be. And I'm not elected by the president. I'm not elected by anyone that works in the White House. I'm elected by my district. That's who I work for. And I got elected without the president's endorsement. And, you know, I think that has served me really well.SIMON: Representative Greene is calling on her fellow Republicans to end the government shutdown by working with Democrats to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies. Her outspokenness on this issue and others is just one item of Georgia politics these days. We're joined now by Greg Bluestein. He's chief political correspondent for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Thanks so much for being with us.GREG BLUESTEIN: Thanks for having me.SIMON: How much does this most recent break from Republican leadership fit into Marjorie Taylor Greene's broader moves?BLUESTEIN: I mean, she's always been such a maverick in Georgia politics. But lately, it's really felt like she's even more of a wild card ever since she decided not to run for U.S. Senate for the spot challenging Senator Jon Ossoff, maybe the most vulnerable Democratic incumbent on the midterm ballot. Ever since she made that decision, she has been even more of a maverick, even more of a wild card. For the first time, really, that I can remember in Georgia politics, a bunch of Democrats are now praising Marjorie Taylor Greene, saying, I didn't think we could ever say this, but I agree with Marjorie Taylor Greene.SIMON: How have her constituents reacted?BLUESTEIN: Well, she is in a very, very red district up in northwest Georgia. There's been Democratic challengers to her that have raised lots of money but really made no headway. So she's safe politically. Her constituents - by her accounts, about 60% of them have agreed with her stance. Time and time again, we will talk to her constituents who say they might not like everything she says on Twitter, or on social media or on TV, but they agree with most of her votes. By some projections, ending these federal subsidies could affect more than 1.4 million Georgians. So to many of her constituents, she's not just speaking as a lawmaker; she's speaking as a mom whose children will have to pay more in health care insurance.SIMON: And, of course, this comes as there are two big races next year in Georgia for the Senate and for governor. What, so far, seems to be the major themes for both those campaigns?BLUESTEIN: Well, the biggest theme, I think, is it is wide open for both races. Other than Jon Ossoff, the incumbent Democratic senator, there seems to be a candidate for every lane. You have candidates in the governor's race from the far left to former Republican Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan, now running as a moderate Democrat. And then, of course, on the Republican side of that governor's race, you've got MAGA allies. You've also got Brad Raffensperger, the secretary of state, who famously defied Donald Trump's demand to find just enough votes to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia.SIMON: What about the economy? What kind of issue is that?BLUESTEIN: Yeah. Every poll that I've seen in Georgia, economy and jobs and inflation have always been the top issue, and I don't think that's going to change. But we have started to see - at least in polls of Democratic voters - number two is standing up to Donald Trump. And that reflects a lot of Democratic voters - especially the more liberal and progressive ones - who want a more confrontational, aggressive approach to the president. And there's candidates who are promising to do that in 2026, and there's others who are saying, no, look, we need to figure out ways we can work with the Republicans.SIMON: OK. And what are the issues on the Republican side?BLUESTEIN: Trump shadows everything as well. On the Senate race, for instance, there's pretty much a three-person race for Donald Trump's endorsement right now. There's former football coach Derek Dooley and Congressmen Mike Collins and Buddy Carter. Derek Dooley is probably the least known of any of them. He has a famous last name, thanks to his father, the legendary University of Georgia football coach. He has Governor Kemp's endorsement, though, so that helps him a lot. On the other side, the other two candidates, Collins and Carter, they're both depicting themselves as MAGA warriors who are going to be President Trump's biggest ally in the Senate should they win.SIMON: Where do a lot of Georgians see themselves fitting into the national landscape of politics now?BLUESTEIN: You know, we went from a state that was an afterthought - I remember in the 2016 presidential election, neither Trump nor Clinton even came to Georgia after the primary. They never had substantial operations in Georgia or big campaign rallies, and nor did they really need to. I mean, Donald Trump was always favored to win Georgia. He did. But in the process of 2016, he lost the Atlanta suburbs, and that was the first real inkling that Georgia was being competitive. And now we're used to being competitive. Now there's even voter fatigue because there have been so many competitive elections.You know, close to a billion dollars was spent in Georgia during the 2020 campaign. About 500 million was spent in 2022. So you're going into 2026 - yes, Georgia's still a battleground. Is it blue? No. Is it red? No. It's probably a sort of darker shade of purple right now but certainly still one of the most competitive places in the nation.SIMON: Greg Bluestein is chief political correspondent for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Dominion was at the center of fraudulent vote rigging claims by President Trump and his allies during the 2020 election.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  Dominion Voting Systems, the election technology company that's at the heart of countless conspiracy theories after the 2020 election, has been sold. Dominion machines are used in more than half the states, and the company's buyer seems to be leaning into some of President Trump's language about voting. NPR's voting correspondent, Miles Parks, joins us in our studios. Miles, thanks so much for being with us.MILES PARKS, BYLINE: Hey, Scott. Thanks for having me.SIMON: Dominion became what amounts to a household name after the 2020 elections. Remind us why.PARKS: Well, if you think back to November 2020, the Trump campaign, influential people on the right, were really throwing spaghetti at the wall, trying to find a conspiracy theory to stick about why President Trump did not win that election. You know, Italian satellites, late-night ballot dumps, and Dominion really got pulled into that. Here's former Trump attorney Sidney Powell talking a little bit after the election on Fox Business.(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FOX BUSINESS\")SIDNEY POWELL: I can hardly wait to put forth all the evidence we have collected on Dominion, starting with the fact it was created to produce altered voting results in Venezuela for Hugo Chavez.PARKS: So you get a taste a little bit of the kind of accusations that were being made about the company, even though none of them were ever proven true. Fox News ended up settling a defamation lawsuit with the company for close to $800 million, and the far-right outlet Newsmax also settled a similar lawsuit for more than $60 million.SIMON: Now, I imagine none of that can be good for business. Is that why the company's been sold?PARKS: Well, we haven't heard from Dominion about the sale, but I can say the rumors have not completely died and have clearly impacted the business. You know, in 2023, a Republican-leaning county in California actually voted to get rid of their Dominion counting machines in favor of hand-counting ballots, even though it was estimated to triple their costs. And even this year, officials with Trump's Justice Department reached out to local clerks in Missouri wanting to access their Dominion machines. We aren't really sure exactly why, but it is clear that there is still a lot of skepticism about this company among people who deny the 2020 results.SIMON: And, of course, that could be a big task for the buyer of Dominion, which is who? And why are they buying?PARKS: Right. So it's someone who wants to - who already owns a voting equipment company and wants to expand. Scott Leiendecker is his name, and he's been working in elections for decades, first as an official. He was the Republican elections director in St. Louis. And then in 2011, he started a company called KNOWiNK that has become the nation's largest vendor for voting check-in equipment. To acquire Dominion, Leiendecker started a new company called Liberty Vote, and where it gets really interesting is how much he seems to be leaning into the right's election integrity language.SIMON: Did the Liberty Vote detail how they plan to change Dominion?PARKS: So it's still a little bit unclear, but there is definitely a rebrand going on. The announcement explicitly said that they would only use domestic staffing and software development, which seemed to nod to the conspiracy theorizing about Venezuela that we heard a little bit of before. And the announcement also said it would prioritize complying with President Trump's March executive order on voting.But just to be clear, it's not like the Dominion machines are just going away. You know, government contracts are already in place and, in many case, for many years down the road. So counties that have these vote tabulators are probably still going to use them in elections in 2026. It will be interesting to watch then how the election integrity activists - the most ardent ones on the right - take this news, considering it's just, at this point, a change in ownership.SIMON: NPR's Miles Parks. Thanks for joining us this morning.PARKS: Thanks, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

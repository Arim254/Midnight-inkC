Many fled the long civil war in their east African country and were drawn to the state's welcoming social programs.   But how many migrants would be affected by Trump's announcement that he wants to end temporary protective status could be very small. A report produced for Congress in August put the number of Somalis covered by the program at just 705 nationwide.   Congress created the program granting Temporary Protective Status in 1990. It was meant to prevent deportations of people to countries suffering from natural disasters, civil strife or other dangerous conditions.   \n   The designation can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary and is granted in 18-month increments.   The president announced his decision on his social media site, suggesting that Minnesota was \"a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.\"   \"Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from,\" Trump wrote. \"It's OVER!\"   \n   The Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said Trump's decision \"will tear families apart.\" Executive Director Jaylani Hussein said in a statement late Friday, \"This is not just a bureaucratic change; it is a political attack on the Somali and Muslim community driven by Islamophobic and hateful rhetoric.\"   Trump promised while campaigning to win back the White House last year that his administration would deport millions of people. As part of a broader push to adopt hardline immigration policies, the Trump administration has moved to withdraw various protections that had allowed immigrants to remain in the United States and work legally.   That included ending TPS for 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians who were granted protection under President Joe Biden. The Trump administration has also sought to limit protections previously extended to migrants from Cuba and Syria, among other countries.\n",

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., speaks during a press conference on the \"Epstein Files Transparency Act\" at the US Capitol in Washington, DC on November 18, 2025.\n                \n                    DANIEL HEUER/AFP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        DANIEL HEUER/AFP\n    \n\n   \n   Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene became a household name in the run up to the 2020 election for divisive rhetoric, political stunts and enthusiastic support of President Trump. But after growing disagreements with Trump during his second term, Greene announced she will leave Congress in January before her term is up.   Greene said it would not be fair to her northwest Georgia district, one of the most conservative in the country, to have them \"endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for\" while noting that \"Republicans will likely lose the midterms.\"   \n   Greene's split with Trump widened in recent weeks as she pushed for the release of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.   For months, Greene had been publicly pressing Trump and top Republicans in Congress to release all files from two federal investigations into Epstein. She was part of a small cadre of Republicans who helped force a vote on the House floor to release the files — a process that drove Trump to reverse his position on the documents and led to near-unanimous support for the measure this week.   \n   But before Trump reversed course, he lashed out last week, calling her \"Marjorie Traitor Greene,\" and told reporters, \"Something happened to her over the last period of a month or two where she changed politically.\"   In her post Friday night, Greene defended her decision to fight for the release of those documents.    \"Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States, whom I fought for,\" Greene wrote.   Greene's defiant push against Trump   On a brisk morning this week, Greene stood outside the Capitol with some of the women who say they were abused by Epstein.   \n   \"I've never owed him anything,\" Greene of the president on Tuesday. \"But I fought for him and for America First. And he called me a traitor for standing with these women.\"   The cracks between Trump and Greene grew over the last year, as Greene increasingly pointed out where she saw the president falling short: she called the war in Gaza a genocide, criticized Trump's decision to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities, and pressed for expiring health subsidies to be extended, citing the threat of skyrocketing premiums for people in her district, including her own children.   \n   And she was doing it not just on social media or right-wing outlets, but on programs like ABC's The View.   \"What Happened to Marjorie?\"   \"I was thinking, if this was the first time I'd ever seen this person, it sounds like a normal congressperson from Schoolhouse Rock,\" said University of North Georgia professor Nathan Price after Greene's appearance on the daytime television staple.   For some, this new persona may be hard to square with the Greene many Americans first got to know: the congresswoman who embraced QAnon conspiracy theories, liked a post that called for violence against former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. and heckled school shooting survivor David Hogg in 2020, before he became a prominent political activist.   Even Trump has publicly mused in recent weeks: \"What happened to Marjorie?\"   Georgia Republican strategist Brian Robinson says it's a fair question.   \"I am open to the idea that she's had a 'road to Damascus' moment, a conversion, that she sees the errors of the toxicity and wants something that's better,\" Robinson said in an interview with NPR earlier in the week.   On her own social media and with journalists, Greene has been open about addressing claims from Trump and others that she has changed or abandoned the president. NPR reached out to Greene for further comment.   \n   \"Nothing has changed about me,\" Greene told the hosts of The View. \"I'm staying absolutely 100% true to the people who voted for me, and true to my district.\"   Robinson said the changes could be part of a natural evolution for Greene, a former CrossFit gym owner from the Atlanta suburbs.   \"We love to elect outsiders to Congress,\" Robinson said. \"They go to Congress with very little idea of how it works. And if at some point you're like, 'I want to do substantive things that make America better, then I've got to do this a little bit different.\"   Or, Robinson said, she may be trying to broaden her appeal with an important constituency as she weighs a bid for higher office. Trump said last week he showed Greene polling earlier this year suggesting she would flounder in a race for Georgia governor or Senate.   \"Is she intentionally signaling to women, 'The good old boys club ignores us, and I understand your struggles?\" Robinson said.   Both Robinson and Price said Greene's evolution was more about style than substance. She has disavowed some of her more controversial views, but not others, like the unproven assertion that widespread fraud upended the 2020 election result.   The anti-interventionist, anti-elite principles that first propelled her to Congress also remain core to her identity. \"What she's responding to is believing that the President has shifted on these issues,\" said Price.   Some potential political opponents see an opportunity in Greene's break with Trump. Robinson, who worked for Greene's opponent in her first primary race, says in the past he has warned potential challengers not to underestimate her.   \"You are wasting your time,\" Robinson said. \"She will beat you. And I would have said that into infinity until this week.\"   How Greene's district reacted to the shift   But in the 14th Congressional District, it was not clear this week that anything had changed. As chair of the Paulding County Republican Party, Ricky Hess spends a lot of time talking with voters.   \n   \"The issues that they want to talk about involve high property taxes, high health care costs, whether or not their kids will be able to buy a house when they graduate,\" Hess said this week ahead of Greene's resignation.    Hess told NPR he believes Greene's \"America First\" worldview resonates in this heavily working class and rural stretch of Northwest Georgia.   \"She's pretty tapped into what her constituents are wanting, and I have to believe that most of her actions are in service to that,\" Hess said.   Hess said voters saw Trump and Greene as fighters on the same team. Though Martha Zoller, who hosts a political talk radio show that airs across North Georgia, said in an interview Wednesday she didn't believe everyone's minds were made up.   \"People are kind of reeling, if you want to know the truth,\" Zoller said. \"We haven't had a lot of listeners discussing it because they're waiting to see what happens.\"   Georgia political observers noted that Greene has been anything but a predictable politician — including her surprise resignation.    Trump has come to a truce with other politicians he's feuded with, including Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. And his future relationship with Greene could still evolve.   But Zoller said the conflict between Trump and Greene has been about more than just two big personalities falling out on the national stage.   \"I think that the big discussion we're going to be having as Republicans over the next few years is what is the Republican movement once it's not Trump?\"   Zoller said earlier this week it seemed clear that Greene wants to be part of that discussion. But with her resignation, the answer to that question is may be less clear  now than before.   NPR's Stephen Fowler contributed to this report.\n",

Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican who rose to prominence as one of President Trump's biggest defenders and recently became one of his biggest critics, is leaving Congress.   In a nearly 11-minute video statement, Greene excoriated the Republican Party, House leadership and the start of campaign season \"which means all courage leaves and only safe campaign re-election mode is turned on.\"   Greene's announcement late Friday that she would resign effective Jan. 5, 2026, is the latest escalation of months of clashes with the president over his second term agenda – including the release of the Epstein files.   \n   \"Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States, whom I fought for,\" Greene said.    \n   Trump's campaign promise to release files related to the life and death of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein – and the numerous ways the president stonewalled the release this year before ultimately relenting this week – was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back.   The third-term congresswoman also said it would not be fair to her northwest Georgia district, one of the most conservative in the country, to have them \"endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for\" while noting that \"Republicans will likely lose the midterms.\"   \"It's all so absurd and completely unserious,\" she said. \"I refuse to be a 'battered wife,' hoping it all goes away and gets better.\"   Greene is one of a record 40 House members and 10 senators who have indicated they do not plan to return to their seats after the 2026 election, joining a number of lawmakers who are retiring or running for a different office.   Her resignation will likely set up a special election to finish the rest of her term in the spring.   \n   The fracturing of Trump's MAGA coalition has been developing for months, with splits over foreign policy issues like bombing Iran and the support of Israel's war in Gaza accompanying questions about domestic effects of tariffs. Greene has been a vocal opponent each time.    Greene has remained ideologically consistent throughout her time in Congress and with her criticism of Trump. Her argument is that the president and the Republican Party have changed and fallen short of the Make America Great Again and America First vision. Notably, her announcement video also blasted the \"political industrial complex of both political parties\" that focuses on which side \"can convince Americans to hate the other side more.\"    \"And the results are always the same, no matter which way the political pendulum swings, Republican or Democrat,\" she said. \"Nothing ever gets better for the common American man or woman.\"   Greene's retirement announcement comes at a time when the Republican Party – and Trump – are facing a number of setbacks, including defeats up and down the ballot in this month's elections and poor economic headwinds. Now, there is a large and visible dent in the previously impenetrable armor that is Trump's control over the party and its future, accelerating the inevitable questions around what a post-Trump GOP would look like.\n",

The order signed by Justice Samuel Alito will remain in place at least for the next few days while the court considers whether to allow the new map favorable to Republicans to be used in the midterm elections.   \n   The court's conservative majority has blocked similar lower court rulings because they have come too close to elections.   \n   The order came about an hour after the state called on the high court to intervene to avoid confusion as congressional primary elections approach in March. The justices have blocked past lower-court rulings in congressional redistricting cases, most recently in Alabama and Louisiana, that came several months before elections.   The order was signed by Alito because he is the justice who handles emergency appeals from Texas.   Texas redrew its congressional map in the summer as part of Trump's efforts to preserve a slim Republican majority in the House in next year's elections, touching off a nationwide redistricting battle. The new redistricting map was engineered to give Republicans five additional House seats, but a panel of federal judges in El Paso ruled 2-1 Tuesday that the civil rights groups that challenged the map on behalf of Black and Hispanic voters were likely to win their case.   If that ruling eventually holds, Texas could be forced to hold elections next year using the map drawn by the GOP-controlled Legislature in 2021 based on the 2020 census.   \n   Texas was the first state to meet Trump's demands in what has become an expanding national battle over redistricting. Republicans drew the state's new map to give the GOP five additional seats, and Missouri and North Carolina followed with new maps adding an additional Republican seat each. To counter those moves, California voters approved a ballot initiative to give Democrats an additional five seats there.   The redrawn maps are facing court challenges in California, Missouri and North Carolina.   The Supreme Court is separately considering a case from Louisiana which could further limit race-based districts under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. It's not entirely clear how the current round of redistricting would be affected by the outcome in the Louisiana case.\n",

    "body": "\n      A bipartisan group in the House is looking to ban lawmakers from trading individual stocks as part of an effort to increase accountability in Congress.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  Trust in the U.S. Congress has been dismal for years, but a bipartisan group in the House thinks that they can restore just a little bit of it. They want to ban lawmakers from trading individual stocks to address the perception that lawmakers are profiting from their jobs. NPR congressional correspondent Deirdre Walsh reports on the effort.DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Tennessee Republican Tim Burchett earlier this week summed up the effort to reform ethics laws on Capitol Hill.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TIM BURCHETT: This is a fist fight, folks.WALSH: He pointed to a list put out by a private trading firm, featuring which lawmakers have the most profitable stock portfolios.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BURCHETT: This is pathetic, folks. We all know what's going on. Congress knows what the hell's going on. And it needs to stop.WALSH: Burchett is part of a bipartisan group with Rhode Island Democrat Seth Magaziner who say allowing lawmakers to buy and sell stock undermines the trust in Congress.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SETH MAGAZINER: Members of Congress have access to all kinds of inside information that the average member of the public does not. So the opportunity for corruption is unacceptable.WALSH: Congress passed a law in 2012 known as the STOCK Act - stop trading on congressional knowledge. It requires disclosure of any stock trades over a thousand dollars within 30 days. But it's unevenly enforced and includes just a $200 fine for failing to report transactions. Joe Morelle, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, said at a hearing this week that the current system doesn't work.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOSEPH MORELLE: Regrettable - those reforms are now just Band-Aids to a gaping, festering wound.WALSH: Dan Savickas with the Taxpayer Protection Alliance testified that members of Congress can affect the global economy and the U.S. stock market.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DAN SAVICKAS: They have the ability to trade based off of nonpublic information in a way that would land ordinary private citizens in legal hot water.WALSH: And he pointed out that many members who trade are beating the market.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SAVICKAS: According to a 2024 report on data that is available, 46 members of Congress, amongst those who trade, outperformed the S&P 500 last year.WALSH: Proponents of banning congressional trading say the hearing was an important step, but if a bill wasn't put on the floor they would take steps to force the vote, using the same process that led to legislation directing the release of the Epstein files. But Magaziner says there is a silent force on the part of both parties that don't want new restrictions.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MAGAZINER: The opponents are quiet, right? They don't get in front of the cameras and say, no, we want to keep trading stocks, but they are in the ear of leadership.WALSH: A Senate committee approved a similar bill in July, but there's no plan for a floor vote yet. Wisconsin Republican Senator Ron Johnson voted no then, saying there are already financial disclosure rules and this bill will make it harder to attract candidates for office.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RON JOHNSON: You could relabel this law, quite honestly, the career politician protection act.WALSH: There are some disagreements about how a ban would work - whether congressional spouses and children and senior congressional staffers involved in writing legislation should also be barred from trading stocks. And for those lawmakers who own stocks now or enter Congress after a new law is put into place, there are questions about how to divest and how to handle the tax issues after they move investments into mutual funds. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who doesn't trade stocks, supports a ban, but hasn't committed to a vote yet. After more than a decade of stalled reform efforts, Pennsylvania Republican Brian Fitzpatrick says he's confident this time there is momentum.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BRIAN FITZPATRICK: This will get a vote. Trust me.WALSH: He stressed that serving in Congress was designed to be temporary.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)FITZPATRICK: Public service is supposed to be a sacrifice. You're supposed to give things up as part of that public service. And this is the least of which we can do.WALSH: There are efforts to broaden the ban to apply to the federal judiciary and to the president and vice president. But for now, the House group says it's time to vote to police Congress.Deirdre Walsh, NPR News, the Capitol.(SOUNDBITE OF THE ROOTS SONG, \"WHAT THEY DO\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "\n      A new NPR poll shows trouble for Republicans as President Trump's message and approach appear to fracture independent voters.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  The new polling from NPR says Americans are largely unhappy with how things are going in the country. President Trump gets bad marks, as does his Republican Party, but so do Democrats. NPR senior national political correspondent Mara Liasson and senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro talked about all of this with NPR Politics Podcast co-host Miles Parks.MILES PARKS, BYLINE: Domenico, what do you see in this new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll?DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Well, it was a pretty eye-opening poll, I thought, this week. Democrats are up 14 points in what's known as the congressional ballot test. We ask routinely, you know, if elections were held today, who would you vote for in your district, a Republican or a Democrat? Fifty-five percent in this poll said a Democrat, 41% said a Republican. In Marist polls, that's the biggest lead that we've seen since 2017, since Trump's first administration.And I have to say, in 20 years of covering politics, I can't remember seeing a good survey put out a congressional ballot where one party is at 55 in the congressional ballot. Look, this could be an outlier, but there's plenty of evidence that it's not, especially with the elections earlier this month where, you know, Democrats did well up and down the ballot, and voters seem to be upset with Trump and Republicans, especially on the issue of affordability.PARKS: Fourteen points is a lot of points. It sounds like the makings of a blowout, but we are still a year away from midterms.MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Sure, we're still a year away, but I do think that if Democrats can maintain a lead of anywhere from - oh, I don't know - 8 to 11 points advantage in the generic ballot, that's setting them up for a very good midterm. So things have changed, and the predictive power of these polls and the generic ballot question has really dropped. Why? - because there are so fewer truly competitive seats. We have more Democrats sitting in seats that Trump won than Republicans sitting in seats that Harris won. And also Republicans have an advantage not even counting the midcycle gerrymandering that's going on in states like Texas and California.MONTANARO: Yeah, I was going to say, the gerrymandering has really led to a right-leaning number of seats in the country that are, you know, seemingly a majority. And that's why Democrats need to have a bigger advantage on this question.PARKS: Well, thinking ahead to how Republicans respond to all of this, the first thing that they did after this government shutdown, Domenico, was to vote to force President Trump's Department of Justice to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Where does the party stand or how are they thinking about moving forward over the next year?MONTANARO: Yeah, I mean, I think it'd be too far to say that the party's fracturing and people are breaking away from Trump. But it's certainly easier to do that when a president has low approval ratings, as Trump does. I mean, our poll had him at 39% job approval, the lowest since just after January 6. You know, it was 24% with independents. He's on the wrong side of a lot of issues - the economy, people thinking he's going too far on how the administration is conducting deportations.But I have to say, you know, I'm skeptical that there will be that much change where we see Republicans suddenly abandoning the president because he's still very popular with base Republican voters. In our survey, 9 in 10 Republicans still approve of the job he's doing.LIASSON: And what's - just a little caveat about the unpopularity of Democrats - they are unpopular, historically unpopular, but a lot of the people who say they are not happy with Democrats are Democratic voters. They're not happy with Democrats. Does that mean they're going to vote for Republicans? No. Are they going to stay home? Probably not 'cause these voters are very, very angry, and we saw in the off years that they are motivated. Whether Trump is on the ballot or not, they are motivated.PARKS: I mean, the thing I struggle with, Domenico, is just trying to figure out what matters right now because it does feel like there's a new political controversy, scandal, something big happening every single day. And I get the sense that that advantages Trump, that nothing ever really seems to stick.MONTANARO: Well, yeah. I mean, Trump is chaos. You know, that's always been his strategy. That's been his playbook. You know, he puts out a fire hose of stuff, you know, controversial things online, as we saw even this week. I think the difference here is that Trump and Republicans, like Democrats and President Biden before him, can't escape the fact that people are feeling a pinch in their pockets. You know, it's arguably one of - you know, the reason why he won crossover voters in the 2024 presidential election.Still, the main issue in our poll - 57% said that lowering prices needs to be Trump's top priority. Immigration was a distant second at 16%, despite the fact that Trump continues to say, or has said repeatedly in the second term, that immigration is really the most important issue. But even a plurality of Republicans were saying that lowering prices is the top priority, so they are screaming it out in the surveys and at the ballot box.LIASSON: The economy and particularly prices is a different kind of issue. It's easy to change the subject from a lot of issues but not when people feel they are being pinched and prices are going up for their basic goods like food and rent and education.And it's very hard to convince people that the economy is better than they feel. And if presidents try - Biden tried, Trump is trying now - try to convince them that something is different than than they're feeling, they are insulted.PARKS: Well, I do feel like a lot can change in a year, specifically - and maybe most importantly, it sounds like - on the economy. How much can we really learn from a poll like this, Domenico, this far out from midterms?MONTANARO: Yeah, I mean, I think it offers a lot of value. I mean, it offers a good framework for where we are right now, you know, what the mood of the country is, what the reporting lines, frankly, will be heading into the next year. What is it that voters care most about? We know what people think is most important. We see this as really a critical juncture of Trump's presidency because he's inching closer to that lame duck status and certainly would be if Democrats take back the House next year.But Democrats have to worry about peaking too soon. They're not taking Republicans by surprise on the issue of affordability. There are some real warning signs for Democrats in this survey as well. As Mara said, Democrats don't really like the people in their own party. And the bottom line here is, if prices stay what they are, it's advantage, Democrats. But if they come down and people feel improvements, then this lead very much could recede.LIASSON: Right. That means Trump has to deliver. He can't just convince people the economy is better than they think it is. He has to actually bring prices down.SUMMERS: You can find more on the political news of the day on the NPR Politics Podcast.

You can refuse illegal orders.MARTÍNEZ: The White House later walked back Trump's comments. In a few minutes, we speak with one of the lawmakers in the video, Representative Jason Crow. First, NPR's Quil Lawrence happened to be interviewing dozens of veterans who were on Capitol Hill this week to talk about this same subject.QUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE: Forty-one vets from 21 states visited Washington this week to express concern that National Guard and even active-duty troops have been dragged into domestic law enforcement. Jackie Robinson (ph) is a 27-year veteran of the Army.JACKIE ROBINSON: I want to speak out against the politicalization of the military and to protect the Constitution.LAWRENCE: Robinson also worked in law enforcement. She says the military has a different mission, and mixing the two is dangerous for troops and civilians.ROBINSON: And the lines are being blurred when you just put someone into a position that they're not trained for.ALEX MCCOY: I served under both Republican and Democratic presidents, commanders in chief.LAWRENCE: Alex McCoy is a former Marine.MCCOY: So this is not a partisan issue. This is not a political issue. It's just a matter of protecting our military from getting sucked into divisive internal politics and avoiding situations where American citizens are afraid of men and women in uniform.LAWRENCE: While these vets met with figures from both parties, six Democratic lawmakers put out a video.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KELLY: You can refuse illegal orders.ELISSA SLOTKIN: You can refuse illegal orders.CHRIS DELUZIO: You must refuse illegal orders.SLOTKIN: No one has to carry out orders that violate the law.CHRISSY HOULAHAN: Or our Constitution.LAWRENCE: On social media, President Trump called for the six Democrats to be tried for treason. He reposted a suggestion to hang them. White House adviser Stephen Miller spoke on Fox News.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STEPHEN MILLER: It's a general call for rebellion from the CIA and the Armed Services of the United States by Democrat lawmakers.LAWRENCE: The White House later put out a statement that the president does not want to execute members of Congress. The military swear an oath to the Constitution and are trained that following orders is not a defense for illegal acts. At the moment, there is a debate and lawsuits about whether deploying troops domestically or lethal strikes against alleged drug boats break US or international law.Quil Lawrence, NPR News.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "\n      President Trump met Mayor Elect Zohran Mamdani in the Oval Office after weeks of fiery rhetoric. Mamdani called the meeting productive.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  President Trump met with the New York City mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, in a much-anticipated meeting between the president of the United States and the incoming mayor of the biggest city in the country. It was stunning in how gracious it seemed to be.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We agree on a lot more than I would have thought.SUMMERS: Let's just remember that Trump has called Mamdani his little communist mayor, and Mamdani has described himself as Donald Trump's worst nightmare. NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez joins us now. Hi there.FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: Hey, Juana.SUMMERS: So Franco, was this meeting as dramatic as some people expected it to be considering how heated things have been between these guys?ORDOÑEZ: I mean, I'd say no, obviously, but also kind of yes. I mean, there were no rhetorical bombs thrown. Trump didn't double down on the name-calling. But it was kind of dramatic in how cordial it was. I mean, they spoke of their shared interests and plans to partner on things like lowering the cost of housing and groceries and energy.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: I expect to be helping him, not hurting him - a big help, because I want New York City to be great. Look, I love New York City. It's where I come from.ORDOÑEZ: Mamdani returned the affection. I mean, it was very clear, though, that he was not there to ruffle any feathers.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ZOHRAN MAMDANI: I appreciated the meeting with the president, and as he said, it was a productive meeting focused on a place of shared admiration and love, which is New York City and the need to deliver affordability to New Yorkers.SUMMERS: I mean, Franco, just listening to this, the warmth between them feels a little extraordinary to me.ORDOÑEZ: Yeah, I mean, to me too. I mean, they were all smiles. Trump patted Mamdani on the arm. Even at one potentially tense moment, when a reporter asked Mamdani if he still thought Trump was a fascist, before he could answer, Trump actually jumped in, kind of chuckled and told Mamdani that it was okay to just say yes, that it was easier.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: I've been called much worse than a despot, so it's not that insulting. But maybe - I think he'll change his mind after we get to working together. Yes, please.ORDOÑEZ: But, you know, let's also be clear that this was one meeting. And Trump can be very charming in person, but things can go very sideways and they can go sideways very quickly. And they do really have some big differences. Trump was asked about some of those on immigration and enforcement and crime. And Trump acknowledged that those are differences, while also saying that he expected Mamdani would be a good mayor and that he's likely to surprise some conservatives.SUMMERS: Interesting. I wonder, why is there so much interest in playing nice in this moment? Like, what's really at stake here?ORDOÑEZ: Well, I mean, there's a lot riding on this relationship. I mean, Trump has vowed to pull federal funding from New York City. He's threatened to deploy the National Guard to the city. And as we know, Trump has not shied away from using the powers of the federal government to attack his political opponents. And Mamdani really can't afford that. He can't have Trump having a personal vendetta against New York City.SUMMERS: And what about Trump? Like, what are the politics for him in this situation?ORDOÑEZ: Well, for Trump, he's been struggling in the polls, especially on the economy, and he's been trying to get in on Mamdani's affordability message, which he ran so successfully. Now, Trump won last year on a similar economic message, but he's now been struggling, especially with inflation. So you could make the argument that Trump's kind of trying to ride Mamdani's coattails here on this issue.I mean, interestingly, though, Juana, this new friendliness could also complicate the politics for both sides. I mean, until today, Trump has used Mamdani as a foil, looking to paint him as kind of the face of the Democratic Party, a party full of democratic socialists, he says. And that was likely going to be the key talking point for the midterms. So all this showing of praise really complicates that message, and it raises some serious political challenges for Republicans as they look to next year.SUMMERS: NPR's Franco Ordoñez at the White House.

The Trump administration is snubbing the event over false race-based claims and what it considers the summit's DEI – diversity, equity and inclusion -- agenda. Since returning to office Trump has accused the South African government of confiscating white-owned land and allowing the killing of white Afrikaners.   \"You know we have a G20 meeting in South Africa, South Africa shouldn't even be in the Gs anymore, because what happened there is bad,\" Trump said earlier this month.   \n   The government here has repeatedly tried to correct the U.S. administration, to no avail.   \n   Ramaphosa has kept his cool and was taciturn this week, saying: \"Their absence is their loss.\"   Still, it's a huge blow to South Africa on the global stage.   President Javier Milei of Argentina announced he isn't coming in solidarity with Trump.   The leader of the world's second biggest economy, Chinese President Xi Jinping, is also not attending – though not as a slight – he isn't travelling internationally much these days. Then there's Russian President Vladimir Putin who can't come as he'd face arrest under an International Criminal Court warrant over the war in Ukraine.   William Gumede, an associate professor at Johannesburg's Witwatersrand University, says the summit controversy is a sign of the times.   \"It is symbolic of the fractured global moment that we are in… it's almost an alternative summit without China and without America,\" Gumede told NPR.   The summit's themes of \"solidarity, equality, sustainability\" are anathema to the U.S. administration, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying South Africa is pushing a quote \"DEI and climate change\" agenda.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, center left and a South African official watch the Fire and Ivory Pantsula dance group perform upon his arrival at the OR Tambo International airport in Ekurhuleni on Friday, Nov. 21, 2025 ahead of the G20 leaders' Summit.\n                \n                    MARCO LONGARI/Pool AFP/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        MARCO LONGARI/Pool AFP/AP\n    \n\n   \n   However other countries whose leaders are attending, like Germany, have praised the theme.   U.S. Spat deepens   As foreign leaders like British Prime Minister Keir Starmer started to arrive in South Africa on Friday, the  U.S.-South Africa spat deepened after Ramaphosa said the U.S. had made an eleventh-hour request to send a delegation after all.   \n   \"We have received notice from the United States…about a change of mind about participating in one shape, form or another in the Summit,\" he said. \"We still need to engage with them fully on what their participation at the 11th hour means.\"   However, the South African leader said \"the United States being the biggest economy in the world, needs to be there, so it is pleasing there is a change of approach.\"   White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt hit back angrily.   \"The United States is not participating in official talks at the G20 in South Africa, I saw the South African president running his mouth a little bit against the United States and the president of the United States and that language is not appreciated,\" she said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, left, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at the end of their media conference in Johannesburg, South Africa, Thursday, Nov. 20, 2025.\n                \n                    Themba Hadebe/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Themba Hadebe/AP\n    \n\n   \n   She said because the U.S. is taking over the rotating presidency of the G20 from South Africa, the embassy's chargé d'affaires—seen as a junior official -- would be there for the symbolic hand over.   However Ramaphosa's spokesman said on X, quote \"The president won't hand over to a chargé.\"   One of the big questions is whether the end of the summit on Sunday will result in a joint declaration by the countries in attendance – which the  U.S. is unlikely to sign.   Tensions at home   Aside from the geopolitical wrangling over the event, there has been discontent surrounding the summit from many in South Africa.   Johannesburg residents have complained the city is only getting a cleanup for foreign guests despite having had crumbling infrastructure and chronic electricity and water shortages for years.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Betereinders, a liberal Afrikaner organization, erected a billboard ahead of the G20 Summit showing South Africa's rugby team the Springboks. The quote is from President Trump.\n                \n                    The Betereinders\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        The Betereinders\n    \n\n   \n   \"Oh they are fixing, the traffic lights are up…the grass has been cut, all for? G20... You're showing off for visitors but you have no regard for the people that live in that city,\" journalist Redi Tlhabi said in her popular podcast.   \n   Ahead of the summit, on Friday, thousands of women dressed in black marked a day of action against gender-based violence, staying home from work and peacefully protesting by laying flat in parks and at university campuses.   \n   The group organizing the event, Women for Change, say they wanted to call attention to the high rates of femicide and violence in South Africa as the G20 convenes.   Then there's been the war of the billboards.   Trump's reason for snubbing South Africa has put race relations here in the spotlight and Afrikaners have differed in their responses.   One right-wing Afrikaans rights group, which agrees with Trump that whites are being persecuted, has put up large billboards welcoming G20 delegates to \"the most race-regulated country in the world\" – a reference to affirmative action laws.   In response, a progressive Afrikaner association has mounted their own campaign, with billboards showing the country's beloved rugby team, the Springboks. In the photo, two smiling white Afrikaner players carry their Black captain Siya Kolisi on their shoulders.   \"Terrible things are happening in South Africa,\" reads the tongue-in-cheek tagline on the billboard.\n",

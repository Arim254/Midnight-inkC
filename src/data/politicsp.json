Under the Epstein Files Transparency Act signed by President Trump last month, the attorney general is directed to \"make publicly available in a searchable and downloadable format all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in the possession of the Department of Justice, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and United States Attorneys' Offices\" related to Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell.   More specifically, the law targets the release of information about individuals affiliated with Epstein's criminal activities, any decisions not to charge Epstein and his associates and \"entities (corporate, nonprofit, academic, or governmental) with known or alleged ties to Epstein's trafficking or financial networks.\"   \n   The files include \"more than 300 gigabytes of data and physical evidence\" in the FBI's custody and internal Justice Department records from criminal cases against Epstein. Some files include photos and videos of Epstein's accusers, including minors, and other depictions of abuse that will be withheld.    \n   The text of the law that passed Congress with near-unanimous support also reads that \"no record shall be withheld, delayed, or redacted on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.\"   Ahead of the release, some members of Congress have expressed concern about what may be shared and when. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a co-sponsor of the bill pushing for the release of Epstein files, shared a 14-minute video online Thursday explaining his expectations.   \n            Our Epstein Files Transparency Act is now law. It establishes a December 19 deadline for the Attorney General to release the Epstein files. In this video, I’ll tell you what to expect in advance of tomorrow's statutory disclosure deadline. pic.twitter.com/7aD7q1kyLC— Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) December 18, 2025\n   \n   Massie said that he spoke with lawyers for some of Epstein's victims who allege that \"there are at least 20 names of men who are accused of sex crimes in the possession of the FBI.\"   \"So if we get a large production on December 19th and it does not contain a single name of any male who's accused of a sex crime or sex trafficking or rape or any of these things, then we know they haven't produced all the documents,\" he said. \"It's that simple.\"   \n   While the law gives the Justice Department 30 days after Trump signed it to publish the files, there is notably no mechanism to enforce the deadline or seek punishment if the deadline is not met or if lawmakers argue some redactions are improper.   There's also language in the law that allows redactions for classified national security or foreign policy purposes as well as anything \"that would jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution.\"   Politics at play   But in recent weeks, Trump called on the Justice Department to investigate Democrats and financial institutions that have been mentioned in Epstein's private communications that have been released by the House Oversight Committee, complicating potential disclosures.   The attorney general is supposed to submit to the House and Senate a report listing the categories of records released and withheld, a summary of redactions made and \"a list of all government officials and politically exposed persons named or referenced in the released materials\" without redactions.   House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told reporters Thursday that Democrats \"expect compliance\" with Friday's deadline.   \"But if the Department of Justice does not comply with what is federal law at this point, there will be strong bipartisan pushback,\" he said.   In the meantime, there has been a steady drip of releases by Democrats and Republicans on the House Oversight Committee of documents from Epstein's private files, handed over by his estate under a subpoena.   \n   The way the Trump administration has handled the Epstein files — including downplaying the information for much of the year — means that this release likely won't be the end of the story.   Democrats have used the files and Trump's changing message as one of the few levers of power they have to go after the Republican Party, which controls Congress and the White House.   Before returning to office, Trump and other key figures vowed to release the Epstein files as proof that a cabal of child predators was being protected by the government and working to undermine Trump. Now, some of Trump's base believes that he himself is part of the cover-up.    \n   Throughout all of this, Epstein and Maxwell's accusers say they're disappointed that their allegations of abuse have been used as a political cudgel wielded by politicians in Washington.   \"It's time that we put the political agendas and party affiliations to the side,\" Haley Robson, one accuser, said in a Nov. 18 press conference outside the Capitol. \"This is a human issue. This is about children. There is no place in society for exploitation, sexual crimes, or exploitation of women in society.\"\n",

A deal to sell the American part of the company to a group of U.S. investors was signed on Dec. 18.\n                \n                    Patrick T.

Fallon/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   TikTok has signed a deal to spin-off its U.S. operations to a group controlled by mostly American investors, including software giant Oracle, a company run by billionaire Trump ally Larry Ellison.   TikTok's hyper-engaging algorithm and the massive amount of data the app has collected on millions of Americans is set to be overseen by the new U.S. firm. According to the agreement, TikTok's U.S. algorithm will be retrained with only Americans' data. Content moderation rules around what is permitted and what is not will be set by the new  investor-controlled entity.   Yet the underlying algorithm will still be owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, with the blessing of American auditors, according to an internal TikTok memo reviewed by NPR and two sources familiar with the deal who were not authorized to speak publicly.   \n   \"With an American majority running the content moderation, concerns about foreign propaganda seem to have been alleviated,\" said Anupam Chander, a professor of law and technology at Georgetown University who studies the regulation of new technology. \"But it is possible that the American TikTok might end up censoring or hiding speech that is permissible on the global TikTok platform. I would hope that the U.S. content moderation team would allow speech that the American owners might dislike.\"   \n   Under the terms of the sale, half of the new entity that will control the American version of TikTok will be owned by a consortium of investors including Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake and United Arab Emirates state-backed investment firm MGX. Those three will control 45% of the new U.S. TikTok entity.   Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX did not return requests for comment.   About a third of the newly-formed TikTok operation will be held by existing investors of ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of the video app. And around 20% will be kept by ByteDance.   A seven-member board of directors, most being American, will oversee the new entity, according to the memo, which was first reported by Axios.   The deal caps more than five years of mounting pressure from Washington, where bipartisan concerns about TikTok's ties to China prompted Congress to pass a law in 2024 that would have banned the app unless it was sold.   \n   The law was upheld by the Supreme Court in January. For months, TikTok was technically operating in violation of federal law, but Trump issued a flurry of executive actions to delay enforcement of the law that would have banned the popular video app.   Jim Secreto, former Treasury official who worked on TikTok policy during the Biden administration, said the deal signed on Thuesday does not completely sever ties with ByteDance, something the law Congress passed was intended to set into motion.   \"The law requires a clean break from ByteDance. This structure doesn't meet that standard,\" Secreto said. \"It looks more like a franchise deal that leaves TikTok's core technology in China than a true divestment. By sidestepping the guardrails Congress set, the national security concerns around covert data access and manipulation of the algorithm remain unresolved.\"   The White House declined to comment.   TikTok has an estimated 2 billion users globally, and less than 10% of its worldwide users are based in the U.S.   A new U.S. entity overseeing the American version creates a curious situation for the viral video app: One version of the service will be under the direction of an American-backed company, with additional checks and balances on content flows and data security while a second version of the app, wholly operated by ByteDance, will be available to the rest of the world.   The deal delivers a major win for Larry Ellison, expanding his family's grip on more corners of American media and entertainment.   \n   Ellison is a major backer of Paramount Skydance, a deal that was completed this year.   His son, David Ellison, who is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, has made a hostile bid to take over Warner Bros. Discovery, just as streaming giant Netflix has made its own bid, which top officials at Warner have endorsed.\n",

The Senate voted 67-30 on Wednesday to confirm Isaacman along bipartisan lines. All 30 senators who voted against him were Democrats.   The 42-year-old e-commerce mogul has flown to space twice on private missions — both in partnership with Elon Musk's SpaceX — and in 2024 became the first civilian to walk in space. Isaacman has no federal government experience.   \n   Isaacman was among President Trump's first picks for his second administration: Trump announced his nomination in December 2024, well before his inauguration, and formalized it after taking office in January.   \"Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social at the time.   Isaacman made it as far as a three-hour Senate subcommittee hearing in April, where he downplayed his connections to Musk but declined to answer when asked whether Musk was in the room when Trump offered him the role. Isaacman also expressed support for lunar and Mars missions, saying he believed NASA had the budget to do both.   While NASA is focused on its Artemis mission to return Americans to the moon for the first time since the early 1970s, the second Trump administration has concerned some with its seeming preoccupation with Mars exploration — a riskier and more divisive concept that just so happens to be a longtime dream of Trump's onetime ally, Musk.   \n   But Isaacman didn't get the chance to answer questions about any of that in front of the full Senate, because Trump withdrew his nomination in late May — the same week Musk left his role in the administration.   Trump said the decision followed a \"thorough review\" of Isaacman's \"prior associations,\" and later explicitly blamed his donations to Democratic causes. Public filings show that Isaacman has contributed to candidates and political action committees of both parties over the years, but since 2016 has supported more Democrats.   \n   Isaacman has described himself as \"relatively apolitical\" and a \"right-leaning moderate,\" and noted that his campaign donations were public long before Trump nominated him — suggesting that wasn't the only reason for the reversal. In June, Isaacman said being considered to lead NASA was \"truly the honor of a lifetime.\"   \"Even knowing the outcome, I would do it all over again,\" Isaacman wrote in a letter to investors.   And that's what ended up happening — only the second time, it worked.   Isaacman takes the helm at a turbulent time for NASA   In early November, Trump nominated Isaacman again, without acknowledging the turmoil that had unfolded along the way.   At his confirmation hearing in early December, Isaacman once again denied that his connections to Musk posed a conflict of interest. The nominee explained that his spaceflights were operated by SpaceX because the company is the only option for sending Americans to space since NASA retired its space shuttle program in 2011.   \n   \"In that respect, my relationship [to Musk] is no different than that of NASA,\" he said, adding that \"there are no pictures of us at dinner, at a bar, on an airplane, or on a yacht because they don't exist.\"   Isaacman takes the helm of an agency that has been grappling with a lack of permanent leadership, downsizing, competitive pressure (particularly from China) and significant funding cuts — with threats of more to come.   The administration's 2026 budget proposes a historic 24% cut to overall NASA funding, which would slash its workforce by about a third and spell the end of 41 science projects.   In recent months, protesters have descended on Capitol Hill to lobby against the proposed budget cuts. Among them was beloved \"Science Guy\" Bill Nye, the CEO of the nonprofit Planetary Society, who also attended Isaacman's December hearing in a show of support for the nominee. The House and Senate both reject the deepest proposed cuts, but differ in how much funding they think its science budget should get.   \n   A 62-page draft agenda named \"Project Athena,\" which Isaacman defended after it leaked in May, offers clues as to how Isaacman seeks to run NASA: primarily, more like a business.   Its priorities include reorganization \"aimed at reducing layers of bureaucracy,\" putting more astronauts in space more often, playing a larger role in certifying commercial space missions and partnering with industries like biotech and pharma to \"figure out how to extract more value from space than we put in.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Jared Isaacman — pictured before he led the first all-civilian spaceflight in 2021 — has worked closely with Elon Musk's company SpaceX.\n                \n                    Patrick T.

Fallon/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Isaacman's background is in e-commerce and private spaceflight   Isaacman traces his interest in space back to his childhood, when he was inspired by a picture book in his school library.   \n   \"I told my kindergarten teacher I was going to go to space someday,\" he recalled in 2021.   But first, he made it as an entrepreneur. He founded the payment processing firm now known as Shift4 Payments as a teenager out of his parents' New Jersey basement in 1991. The company, which went public in 2020, says it processes payments for 1 in 3 restaurants and 40% of hotels across the U.S.   Isaacman dropped out of high school to pursue his business, but later earned his GED and a bachelor's degree in aeronautics from Embry‑Riddle Aeronautical University. He is a licensed pilot with over 7,000 flight hours, according to his Polaris bio.   He also co-founded a civilian aerobatic display team called the Black Diamond Jet Team, as well as Draken International, which provides tactical fighter aircraft to customers including the military and defense industries. He sold a majority share of it to the investment firm Blackstone Group in 2019 for a reported nine-figure sum.   Forbes values Isaacman's current net worth at $1.2 billion. That fortune has allowed him to pursue his astronaut ambitions, as well as support STEM-related causes (he and his wife have pledged to donate the majority of their wealth to charity).   \n   Isaacman funded and commanded the first all-civilian orbital flight in 2021 — which raised over $240 million for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital — as well as the 2024 Polaris Dawn mission, in which he and crewmate Sarah Gillis became the first civilians to conduct a spacewalk.   Upon his return, Isaacman told NPR's All Things Considered that while Earth looked beautiful from afar, \"looking out into the darkness of space, it was a very unwelcoming feeling that this is a threatening environment for humans.\"   \"We certainly didn't evolve to be here, and if we want to be here, we're going to have to work really hard in order to kind of open up this last frontier,\" he added. \"That was kind of one of the big takeaways I had.\"\n",

He plans to return to the city on Friday.\n                \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. — President Trump will visit Rocky Mount, N.C., on Friday, capping off a week in which his administration has attempted to reassure Americans that the nation's economy is improving.   On Wednesday, the president gave a primetime address stating that the country's current economic woes are due to the policies of former Democratic President Joe Biden.   Earlier this month, Trump visited the swing state of Pennsylvania with a similar message blaming the previous administration for the challenges his administration is currently experiencing and saying that he is igniting an economic turnaround.   This week, a NPR/PBS News/Marist poll found that only 36% of voters approve of Trump's handling of the economy, the lowest mark since the poll started asking the question six years ago.   \n   Other recent polls have shown that Trump is losing popularity with voters in North Carolina, a state he's won in three consecutive presidential elections.   A late November poll from High Point University found that about 60% of North Carolina voters surveyed disapprove of how Trump is addressing inflation, while 52% disapprove of his tariff policies.   Still, Trump is visiting a decidedly purple part of a decidedly purple state in a congressional district recently redrawn by state Republicans to boost their chances of maintaining control of Congress.   And many state residents who voted for Trump in 2024 believe his policies are moving the country in the right direction.   Ronnie Peede, an HVAC technician who was working in downtown Rocky Mount on Thursday, is among those who voted for Trump last year.   \"He wants to get people back to work and get off of government help as much as possible,\" Peede said.   Peede also said while HVAC prices initially started rising after the Trump administration implemented tariffs, he thinks they have started to level off now and even drop in some cases.   Up the street from where Peede was working, Jonathan Sutton was tending to clients inside his barbershop on Thursday.   Sutton, a Democrat, said he has seen higher prices on some of the clippers and blades he orders from Europe and believes this is due to Trump's tariffs. But he doesn't necessarily blame the president for broader inflation.   \n   \"I think prices just go up, period. Since I've been alive, I don't remember a time when prices went down,\" Sutton said.   Sutton added that he thinks Trump is \"insensitive\" in how he talks to and about people, adding, \"for a president, it's kind of rough.\"   Sutton referred to Trump's recent remarks about Hollywood director Rob Reiner who was killed along with his wife, Michele, and what Sutton considers xenophobic comments about Somali immigrants.   All eyes on North Carolina's 2026 midterm elections   Trump's visit to Rocky Mount will take place just hours after the state's filing period for the 2026 elections closes, with highly competitive races expected in both the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate.   North Carolina will be home to one of the country's most-anticipated U.S. Senate races next year. The race is one of the few happening in a swing state, with Democratic and Republican voter registrations almost evenly split here. North Carolina voters have also shown a willingness in recent elections to split their tickets.   Former two-term Gov. Roy Cooper is expected to secure the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate race. Both times Cooper was elected governor in 2016 and 2020, Trump was also on the ballot.   Amongst the GOP primary candidates so far in the U.S. Senate race, Trump has endorsed Michael Whatley, a former Republican National Committee chairman, but former U.S. Navy JAG officer Don Brown and one-time state superintendent candidate Michele Morrow are both trying to stake out positions to Whatley's right.   North Carolina became the first swing state to draw new congressional districts amid a nationwide arms race between Republicans and Democrats to secure additional seats ahead of next year's midterm elections.   Rocky Mount itself is the largest city in the state's 1st Congressional District. State Republicans redrew that district and the neighboring 3rd Congressional District in an effort to give House GOP candidates an advantage in both. Using results from the 2024 presidential election, Republicans swapped 10 counties between the 1st and 3rd districts to increase the proportion of voters with a history of casting their ballot for GOP candidates in the 1st district.   \n   U.S. Rep. Don Davis, a moderate Democrat, won the seat twice in a row. Black Democrats have held the seat since 1992.   When Eva Clayton won the district in 1992, it marked the first time that North Carolina had elected a Black person to Congress since Reconstruction. In each election since, a Black Democrat has won the seat.   When voting rights groups challenged new maps in court earlier this year, they said the new district would dilute the influence of Black voters. But a panel of three federal judges ruled that the maps were intended to take power away from Democratic voters. Both North Carolina courts and the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in recent years that they will not overturn maps on the basis of partisan gerrymandering.   \n   As of Thursday evening, four Republicans have filed to run in the 23-county district. Trump has not yet made an endorsement in the primary, even as several GOP candidates have touted their allegiance to the president.   Peede, the HVAC technician, says he's unaffiliated but typically votes in Republican primaries. If Trump endorses in the state's 1st Congressional District primary, Peede said he would take it into consideration but also vet the candidates for himself.   \"I still like to look at the candidates to see what they stand for,\" he said. \"So it's not just because Trump said it. I mean, Trump's not perfect.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      In recent elections, some Latino voters are shifting away from the Republican Party. Those votes helped flip seats in Virginia and could be an important factor in next year's midterm elections.   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger is not the only Democrat who flipped a seat in Virginia's elections this year. Democrats also won in other local elections, including by big margins in areas with significant numbers of Latino voters. Now, that's a big change from the 2024 presidential election, when those same parts of Virginia shifted slightly toward Republicans. Margaret Barthel of member station WAMU reports on what's behind those changing margins.MARGARET BARTHEL, BYLINE: Virginia's House of Delegates District 22 is about an hour west of D.C., where suburban sprawl gives way to farms. It's a political battleground. President Trump won it in 2016 and lost it to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris in 2024 by about a single point.Last month, though, the margin between the political parties looked different. Delegate-elect Elizabeth Guzman, a Democrat, won the seat by 10 percentage points, ousting incumbent Republican Ian Lovejoy, a moderate conservative. Guzman thinks part of the reason for her win is the district's Latino voters - some of whom supported President Trump just last year - are now wary of giving their vote to a GOP candidate again. That's something she heard out door-knocking.ELIZABETH GUZMAN: The first thing, they would look at me, it's like, you a Republican or Democrat? And I said, I'm a Democrat. OK, because we don't want to vote for any more Republicans anymore. They betrayed us and we are not happy.BARTHEL: Data shows 14% of the population here identifies as Hispanic. The shifting opinion Guzman heard on the campaign trail is reflective of what happened in other major races in November, and it comes at a moment when 70% of Latinos disapprove of the job Trump is doing. That's according to a recent Pew Research poll.GUZMAN: No. 1, we are under attack here.BARTHEL: Guzman, who is a social worker in her day job, says the Trump administration's aggressive approach to immigration enforcement is causing widespread fear where she lives, including in her own family. She said she'd made sure that her kids had real IDs to prove that they are citizens if they get stopped by ICE. Republicans ignore those worries at their own peril, she says.GUZMAN: Our president is hurting the country and is hurting us. And none of them wanted to recognize that.BARTHEL: In neighboring Loudoun County, voter Jose Ramiro Cruz has similar concerns.JOSE RAMIRO CRUZ: I am really upset about the label that we Latinos have been given in terms of being criminals or being, you know, uneducated and all that.BARTHEL: Cruz said he volunteered this year for Democrats because of his anger at Republicans for that rhetoric. He's also worried about the economy. Marvin Hernandez managed the Virginia campaign for CASA in Action, a progressive national political group that organizes Black and Latino voters.MARVIN HERNANDEZ: We came across some voters that they said, they stated - right? - I voted for Trump 'cause I thought that the economy will improve. But that hasn't changed.BARTHEL: Hernandez said CASA in Action and other Democratic-aligned groups capitalized on voter frustrations with Trump, spending money on Spanish-language ads. Srilekha Palle, a conservative political consultant in Northern Virginia, admits that investment paid off.SRILEKHA PALLE: I think what Democrats does well is they would go to, let's say, Telemundo and advertise like there is no other day. Republicans will not even have one ad in there.BARTHEL: She says her own party missed an opportunity to emphasize Virginia's economic strength under a Republican governor. Sam Shirazi, a Virginia political analyst, points out Democrats' focus on affordability as the core of their campaign comes just a year after Republicans did the same thing to win the presidential race.SAM SHIRAZI: We're kind of entering an era where perhaps some of those voters will go back and forth and they aren't necessarily loyal to either party.BARTHEL: But for now, Shirazi said the swing left among Latino voters in Virginia is a warning sign for Republicans in the midterms next year.For NPR News, I'm Margaret Barthel in Arlington, Virginia.(SOUNDBITE OF TENDAI SONG, \"TIME IN OUR LIVES\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "\n      In a primetime address Wednesday, President Trump said the nation is on the brink of an economic boom and claimed prices are falling quickly, even as affordability remains a top concern for voters.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  In a defensive and boastful address to the nation Wednesday night, President Trump insisted that the U.S. is poised for an economic boom and said that high prices are falling.MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  He blamed his predecessor and immigrants for many of the country's problems. The speech comes as a majority of voters say they are not feeling the economic relief Trump promised in his campaign and touted in his speech. Recent polling shows Trump's rating on the economy is historically low and high prices remain a top concern.FADEL: With us to talk this through is NPR White House correspondent Deepa Shivaram. Hi, Deepa.DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning.FADEL: OK. So what did the president say to try to counter how Americans are feeling about high costs?SHIVARAM: Well, his message overall is essentially telling people to just hang on and wait. He says costs of goods like gas are going down, and he said the administration is, quote, \"making progress\" on lowering other costs, but \"it's not done yet.\"(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You will see in your wallets and bank accounts in the new year, after years of record-setting falling incomes, our policies are boosting take-home pay at a historic pace.SHIVARAM: In other words, the policies that he passed this year will have benefits next year, things like the big tax cut bill, which includes things like no taxes on tips or overtime. He also said families will see a larger tax refund next year. He also touted what he said was an $18 trillion investment in the U.S. from foreign countries. Though his own White House website puts that tally at a little more than half of that.FADEL: I mean, the message to tell Americans, oh, you can't feel it but just have patience. The economy is pretty good. I mean, that's something that we heard from the Biden administration. That's what they tried to do, and that didn't really work, right?SHIVARAM: Yeah. It's a familiar message - right? - telling people that they will feel it in their pocketbooks just later is a complicated place for Trump to be in heading into a midterms year. A recent poll from NPR-PBS News-Marist just said that 36% of Americans approve of Trump's handling of the economy. That's a new low. So he's clearly trying to turn some of these feelings around. He did announce a few new things last night. One is an initiative of paying service members a check of $1,776. The other plan is to come next year on lowering the cost of housing. And I will say just one other major part of his speech was talking about immigration. That's long been an issue he falls back on when other things aren't going well. He tried to tie bad economic feelings to illegal immigration. He said migrants were the reason housing costs have gone up, but of course, housing prices fluctuate based on a number of factors and can't be pinned down to just blaming immigrants.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: The worst thing that the Biden administration did to our country is the invasion at the border. The last administration and their allies in Congress brought in millions and millions of migrants and gave them taxpayer-funded housing, while your rent and housing costs skyrocketed.SHIVARAM: So that message of attacking immigrants and Democrats, you know, that's something we've heard from Trump again and again, and it's possible that stays part of his economic messaging.FADEL: I mean, on that note, why don't we take a step back here and talk about his overall address last night? It comes at a time the president is seeing lower approval ratings, a lot of criticism over Venezuela, his reaction to the killing of filmmaker and actor Rob Reiner, the issue of affordability. What was his big message to Americans?SHIVARAM: Yeah. I mean, this sounded like a pretty typical Trump address in a lot of ways. It was a long list of everything he seems to think his accomplishments are, all of that tacked together, everything from claiming that he's ended eight wars this year to showing off tariff policy. He ended his remarks saying that the country is doing better than ever, which is a definite contrast to polling that shows that Americans are worried about the future and the direction of the country. His response to things when, you know, they aren't going in his favor is usually to dig his heels in deeper. So as all of these criticisms, like you mentioned, of his rhetoric in these recent weeks have ramped up and his approval numbers fall, he's trying to paint a different picture of the last 11 months, saying that they have just been stellar and that only he could bring about what he says is a strong nation.FADEL: That's NPR's Deepa Shivaram. Thank you, Deepa.SHIVARAM: Thanks.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Today's top stories   President Trump insisted that the U.S. is poised for an economic boom during a prime-time address to the nation yesterday. He said that high prices are decreasing and attributed many of the country's problems to his predecessors and immigrants. This message comes as Trump's rating on the economy is historically low, and high prices remain a top concern, according to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump addresses the nation from the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Dec. 17, 2025.\n                \n                    Doug Mills/Pool/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Doug Mills/Pool/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 The president essentially asked people to wait because his policies, which he passed this year, will have benefits in the new year, NPR's Deepa Shivaram tells Up First. Trump said families will see a larger tax refund next year. He also announced an initiative that would pay service members $1,776 and an upcoming plan to help lower the cost of housing. Shivaram said that overall, it sounded like a pretty typical Trump address, which included a long list of everything he sees as his accomplishments, all tacked together.   The House of Representatives voted yesterday on a Republican-led health care plan that did not include extending enhanced health care subsidies. Over 20 million Americans rely on the subsidies that are set to expire at the end of this month. Several Republicans went against party leadership and joined Democrats to force a vote on a three-year extension of the subsidies.    \n   🎧 The House speaker now has a decision to make on whether to move the vote sooner, NPR's Barbara Sprunt says. If the vote doesn't happen by the end of this week, it won't take place until next year, as lawmakers are leaving for the holidays. Sprunt says some Republicans could be shifting their stance on these subsidies because next year is a midterm year. Lawmakers recognize what is important to their constituents — in this case, the impact of expiring subsidies on insurance premiums.   Trump has ordered a ban on all sanctioned oil tankers traveling to and from Venezuela. This threat of a partial blockade escalates the administration's pressure campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. It also sparks the question of whether the two countries are inching closer to direct military conflict.    🎧 A full blockage is considered an act of war, but the Trump administration appears to be targeting only tankers already on the sanctions list, according to NPR's Greg Myre. For years, the U.S. has been sanctioning \"ghost ships,\" which are tankers that attempt to disguise their identities and locations in an effort to evade U.S. and Western sanctions. This latest move could prove to be a major blow to Venezuela, as the country is heavily dependent on oil exports. A fully loaded large tanker carries over $100 million worth of oil. If the U.S. seizes a number of ships, it could possibly scare away non-sanctioned tankers who may decide it's not worth the risk.   \n   Deep dive   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Ailsa Ostovitz, left, and her mother, Stephanie Rizk, at their home in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C.

The teachers did so despite numerous studies highlighting that these tools lack reliability. Popular detectors like Turnitin, GPTZero and Copyleaks misidentified some things as AI that weren't, and vice versa, according to findings by Mike Perkins, a leading researcher on academic integrity and AI at British University Vietnam. Their accuracy rates plummet even further when users manipulate the AI test to appear more human. Despite these challenges, NPR found that school districts across the U.S. spend thousands of dollars on these tools.    ➡️ John Grady, a language and literature teacher, uses AI detection tools as a starting point to initiate conversations with students about AI use.➡️ Grady says he scans all essays with GPTZero, and if the tool flags a 50% likelihood of AI use, he digs deeper by using revision history tools to measure writing time and edit counts. If a student submits work with few edits and minimal time writing, he will conduct a check-in.➡️ High school student Zi Shi, whose first language is Mandarin, fears that AI software will flag his work due to his writing style and his limited English vocabulary.

On Cyber Monday, consumers financed a record $1 billion in online purchases through this payment option, according to Adobe Analytics data. Adobe projects that by the end of the season, that figure will jump to $20.2 billion, up 11% from last year. BNPL allows shoppers to purchase goods instantly through lenders like Afterpay and Klarna, and pay them back over time. However, like any form of credit, it comes with drawbacks. Finance experts shared with Life Kit tips on how to use BNPL responsibly. Here is some of the guidance provided to help you protect yourself from risk:    \n   💲 If you already have credit card debt or cannot afford to cover the payments, be wary of using BNPL.💲 Try to only take these loans from one lender, so all your payment plans are in one place, allowing you to better keep track of payments.💲 Avoid impulse buying just because BNPL is an option. One way to avoid buyer's remorse is to imagine talking with your future self, who is looking at all those bills.   If you are curious to learn more about how BNPL loans work, check out these six pros and cons.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Mary Louise Kelly talks to Virginia's Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger about her priorities and being the first woman to lead the Commonwealth.   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  At 12 noon on Saturday, January 17, Abigail Spanberger will be sworn in as governor of Virginia. In our current era of division, when it can feel hard to get people to agree on anything - and that is before you mention politics - Spanberger won by a double-digit margin. She'll be the first woman to lead the commonwealth, the first mom, and the first Virginia governor to have served as a CIA officer. She joins me now from her transition offices in Virginia. Governor-elect Spanberger, welcome.ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: Thank you so much for having me. I really appreciate it.KELLY: So the last time I interviewed you - I just went and looked - was 2021. Joe Biden was in the White House. You and your fellow Democrats controlled the House...SPANBERGER: Yeah.KELLY: ...Thin margin, but you were in the majority. Y'all were still struggling to advance his agenda, and I remember asking you a pretty blunt question - what do Democrats stand for? How would you answer that question today?SPANBERGER: I'm curious to know how I answered it back then, but I know that...KELLY: Back then, you told me (laughter) - I'm paraphrasing - but you said Democrats need to quit arguing on TV. And then you said, and we need...SPANBERGER: Oh, yeah, that sounds like me (laughter).KELLY: ...We need to do a better job of saying, this is what we're working toward.SPANBERGER: Yeah, so...KELLY: What are you working toward in 2025?SPANBERGER: What I'm working towards - I mean, I think this is the most central thing. What I'm working towards is delivering a Virginia that is ultimately more affordable. It's contending with the issues that matter to voters, to Virginians, to small businesses, to small business owners, to family farmers, to communities across our commonwealth. You know, we - like so many places across the country - are impacted by, you know, worry about affordability, housing supply that is causing costs to go up for families to rent a home, to buy a home. Here in Virginia, the cost of buying a house has gone up 18% over the last four years, 14% over the last four years to rent a home. And that has a real impact.And so what I am for is contending with and making progress on - and, you know, frankly, also being honest with voters and with Virginians - we cannot fix every problem. There's no kind of one single lever to pull. If there were, we would have pulled it a while ago. But we need someone who's relentless in bringing together members of our state legislature to pass bills that are going to move us in the right direction, to having an administration where every secretariat is focused on, you know, improving the lives of Virginians and creating opportunity and ultimately, day in and day out, focusing on delivering.KELLY: Just to push you on this, and I know you don't...SPANBERGER: Sure.KELLY: ...Speak for the Democratic Party, but you have served at senior levels in the federal - in Washington and now about to be in Virginia. Has your party figured out what you stand for, as opposed to standing against a lot of President Trump's agenda?SPANBERGER: So this is where I will say, whether people have figured it out or not doesn't matter as much as whether the voters - the people of the country or of individual states - think that we have, right? I mean, I'm a Democrat 'cause I think our policies are better at getting at the issues that matter most to people, helping people, creating opportunity, but...KELLY: But you're speaking to a messaging challenge.SPANBERGER: Yeah. And so if people don't realize it, don't feel it, don't know it, across the country, then I think it's up to every person in elected office or seeking elected office to make clear what they are for. And I do think that there is a lot of room for improvement in many places across the country, without question.KELLY: I mentioned, Abigail Spanberger, you're the first woman to be elected governor of Virginia. For years, every time I interview a woman who's the first woman to hold a position, I ask about it, and I always think I so look forward to when I get to stop asking this question because we've reached a...SPANBERGER: Yeah.KELLY: ...Day when it's utterly normal for women to be amply represented in positions of leadership. Are we close? How far off is that day?SPANBERGER: I think it's closer than it was. It's closer than it was two months ago, I'll say that.KELLY: (Laughter) Right.SPANBERGER: You know? And I think it's every bit of progress because every example of leadership and of what, you know, different styles can be, who can be in positions of leadership, every example that, you know, that the next generation sees is helpful. And, you know, I would note not only certainly was I elected but we elected a woman as our lieutenant governor. We flipped 13 seats in the General Assembly. The majority of them were also women candidates who flipped those seats.And so I think what's exciting for me is to hear from people who say things like, you know, I brought my daughter here. I brought my granddaughter here so that they can see you speak. Or, you know, yesterday, there was a teenage girl who said, oh, my goodness, my grandpa loves you. I was at an event. And I think that we are much, much closer, and we get ever closer to having, you know, those very boring and very normal interviews that you look forward to having with just yet another woman governor...KELLY: Yet another woman governor...SPANBERGER: ...Or yet another...KELLY: ...How boring is that?SPANBERGER: ...Woman.KELLY: Do you spend...SPANBERGER: Exactly.KELLY: ...Much time thinking about it?SPANBERGER: I actually find it really, really heavy to think about. So the short answer is, I don't spend that much time thinking about it because then it leads me to the next place of, well, then how do I ensure that everything I do is setting a good example? From, of course, the good policies I put forth, but the way I give a speech, to the way I present myself, to the way I, you know, speak about every aspect of what led me here, or who I am, or what I want to achieve.But I do recognize the example and the permission structure. There was a group of teenagers I saw yesterday, which is why I have multiple teenage girls on my mind, and another one said to me, she said, I'm going to follow in your footsteps, and I'm going to be president, she said. And so I looked at her. I said, OK, well, remind me your name. And she said her name, and I said, OK, well, I'll remember that for when I'm bubbling you in...KELLY: (Laughter).SPANBERGER: ...On my presidential ballot, right?KELLY: Yeah.SPANBERGER: And I don't know that she would have had that same conversation with, you know, a man who happened to be the governor-elect.KELLY: Abigail Spanberger - Democrat, former member of Congress, former CIA officer and now governor-elect of Virginia - thank you.SPANBERGER: Thank you for having me.KELLY: And you can hear our full conversation on next week's episode of our national security podcast Sources & Methods. We'll include that other piece of her resume, the ex-CIA piece.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)SPANBERGER: I loved it. I was a case officer. I was undercover my whole time at the agency. I later got my employment declassified.KELLY: That episode with governor-elect Spanberger drops on Monday. You'll find it wherever you get your podcasts.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

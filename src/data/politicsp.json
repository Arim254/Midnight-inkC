But the death toll in the protests has grown, while 2,600 others have been detained, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.   Meanwhile, Iran's parliament speaker warned the U.S. military and Israel would be \"legitimate targets\" if America strikes the Islamic Republic, as threatened by President Donald Trump. Qalibaf made the threat as lawmakers rushed the dais in the Iranian parliament, shouting: \"Death to America!\"   \n   Those abroad fear the information blackout will embolden hard-liners within Iran's security services to launch a bloody crackdown, despite warnings from Trump he's willing to strike the Islamic Republic to protect peaceful demonstrators.   \n   Trump offered support for the protesters, saying on social media that \"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!\" The New York Times and Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous U.S. officials, said on Saturday night that Trump had been given military options for a strike on Iran, but hadn't made a final decision.   The State Department separately warned: \"Do not play games with President Trump. When he says he'll do something, he means it.\"   Parliament rallies   Iranian state television broadcast the parliament session live. Qalibaf, a hard-liner who has run for the presidency in the past, gave a speech applauding police and Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, particularly its all-volunteer Basij, for having \"stood firm\" during the protests.   \"The people of Iran should know that we will deal with them in the most severe way and punish those who are arrested,\" Qalibaf said.   He went on to directly threaten Israel, \"the occupied territory\" as he referred to it, and the U.S. military, possibly with a preemptive strike.   \n   \"In the event of an attack on Iran, both the occupied territory and all American military centers, bases and ships in the region will be our legitimate targets,\" Qalibaf said. \"We do not consider ourselves limited to reacting after the action and will act based on any objective signs of a threat.\"   It remains unclear just how serious Iran is about launching a strike, particularly after seeing its air defenses destroyed during the 12-day war in June with Israel. Any decision to go to war would rest with Iran's 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.   The U.S. military has said in the Mideast it is \"postured with forces that span the full range of combat capability to defend our forces, our partners and allies and U.S. interests.\"   Protests in Tehran and Mashhad   Online videos sent out of Iran, likely using Starlink satellite transmitters, purportedly showed demonstrators gathering in northern Tehran's Punak neighborhood. There, it appeared authorities shut off streets, with protesters waving their lit mobile phones. Others banged metal while fireworks went off.   Other footage purportedly showed demonstrators peacefully marching down a street and others honking their car horns on the street.   In Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city, some 725 kilometers (450 miles) northeast of Tehran, footage purported to show protesters confronting security forces. Flaming debris and dumpsters could be seen in the street, blocking the road. Mashhad is home to the Imam Reza shrine, the holiest in Shiite Islam, making the protests there carry heavy significance for the country's theocracy.   Protests also appeared to happen in Kerman, 800 kilometers (500 miles) southeast of Tehran.   Iranian state television on Sunday morning took a page from demonstrators, having their correspondents appear on streets in several cities to show calm areas with a date stamp shown on screen. Tehran and Mashhad were not included. They also showed pro-government demonstrations in Qom and Qazvin.   \n   Khamenei has signaled a coming clampdown, despite U.S. warnings. Tehran escalated its threats Saturday, with Iran's attorney general, Mohammad Movahedi Azad, warning that anyone taking part in protests will be considered an \"enemy of God,\" a death-penalty charge. The statement carried by Iranian state television said even those who \"helped rioters\" would face the charge.   More demonstrations planned Sunday   Iran's theocracy cut off the nation from the internet and international telephone calls on Thursday, though it allowed some state-owned and semiofficial media to publish. Qatar's state-funded Al Jazeera news network reported live from Iran, but they appeared to be the only major foreign outlet able to work.   Iran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, who called for protests Thursday and Friday, asked in his latest message for demonstrators to take to the streets Saturday and Sunday. He urged protesters to carry Iran's old lion-and-sun flag and other national symbols used during the time of the shah to \"claim public spaces as your own.\"   Pahlavi's support of and from Israel has drawn criticism in the past — particularly after the 12-day war. Demonstrators have shouted in support of the shah in some protests, but it isn't clear whether that's support for Pahlavi himself or a desire to return to a time before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.   The demonstrations began Dec. 28 over the collapse of the Iranian rial currency, which trades at over 1.4 million to $1, as the country's economy is squeezed by international sanctions in part levied over its nuclear program. The protests intensified and grew into calls directly challenging Iran's theocracy.\n",

The large-scale strikes, conducted by the U.S. alongside partner forces, occurred around 12:30 p.m. ET, according to U.S. Central Command. The strikes hit multiple Islamic State targets across Syria.   Saturday's strikes are part of a broader operation that is part of President Donald Trump's response to the deadly ISIS attack that killed Sgt. Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar, Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard, and Ayad Mansoor Sakat, the civilian interpreter, in Palmyra last month.   \n   \"Our message remains strong: if you harm our warfighters, we will find you and kill you anywhere in the world, no matter how hard you try to evade justice,\" U.S. Central Command said in a statement Saturday.   A day earlier, Syrian officials said their security forces had arrested the military leader of IS's operations in the Levant.   The U.S. military said Saturday's strikes were carried out alongside partner forces without specifying which forces had taken part.   The Trump administration is calling the response to the Palmyra attacks Operation Hawkeye Strike. Both Torres-Tovar and Howard were members of the Iowa National Guard.   It launched Dec. 19 with another large-scale strike that hit 70 targets across central Syria that had IS infrastructure and weapons.   The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces has for years been the U.S.'s main partner in the fight against IS in Syria, but since the ouster of former Syrian President Bashar Assad in December 2024, Washington has increasingly been coordinating with the central government in Damascus.   Syria recently joined the global coalition against IS.\n",

Some Americans are making big leaps to manage the cost of health care.\n                \n                    Anton Pentegov/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anton Pentegov/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   When he stops to think about it, Mathew says, his situation feels kind of ridiculous.   \"I find myself in the middle of some sort of rom-com plot,\" he says. \"For me to be able to see my doctor to tend to my autoimmune disease, I had to marry my best friend — it's like some weird twisted plot of Will and Grace.\"   Mathew asked NPR not to use his full name because he fears repercussions from his health insurance company if it finds out he got married to obtain coverage.   He is not the first American to marry for health insurance, and he won't be the last. Especially before the Affordable Care Act, marriages, delayed divorces and job decisions were often tied to private health insurance, since it could only be obtained if you had a job with benefits.   \n   But his decision was forced by the cost crisis facing many of the roughly 24 million people who get their health care via Affordable Care Act marketplaces. Enhanced subsidies that made plans affordable for many people expired at the end of 2025 and Congress failed to extend them before the 2026 plan year. Millions of people face untenable monthly premium prices — as much as the cost of a mortgage for some families.   Congressional lawmakers are back at the table working toward a deal that could revive the enhanced subsidies. In the meantime, some have decided to forgo insurance or make drastic changes to their lives to stay insured, like Mathew.   \"I couldn't afford to wait for Congress to make up their minds and come to an agreement,\" he says.   \n   \"That's so weird\"   Mathew is 40 years old and lives in a small town in Michigan. He loves his job, but the company is too small to offer health coverage, and he has an auto-immune condition that requires medication transfusions. For several years, he's relied on the Affordable Care Act for coverage. He liked his plan, and his $181 monthly premium for 2025 was manageable for him.   Then, in the summer, Mathew started to get nervous.   \"I started seeing things about — what's going to happen when these subsidies lapse for the ACA in the marketplace?\"   \n   When the enhanced subsidies expired at the end of the year, his premium would go up to over $427 a month, \"which was just not an expense I could manage.\"   Enter Christina, Mathew's roommate and best friend of 25 years. \"We met when we were in eighth grade and when we both moved out of our family homes, we moved in together and we've lived together ever since,\" he says.   They're basically platonic life partners, he says. So as he was weighing what to do about his insurance, one night, she turned to him.   \"She's like, I have great insurance — why don't we get married?\" he says. \"And I said, 'Well, that's so weird because I'm gay.'\"   He remembers her responding: \"It wouldn't change anything between us other than a piece of paper and we're making sure that you have what you need.\"   He said he really wasn't sure at first. \"I've always been kind of like a romantic, and I've always envisioned myself getting married to a man,\" Mathew says.   They had a lot of discussions, a lot of talking things through with therapists. \"We both came to the realization — there's nothing really phony about our marriage other than the fact that we're not romantic and we were not physical with each other,\" he says. \"We share the burdens of day to day life and we have for over 15 years of living together and 25 years of friendship.\"   So they did it. In late September, they had a small ceremony at a local church, with both sets of parents and two friends. \"Ultimately, I have no regrets,\" he says.   Many reasons for marriage   Marrying for benefits used to be more common, says Erin Fuse Brown, health law professor at the Brown University School of Public Health, although she notes there are no hard numbers of how many people do it.   \n   \"With the advent of the Affordable Care Act, this question faded to some degree because there were better options for someone who didn't have access to employer-sponsored coverage to get covered in an affordable way,\" she says. \"With the expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits, we're now starting to slowly walk back toward a pre-ACA world.\"   Marriage for benefits is not against the law, Fuse Brown notes.   \"If you say this person is your partner, it's not the job of the HR department — or the law — to question: how sincere is this person's marriage?\" she says. \"People get married for a whole bunch of reasons that are non-romantic — they could be economic, they could be practical, they could be childrearing, there could be any number of reasons.\"   Mathew's new health plan through Christina's job started in January, and it costs $121 per month, not too different than his subsidized ACA premium.   Now, he's scrambling to get his care up and running under the new insurance. \"I have been in a mad dash of securing referrals and prior authorizations to be able to get my medication in two weeks time,\" he says.   It frustrates Mathew to find himself in this situation. He liked his Affordable Care Act plan and believes in it. He's still hoping Congress makes a deal. Not everyone, he says, has a best friend they can marry to get affordable health insurance.\n",

At least 1,000 events across the U.S. were planned for Saturday and Sunday, according to Indivisible, a progressive grassroots coalition of activists helping coordinate the movement it calls \"ICE Out For Good Weekend of Action.\"   Leah Greenberg, a co-executive director of Indivisible, said people are coming together to \"grieve, honor those we've lost, and demand accountability from a system that has operated with impunity for far too long.\"   \n   \"Renee Nicole Good was a wife, a mother of three, and a member of her community. She, and the dozens of other sons, daughters, friends, siblings, parents, and community members who have been killed by ICE, should be alive today,\" Greenberg said in a statement on Friday. \"ICE's violence is not a statistic, it has names, families, and futures attached to it, and we refuse to look away or stay silent.\"   Large crowds of demonstrators carried signs and shouted \"ICE out now!\" during protests across Minneapolis on Saturday. One of those protesters, Cameron Kritikos, told NPR that he is worried that the presence of more ICE agents in the city could lead to more violence or another death.   \"If more ICE officers are deployed to the streets, especially a place here where there's very clear public opposition to the terrorizing of our neighborhoods, I'm nervous that there's going to be more violence,\" the 31-year grocery store worker said. \"I'm nervous that there are going to be more clashes with law enforcement officials, and at the end of the day I think that's not what anyone wants.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Demonstrators in Minneapolis on Saturday.\n                \n                    Sergio Martínez-Beltrán/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Sergio Martínez-Beltrán/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   The night before, hundreds of city and state police officers responded to a \"noise protest\" in downtown Minneapolis. An estimated 1,000 people gathered Friday night, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara, and 29 people were arrested.   \n   People demonstrated outside of hotels where ICE agents were believed to be staying. They chanted, played drums and banged pots. O'Hara said that a group of people split from the main protest and began damaging hotel windows. One police officer was injured from a chunk of ice that was hurled at officers, he added.   Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey condemned acts of violence but praised what he said were the \"vast majority\" of protesters who remained peaceful, during a morning news conference.   \n   \"To anyone who causes property damage or puts others in danger: you will be arrested. We are standing up to Donald Trump's chaos not with our own brand of chaos, but with care and unity,\" Frey wrote on social media.   Commenting on the protests, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told NPR in a statement, \"the First Amendment protects speech and peaceful assembly — not rioting, assault and destruction,\" adding, \"DHS is taking measures to uphold the rule of law and protect public safety and our officers.\"   Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Sunday said the agency was sending \"hundreds more\" federal agents to Minneapolis Sunday and Monday to protect ICE agents.   \"If they [protesters] conduct violent activities against law enforcement, if they impede our operations, that's a crime, and we will hold them accountable to those consequences,\" Noem told Fox News.   Good was killed the day after DHS launched a large-scale immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota set to deploy 2,000 immigration officers to the state.   \n   In Philadelphia, police estimated about 500 demonstrators \"were cooperative and peaceful\" at a march that began Saturday morning at City Hall, Philadelphia Police Department spokesperson Tanya Little told NPR in a statement. No arrests were made.   In Portland, Ore., demonstrators rallied and lined the streets outside of a hospital on Saturday afternoon, where immigration enforcement agents bring detainees who are injured during an arrest, reported Oregon Public Broadcasting.   A man and woman were shot and injured by U.S. Border Patrol agents on Thursday in the city. DHS said the shooting happened during a targeted vehicle stop and identified the driver as Luis David Nino-Moncada, and the passenger as Yorlenys Betzabeth Zambrano-Contreras, both from Venezuela. As was the case in their assertion about Good's fatal shooting, Homeland Security officials claimed the federal agent acted in self-defense after Nino-Moncada and Zambrano-Contreras \"weaponized their vehicle.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Activists participate in a protest prior to a march to the headquarters of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Sunday in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Protests also continued Sunday, including in Atlanta, Washington, D.C., and New York City.   \n   Crowds gathered across the metro Atlanta area, including on the 17th Street bridge, where demonstrators held signs that read \"Stop ICE Terror Now\" and \"ICE out 4 good,\" according to local media reports.   In Washington, D.C., a day after protesters gathered in front of the White House on Saturday, demonstrators marched to ICE headquarters on Sunday. There were no arrests during the protests, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police Department told NPR on Sunday.   A large crowd of demonstrators also marched in New York City on Sunday, according to PIX11.\n",

    "body": "\n      Stephen Miller is largely credited with channeling President Trump's desires and making his vision for the United States real. Ashley Parker, a staff writer for The Atlantic, explains Miller's power within the administration.   \n\n    SARAH MCCAMMON, HOST:  Stephen Miller isn't an elected official, but there are a few people with more power in America today. As the deputy chief of staff for policy and one of President Trump's longest-serving aides, Miller's been the driving force behind many of Trump's core policies. He's the architect of the anti-immigrant crackdown and led the push in ICE recruitment and deployment. And he's been in the spotlight recently as a driving force behind the plan to capture Venezuela's leader, Nicolás Maduro. In a much-circulated interview this week on CNN, Miller said we live in a world, quote, \"governed by strength and force\" and also asserted that Greenland should be part of the United States. Here to help us unpack Miller's influence and direction is Ashley Parker, staff writer for The Atlantic and the lead author on a new piece called \"The Wrath Of Stephen Miller.\" Welcome.ASHLEY PARKER: Thanks for having me.MCCAMMON: Ashley, simply put, how powerful is Stephen Miller in this administration?PARKER: He's incredibly powerful. Steve Bannon and other people jokingly call him the prime minister. And I think the public, in general, especially from the first term, associates Stephen Miller with Trump's hard-line immigration policies. And that's certainly true. He has a big, big hand in immigration. But one thing we were trying to capture with this profile is that immigration is not the only thing that Stephen Miller has his hands in - and not just hands, but has a major, major role on everything from immigration to homeland security to law enforcement in our nation's streets, to foreign policy, to trade and even to education. And a lot of the controversial policies coming out of the administration are either being dreamed up by Stephen Miller or executed by Stephen Miller.MCCAMMON: You spoke with several folks within the administration about Miller's style, and you describe him as, quote, \"the pulsing human id of a president who is already almost pure id.\" What does that mean, Ashley? And how does that style shape the way that the administration is functioning?PARKER: So Stephen Miller, one thing he's very clear about is that he views his job as taking what President Trump wants to do and executing it ruthlessly and urgently. What's interesting is there are areas where Stephen - and Trump has joked about this in public - is far more extreme than even President Trump. And so Stephen, behind the scenes, will very vigorously argue his case, make his points, make his pitch. But once Trump has decided something, he's not like some of the people - especially in the first term, right? - who would tell Trump all the reasons he can't do it or why it's the wrong thing or try to quietly undermine him. Once Donald Trump has decided what he wants to do, Stephen is going to go out there and do it.MCCAMMON: But you talk about Miller as somebody who has very - a very strong point of view. He casts political disagreements as this existential struggle between good and evil, for example. I mean, how much is Miller shaping or trying to shape the president's viewpoint versus reflecting or amplifying Trump?PARKER: Well, again, it's a combination of both, right? For starters, Stephen Miller would not be able to work for someone with whom he was not broadly aligned because one of the things that people told us that they really like about Stephen Miller in the administration - and this might seem a little counterintuitive - is that he's a zealot. They said, we always know where he stands. That said, in some instances, he is more hard-line, especially on immigration, than President Trump is. And in those instances, again, he very intensely and very forcefully makes his case in private. And so I do think there is some shaping of the president there just because we know President Trump is often persuaded by the last person he talked to or by people he talks to frequently. But again, at the end of the day, there have been some disagreements between the two of them, and when there are those disagreements, Stephen Miller does go out and do what the president wants, regardless of his personal views. But there's not that much daylight between them.MCCAMMON: A decade ago, Stephen Miller was a speech writer for Trump. What led to his ascendance between the two Trump administrations?PARKER: I mean, he was still incredibly powerful in the first Trump term. The difference was the same guardrails that kind of constrained President Trump in that first term also constrained Stephen Miller. There were people at the Department of Homeland Security who, when he did something that they felt was too extreme or was morally reprehensible, would not follow through on his directive. And they knew that at the time when John Kelly was leaving that agency, he would protect them. All of those guardrails and all of those people are gone now. And the second thing is, much like this more emboldened, unfettered, unchained President Trump we're seeing now, Stephen Miller underwent the same process. And so he basically spent his four years out of power working quietly and privately to ensure that if he and Trump came back to office, he would have all the levers and tools of the federal bureaucracy at his disposal.MCCAMMON: Before I let you go, Ashley, what is it that you want people to understand about Stephen Miller and about his role in the Trump administration at this moment?PARKER: I think it's important to understand a couple things - how close to the president he is, just how broad his purview is and how he has his hand in policies that people might not expect, like the Trump administration's war against higher education and against Harvard, right? People, again, they think of immigration. They maybe think of foreign policy, but they don't necessarily think of all the other areas where Stephen Miller is playing a role. And I think the other thing that's important to understand about Stephen Miller is he's confided in friends and colleagues that he does like playing this role of the gleeful contrarian or the troll who makes liberals' heads explode. But at this point, the caricature that we see on TV and interviews on CNN and elsewhere has now become his true character. There is not a real difference between public and private Stephen Miller in the intensity of his convictions.MCCAMMON: Ashley Parker is a staff writer for The Atlantic. Her new article is called \"The Wrath Of Stephen Miller.\" Ashley, thanks so much for your time.PARKER: Oh, of course. Thank you for doing this.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Will this year's midterm elections be fair? It seems like a simple question, but many state and local voting officials from both parties are worried about the possibility of federal interference.   \n\n    SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:  Will this year's midterm elections be fair? It's a simple question, but for many state and local voting officials, it has an increasingly complicated answer. That's because of the possibility of interference by the federal government and President Trump. NPR voting correspondent Miles Parks is tracking this issue, and he joins me now. Hi, Miles.MILES PARKS, BYLINE: Hey, Sacha.PFEIFFER: Miles, your reporting shows that voting officials are already preparing for the possibility of federal interference. Tell us about that prep process.PARKS: Yeah. So, I mean, early last year, it became clear to local officials - and I should say, from both parties - that the federal government helmed by President Trump wanted a bigger role in local processes. Just two months into his second term, he signed an executive order aimed at adding new voting restrictions, for instance. Most of that has been blocked by the courts at this point. But he also - his administration laid off much of the election security staff at the Department of Homeland Security. And I was talking about all of that with the secretary of state of Minnesota, Steve Simon, who's a Democrat, and he said the idea of federal interference is on election officials' minds as they game plan out every scenario.STEVE SIMON: We in the election space have to just use our imaginations, as we would, to be clear, for any threat, whether it's from a foreign actor, whether it's a natural disaster that we can't quite predict. This falls into that category, too.PFEIFFER: Miles, it's noteworthy that you have a state voting official there referring to federal government action as a threat, in his words. Did the Minnesota secretary of state say what specifically he's worried about?PARKS: Well, something Simon talked about - and this is also something I've heard from a number of other Democrats that they're concerned about, as well - is the possibility of federal troops being deployed to polling places this year. I asked the White House about this. A spokesperson, Abigail Jackson, referred to these sort of scenarios as baseless conspiracy theories in a statement to NPR, but she didn't categorically rule it out. And the National Guard deployments last year obviously crystallized this as a thing that local officials feel like they need to prepare for, even if this sort of scenario would clearly break federal voting laws. The other possibility that voting officials are talking about is immigration enforcement. It is already illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections, but people in Trump's orbit have toyed with the idea of having ICE agents at polling places or involved in the election in some other capacity to guard against noncitizen voting. And any of these scenarios obviously could potentially have a suppressive effect if they make anyone scared to vote.PFEIFFER: President Trump has talked a lot about wanting to ban mail-in ballots - voting by mail. What power, if any, does he have over the rules of how people will vote this year?PARKS: Essentially none. The Constitution is very clear on this. States set the rules for how their voters vote, and Trump's allies have acknowledged this. But in the fall, Cleta Mitchell, who's a notable far-right election attorney, indicated that Trump could consider a sort of workaround by declaring a national emergency based on election integrity. Here's Mitchell talking on the podcast \"Washington Watch With Tony Perkins.\"(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"WASHINGTON WATCH WITH TONY PERKINS\")CLETA MITCHELL: The president's authority is limited, except that where there is a threat to the national sovereignty of the United States, then I think maybe the president is thinking that he will exercise some emergency powers to protect the federal elections going forward.PARKS: Legal experts I've talked to say there's no way this could actually work in practice, but I have heard from voting officials, including local Republicans, who say they're shoring up their relationships with their local and state attorneys' offices in preparation for the potential of legal fights. They're preparing for the possibility of attempts to access their election equipment. And I'll also note that more than a dozen states are already engaged in lawsuits with the Justice Department over requests the Trump administration has made for their voter data.PFEIFFER: Miles, a bigger picture question. Trump is not on the ballot, of course. Lay out why he's so interested in how local officials conduct elections.PARKS: I mean, at the most basic level, if Republicans lose control of the House of Representatives in midterms, it just becomes very, very difficult for the Trump administration to get anything done legislatively. But this week, Trump also made it clear that his investment in the midterms is personal. He said he thinks that if Democrats win, he will be impeached for a third time. And he's also made it clear that he is willing to mess with the democratic process to advantage himself, right? I mean, we just had the anniversary, the five-year anniversary of January 6 and his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. And even this cycle, we saw Trump spur on this unprecedented mid-decade redistricting. And so for many local election officials, this is not abstract or hypothetical, this idea that Trump would mess with the system to advantage himself.PFEIFFER: That is NPR's Miles Parks. Thanks for covering this, and we'll keep talking throughout the year.PARKS: Thanks, Sacha.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

And counterparts in Illinois, New York, Colorado and Minnesota filed a lawsuit yesterday against the Trump administration for cutting off that money - some $10 billion. And last night, a judge temporarily reinstated that money that the administration says it still wants to freeze while it looks for fraud. Mawa Iqbal from member station WBEZ has some of the reaction from Illinois.MAWA IQBAL, BYLINE: Illinois is no stranger to the Trump administration withholding federal dollars from funding for after-school programming to now social services for lower-income children and families. Democratic Governor JB Pritzker, who's never been shy about his disdain for the president, says this recent freeze, much like the others, is purely political.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JB PRITZKER: They picked five states to cut off funding for. All of them are run by Democratic governors that he doesn't like.IQBAL: The move by the administration comes in response to investigations of social service fraud in Minnesota. Illinois stands to lose funding that would go towards administering the Child Care Development Fund, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and the Social Services Block Grant. And while it's unclear when that money would stop coming in, especially now that the issue is in court, some advocates are already feeling the pressure.IRETA GASNER: There's such an unmet need to really fund early care and learning already on our best day.IQBAL: Ireta Grasner (ph) heads the state policy team at Start Early, an Illinois chapter of the federal Head Start program.GASNER: These kinds of pressures are very real because we have a long way to go to, you know, having more families who really can use these supports at this really critical stage of life.IQBAL: In a letter to Governor Pritzker about the funding cuts, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services says it's concerned about potential extensive and systemic fraud and that it has reason to believe that Illinois is providing aid, quote, \"intended for American citizens\" to those without legal status. HHS is demanding the, quote, \"complete universe\" of documents containing Illinoians' personal information, like Social Security numbers and home addresses. HHS did not respond to requests for comment on the story.KWAME RAOUL: The real motivation behind this action is to punish Democrat-led states.IQBAL: Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul says the claims are cruel and baseless and is why he and his fellow attorneys general are turning to the courts.RAOUL: If the president was serious about rooting out fraud, his administration would be investing more resources in partnering with states and supporting states' efforts to root out fraud and abuse.IQBAL: He says the move would affect more than 150,000 children in the state who rely on these programs for everything from nutrition to child care.RAOUL: The effects of this action are far-reaching and dangerous. For Illinois alone, the president's action threatens around $1 billion that Illinois families and service providers are counting on.IQBAL: Republican leaders in the state haven't come out publicly on either side of the issue, like with many actions the president has taken against the state. A judge has reinstated the funding for two weeks, but a longer court battle is sure to play out over the fate of these programs.For NPR News, I'm Mawa Iqbal in Springfield, Illinois.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

    "body": "\n      A change in U.S. posture, following its military operation last weekend in Venezuela, as President Trumps talks about selling Venezuela's oil and the U.S. taking control of Greenland.   \n\n    SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:  A few days after the United States seized the leader of Venezuela and said it would run the country, President Trump was asked if there were any checks on his power on the world stage. Here's his answer.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: My own morality, my own mind. It's the only thing that can stop.UNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST: Not international law?TRUMP: And that's very good.PFEIFFER: That's from Trump's two-hour interview Wednesday with The New York Times. The U.S. military action against a sovereign nation without authorization or consultation with Congress is a dramatic shift from previous presidential administrations. It also raises questions about what Trump plans to do next. NPR senior national political correspondent Mara Liasson is with us now to talk about that. Good morning, Mara.MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Sacha.PFEIFFER: In recent years and even decades, we've gotten used to the U.S. working with allies, and that clearly did not happen here. What have we learned about how President Trump thinks the U.S. should use military force?LIASSON: This was a week when Trump's worldview came into sharper focus than ever before. You just heard him say that nothing can stop him but his own morality or mind. He also said in that interview that he'll be running Venezuela indefinitely. He said, quote, \"I don't need international law.\" He also said he's not looking to hurt people. And hat stance was previewed earlier in the week by his senior aide Stephen Miller, who was talking to Jake Tapper on CNN. Here's what he said.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STEPHEN MILLER: We live in a world - in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world...JAKE TAPPER: But are you saying that...MILLER: ...That have existed since the beginning of time.LIASSON: But brute power has not been the only ruling force. Since World War II, it's also been alliances and treaties and international rules backed up by the most powerful military in the world. And the U.S. has abided by them. In Europe, NATO has kept the peace for 80 years. That's a historical record. But the Trump administration seems to be marking a shift to a new kind of global balance of power where three aggressive superpowers - China, Russia and the U.S. - control their smaller, weaker neighbors.Donald Trump has talked about taking Greenland, possibly by military force. Greenland is a territory of Denmark, which is a NATO ally. And in that New York Times interview, Donald Trump seemed to acknowledge this. He said, quote, \"it may be a choice,\" unquote, between preserving NATO or getting Greenland.PFEIFFER: Mara, on Venezuela, there was some pushback from U.S. lawmakers. Five Republican senators voted with Democrats to advance legislation that would require Trump to get congressional approval before taking more action in the country. How significant is that pushback?LIASSON: I think it's significant, but that measure is not likely to become law. It is a rare pushback from members of the president's own party, and it prompted Trump to call for all five Republicans who voted with the Democrats to lose their seats. Of those five, only Susan Collins of Maine is up for reelection this year.So Trump does not seem to be in any danger of losing his base or Republican support in Congress over Venezuela. Most polls show Republican voters approve of the operation to get Maduro. It's not clear how they'll feel over time. It depends on if running Venezuela turns into a success or a quagmire.But right now, Donald Trump is extremely confident in his grip on his party. When NBC asked him if his MAGA base - many of whom liked his promise to keep the U.S. out of foreign entanglements - would stick with him, he answered, quote, \"MAGA loves everything I do. MAGA is me. MAGA loves everything I do.\"PFEIFFER: Trump has been talking a lot about Venezuela's oil, essentially coveting that oil, and he met Friday with U.S. oil and gas executives. How did that meeting go?LIASSON: Well, it's really interesting because the president has been very enthusiastic about getting Venezuelan oil. That's one of the reasons he said that they did the incursion into Venezuela. But the executives he met with were not as enthusiastic as he was about going back into Venezuela.Trump says he wants to give some of the oil profits to Venezuela. Some of the profits would compensate American companies who had their assets nationalized two decades ago. And he says the companies are ready to invest a hundred billion dollars. But that's not what we're hearing from the executives. The head of Exxon in that meeting told the president that, at least at this time, Venezuela is, quote, \"uninvestable,\" and major changes would have to happen before Exxon goes back in.PFEIFFER: Mara, in a very different topic, a domestic one, we've been watching, of course, the fallout from the fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen, Renée Good, by an ICE agent in Minneapolis last week. There were protests all over the country yesterday. How much does this incident mark any shift in public sentiment or administration policy?LIASSON: I think it's too early to tell. There have been a lot of concerns expressed, including among people who support ICE's mission, about how these officers operate and when they are sent. Ten thousand new agents were authorized by Congress in that big funding bill. So these are armed agents going into communities that don't want them there, and there are serious questions about the kind of training that these agents are getting as they are flooding into communities around the country. They say they are there to apprehend undocumented immigrants, but now we've seen several incidences of violence and casualties.PFEIFFER: That is NPR senior national political correspondent Mara Liasson.

A spokesperson for the Smithsonian said in a statement to NPR on Sunday that the National Portrait Gallery had begun a planned update of its \"America's Presidents\" gallery, which will include new labels and wall text.   \"For some new exhibitions and displays, the museum has been exploring quotes or tombstone labels, which provide only general information, such as the artist's name,\" the spokesperson said.   \n   The previous portrait label, which is still available on the Smithsonian's website, mentioned Trump's Supreme Court nominations, the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and that he was impeached twice \"on charges of abuse of power and incitement of insurrection\" before being acquitted by the Senate in both cases.   Text accompanying the new portrait identifies Trump's birth year, that he is the 45th and 47th president, the dates of his presidency, and information about the photographer and photograph.   The Smithsonian said other Smithsonian museums such as the National Museum of American History contain information about the history of U.S. presidential impeachments.   News of the omission comes at a tense time for the Smithsonian Institution. In March, Trump signed an executive order aiming to eliminate \"divisive race-centered ideology\" from Smithsonian museums and other cultural institutions, and over the summer the White House ordered a \"comprehensive internal review\" of eight Smithsonian museums, including the National Portrait Gallery.   \n   Trump tried to fire former National Portrait Gallery director Kim Sajet in May, whom he called \"a highly partisan person, and a strong supporter of DEI,\" and Sajet later resigned.   The Smithsonian said Sunday it had previously rotated two photographs of Trump before displaying the new one, which was taken by White House photographer Daniel Torok.   The White House did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment on Sunday.   But White House spokesperson Davis Ingle said in a statement to The New York Times that the new portrait of Trump was an \"iconic photo\" of the president and that \"his unmatched aura will be seen and felt throughout the halls of the National Portrait Gallery.\"   \n   Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives twice during his first term. The 2019 impeachment related to Trump's request that Ukraine investigate the Biden family ahead of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Trump was impeached again in 2021 for inciting an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol after his electoral loss to Joe Biden. He was acquitted in both Senate trials.   In July, the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History also removed references to Trump's two impeachments from an exhibit entitled \"The American Presidency: A Glorious Burden.\"\n",

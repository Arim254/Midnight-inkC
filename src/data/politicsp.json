Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., was rushed by a man during a town hall event Tuesday night and sprayed with a liquid via a syringe.    Footage from the event shows a man approaching Omar at her lectern as she is delivering remarks and spraying an unknown substance in her direction, before swiftly being tackled by security. Omar called on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to resign or face impeachment immediately before the assault.   Noem has faced criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in the aftermath of the fatal shooting of 37-year-old intensive care nurse Alex Pretti by federal officers in Minneapolis Saturday.    \n   Omar's staff can be heard urging her to step away and get \"checked out,\" with others nearby saying the substance smelled bad.    \"We will continue,\" Omar responded. \"These f******* a**holes are not going to get away with it.\"    A statement from Omar's office released after the event said the individual who approached and sprayed the congresswoman is now in custody.    \"The Congresswoman is okay,\" the statement read. \"She continued with her town hall because she doesn't let bullies win.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A syringe lays on the ground after a man, left, approached Representative Ilhan Omar, a Democrat from Minnesota, during a town hall event in Minneapolis, Minnesota, US, on Tuesday, Jan. 27, 2026.

Minnesota strong.— Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) January 28, 2026 \n   \n   As Omar continued her remarks at the town hall, she said: \"We are Minnesota strong and we will stay resilient in the face of whatever they might throw at us.\"    Just three days ago, fellow Democrat Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida said he was assaulted at the Sundance Festival by a man \"who told me that Trump was going to deport me before he punched me in the face.\"    Threats against Congressional lawmakers have been rising. Last year, there was an increase in security funding in the wake of growing concerns about political violence in the country.   According to the U.S. Capitol Police, the number of threat assessment cases has increased for the third year in a row. In 2025, the USCP investigated 14,938 \"concerning statements, behaviors, and communications\" directed towards congressional lawmakers, their families and staff. That figure represents a nearly 58% increase from 2024. \n",

Trump has said the Cuban government is ready to fall, and that the island would receive no more oil shipments from Venezuela after a U.S. military operation deposed former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.   In its deepening energy and economic crisis, Cuba has relied heavily on foreign assistance and oil shipments from allies like Mexico, Russia, and — previously — Venezuela.   Mexico has sought to balance its long-term support of Cuba's government with pressure from Trump for Latin American leaders to fall in line with his vision for the region.   Sheinbaum said Tuesday that Mexico would continue to show solidarity with Havana, but didn't clarify what kind of support Mexico would offer.   Mexico has faced its own pressure from Washington, as Trump has threatened to take military action against Mexican drug cartels.   Mexico last week transferred dozens of suspected cartel members to the United States to face justice. They were sought by the Trump administration, but Sheinbaum used similar language at the time as she did Tuesday, saying the transfers were made on a sovereign and autonomous basis.   \n   Mexican oil has long acted as a key lifeline for Cuba. In its most recent report, Pemex said it shipped nearly 20,000 barrels of oil per day to Cuba from January through Sept. 30, 2025. That month, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Mexico City. Afterward, Jorge Piñon, an expert at the University of Texas Energy Institute who tracks shipments using satellite technology, said the figure had fallen to about 7,000 barrels.   Sheinbaum has spent weeks saying she would provide clear data on exports to Cuba, but has yet to do so. The Cuban government and Pemex did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   Piñon said that while the future of shipments from Mexico remains uncertain, what was clear is that Sheinbaum is \"walking a tightrope\" between her political rhetoric supporting Cuba and upcoming trade agreement negotiations with the U.S.   Analysts now expect further pressure from Washington to halt those shipments more permanently, given Trump's growing demands that Mexico deliver stronger results in the fight against drug cartels.   Meanwhile, dozens of drivers waited hours in long lines — common on the island — to fill up their cars with gasoline, saying they had heard the news. While some said they weren't particularly worried and said they would find a way forward, others expressed deep anxiety over what the future might hold.   Rolando Graña, 40, spent two hours of his day off in a gas line. For the airport employee, it was a hunt for fuel rather than a day of rest.   \"That's going to affect us a lot more now,\" Graña said.\n",

Initial moves involving such mainstay shows as 60 Minutes and the CBS Evening news have sparked dissent inside the newsroom and drawn criticism from journalists outside it.\n                \n                    Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   CBS News Editor-in-Chief Bari Weiss said she will make the news division \"fit for purpose in the 21st Century\" at an all-staff meeting Tuesday,  in which she outlined her strategy.   Weiss announced the hiring of 18 paid commentators — on subjects ranging from national security to health and wellness — as part of an effort to \"widen the aperture of the stories we tell and the voices we listen to.\" They include HR McMaster, who served as national security advisor during the first Trump administration; Reihan Salam, the president of the conservative Manhattan Institute; and the historian Niall Ferguson.    \n   She also cited several new hires who are going to produce original reports from Kyiv, London and New York City with a social media-first approach. And she said she only wants top-flight performers committed to her approach to stick around.    Weiss is expected to make significant cuts to the newsroom, though she did not address them in her remarks.   Weiss has expressed exuberance about the task she confronts at CBS, ranked third behind NBC and ABC, and an eagerness to learn about broadcast news. She has said she wants to appeal to independently minded Americans. And she says the news division has not — until now —addressed the fundamental reasons that she believes it is losing audience: a sharp drop in public trust in the mainstream media and a huge spike in competition for viewers' attention.   \"We all must focus first on what we're building, not what we're maintaining. On how we are going to reach an audience exponentially bigger than the one we have now,\" Weiss said, according to prepared remarks shared by the network with NPR and other outlets. She said that she would do that by \"marrying the journalistic principles that will never change — seeking the truth, serving the public, and ferociously guarding our independence — with the tools that constantly are.\" (The network said Weiss hewed closely to her prepared text.)   \n   \"We can still do what the Wild West of social media cannot,\" she said.    First months marked by controversy   In her brief tenure, Weiss has alienated much of the staff of 60 Minutes, the crown jewel of the news division; sought to reinvent the CBS Evening News; and questioned whether CBS journalists have been fair or worthy of Americans' trust in the past.   This story also draws on interviews with eight current and former CBS News journalists. All of those still at the network spoke on condition they not be named, citing professional repercussions. Several noted that Weiss has told staffers she welcomes internal debate but cannot abide public dissent.   While Weiss has been welcomed by some CBS journalists, including Chief Legal Correspondent Jan Crawford, others have taken issue with her style of leadership and the editorial choices that have followed her arrival.   In addition, liberal critics outside the network have blasted her, alleging that she is doing the handiwork of the networks' owners, who are allies of President Trump and are seeking his blessing in their bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. Weiss has rejected that assertion, though she declined to comment for this story through a spokesperson.   Weiss brought in to reshape CBS News   A former conservative opinion writer and editor for the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, Weiss was hired last fall by Paramount's new controlling owner, David Ellison, to shake up CBS's news division as it came under renewed attack from the Trump administration.   The previous owners of Paramount had paid $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump as a private individual over the editing of a fall 2024 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris. That helped clear the way for approval from Trump's chief broadcast regulator, who additionally secured promises from Ellison of an ombudsman to field complaints of ideological bias.   \n   Paramount also acquired Weiss's center-right digital startup, The Free Press, for $150 million. The Substack views-and-news site has approximately 170,000 paying subscribers and is built on the proposition that most of the mainstream media is reflexively liberal, though it does sometimes offer coverage that is critical of Trump.   She has been personally involved in remapping the CBS Evening News.   Ahead of his debut as the new anchor of the Evening News, CBS's Tony Dokoupil said the press has too often missed the story.   \"Because we've taken into account the perspective of advocates and not the average American. Or we put too much weight in the analysis of academics or elites and not enough on you,\" he wrote in an online post on Jan. 1. \"At certain points, I have been you. I have felt this way too. I have felt like what I was seeing and hearing on the news didn't reflect what I was seeing and hearing in my own life.\"   On Instagram, Dokoupil wrote in response to a critic: \"I can promise you we'll be more accountable and more transparent than Cronkite or any one else of his era.\"   His comment was taken as an affront by some of his colleagues, according to four people at the network's news division. Walter Cronkite, the iconic CBS anchor who narrated the death of President John F. Kennedy, humanity's ascent to the Moon, and the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon for tens of millions of Americans, embodied the definition of the TV news anchor for the modern era.   The internal tensions erupted into public view in December. Less than two days before broadcast, Weiss decided to hold a 60 Minutes story on the alleged abuse of immigrants sent to an El Salvador detention center where the Trump administration sent hundreds of Venezuelan migrants last March.   \n   She said the segment wasn't ready, though it had been reviewed and approved by CBS News lawyers and video excerpts had been released publicly to promote the segment. Weiss later said she would not be rushed into approving it for air.   The incident became public and sparked an enormous outcry. Yet, when the story aired this month, it had not changed appreciably. (The initial version was available from a Canadian distributor that had mistakenly already loaded it for streaming subscribers.)   The story ended up running almost exactly as it had been prepared, with an extra element documenting the written comments of Trump administration officials and CBS's efforts to get them to come on camera for an interview.   According to someone who attended Tuesday's meeting, Weiss conceded making a mistake on the 60 Minutes story, saying she had not understood how the timing of her decision would throw the show into disarray. Yet she did not back down from the merits of her decision, which she grounded in the desire to get a Trump administration official to speak about the matter on camera.   Initial CBS Evening News coverage choices prove divisive    Less well known are some of the incidents involving the Evening News that inspired internal discomfort.   Weiss and top producers had drawn up plan to fly Dokoupil around the country to underscore his desire to talk to Americans outside elite circles in New York, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles.   Yet since Dokoupil's debut in early January, CBS has taken an Evening News segment off the air called \"Eye On America,\" on since 2024, that had been doing just that.   On the first night, executives pulled Dokoupil back to New York City to cover the U.S. seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The second night was Jan. 6 and Dokoupil was in Miami. Major news organizations, including NPR and the New York Times, offered new projects about what had been learned in the five years since the siege of the U.S. Capitol.   \n   Dokoupil offered this scant reference: \"President Trump today accused Democrats of failing to prevent the attack on the Capitol, while House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused the president of 'whitewashing' it.\" The he-said, he-said formulation lasted about 15 seconds.   That prompted denunciations from outside critics. Sarah Longwell, the founder and publisher of the center-right, anti-Trump publication The Bulwark, wrote on X: \"Trump is getting exactly what his rich buddy paid for.\"   Ellison's takeover of Paramount was financed by his father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. The elder Ellison is a Trump adviser who encouraged his efforts to contest the 2020 race.   CBS Justice Correspondent Scott MacFarlane took great exception to Dokoupil's Jan. 6 broadcast, according to two people inside the network who spoke on condition they not be named.   MacFarlane has spent the past five years covering the attack on the U.S. Congress, drawing upon evidence presented in court to document the effort to deny the formal certification of President Joe Biden's win in the 2020 race.   He did not appear on the air on CBS News this Jan. 6. Instead, as he posted on the social media platform X, MacFarlane appeared on the BBC. It lasted nearly four-and-a-half-minutes.   \"Here's my deep dive on the 5-year mark of Jan 6,\" MacFarlane wrote. \"The ongoing impact on victims, the lies... and the continued malignant corrosion of democracy[.] As aired on.... The BBC.\"   At the tail of that night's broadcast from Miami, Dokoupil hailed Secretary of State Marco Rubio as a prominent Floridian in a flippant segment at the end. The anchor noted his key role in the administration — including on Venezuela — and shared AI-generated social media memes envisioning Rubio in a variety of roles, including as a hunter, the Michelin Man, and the leader of Greenland.   \"Marco Rubio, we salute you,\" Dokoupil deadpanned. The light-hearted approach to the minute-long segment so close to the Venezuelan military action delighted the Trump White House and stirred backlash from journalists.   \n   A White House threat over Trump interview   Weiss has personally gotten involved to secure major interviews in her drive for the network to make and break news.   Dokoupil landed several big-name interviews including with Trump and Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth. The Independent reported Hegseth said he only did the interview because Weiss asked. The New York Times posted audio showing that White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt threatened to sue CBS at the end of the interview with Trump if it was not run in full, unedited. Dokoupil said it would.   In a statement, CBS News said the network had already made \"the independent decision to air it unedited and in its entirety.\"   Several current and former CBS journalists pointed to another instance that appeared to pull a punch that could land hard on the Trump administration. Correspondent Nicole Sganga broke down video footage of the deadly shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer. A retired ICE agent who watched the footage frame by frame with CBS said the officer appeared to act improperly.   The segment streamed on the YouTube page of CBS Evening News. But it did not air on the flagship news program.   \"There are always growing pains when you start something new,\" says former CBS News President Andrew Heyward, citing the reinvention of CBS Evening News with Dokoupil as anchor. \"Those growing pains have been exacerbated by today's polarized political atmosphere and execution errors.\"   \"Now comes the hard slog of, day after day, drawing on CBS News's journalistic capacities to do original reporting that delivers real value to the existing audience and attracts new people without chasing away the people who like what they see,\" Heyward says.   Weiss told staffers Tuesday that she's thinking of CBS News as a start-up.   \"If we all do our jobs right, in a year's time CBS News will look very different,\" Weiss said in her prepared remarks. \"But start-ups aren't for everyone. They're places that move at rapid speed. They experiment. They try new things. They sometimes create noise and, yes, bad press!\"   \n   \"If that's not your bag... that's okay,\" Weiss added. \"But if what I'm describing sounds exciting and exhilarating to you... I am here to work very hard alongside you. What I can promise you in return is a common, shared purpose, the freedom to do great work and to see it aggressively promoted, and the stability and support you deserve.\"  \n",

Pretti's death at the hands of immigration officers escalated tensions surrounding the Trump administration's immigration enforcement surge, and has already prompted bipartisan calls for an investigation. Pretti was the second U.S. citizen killed by immigration officers in Minneapolis this month.   According to the preliminary assessment, Customs and Border Protection officers said Pretti resisted arrest before two officers shot him.   \n   But the assessment makes no mention of Pretti attacking officers or threatening them with a weapon — as the administration first described the incident. It also appears to more closely match multiple bystander video and witness testimony of the incident.   The preliminary assessment of Pretti's shooting, known as a death notification, was shared by congressional sources not authorized to speak publicly, and reviewed by NPR. It was based on body-worn camera footage and documentation from the agency, it said.   The CBP assessment describes how officers were initially confronted by two women who were blowing whistles while they conducted an immigration enforcement operation.   \"The [officer] pushed them both away and one of the females ran to a male, later identified as 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a US citizen. The [officer] attempted to move the woman and Pretti out of the roadway. The woman and Pretti did not move,\" the review states, adding that the officer then sprayed both with oleoresin capsicum spray, commonly known as pepper spray.   \n   CBP officers attempted to take Pretti into custody. Pretti resisted their efforts and a struggle ensued, according to the report.   During the struggle, an agent yelled, \"He's got a gun!\" multiple times, the review states.   Approximately five seconds later, one agent discharged his CBP-issued Glock 19 and an officer also discharged his CBP-issued Glock 47 at Pretti. After the shooting, an agent advised that he had Pretti's firearm in his possession, the review states.   Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was quick to describe Pretti's actions as \"domestic terrorism,\" saying Pretti was \"attacking\" officers and \"brandishing\" a weapon before he was killed. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller described Pretti as a \"would-be-assassin.\"   \n   Multiple bystander videos and witness testimony contradict that portrayal of the incident. Pretti can be seen holding only a phone in his hand before at least six officers tackle him, pinning him face down on the ground and shooting him in the back, firing what sounds like 10 shots.   One eyewitness said in a court document that Pretti was not even facing agents when they grabbed him. \"It didn't look like he was trying to resist, just trying to help [a] woman up,\" they wrote.   Noem has come under bipartisan scrutiny for her quick characterization of the incident.   In Washington, Democrats are pushing to block funding for the Homeland Security Department, and several other agencies, after the shooting and the administration's response. Several Republicans, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and John Curtis of Utah, also criticized Noem's immediate effort to blame Pretti, and others called for an investigation.   \n   The assessment of Pretti's death was conducted by an internal Customs and Border Protection oversight office known as the Office of Professional Responsibility; it cautions that any information may be updated as more details come to light.   Homeland Security Investigations, a branch of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is investigating the incident. It's also under review by the Office of Professional Responsibility's Investigative Operations Directorate, which investigates employee misconduct.   The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General was also notified about Pretti's death, according to the assessment.\n",

The case, filed in Massachusetts, is the first lawsuit over the strikes to land in a U.S. federal court since the Trump administration launched a campaign to target vessels off the coast of Venezuela. The American government has carried out three dozen such strikes since September, killing more than 100 people.   \n   Among them are Chad Joseph, 26, and Rishi Samaroo, 41, who relatives say died in what President Trump described as \"a lethal kinetic strike\" on Oct. 14, 2025. The president posted a short video that day on social media that shows a missile targeting a ship, which erupts in flame.   \"This is killing for sport, it's killing for theater and it's utterly lawless,\" said Baher Azmy, legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights. \"We need a court of law to rein in this administration and provide some accountability to the families.\"   The White House and Pentagon justify the strikes as part of a broader push to stop the flow of illegal drugs into the U.S.   \"The October 14th strike was conducted against designated narcoterrorists bringing deadly poison to our shores,\" Anna Kelly, the White House deputy press secretary, said in an emailed statement. \"President Trump used his lawful authority to take decisive action against the scourge of illicit narcotics that has resulted in the needless deaths of innocent Americans.\"   The Pentagon declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying it doesn't comment on ongoing litigation.   \n   Victims' families deny thy presented imminent threat   The new lawsuit described Joseph and Samaroo as fishermen doing farm work in Venezuela, with no ties to the drug trade. Court papers said they were headed home to family members when the strike occurred and now are presumed dead.   \n   Neither man \"presented a concrete, specific, and imminent threat of death or serious physical injury to the United States or anyone at all, and means other than lethal force could have reasonably been employed to neutralize any lesser threat,\" according to the lawsuit.   Lenore Burnley, the mother of Chad Joseph, and Sallycar Korasingh, the sister of Rishi Samaroo, are the plaintiffs in the case.   Their court papers allege violations of the Death on the High Seas Act, a 1920 law that makes the U.S. government liable if its agents engage in negligence that results in wrongful death more than 3 miles off American shores. A second claim alleges violations of the Alien Tort Statute, which allows foreign citizens to sue over human rights violations such as deaths that occurred outside an armed conflict, with no judicial process.   \n   The American Civil Liberties Union, the Center for Constitutional Rights, and Jonathan Hafetz at Seton Hall University School of Law are representing the plaintiffs.   \"In seeking justice for the senseless killing of their loved ones, our clients are bravely demanding accountability for their devastating losses and standing up against the administration's assault on the rule of law,\" said Brett Max Kaufman, senior counsel at the ACLU.   U.S. lawmakers have raised questions about the legal basis for the strikes for months but the administration has persisted.   —NPR's Quil Lawrence contributed to this report.\n",

And Carlson is more than happy to provide his thoughts and his advice,\" Zengerle says. \"That doesn't mean that Trump always takes that advice, and there have certainly been instances where Carlson's been disappointed by some of Trump's decisions, but he seems to have a seat at the table.\"   \n   Carlson got his start in conservative print media and transitioned to TV in the early days of cable news. After he was let go from CNN and MSNBC (now MS NOW), he was hired by Fox, then abruptly fired in 2023. He has since launched a new streaming show on the social media platform X, where he's espoused far-right fringe positions, such the \"great replacement\" conspiracy theory.   \"Since leaving Fox, he doesn't have a built-in audience anymore and he has to navigate the attention economy. And in order to get people to listen to his podcast, I think he has kind of embraced more outrageous views,\" Zengerle says. \"He's saying things before in a more explicit fashion, whereas in the past he tried to modulate his rhetoric a little bit.\"   \n   Zengerle sees the throughline of Carlson's career as a desire for \"fame, fortune and power.\" To that end, he would not be surprised if Carlson ran for office himself.    \"It's a mistake to think of him as just a media figure because I think his ambitions are bigger than that,\" Zengerle says. \"He operates as a political actor, maybe even more than a media actor at this point.\"      Interview highlights    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Hated By All The Right People: Tucker Carlson and the Unraveling of the Conservative Mind, by Jason Zengerle\n                \n                    Penguin Random House\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Penguin Random House\n    \n\n   \n   On Carlson's shift from print journalism to TV in the '90s   The things that he was good at, in terms of being glib and having an opinion on everything and just being able to appear reasonably intelligent on camera, that was the start of his career. … He would spend all this time and energy crafting these [print] stories, and it might get a little bit of a response. And then he would go on some TV show and make some off-handed remark, and a cabinet member would call him to talk about it. And I think that it was that sort of recognition that made him think that TV was the way to go.   \n   On Jon Stewart's 2004 appearance on CNN's Crossfire, which led to the show's cancellation    I think [it] was a really important moment in Tucker's career and life, because it was a humiliation. He was sort of friendly with Stewart. … He knew, obviously, that Stewart had kind of a dim view of Crossfire and a dim view of cable news. But they all thought they were kind of … play acting the way Crossfire was, you know? You would argue with this person for 30 minutes and then afterwards you'd go out and have a steak and a drink and everybody was sort of doing the same thing, and it was like professional wrestling in some ways. When Stewart came on there and wasn't part of that game, I think Tucker was really surprised and he tried to debate Stewart and Stewart just destroyed him, and destroyed him in front of a studio audience. … It led to the cancellation of the show. It led to Tucker leaving CNN.   \n   I think it was a really important moment in his life and his career because he was a member in good standing of the Washington political and media elite, and I think he felt that his friends in that world did not come to his aid and did not support him the way he would have wanted them to. And so years later, when he developed this populist streak and really turned against people in Washington and legacy media and the things like that, I think he remembered that moment and some of his bitterness towards those people really came out at that point.   On Carlson co-founding the conservative website The Daily Caller in 2010 and pivoting from reporting to tabloidy content    When he launched The Daily Caller, his idea for it was it was going to be a right-wing version of sort of a combination [of] Huffington Post and New York Times. He wanted it to be a very fact-based, heavily reported website. He had a critique of conservative media that conservatives didn't report, they just opined and, \"We need to get back to reporting. We need to get back to presenting facts, and we need to be serious about the news.\" And that was his vision for The Caller. I think within a couple months, looking at the website's traffic, he realized that there was not an audience for that kind of conservative publication — and he pivoted, and he kind of went more in the direction of tabloidy, kind of outrageous stuff.    \n   Increasingly, I think he saw that the types of stories that were getting attention, that were [getting] a lot of traffic, getting clicks, had to do with race, had to do with immigration, and had to do with gender, and he just leaned into that. Eventually he kind of found himself in this competition with Breitbart that Steve Bannon was running at the time. And it was just kind of this race to the bottom in terms of who could write more kind of inflammatory and incendiary stories about Black-on-white crime or about immigrant crime and things like that. And he saw that there was an audience there for that.   On Carlson climbing the ranks at Fox   He really was kind of an afterthought at Fox. You had the stars, you had the Bill O'Reillys, you had the Sean Hannitys. Tucker was just this guy who they could put on the weekend Fox & Friends show and he had some television experience. He was conservative, so he wasn't going to say anything that veered from the party line. He was just kind of a bit player. ...   \n   Then he got his own show, and he got his own show because he was able to use Trump's presidential candidacy to revive his career. ... When Trump came along, those more prestigious Fox shows, they had a basic television problem. They could not find camera-ready, intelligent human beings to go on their programs and make a sensible case for Donald Trump. And Tucker was someone who could, so ... he started getting more airtime that way. And then as Trump's candidacy took off and it became clear that Trump was going to be the Republican nominee. … By the end of the campaign, [Fox News CEO] Roger Ailes had been fired because of the sexual harassment scandal. [News Corps CEO] Rupert Murdoch was now running the network. And the first big move Murdoch made was taking Tucker and giving him his own show at 7 p.m.   \n   Thea Chaloner and Susan Nyakundi produced and edited this interview for broadcast. Bridget Bentz, Molly Seavy-Nesper and Brett Neely adapted it for the web.\n",

    "body": "\n      Border czar Tom Homan met with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz Tuesday. Homan takes over from Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino, overseeing ICE operations in the state. Do things look any different on the ground?   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  Minnesota Governor Tim Walz met with President Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, today in what seems to be the beginning of talks since the shakeup in immigration leadership. The Trump administration continues to face significant criticism over immigration enforcement in Minnesota, following two fatal shootings of U.S. citizens by federal agents just this month. Minnesota Public Radio's Brian Bakst is in St. Paul. Hi there, Brian.BRIAN BAKST, BYLINE: Hi there.KELLY: So how'd this meeting between the governor and Tom Homan go today?BAKST: The two met this morning in the governor's state Capitol office, and it really was our first indication that Tom Homan had arrived in Minnesota after being dispatched to the state yesterday by President Trump. The meeting was private, so we don't know everything that was said, but Walz's office says the governor stressed his main objectives. And they include a swift drawdown in the massive presence of federal agents in Minnesota for many weeks now and his request that a state unit be part of the investigation into the deadly shootings of two observers, Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti. Walz entered the meeting hopeful that the tide was changing, and here's what he told us yesterday.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TIM WALZ: Whether it was morality or bad optics and poll numbers, whatever has happened here, there is a definite change of tone. There is definitely a more collaborative tone. I want to make sure that I'm not jeopardizing that, that I'm going to take them for their word right now, that they're going to reduce this force. They're going to let us be part of a fair investigation.BAKST: The White House told us that Homan wasn't available for comment at this time. Trump did tell reporters that he wants an honorable and honest investigation, and in an appearance just a bit ago on Fox News, the president said his administration is going to, quote, \"de-escalate a little bit.\"KELLY: Meanwhile, where you are today, I understand Homan also met with Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis. What do we know about how that meeting went?BAKST: Yes. That meeting happened a bit later in the day. And again, we weren't invited in, and the participants - they weren't available for questions after. But Mayor Frey issued a statement later saying that in part, he appreciated the conversation, and he also pushed for a quick end to the Minnesota operation. Frey says that he conveyed to Homan just how much community trust and local police officer resources had been strained during these past seven weeks of intensive immigration enforcement.KELLY: So these meetings today, of course, follow the big shake-up yesterday. Late yesterday, the White House announced Homan would take over immigration enforcement operations there, that Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino - he was out. And has that translated into any change on the ground, so far as you can tell?BAKST: It's really hard to say, and that's partly because the entire operation has been a bit opaque. Agents would just show up in places, and there would sometimes be clashes. Full arrest data was never disclosed. We've been able to keep some tabs on the number of detainments through court filings, and those are on behalf of immigrants arrested for possible deportation. We'll be watching to see if those court filings challenging detainments fall off.But there's still the sense that residents across the Twin Cities aren't ready to let their guard down just yet. It's really hard for them to tell if the step-down is real. NPR's Liz Baker spoke with Flavio Moreno earlier today as he lit a candle near a memorial to Alex Pretti. He said he wanted to honor Pretti because he died protecting Moreno's community of Latino immigrants. And Liz asked if he thought changes in DHS leadership on the ground would make a difference, and he really wasn't optimistic.FLAVIO MARENO: Not really, not really - I'm thinking we're going to see nothing real till we don't see ICE in the streets.BAKST: Until we don't see ICE on the streets is what he stressed there.KELLY: Meanwhile, Alex Pretti's sister issued her first statement today. Can you describe it?BAKST: Yeah. She wrote about her older brother as kind, generous and said he had a way of lighting up a room - every room he walked into. She called him her hero. But Micayla ended it by criticizing the way Trump administration officials characterized her brother as having malicious intent the day he was killed and asked, where does this end? Mary Louise, that's a question a lot of people in Minnesota also have.KELLY: Brian Bakst from Minnesota Public Radio. Thank you.BAKST: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Steve Inskeep speaks with Republican Minnesota State Rep. Nolan West, who represents part of Minneapolis, about the reservations he's expressed on the federal show of force in the state.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Some people who voted for President Trump have been horrified by the video from Minnesota. We heard elsewhere on today's program about a focus group of Trump voters from 2024 who've turned against his immigration policy. They'd seen the video. They knew it frame by frame. In Minnesota, Republican candidate for governor dropped out to show his objection to that policy, and Republican Nolan West joins us next from Minnesota. He is a state representative, and his district includes some of the Twin Cities' northern suburbs. Welcome to the program, sir.NOLAN WEST: Thanks for having me on.INSKEEP: I noticed that you put out a statement over the weekend calling for an end to the federal immigration operation in Minnesota. Did you have some personal experience that motivated you to say that?WEST: Oh, so that was the day of my 1-year-old's birthday. And my wife was going to pick out a cake - well, pick up a cake from a baker on the very street where Pretti was shot minutes after it happened. As she was leaving, droves of protesters were showing up, and it took her, like, an extra 20 minutes to get home.INSKEEP: And how did that affect you when you heard that story?WEST: Well, I was already looking at the situation with resounding depression, let's say. And when you see this happening in your own state and somewhat again after it happened recently, it's - just hurts. And when it affects your family's safety, and, you know, honestly, I was more concerned about the protesters and her safety than the ICE agents posing any threat to her.INSKEEP: Understood.WEST: But it was still, like, a horrible situation. And knowing it's an ongoing situation, and the only way to stop it I see is the federal government to do something.INSKEEP: Would you have been in support of the way the president has been enforcing immigration law up to the last month or two in Minnesota?WEST: Well, I think there's broad support for deporting illegal immigrants who have committed an actual crime or charged with drug or murder or something, a violent crime like that. The idea that we're going to deport every single one was never - like, it's shocking that that seems like it was even attempted because, you know, our immigration system has been broken for so many years that that was never going to be something doable without, well, one, violence and two, economic calamity 'cause significant parts of our economy, especially in agriculture, depend on them.INSKEEP: I want to be clear, the Trump administration has constantly given multiple messages on this. We were told during the campaign, first, we're going to get rid of the criminals, which it sounds like you completely support and which most Americans would support. But then they kept adding to the numbers, increasing the numbers, saying, actually, it's 11 million, maybe 15 million, maybe 20 million. A few weeks ago, the Department of Homeland Security talked about 100 million deportations, which, of course, is far more than the number of people without legal status in the entire United States. Was there something of a bait-and-switch, or just inviting people to believe what they wanted to do what they liked?WEST: Well, I mean, there's always a difference between any presidential candidate's campaign and their administration. It happens with every single administration. I don't - I can't speak to their motives, but I would like them to stick to a more refined approach that doesn't have any of these situations where they, you know, even just detain a U.S. citizen is unacceptable.INSKEEP: I want to take a little bit of extra time and talk about what the administration has said over the last several days and get your thoughts about it. As you know very well, the Trump administration got its say on this - referred to Mr. Pretti, your fellow citizen, as a domestic terrorist, said that he had brandished a gun, when video clearly showed that he did not brandish a gun. Lots of other things were said, saying that he wanted to do maximum damage to immigration agents and so forth. Now we have an opportunity to hear from the other side, a friend of Alex Pretti was on All Things Considered, the NPR program, yesterday. Scott Detlow (ph) spoke - Detrow spoke with Heather Zielinski, who's a friend of this nurse, this ICU nurse. And here's some of their conversation.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)SCOTT DETROW: I want to ask what you thought when you heard Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem call Alex Pretti a domestic terrorist or top White House aide Stephen Miller call him a would-be assassin.HEATHER ZIELINSKI: Liars, traitors, cowards.INSKEEP: And she went on to say a little more.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)ZIELINSKI: He was nothing like what the people you just named said. He was an American citizen. He was a good man. He was a hard worker, and he cared for people.INSKEEP: What do you think of the way the administration has handled this incident once it happened?WEST: I mean, it obviously was a complete disaster. For one, when you speak in these situations, you don't speak for yourself. You speak for the organization you represent. And I have no idea why it was so hard not to say, you know, this is a active investigation. We're going to investigate, get to the bottom of it, and we have no comment at this time, and then actually investigate it and cooperate with state investigators. I just - it was absolutely horrifying to see. I'm glad it looks like there's a corner being turned with the conversations between Governor Walz and President Trump, and bringing in Tom Homan as somebody who doesn't have a bunch of statements that they refuse to retract. So I'm optimistic that we're trending in the right direction now, but the response was terrible.INSKEEP: What do you want from your state's Democratic governor, now, Governor Walz, who did speak with President Trump?WEST: Well, I would like to see him meaningfully compromise. Like, both sides have been really dug in. One of the things that caused this, outside of just having federal agents here, is local law enforcement, state patrol were pulled from providing protection for them, which created a lot of these opportunities for ICE agents who are not properly trained for this kind of stuff to engage with protesters. And that - you know, that helped create this situation. So what I would like to see is, OK, you have to get less ICE agents on the street. Like, that's his position he wants (ph). Let's make sure we - the federal government takes them out and they can do that if you help them enforce a more targeted approach. And that's what I would like to see.INSKEEP: And I guess we'll just note for the record. We've heard differing statements about whether police have said they're withdrawing from DHS or whether DHS isn't giving them information. But in any case, you are correct that in this incident and so many others, it's DHS people not trained for crowd control who are doing crowd control and a little more. Representative, thanks for your time. I really appreciate it.WEST: Thank you for having me.INSKEEP: Nolan West is a Republican state representative in Minnesota who has called for federal immigration agents to pull back.(SOUNDBITE OF PARACHUTE DAY'S \"YEARBOOK\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

It comes as polls show that voters are unhappy with many elements of his messaging so far.   Tuesday's speech in Clive, Iowa, is expected to focus on energy and the economy — two areas where Trump's policy changes in the last year have negatively impacted the state.   Trump was last in Iowa on the eve of July 4, 2025, where he kicked off a yearlong celebration of America's 250th birthday and touted Congress' passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which enacted sweeping cuts to taxes and social safety net programs.   \n   As the tax season starts, voters will begin to see the impact of the law's signature policies, like no tax on tips and overtime and an expanded child tax credit. Later this week, the Treasury Department will hold a summit to release more details about the \"Trump Accounts\" created by the law, which will be seeded with a $1,000 government contribution for babies born between 2025 and 2028 and which will serve as investment accounts for newborns.   Much has changed in those six months, though, as polling data suggests the American public has soured on the Trump administration's overhaul of the country's foreign and domestic agenda. That includes an aggressive immigration enforcement crackdown in Minnesota where federal agents shot and killed two people in two different incidents this month.   Last week, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that his message for Iowa was \"straight to the farmers,\" touting the billions of dollars the administration made available as bridge payments to farmers negatively affected by the president's tariff policies.   \"You know, the farmers like Trump, and I like the farmers,\" Trump said. \"The farmers have been very special to me. Very successful.\"   The speech also comes as farming industry groups have expressed frustration that the Republican-led House failed to include a measure allowing higher-ethanol E15 fuel to be sold year-round in its spending plan that passed last week.   \n   Ahead of Friday's deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown, Senate Democrats say they will not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security without additional guardrails for immigration enforcement after the latest shooting of a U.S. citizen by federal immigration agents.   Trump's visit to Iowa also highlights the political gravity that Republicans must overcome in an environment where voters are already primed to express displeasure with the party in power. The president earned 55% of the vote statewide in 2024 and Democrats hold only one statewide office, but that Democrat, auditor Rob Sand, has drastically outraised his opponents in the race for governor.   Control of Congress could hinge on Iowa, too: Three of its four House districts could be competitive, and national Democrats see the retirement of Republican Sen. Joni Ernst as an opportunity as Trump's popularity continues to plummet.   Recent surveys of Trump's approval rating find the president struggling with key demographics that swung toward Republicans in 2024 and also losing support on issues like immigration and the economy. At the state level, Iowa often gives Trump a lower approval rating than any other Republican-led state.\n",

More Republicans are calling for an investigation after a second U.S. citizen was shot by a federal agent in Minneapolis.   The president stopped off at a local restaurant, taking questions from reporters and giving a Fox News interview before taking the stage to make the hard sell on the state of the economy.   \"Just after one year of President Trump our economy is booming incomes are rising investment is soaring, inflation has been defeated, our border is closed, totally closed,\" Trump said, sticking largely to his economic message throughout the speech.   \n   His chief of staff, Susie Wiles, says the trip is the beginning of what will eventually be weekly travel across the U.S. in support of Republican candidates ahead of the midterm elections. But Trump is unlikely to escape the controversy surrounding his administration's immigration tactics in Minneapolis.   \"The primary news story at the moment isn't just the ICE-related shooting. It's the response to the ICE-related shooting,\" said Ryan Williams, a veteran Republican strategist who helped lead Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. \"That's what's going to be the focus. And the president can attempt to focus on the economy, on what he views are successes of his administration on the economic front. But he's going to be stuck talking about this issue for a significant period of time.\"   \n   The Republican Party has struggled with how to respond to Saturday's fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse at a VA hospital.   The shooting happened just weeks after another Minneapolis protester, Renee Macklin Good, was killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.   A number of Republican lawmakers are pushing for more details about the second shooting, including Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas and Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.   \n   After his top officials rushed to declare the U.S. citizen killed by federal agents a \"domestic terrorist,\" Trump is now trying to strike a softer tone   Trump spoke with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Monday. Trump said in a social media post that Walz requested that they \"work together.\"   \"It was a very good call, and we, actually, seemed to be on a similar wavelength,\" Trump wrote.   But soon after the call, Trump's team was attacking Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey again.   \n   Press secretary Karoline Leavitt blamed the local Democratic leaders for the tragedies, saying it was a result of their \"deliberate and hostile resistance.\"   She called on the city and state leaders to turn over \"criminal illegal aliens currently incarcerated in their prisons and jails and assist federal law enforcement in apprehending illegal immigrants wanted for crimes.   \"In Minnesota, ICE and local law enforcement can peacefully work together as they are effectively doing in so many other states and jurisdictions,\" she said.\n",

Messages posted on agency websites and in emails to federal workers across multiple Cabinet departments blamed congressional Democrats and, in some cases, the \"Radical Left\" for the shutdown and its impacts. (Republicans control both chambers of Congress but need Democratic support in the Senate to approve any government funding deal.)</p>   \n   <p>Many Department of Education employees who were furloughed due to the shutdown were surprised to see the following message inserted into their out-of-office replies: \"Thank you for contacting me. On September 19, 2025, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5371, a clean continuing resolution. Unfortunately, Democrat Senators are blocking passage of H.R. 5371 in the Senate which has led to a lapse in appropriations. Due to the lapse in appropriations, I am currently in furlough status. I will respond to emails once government functions resume.\"</p>   \n   <p>Multiple employees told NPR that although the message was written in the first person and sent from their email, they did not write it and were not told it would replace whatever out-of-office message they had originally set up.</p>   <p>The language also differed from the model language the department had provided to staffers as they prepared for the shutdown, according to the lawsuit. Some staffers who tried to change their out-of-office messages to remove the partisan language found they were changed back, the lawsuit said.</p>   <p>The lawsuit argues that the messages violate the First Amendment, which prohibits the government from compelling speech. It names the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon as defendants.</p>   <p>\"Without giving notice to their employees, let alone obtaining their consent, the Department of Education has replaced employees' out-of-office email messages with partisan language that blames 'Democrat Senators' for the shutdown,\" the complaint said. \"Employees are now forced to involuntarily parrot the Trump Administration's talking points with emails sent out in their names.\"</p>   \n   <p>In response to NPR's request for comment on the lawsuit, the Education Department press team replied with the same automated out-of-office message. In a statement to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/education-department-employees-email-automatically-changed-rcna235211\" target=\"_blank\">NBC News</a> on Thursday, before the lawsuit was filed, Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications, said: \"The email reminds those who reach out to Department of Education employees that we cannot respond because Senate Democrats are refusing to vote for a clean CR and fund the government. Where's the lie?\"</p>   \n   <p>Government ethics experts have <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/30/nx-s1-5558393/government-shutdown-trump-ethics-hatch-act\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> that the inclusion of overtly political messages in federal agency communications could violate the <a href=\"https://osc.gov/Services/pages/hatchact.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Hatch Act</a>, which limits political activity by civil servants in the executive branch.</p>   <p>\"The Hatch Act prohibits engaging in political activity while in an official capacity, including communication that contains advocacy in opposition to a political party,\" Michael Fallings, a partner at Tully Rinckey, an employment law firm, said in a statement. \"Here, while the reference to Democrats alone likely does not constitute a violation, the explicit blaming of the Democratic Party for the shutdown and 'reference to radical left' may constitute a violation.\"</p>   <p>On Thursday, Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, <a href=\"https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-oversight.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2025-10-02-garcia-to-osc-re-hatch-act-shutdown-agency-messages.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">asked</a> the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal agency that enforces the Hatch Act, to investigate the Trump administration's use of agency websites and official government emails \"to promote a false, partisan Republican political agenda.\" (The Office of Special Counsel is being led by an acting director since President Trump <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/17/nx-s1-5475191/trump-executive-power-supreme-court-whistleblower\" target=\"_blank\">fired</a> its Senate-confirmed leader <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/05/nx-s1-5319326/trump-hampton-dellinger-watchdog-appeals-court\" target=\"_blank\">before the end of his term</a>. The agency is closed during the shutdown, according to its website.)</p>   <p>More than two dozen current and former federal workers contacted NPR in recent days to express concern about the politicized language they are seeing from agencies and officials.</p>   \n   <p>\"As a professional civil servant and human being I find the rhetoric shocking, offensive, and jarring,\" said one federal worker who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation from the Trump administration for speaking publicly.</p>   <p>Six people shared screenshots of a weekly newsletter the Department of Veterans Affairs sends to \"Veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors.\" Titled \"How the government shutdown impacts VA,\" the Oct. 1 newsletter said: \"President Trump opposes a lapse in appropriations, and on September 19, the House of Representatives passed, with the Trump Administration's support, a clean continuing resolution to fund the government through November 21. Unfortunately, Democrats are blocking this Continuing Resolution in the U.S. Senate due to unrelated policy demands.\" It went on to list VA services that would be affected.</p>   <p>\"I think the politicization of a VA newsletter which is intended only to let us know of our benefits should also be reported on,\" a veteran who received the newsletter and requested anonymity because they fear reprisal from the government told NPR.</p>   <p>\"The message was 100% factual, and even mainstream media outlets and reporters say the same thing,\" VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz said in a statement in response to NPR's questions about the newsletter and the concerns veterans expressed about politicization.</p>   <p><em>NPR's Cory Turner contributed reporting.</em></p>\n</div>",

But in practice, the Assad-led Baath Party always dominated the parliament, and the votes were widely regarded as sham elections.</p>   <p>Outside election analysts said the only truly competitive part of the process came before election day — with the internal primary system in the Baath Party, when party members jockeyed for positions on the list.</p>   <p>The elections to be held on Sunday, however, will not be a fully democratic process either. Rather, most of the People's Assembly seats will be voted on by electoral colleges in each district, while one-third of the seats will be directly appointed by interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa.</p>   \n   <p>Despite not being a popular vote, the election results will likely be taken as a barometer of how serious the interim authorities are about inclusivity, particularly of women and minorities.</p>   <p>Here's a breakdown of how the elections will work and what to watch.</p>   <h3>How the system works</h3>   <p>The People's Assembly has 210 seats, of which two-thirds will be elected on Sunday and one-third appointed. The elected seats are voted upon by electoral colleges in districts throughout the country, with the number of seats for each district distributed by population.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n

districts — chosen from a pool of applicants in each district by committees appointed for the purpose — should vote for 140 seats.</p>   <p>However, the elections in Sweida province and in areas of the northeast controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have been indefinitely postponed due to tensions between the local authorities in those areas and the central government in Damascus, meaning that those seats will remain empty.</p>   <p>In practice, therefore, around 6,000 electoral college members will vote in 50 districts for about 120 seats.</p>   <p>The largest district is the one containing the city of Aleppo, where 700 electoral college members will vote to fill 14 seats, followed by the city of Damascus, with 500 members voting for 10 seats.</p>   \n   <p>All candidates come from the membership of the electoral colleges.</p>   \n   <p>Following Assad's ouster, the interim authorities dissolved all existing political parties, most of which were closely affiliated with the Assad government, and have not yet set up a system for new parties to register, so all candidates are running as individuals.</p>   <h3>Why no popular vote</h3>   <p>The interim authorities have said that it would be impossible to create an accurate voter registry and conduct a popular vote at this stage, given that millions of Syrians were internally or externally displaced by the country's nearly 14-year civil war and many have lost personal documents.</p>   <p>This parliament will have a 30-month term, during which the government is supposed to prepare the ground for a popular vote in the next elections.</p>   <p>The lack of a popular vote has drawn criticism of being undemocratic, but some analysts say the government's reasons are legitimate.</p>   <p>\"We don't even know how many Syrians are in Syria today,\" because of the large number of displaced people, said Benjamin Feve, a senior research analyst at the Syria-focused Karam Shaar Advisory consulting firm.</p>   <p>\"It would be really difficult to draw electoral lists today in Syria,\" or to arrange the logistics for Syrians in the diaspora to vote in their countries of residence, he said.</p>   <p>Haid Haid, a senior research fellow at the Arab Reform Initiative and the Chatham House think tank said that the more concerning issue was the lack of clear criteria under which electors were selected.</p>   <p>\"Especially when it comes to choosing the subcommittees and the electoral colleges, there is no oversight, and the whole process is sort of potentially vulnerable to manipulation,\" he said.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source

\"removed names from the initial lists that were published, and they did not provide detailed information as to why those names were removed,\" he said.</p>   \n   <h3>Questions about inclusivity</h3>   <p>There is no set quota for representation of women and religious or ethnic minorities in the parliament.</p>   <p>Women were required to make up 20% of electoral college members, but that did not guarantee that they would make up a comparable percentage of candidates or of those elected.</p>   <p>State-run news agency SANA, citing the head of the national elections committee, Mohammed Taha al-Ahmad, reported that women made up 14% of the 1,578 candidates who made it to the final lists. In some districts, women make up 30 or 40% of all candidates, while in others, there are no female candidates.</p>   <p>Meanwhile, the exclusion of the Druze-majority Sweida province and Kurdish-controlled areas in the northeast as well as the lack of set quotas for minorities has raised questions about representation of communities that are not part of the Sunni Arab national majority.</p>   <p>The issue is particularly sensitive after outbreaks of sectarian violence in recent months in which hundreds of civilians from the Alawite and Druze minorities were killed, many of them by government-affiliated fighters.</p>   <p>Feve noted that electoral districts had been drawn in such a way as to create minority-majority districts.</p>   <p>\"What the government could have done if it wanted to limit the number of minorities, it could have merged these districts or these localities with majority Sunni Muslim districts,\" he said. \"They could have basically drowned the minorities which is what they didn't do.\"</p>   <p>Officials have also pointed to the one-third of parliament directly appointed by al-Sharaa as a mechanism to \"ensure improvement in the inclusivity of the legislative body,\" Haid said. The idea is that if few women or minorities are elected by the electoral colleges, the president would include a higher percentage in his picks.</p>   <p>The lack of representation of Sweida and the northeast remains problematic, Haid said — even if al-Sharaa appoints legislators from those areas.</p>   \n   <p>\"The bottom line is that regardless of how many people will be appointed from those areas, the dispute between the de facto authorities and Damascus over their participation in the political process will remain a major issue,\" he said.</p>\n</div>",

Instead, she was met with a notice of closure.</p>   <p>\"I just couldn't wait — could not wait to — get here,\" Ten Eyck said. \"We stopped at the [PistachioLand] right up the street there, and that's where we heard that it was closed.\"</p>   <p>Kathy Theriot was similarly heartbroken outside of the New Mexico Park. She had driven her children more than five hours from their home in Taos and hoped that they could experience the white sands she remembered from her childhood.</p>   <p>\"I've been waiting 10 years to show my kids White Sands and the day we come it's closed, which is very disappointing,\" Theriot said.</p>   <p>\"But it is really, really sad though that we get to the side of the road to enjoy part of our country because our elected officials can't get along.\"</p>   <h2>Vandalism and safety concerns</h2>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3939x2626+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F25%2F05bdd2c34dfd9c853f3a7905cbef%2Fap19354685626703.jpg\" alt=\"In this Jan. 10, 2019 file photo people visit Joshua Tree National Park in Southern California's Mojave Desert.\" />\n        </picture>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p>\n                In this Jan. 10, 2019 file photo people visit Joshua Tree National Park in Southern California's Mojave Desert.\n                <b>\n                    Jae C.

CBS' new corporate owner, Skydance Media, is also acquiring The Free Press, Weiss' views-and-news site.</p>   <p>Weiss arrives with a mandate to redefine the CBS News brand in the eyes of the public and refine its news coverage. She is seen as a change agent for a network regularly accused by President Trump and his political allies of liberal bias.</p>   <p>\"Bari is a proven champion of independent, principled journalism, and I am confident her entrepreneurial drive and editorial vision will invigorate CBS News,\" said David Ellison, the CEO of parent company Skydance Media, in a statement Monday, adding that Weiss will report directly to him. \"We believe the majority of the country longs for news that is balanced and fact-based, and we want CBS to be their home.\"</p>   \n   <p>In a note to staff, Ellison decried partisanship as a threat to communities. The media, he said, also played a role. </p>   <p>\"Too often it has become a platform that amplifies the very partisanship tearing our society apart,\" he wrote.</p>   <p>Weiss echoed that view in a note to subscribers, saying that the majority of Americans, who are neither part of \"an America-loathing far left\" or \"a history-erasing far right,\" have been ill-served, and she sees this as an opportunity to reach them as quickly as possible.</p>   <p>Weiss founded The Free Press after a blistering resignation from <em>The New York Times</em>, where she accused colleagues of intolerance. She has no experience in broadcasting and appears unlikely to run CBS' news division on a day-to-day basis given the logistical demands of TV news. The current president and executive editor,  Tom Cibrowski, a veteran broadcast news executive, is staying on. The two will be partners, Ellison said. </p>   \n   <p>NPR interviewed eight current and former journalists at CBS News for this story. Several still at the network — speaking on condition of anonymity because the network did not authorize them to speak publicly — say they are withholding judgment until they see whether Weiss offers insight and guidance or starts issuing decrees with ideological intent.</p>   <p>Weiss' job will be complicated, however, by the company's intention to conduct network-wide layoffs this month of up to 10% of the workforce, according to two people with direct knowledge. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.</p>   \n   <p>While the news division president is the titular head, CBS News has a tradition of strong-willed, independent-minded executive producers stretching back to Edward Murrow's collaborator Fred Friendly and <em>60 Minutes</em> creator Don Hewitt.</p>   <p>Weiss is considered sharp, savvy and entrepreneurial. She had been an opinion and book reviews editor at <em>The</em> <em>Wall Street Journal </em>before joining the <em>New York Times' </em>opinion section, where she also wrote under her own byline, often taking a contrarian bent. When she left that paper in July 2020, it — <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/15/874530954/rancor-erupts-in-la-times-newsroom-over-race-equity-and-protest-coverage\" target=\"_blank\">like many newsrooms</a> — was grappling with tensions over social justice. She denounced her former colleagues in a publicly posted letter to <em>Times </em>Chairman and Publisher A.G. Sulzberger, saying they bullied her and created what she said was an \"illiberal environment.\" At the time, the <em>Times</em> responded by affirming a commitment to honest dialogue and mutual respect among colleagues. </p>   <p>The Free Press has focused on what it contends is a cancel culture afflicting institutions across higher education and popular culture. It made a splash last year by <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/04/09/1243755769/npr-journalist-uri-berliner-trust-diversity\" target=\"_blank\">publishing a critical essay</a> about NPR by Uri Berliner, then a senior business editor at the public media network, and critiques of how mainstream news organizations are covering the Israel-Hamas war. </p>   <p>While drawing support from many who accuse the mainstream media of being reflexively liberal, the site does not blindly embrace Trump's agenda. When the nation's top broadcast regulator, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5546764/fcc-brendan-carr-kimmel-trump-free-speech\" target=\"_blank\"><u>pressured ABC to \"take action\" on Jimmy Kimmel</u></a>, The Free Press cried foul on First Amendment grounds.</p>   \n   <p>Under the new plan, Weiss will continue to run The Free Press as a standalone news-and-views site, maintaining its own brand and subscription model. Outside analysts say the acquisition figure appears high, but reflects the value that Ellison and his multibillionaire father Larry Ellison place on Weiss and her news site. </p>   <p>Since Skydance bought CBS' parent company Paramount in July, David Ellison has made clear that the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/12/nx-s1-5537152/cbs-news-ellison-steps-appease-trump\" target=\"_blank\"><u>network is friendly to conservative views</u></a>. His father, who is the major financial backer of Skydance and the Paramount deal, is the founder of Oracle and a vocal Trump supporter.</p>   \n   <p>Yet that purchase was held up for months as CBS' former owner <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/02/nx-s1-5454790/cbs-settlement-trump-60-minutes-harris-interview-analysis\" target=\"_blank\"><u>negotiated a $16 million settlement</u></a> with Trump. Just before last year's election, Trump sued CBS alleging that a <em>60 Minutes</em> interview with Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris had been edited in an effort to make her appear more articulate than she was.</p>   <p>Many <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/02/nx-s1-5290171/trump-lawsuit-paramount-cbs-60-minutes-kamala-harris\" target=\"_blank\">legal experts</a> had considered the lawsuit frivolous and CBS likely to triumph in court. Yet Carr initiated a formal FCC review of CBS that reinforced Trump's complaint, raising the pressure on the network and its owners. </p>   \n   <p>Before the settlement, Cibrowski's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/19/nx-s1-5403690/cbs-news-wendy-mcmahon-resigns-paramount-trump-lawsuit-60-minutes\" target=\"_blank\"><u>predecessor Wendy McMahon resigned</u></a>, as did Bill Owens, the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/22/nx-s1-5372733/60-minutes-bill-owens-cbs-trump-paramount\" target=\"_blank\"><u>longtime executive producer</u></a> of the network's signature show, <em>60 Minutes</em>. In a note to staff, Owens said he was no longer allowed \"to make independent decisions based on what was right for 60 Minutes, right for the audience.\"</p>   <p>Before completing the purchase, David Ellison made commitments to the FCC's Carr to reshape Paramount, CBS and CBS News. Skydance then hired Kenneth Weinstein, the former president and chief executive of the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank, as CBS News' ombudsman to field complaints about news coverage.</p>   <p>In approving the sale, the FCC said Skydance had made written commitments to \"root out the bias that has undermined trust in the national news media\" and \"ensure that the new company's programming embodies a diversity of viewpoints from across the political and ideological spectrum.\"</p>   <p>Ellison may not be done expanding Skydance's journalism portfolio. He is <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/media/paramount-skydance-prepares-ellison-backed-bid-for-warner-bros-discovery-0b921c20?mod=author_content_page_1_pos_1\" target=\"_blank\"><u>reportedly preparing a bid</u></a> for Warner Brothers Discovery, which owns the cable news giant CNN.<br /></p>\n</div>",

It came hours after the government dispatched California National Guard members to Oregon.</p>   <p>Oregon and Portland <a href=\"https://x.com/AGDanRayfield/status/1974996554084667579\" target=\"_blank\">went back to the court</a> — this time with California as an additional party to the lawsuit — and asked U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut for a new temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from sending the California National Guard to Oregon.</p>   <p>In her ruling, Immergut barred any National Guard members from being relocated from any state for service in Oregon. One day earlier, she had <a href=\"https://www.opb.org/article/2025/10/05/federal-tactics-on-protesters-escalates-hours-after-judge-rules-against-trump/\" target=\"_blank\">temporarily blocked</a> the Trump administration from federalizing the Oregon National Guard.</p>   \n   <p>\"I am certainly troubled by now hearing that both California and Texas are being sent to Oregon, which does appear to be in direct contradiction of my order,\" Immergut said in her order, <a href=\"https://www.opb.org/article/2025/10/05/california-and-oregon-sue-trump-administration-to-block-national-guard-deployment-to-portland/\" target=\"_blank\">according to Oregon Public Broadcasting</a>.</p>   <p>The ruling came as Portland and Chicago were preparing for the possibility that National Guard members would be deployed to their streets, as President Trump moves ahead with his plan to send troops to Democratic-run U.S. cities that he says require help to control crime and protect federal law enforcement officers.</p>   <p>On Saturday, the White House said Trump \"authorized\" the deployment of 300 Illinois National Guard members, after vowing for weeks to send federal forces into Chicago.</p>   <p>Guard members will be used to protect federal property as well as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Federal Protective Service agents and other federal employees, according to a copy of a federal memo viewed by NPR. They will be sent to places where there are \"violent demonstrations\" in the state or where they are likely to occur based on \"current threat assessments,\" the memo said.</p>   <p>Also over the weekend, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said he had <a href=\"https://x.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1975027635295007073\" target=\"_blank\">authorized the deployment</a> of 400 Texas National Guard members at Trump's request.</p>   \n   <p>Already this year, the Trump administration has sent National Guard members to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. Trump has said he also <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/29/nx-s1-5556831/portland-memphis-national-guard-trump-troops\" target=\"_blank\">intends to send troops to Memphis</a> with the backing of Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee.</p>   \n   <p>The latest effort comes against the wishes of the Democratic governors of Oregon and Illinois, Tina Kotek and JB Pritzker, who say the Guard deployment is unnecessary and will escalate tensions.</p>   <p>On Saturday, Pritzker wrote in <a href=\"https://x.com/GovPritzker/status/1974531904767656030\" target=\"_blank\">a post on X</a> that the \"Trump Administration's Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will.\" Pritzker added: \"It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.\"</p>   <p>In <a href=\"https://x.com/GovPritzker/status/1975013177026109717\" target=\"_blank\">a later post</a>, Pritzker said no one from the administration had contacted him about the deployment of Texas National Guard members to Illinois. \"We must now start calling this what it is: Trump's Invasion,\" he wrote.</p>   <p>White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement on Saturday that Trump had activated the Illinois National Guard troops \"[a]midst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness\" in Chicago in order to \"protect federal officers and assets,\" <a href=\"https://www.wbez.org/politics/2025/10/04/donald-trump-jb-pritzker-illinois-national-guard\" target=\"_blank\">WBEZ reported</a>. Trump has said National Guard deployments are in an effort to fight crime, despite violent <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/08/nx-s1-5534338/ice-chicago-boston-immigration-raids\" target=\"_blank\">crime being down</a> in Chicago and other cities.</p>   <p>It came on the same day that Border Patrol agents <a href=\"https://www.wbez.org/immigration/2025/10/04/federal-agents-shoot-woman-they-say-boxed-in-authorities-in-brighton-park\" target=\"_blank\">shot a woman in Chicago</a>. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, said the woman was one of a group of drivers who rammed federal agents with their vehicles. The woman, Marimar Martinez, was released from the hospital and is now in the custody of the FBI, DHS <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/10/04/update-dhs-deploys-special-operations-after-multiple-violent-attacks-federal-law\" target=\"_blank\">said in a statement</a>. No agents were seriously injured, according to McLaughlin.</p>   <h3>A judge blocks Trump's effort to deploy the National Guard in Portland — twice</h3>   <p>Immergut's ruling late Sunday was the second time over the weekend that she had temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard in Oregon.</p>   \n   <p>Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek blasted the government's actions <a href=\"https://www.opb.org/article/2025/10/05/california-and-oregon-sue-trump-administration-to-block-national-guard-deployment-to-portland/\" target=\"_blank\">in a statement</a> after the ruling. \"President Trump's actions are an effort to occupy and incite cities and states that don't share his politics,\" Kotek said, \"and I believe that we should expect him to continue to push the limits of his authority.\"</p>   <p>On Saturday, Immergut ruled that the government had failed to meet the threshold for declaring that recent protests outside an ICE facility in Portland constituted a rebellion.</p>   \n   <p>Immergut, who was appointed by Trump in 2019, said protests at the facility since July were generally limited to fewer than 30 people and were \"largely sedate.\" She added that the city's police force was trained in crowd management and could seek the assistance of other law enforcement agencies — and even the National Guard — if it needed to.</p>   <p>The Trump administration federalized 200 members of the Oregon National Guard last Sunday for a 60-day deployment, according to a memo sent to Gov. Kotek from the Department of Defense.</p>   \n   <p>As in Chicago, Trump was planning to send the troops to Portland over the objections of state and local leaders.</p>   <p>Trump said Sunday he hadn't seen the judge's order, but that \"that judge ought to be ashamed of themselves.\"</p>   <p>Despite the judge's ruling, Guard members began traveling to Oregon, according to California Gov. Gavin Newsom. He said in <a href=\"https://x.com/CAgovernor/status/1974882275927249293?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\" target=\"_blank\">a post on X</a> on Sunday that the Trump administration had sent 300 California National Guard personnel to the state's northern neighbor.</p>   <p>\"They are on their way there now,\" Newsom wrote. \"We are taking this fight back to court. The public cannot stay silent in the face of such reckless and authoritarian conduct by the President of the United States.\"</p>   <p>Kotek said that 101 California Guard members arrived on Saturday in Oregon and more were on their way. </p>   <p>Later on Sunday, Newsom praised the judge's decision blocking the California troop deployment. \"We just won in court — again,\" he <a href=\"https://x.com/CAgovernor/status/1975042264885035195\" target=\"_blank\">wrote in a post</a> on X. \"Trump's abuse of power won't stand.\"</p>   \n   <p><em>Gigi Douban and Tom Bowman contributed reporting.</em></p>\n</div>",

That could be making sure detainees got their necessary medication or a culturally appropriate diet. Or it could be handling complaints about <a href=\"https://immigrantjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CRCL-complaint-letter-NIJC-request-for-investigation-Sec.-504.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">the use of solitary detention</a>, sexual assault or <a href=\"https://immigrationjustice.us/advocacy/advocacy-issues/access-to-medical-mental-health-care/complaint-urges-immediate-release-of-infants-from-detention/\" target=\"_blank\">issues with infants in detention</a>.</p>   \n   <p>The Trump administration earlier cut hundreds of staff in these congressionally mandated offices in order to save money and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/21/nx-s1-5336738/homeland-security-rif-cuts-dhs\" target=\"_blank\">because DHS argued they were</a> \"internal adversaries that slow down operations.\"</p>   \n   <p>This included federal employees who conducted regular visits to detention centers, reviewed and investigated complaints about detention conditions, and prepared reports due to Congress.</p>   <p>\"You don't have anyone to turn to,\" said Whitlock, now senior policy counsel at the National Immigration Law Center, a legal advocacy group. Without the offices, immigration advocates are turning to members of Congress to address problems on behalf of their clients.</p>   <p>\"That's like a one-time flash bang situation,\" she said, about outreach to Congress. \"That's no way to treat somebody who is having issues.\"</p>   <p>NPR spoke with four former employees — all part of a lawsuit challenging their terminations — who said they would regularly review DHS immigration-related policies and programs to make sure there were no civil rights violations.</p>   <p>Now, it's unclear who has that role — even as the Trump administration is ramping up detention space provided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, after a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/03/g-s1-75609/big-beautiful-bill-ice-funding-immigration\">funding boost</a> from Congress this summer.</p>   \n   <p>\"DHS CRCL is performing all legally required functions, but in an efficient and cost-effective manner and without hindering the Department's mission of securing the homeland,\" DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said, speaking about the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.</p>   <p>Former agency watchdogs warn that the rapid expansion comes without hundreds of internal employees to oversee it, increasing the risk of civil rights violations and even deaths while migrants are detained.</p>   <p>\"This massive infusion of funds to ICE is super problematic,\" said one former employee of DHS's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to fear of reprisals from the agency. \"If we were still there, we would be incredibly busy.\"</p>   \n   <p>\"More people are going to die in custody as a result because there are not going to be the same level of checks and balances internally. And the American public will not be able to be as outraged because there's no one with whom to file these complaints,\" the former employee added.</p>   <p>Now, with fewer staff, DHS said the offices are working; it was not immediately clear how many employees are still working in each office.</p>   \n   <h3>Effort to reduce federal workforce</h3>   <p>In fiscal year <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/detain/detainee-death-reporting\" target=\"_blank\">2025</a>, at least<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/23/nx-s1-5549411/ossoff-warnock-noem-immigration-detention-death\" target=\"_blank\"> 15 people died in ICE custody</a>, out of more than 59,000 people in immigration detention. That's the highest detention total in the <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/detain/detention-management\" target=\"_blank\">last six years of publicly available</a> ICE data and it's the highest death count since 18 people died in fiscal year 2020.</p>   <p>The deaths represent a tiny fraction of overall detainees. But it doesn't capture any other issues detainees may face. Across the country, media and immigration advocates have reported <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/05/nx-s1-5413364/concerns-over-conditions-in-u-s-immigration-detention-were-hearing-the-word-starving\" target=\"_blank\">overcrowding, unsanitary conditions and issues with food</a> and healthcare access — a byproduct of a rapid scaling-up of immigration arrests.</p>   <p>\"It's hard to know when things are stopped in the middle, out of the blue, what work actually continues,\" said Katerina Herodotou, a senior policy advisor at CRCL who was laid off.</p>   <p>She said detainees could see posters with the CRCL hotline to call, and that listed what rights they have, something that \"might not seem like much, but could make a huge difference to someone who's experiencing abuse or discrimination in in a jail,\" she said. She worries that posters that were up previously may have been removed — something NPR couldn't immediately verify.</p>   <p>Earlier this year, over 300 people across the three oversight <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/21/nx-s1-5336738/homeland-security-rif-cuts-dhs\" target=\"_blank\">divisions of DHS</a> received notice that their jobs were being cut as part of a broader effort to reduce the size of the federal government.</p>   \n   <p>The oversight offices were created by Congress in order to provide internal reviews and gather external complaints related to immigration enforcement.</p>   <p>Even the existing mechanisms were imperfect, given that they were part of the agencies they were supposed to police, immigration advocates say.</p>   <p>\"These oversight bodies already had limited authority and power to change the system,\" said Jesse Franzblau, associate director of policy at the National Immigrant Justice Center. \"But scrapping these limited oversight mechanisms that were in place has left the door open for expansion to happen in a very secretive way that has allowed lack of accountability,\" he said about the increase in detention space.</p>   \n   <h3>Former watchdogs warn of potential for deaths and abuse</h3>   <p>The former employees interviewed by NPR say they played a critical role to avoid civil rights violations in immigration enforcement — not just address them. For example, some former oversight employees would help approve local law enforcement agencies who wanted to partner with ICE, according to Herodotou.</p>   <p>\"[I was] looking at whether or not the law enforcement agencies that were partnered with ICE under that program were following the protocols and not using the program to racially profile individuals or to go outside the bounds of what the agreement with ICE was in regard to civil liberties and civil rights,\" Herodotou said.</p>   \n   <p>She also worked on a project to change the language the agency used in its interviews with those applying in order to help better identify victims of human trafficking. Now, she worries none of the work to review the agency's programs, or congressionally-mandated annual reports, is getting done.</p>   <p>Another former employee recalls regular visits to Customs and Border Protection detention centers and meetings with detained children, to monitor conditions and raise concerns about any harassment or lapses in health care.</p>   <p>The former employee of the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman also spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisals, and said oversight staff were often the only outsiders any detainees could appeal to.</p>   \n   <p>\"The humanitarian provisions in internal policies and procedures are very likely not being abided by. I do believe that,\" the former employee said.</p>   <p>NPR couldn't independently verify how much oversight is provided by the remaining employees in the oversight offices. Immigration advocates say they have also been unable to keep track.</p>   <p>Congress requires that CRCL issue two reports per year: a semi-annual report and a yearly report based on the previous fiscal year. It does not appear that a semi-annual report has been published this year. The annual report is due later this winter.</p>   \n   <h3>Oversight employees seek to be reinstated</h3>   <p>About 86 former DHS employees in these oversight offices have joined a legal challenge filed to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), the independent federal agency that hears employee complaints against the government.</p>   <p>\"The first argument is that the agency does not have legal authority to abolish the functions that are required by Congress, although they claim to still be carrying out those functions; they have not provided any evidence,\" said Marlene Laimeche, one of the attorneys on the case at Gilbert Employment Law.</p>   \n   <p>\"They are cherry-picking people to perform crucial functions that will turn the government into a machine to execute what the president's priorities are any given day without any type of oversight, without the proper balance and checks on presidential power,\" she added.</p>   <p>Legal challenges, including a<a href=\"https://rfkhumanrights.org/litigation/rfk-human-rights-v-noem-fighting-for-accountability-in-immigration-enforcement/\" target=\"_blank\"> separate federal lawsuit brought by nonprofits</a>, could take months, at best. In the meantime, oversight advocates worry their absence could exacerbate conditions in detention.</p>   <p>\"It's not a risk, it's a reality. We've already seen the treatment of individuals being encountered, arrested and detained,\" Herodotou said, adding that her office experienced an increase in complaints just as employees were being cut back in March.</p>   <p>\"More detention woes, people with health issues in detention, deaths in detention,\" she predicted. \"I don't know if there's an avenue for anyone to get that help anymore.\"<br /></p>\n</div>",

The administration federalized at least 300 members of the Illinois National Guard, who are likely to be sent to Chicago.

In contrast, the court ruled against the administration in these emergency cases three times. These rulings are temporary because the court didn't hear arguments in the cases. Now, some of the cases are back at the court with full briefing and arguments expected.</li></ul>   <p><strong>Negotiators are beginning talks today in Egypt in an attempt to finally end the war in Gaza. </strong>The U.S. presented a peace plan, which Israel agreed to.

Fabrello said she works with staffing agencies to arrange services. She also learned to give the care ordinarily performed by a doctor, skilled nurse, or highly trained therapist because she often can't get help.</p>   \n   <p>Now, broad cuts to North Carolina Medicaid will make finding and paying for care even more difficult. Medicaid is government health insurance for people with low incomes or disabilities and both state and federal dollars pay for the program.</p>   \n   <p>Nationwide, states are scrambling to close budget shortfalls and are eyeing Medicaid, generally one of a state's biggest costs — even before President Donald Trump's hulking tax-and-spending law decreases federal spending on Medicaid by about<a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61570\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>$1 trillion</u></a> over the next decade.</p>   <p>North Carolina and Idaho have already announced plans to cut Medicaid payments to health care providers, including hospitals, doctors, and caregivers.</p>   <p>In Michigan and Pennsylvania — where lawmakers have yet to pass budgets this year — spending on Medicaid is part of those debates. In<a href=\"https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2025/sep/07/strained-past-our-breaking-point-washingtons-small/\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>Washington state</u></a>, lawmakers approved cuts to the program that will not affect who is eligible, said Hayden Mackley, a spokesperson for the state's Office of Financial Management.</p>   <h3>N.C. cuts underway</h3>   <p>North Carolina's Medicaid agency instituted a<a href=\"https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/26090936-medicaid-rebase-ncga-letter-august-2025-final/?embed=1\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>minimum 3% reduction</u></a> in pay for all providers who treat Medicaid patients on Oct. 1. Primary care doctors face an 8% cut and specialty doctors a 10% drop in payments, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.</p>   <p>Fabrello said her son's dentist already called to say the office will not accept Medicaid patients come November. Fabrello fears dental work will become another service her son qualifies for but can't get because there aren't enough providers who accept Medicaid coverage.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1196x1595+0+0/resize/200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F85%2F20%2Fb668a3f14bf7a63861ff17c4a66d%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-03.jpg 200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1196x1595+0+0/resize/300/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F85%2F20%2Fb668a3f14bf7a63861ff17c4a66d%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-03.jpg 300w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1196x1595+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F85%2F20%2Fb668a3f14bf7a63861ff17c4a66d%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-03.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1196x1595+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F85%2F20%2Fb668a3f14bf7a63861ff17c4a66d%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-03.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1196x1595+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F85%2F20%2Fb668a3f14bf7a63861ff17c4a66d%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-03.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1196x1595+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F85%2F20%2Fb668a3f14bf7a63861ff17c4a66d%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-03.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1196x1595+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F85%2F20%2Fb668a3f14bf7a63861ff17c4a66d%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-03.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1350px) 298px, (min-width: 1025px) calc(((100vw - 365px)/3) - 30px), (min-width: 768px) calc(((100vw - 30px)/3) - 30px), calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1196x1595+0+0/resize/200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F85%2F20%2Fb668a3f14bf7a63861ff17c4a66d%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-03.jpg 200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1196x1595+0+0/resize/300/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F85%2F20%2Fb668a3f14bf7a63861ff17c4a66d%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-03.jpg 300w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1196x1595+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F85%2F20%2Fb668a3f14bf7a63861ff17c4a66d%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-03.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1196x1595+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F85%2F20%2Fb668a3f14bf7a63861ff17c4a66d%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-03.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1196x1595+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F85%2F20%2Fb668a3f14bf7a63861ff17c4a66d%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-03.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1196x1595+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F85%2F20%2Fb668a3f14bf7a63861ff17c4a66d%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-03.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1196x1595+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F85%2F20%2Fb668a3f14bf7a63861ff17c4a66d%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-03.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1350px) 298px, (min-width: 1025px) calc(((100vw - 365px)/3) - 30px), (min-width: 768px) calc(((100vw - 30px)/3) - 30px), calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1196x1595+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F85%2F20%2Fb668a3f14bf7a63861ff17c4a66d%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-03.jpg\" alt=\"Ysadore Maklakoff, pictured during a stay at the hospital in 2011, is shown in a hospital bed sleeping or unconscious.

Deadlocked state lawmakers agreed to a mini budget in July to continue funding state programs that gave the Medicaid agency $319 million less than it requested. Lawmakers can choose to reinstate funding for Medicaid this fiscal year, Dowler said.</p>   <p>\"We all hope it changes,\" Dowler said, adding that if it does not, \"you're going to see practices dropping coverage of Medicaid members.\"</p>   <h3>Tough options</h3>   <p>Each year since at least 2019, North Carolina's Medicaid agency has asked for more money than it received from the state legislature. A variety of federal resources, including money provided to states during the COVID-19 pandemic, helped bridge the gap.</p>   <p>But those funds are gone this year, leaving the agency with a choice: Eliminate some optional parts of the program or force every provider that accepts the public insurance to take a pay cut. The state opted mostly for the latter.</p>   <p>\"It's a difficult moment for North Carolina,\" said Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid. The cut in the budget is \"absolutely the opposite direction of where we really want to go, need to go, have been headed as a state.\"</p>   \n   <p>For Anita Case, who leads a small group of health clinics in North Carolina, the cuts make it harder to take care of the \"most vulnerable in our community.\"</p>   <p>Western North Carolina Community Health Services' three clinics serve about 15,000 patients in and around Asheville, including many non-English-speaking tourism workers. Case said she will look at staffing, services, and contracts to find places to trim.</p>   <h3>Hospitals at risk of closure in Idaho</h3>   <p>Idaho has about 350,000 people enrolled in Medicaid. This month, state leaders there responded to an $80 million state budget shortfall by cutting Medicaid pay rates<a href=\"https://idahocapitalsun.com/2025/08/26/idaho-cuts-doctor-pay-rates-for-medicaid-more-cuts-could-come-health-and-welfare-says/\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>4% across the board</u></a>.</p>   \n   <p>The broad cuts have raised backlash from nursing home operators and patient advocacy groups. Leaders of one nursing home company wrote in a<a href=\"https://www.idahostatesman.com/opinion/readers-opinion/article311941139.html\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>recent op-ed</u></a> in the Idaho Statesman newspaper that 75 to 100% of the funding at their facilities comes from Medicaid and the cuts will force them to \"to reduce staff or accept fewer residents.\"</p>   <p>Idaho Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter said the state faced tough choices. It forecasted<a href=\"https://publicdocuments.dhw.idaho.gov/WebLink/DocView.aspx?id=34596&dbid=0&repo=PUBLIC-DOCUMENTS\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>19% growth</u></a> in Medicaid spending this year.</p>   <p>The Idaho Hospital Association's Toni Lawson said the financial strain will be greatest at about two dozen small hospitals — ones with 25 or fewer beds — that dot the state. Lawson, the organization's chief advocacy officer, said one hospital leader reported they had less than two days of cash on hand to make payroll. Others reported 30 days of cash or less, she said.</p>   <p>\"Hopefully, none of them will close,\" Lawson said, adding that she expects labor and delivery and behavioral health units, which often lose money, to be the first to go because of this latest state reduction in payments. Several hospitals in mostly rural areas of the state closed their labor and delivery units last year, she said.</p>   <h3>A big part of state budgets</h3>   <p>Nationwide, Medicaid makes up an average of 19% of a state's general fund spending, second only to K-12 spending, said Brian Sigritz, director of state fiscal studies for the National Association of State Budget Officers.</p>   <p>States generally had strong revenue growth in 2021 and 2022 because of economic growth, which included federal aid to stimulate the economy. Revenue growth has since slowed, and some states have cut income and property taxes.</p>   <p>Meanwhile, spending on Medicaid, housing, education, and disaster response has increased, Sigritz said.</p>   <p>In North Carolina, Fabrello has been unable to work outside of caring for her son. Her savings are almost exhausted, Fabrello said, and she was on the brink of financial ruin until the state began allowing parents to be compensated for caregiving duties. She has received that income for about a year, she said. Without it, she worried about losing her home.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1600x1438+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F80%2Ffb%2Fd0ed40474d6bb43acd520bfd3839%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-01.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1600x1438+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F80%2Ffb%2Fd0ed40474d6bb43acd520bfd3839%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-01.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1600x1438+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F80%2Ffb%2Fd0ed40474d6bb43acd520bfd3839%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-01.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1600x1438+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F80%2Ffb%2Fd0ed40474d6bb43acd520bfd3839%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-01.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1600x1438+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F80%2Ffb%2Fd0ed40474d6bb43acd520bfd3839%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-01.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1600x1438+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F80%2Ffb%2Fd0ed40474d6bb43acd520bfd3839%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-01.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1600x1438+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F80%2Ffb%2Fd0ed40474d6bb43acd520bfd3839%2Fstate-medicaid-cuts-ysadore-01.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw -

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>The White House is renewing threats to send military force to Chicago. Meanwhile there seems to be no progress in ending the federal government's shutdown.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>AYESHA RASCOE, HOST: </p><p> And now we'll turn to NPR White House correspondent Deepa Shivaram. Good morning, Deepa.</p><p>DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: Hey, Ayesha, good morning.</p><p>RASCOE: So Chicago is just one of the cities President Trump wants to send the military into, but it is the one that he keeps coming back to over and over again in his comments. Even before this weekend's events, talk to me a little bit about Trump's interest in Chicago.</p><p>SHIVARAM: Yeah, I mean, it was sort of a slow buildup to this point because the president has been teasing that he wants to send National Guard members to Chicago for a while now, months and months and months. And about a month ago, he started to escalate that rhetoric and said that the administration was, quote, \"going into Chicago,\" but he never specified when exactly that would happen. And then earlier this week, he mentioned the idea again and said it would be happening soon, and he also insulted the state's Democratic governor, JB Pritzker, calling him incompetent and stupid.</p><p>And so that leads us to this weekend. And as you and Michael were just talking about, Pritzker said the Trump administration basically gave him an ultimatum. Either he calls in National Guard members, or Trump will supersede him and do it himself. And of course, this all follows up on Trump sending in the National Guard to other cities - right? - like LA and DC. And more recently, he's been trying to send troops to Portland, Oregon, though yesterday, a federal judge temporarily blocked Trump's move to send the National Guard to Portland, and I will note that that judge was appointed by Trump in 2019.</p><p>RASCOE: Has there been any progress on negotiations to end the federal government shutdown?</p><p>SHIVARAM: Yeah, well, the answer - the short answer, Ayesha, is no. There doesn't really seem to be an end in sight here. I mean, the Senate failed to move forward on funding proposals on Friday. Senate members are expected to return to the Hill tomorrow to try again, but the House will actually remain out of session, per House Speaker Mike Johnson. He said he'd call the House back in session once the Senate can come to an agreement on funding the government, but like I said, there really isn't much agreement going on between the two parties.</p><p>RASCOE: Well, onto another set of negotiations, there does seem to be movement in the talks between Israel and Hamas, though, right?</p><p>SHIVARAM: Yes, there has been some updates on the negotiations there. And, you know, just to catch up and put this into context, on Friday, the president posted on social media - his platform, Truth Social - and he basically gave Hamas this deadline of 6 p.m. this evening - that's Sunday evening - to accept the ceasefire deal that the White House had put together last week. And that deal was a 20-point plan that had requirements for Hamas to release all the hostages, for Israel to end its war in Gaza and for aid to immediately come into Gaza, and there were a number of other points as well. And Israel agreed to that deal, but Hamas said that they had lingering questions. But after Trump set that Sunday deadline, Hamas responded a few hours later and accepted the proposal.</p><p>But that doesn't mean the whole deal is all said and done. There are still some negotiations taking place. And yesterday, for example, Trump posted that Israel had agreed to the withdrawal lines that the White House had drafted in its plan, but the U.S. is still waiting to hear from Hamas on whether they accept that and other elements of the plan, as well. So definitely some progress and some movements, but nothing is finalized.</p><p>RASCOE: And meanwhile, the president is visiting Norfolk, Virginia. What's bringing him there?</p><p>SHIVARAM: Yeah, Trump is headed out there to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Navy. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth will also be there with the president and the first lady, Melania Trump. It's planned to be this big celebratory event, though I will note that it is happening during the government shutdown, which means that active-duty service members are not getting paid. So I'm pretty curious if the president mentions that in his remarks as this shutdown heads into week No. 2.</p><p>RASCOE: That's NPR's Deepa Shivaram. Deepa, thank you so much.</p><p>SHIVARAM: Thank you very much.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

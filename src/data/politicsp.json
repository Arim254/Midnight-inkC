Because of the shutdown, officers missed their first full paycheck Oct. 10.\n                \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Most of the effects of the ongoing government shutdown are far-removed from the halls of Congress.   But the situation facing one group of federal employees who are working without pay is difficult for lawmakers to overlook: The Capitol Police officers who protect them every day.   The officers missed their first full paycheck Oct. 10th.   \"They're asked to be everything to everybody,\" said Terry Gainer, a former Capitol Police chief. \"You need to be ready at the drop of a hat to take very aggressive enforcement action, but you also have to be a person who will welcome visitors and be a tour guide.\"   \n   Gainer says the job is tougher than ever, as public officials face growing threats and violence.   \n   Gesturing toward two officers guarding the ornate Senate Reception Room, Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., says she feels for the force's more than 2,000 officers and that Democrats are to blame for the impasse.   \"These men and women are paying the price,\" Britt said. \"It's absolutely selfish and ridiculous. It's heartbreaking. People have mortgages, they have families.\"   Officer Gus Papathanasiou, the Capitol Police union chair, called on lawmakers last week to end the shutdown, writing in a statement that \"Banks and landlords do not give my officers a pass.\"   Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., who sits on the House committee that oversees the force, says he has kept in touch with Papathanasiou and Capitol Police Chief Michael Sullivan.   \"What I find really strange is that there doesn't seem to be any negotiation going on at all and yet we're walking among people who are directly impacted by this,\" Morelle said.   \n   The Trump administration has signaled plans to repurpose funds to pay federal law enforcement during the shutdown, though Democrats have questioned the legality of the moves.   \"I'm not unhappy with that result if it's the case,\" Morelle said. \"But I'm still mindful of the fact that what the president is talking about, whether it's military troops or law enforcement, it's patently illegal,\" he said.   Morelle says the missed checks are not the only slight, saying officers felt stung when some GOP lawmakers did not oppose President Trump's pardons of rioters who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6th. He notes a Jan. 6 memorial plaque honoring officers who defended the Capitol is still uninstalled on Capitol Hill, despite a federally-mandated deadline.   \n   \"We've always stood with Capitol police and law enforcement and we've shown that in word and deed,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters last week.   \"All of a sudden after all of these issues where they have been frankly insulting to members of the Capitol Police, now they're going to say, 'Oh well, we really care about them,\" Morelle said.   Gainer, the former Capitol Police chief, said officers continue to do their jobs with professionalism, but each slight makes it more difficult to convince them that the long hours and personal risk are worth staying for.   Last week, Rep. Nanette Barragán, D-Calif., briefly clashed with an officer during a protest, prompting the Capitol Police union to demand an apology. Barragán said the officer grabbed her as she tried to enter Johnson's office.   \"One of the skill sets we require of police officers is your ability to remember, because you're good witnesses,\" Gainer said. \"So your memory doesn't get erased, but what you try to do is reset the clock.\"   Asked this week whether they were holding up during the shutdown, a group of officers said they were — \"for now.\"   But one officer had an addendum to that assessment.   \"Give it a month, maybe not,\" he said.\n",

As legal challenges to President Trump's push to send military troops to Democratic-led cities make their way through several courts, the administration's appeal to the high court marks the first time the justices have been asked to weigh in on the issue.   In the appeal filed on Friday by the Department of Justice, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that troops are needed in the Chicago area to \"prevent ongoing and intolerable risks to the lives and safety\" of federal agents. The appeal comes a day after a federal judge denied Trump's bid to deploy troops in Illinois. Sauer argued that the judge's ruling \"improperly impinges on the President's authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property.\"   \n   Trump has been arguing that Chicago is lawless and in need of military intervention to quell protests and protect federal immigration facilities, and federalized the state National Guard against Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker's wishes earlier this month. Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott also sent several hundred of his state's troops to the Democratic-led state.   The Trump administration is \"going to litigate this as much as we can,\" Vice President JD Vance said in an interview with ABC's This Week on Sunday. \"We think that we have the authority to provide proper safety to our citizens all over the United States, but particularly in Chicago.\"   The Supreme Court has asked Illinois and Chicago officials to respond to the administration's arguments by Monday evening.   President Trump has carried out, or attempted to carry out, similar plans in other cities while claiming that federal intervention is needed to drive down crime rates. Leaders in several of those cities have said military force is unnecessary and have accused the president of exceeding his authority to carry out such deployments.   \n   The president is currently in a legal battle with the state of California, after he deployed about 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles to quell anti-ICE protests. California Attorney General Rob Bonta has argued that Trump broke the law by not consulting with Gov. Gavin Newsom.    Last month, Trump authorized National Guard troops to go to Memphis to handle what he said were \"tremendous levels\" of crime in the city. He is also in litigation with the city of Portland, Ore., after attempting to send troops there to safeguard ICE facilities that he said were being attacked. A judge has issued an order blocking the deployment.    \n   In August, Trump deployed National Guard Troops to Washington, D.C., after issuing a crime emergency that lasted about a month. Shortly before the emergency expired, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced the city had established the Safe and Beautiful Emergency Operations Center to manage and continue its relationship with federal law enforcement. The office is responsible, in part, for communicating D.C.'s requests to the federal agents, such as that they not wear masks and that they clearly identify themselves during arrests and interactions with the public.    Trump, eyeing future troop deployments, has said Baltimore, New York, New Orleans, St. Louis, Mo., Oakland and San Francisco are next. \n",

Clary/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Demonstrators across the U.S. are expected to take to the streets by the millions on Saturday, organizers say, to protest the policies of President Trump. The marches are part of the No Kings movement, which has accused the president of behaving more like a monarch than an elected official.   This will be the second massive wave of protests organized by No Kings — a network of progressive organizations fighting against Trump's agenda.   \n   \"In June, we did what many claimed was impossible: peacefully mobilized millions of people to take to the streets and declare with one voice: America has No Kings,\" the group states on its website.   The overwhelmingly peaceful June protests were in response to a military parade held on the Army's 250th anniversary — which coincided with Trump's 79th birthday.   Critics said Trump had pushed for the extravagant parade not to commemorate the armed forces, but as a display of his own vanity.   \n   \"Now, President Trump has doubled down,\" No Kings states on its website, citing immigration detentions carried out by often-masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, the administration's aggressive slashing of federal education resources and environmental protections, gerrymandering and other concerns.   \n   No Kings organizers estimated that more than 5 million people turned out for the June protests. They speculate that Saturday's event could be even bigger.   House Speaker Mike Johnson has slammed the event as a \"hate America rally,\" and other Republicans have derided the event as anti-American.   Responding to NPR's questions about the protests, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said: \"Who cares?\"   Republican Govs. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia and Greg Abbott of Texas, in preparation for the day of protesters, mobilized their states' National Guards.   \"The Governor has authorized state active duty for training to help ensure the Guard will be ready to respond if needed to help keep people safe,\" Youngkin spokesman Peter Finocchio wrote in a statement to VPM.   \n   The Texas Newsroom reported that Abbott said in a statement: \"Violence and destruction will never be tolerated in Texas. Texas will deter criminal mischief and work with local law enforcement to arrest anyone engaging in acts of violence or damaging property.\"   Speaking to Connecticut Public, that state's lead organizer, Jim Chapdelaine, reiterated the group's commitment to peace and the importance of showing up for what you believe in.   \"There are powers that be that would prefer we all just stay at our houses and, I don't know, take up crochet,\" Chapdelaine said in a Tuesday interview. \"It's really important to build community and solidarity and unity, [and] especially important to do that in a very peaceful way.\"\n",

Let both claim Victory, let History decide!\"   \n   Later, soon after arriving in Florida, where he's spending the weekend, Trump urged both sides to \"stop the war immediately\" and implied that Moscow keep territory it's taken from Kyiv.   \"You go by the battle line wherever it is — otherwise it's too complicated,\" Trump told reporters. \"You stop at the battle line and both sides should go home, go to their families, stop the killing, and that should be it.\"   The comments amounted to another shift in position on the war by Trump. In recent weeks, he had shown growing impatience with Russian President Vladimir Putin and expressed greater openness to helping Ukraine win the war.   After meeting with Zelenskyy in New York on the sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly last month, Trump even said he believed the Ukrainians could win back all the the territory they had lost to Russia since Putin launched the February 2022 invasion. That was a dramatic shift for Trump, who had previously insisted that Kyiv would have to concede land lost to Russia to end the war.   \n   Zelenskyy after Friday's meeting said it was time for a ceasefire and negotiations. He sidestepped directly answering a question about Trump nudging Ukraine to give up land.   \"The president is right we have to stop where we are, and then to speak,\" Zelenskyy said when asked by reporters about Trump's social media post, which he hadn't seen.   Another change in tone   Trump's tone on the war shifted after he held a lengthy phone call with Putin on Thursday and announced that he planned to meet with the Russian leader in Budapest, Hungary, in the coming weeks.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Donald Trump, second right, and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, seated left, sit as reporters ask questions before a lunch in the Cabinet Room of the White House, Friday, Oct. 17, 2025, in Washington.\n                \n                    Alex Brandon/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Brandon/AP\n    \n\n   \n   The president also signaled to Zelenskyy on Friday that he's leaning against selling him long-range Tomahawk missiles, weaponry that the Ukrainians believe could be a game changer in helping prod Putin to the negotiating table.   \n   Zelenskyy at the start of the White House talks said he had a \"proposition\" in which Ukraine could provide the United States with its advanced drones, while Washington would sell Kyiv the Tomahawk cruise missiles.   But Trump said he was hesitant to tap into the U.S. supply, a turnabout after days of suggesting he was seriously weighing sending the missiles to help Ukraine beat back Russia's invasion.   \"I have an obligation also to make sure that we're completely stocked up as a country, because you never know what's going to happen in war and peace,\" Trump said. \"We'd much rather have them not need Tomahawks. We'd much rather have the war be over to be honest.\"   In an interview with Kristen Welker of NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Zelenskyy suggested the door was not closed.   \"It's good that President Trump didn't say 'no,' but for today, didn't say 'yes,'\" he said.   Zelenskyy also said \"we need Tomahawks\" because \"it's very difficult just to operate only with Ukrainian drones.\"   Trump's latest rhetoric on Tomahawks was certainly disappointing to the Ukrainians. In recent days, Trump had shown an openness to selling Ukraine the Tomahawks, even as Putin warned that such a move would further strain the U.S.-Russian relationship.   Why Tomahawks?   But following Thursday's call with Putin, Trump began downplaying the prospects of Ukraine getting the missiles, which have a range of about 995 miles (1,600 kilometers.)   Zelenskyy had been seeking the Tomahawks, which would allow Ukrainian forces to strike deep into Russian territory and target key military sites, energy facilities and critical infrastructure. Zelenskyy has argued that the potential for such strikes would help compel Putin to take Trump's calls for direct negotiations to end the war more seriously.   Putin warned Trump during the call that supplying Kyiv with the Tomahawks \"won't change the situation on the battlefield, but would cause substantial damage to the relationship between our countries,\" according to Yuri Ushakov, Putin's foreign policy adviser.   \n   It was the fifth face-to-face meeting for Trump and Zelenskyy since the Republican returned to office in January,   The president said Friday it was \"to be determined\" if Zelenskyy would be involved in the upcoming talks in Hungary — suggesting a \"double meeting\" with the warring countries' leaders was likely the most workable option for productive negotiations.   \"These two leaders do not like each other, and we want to make it comfortable for everybody,\" Trump added.   But Zelenskyy told reporters that the animus toward Putin \"is not about feelings.\"   \"They attacked us, so they are an enemy for us. They don't intend to stop,\" Zelenskyy added. \"So they are an enemy. It is not about someone just hating someone else. Although, undoubtedly, we hate the enemy. Undoubtedly.\"   Trump, going back to his 2024 campaign, insisted he would quickly end the war, but his peace efforts appeared to stall following a diplomatic blitz in August, when he held a summit with Putin in Alaska and a White House meeting with Zelenskyy and European allies.   Trump emerged from those meetings certain he was on track to arranging direct talks between Zelenskyy and Putin. But the Russian leader hasn't shown any interest in meeting with Zelenskyy and Moscow has only intensified its bombardment of Ukraine.   Asked Friday if he was concerned that Putin was stringing him along, Trump acknowledged it was a possibility but said he was confident he could handle the Russian leader.   \"I've been played all my life by the best of them, and I came out really well,\" Trump said. He added, \"I think I'm pretty good at this stuff.\"\n",

The New York Republican was later sentenced to prison after pleading guilty to range of federal charges, but President Trump has now commuted his sentence.\n                \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   President Trump announced on Friday that he commuted the prison term of George Santos, the disgraced New York Republican who was sentenced to more than seven years in prison for a litany of crimes after he was expelled from the House over accusations that he stole money from campaign donors.   Trump made the announcement in a post on Truth Social on Friday, saying he had signed a commutation to release Santos from prison immediately. Joseph Murray, one of Santos' lawyers, told The Associated Press that the former lawmaker was released from the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, N.J., around 11 p.m. Friday, and was greeted by his family.   \n   \"George Santos was somewhat of a 'rogue,' but there are many rogues throughout our Country that aren't forced to serve seven years in prison,\" Trump wrote.   Santos, a fierce supporter of Trump, pleaded guilty in 2024 to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Prosecutors said Santos was responsible for a \"mountain of lies, theft, and fraud\" aimed at enriching himself and deceiving campaign donors. He began his sentence in July of this year.   Soon after Santos was elected in 2020, reports that he had fabricated numerous aspects of his identity began to trickle out. He later admitted to lying about his education, employment and his upbringing. Santos was still sworn into Congress in 2022 despite the inconsistencies raised about his background and campaign finances.   His falsehoods would catch up with him less than a year after his term began. In 2023, the House voted 311-114 to remove him from office. Almost every Democrat and more than 100 Republicans voted to expel Santos.   The vote made Santos just the sixth representative to ever be expelled from the chamber but the first to be expelled without being convicted of a crime. At the time of his expulsion, Santos was facing 23 criminal charges.   Trump compared Santos' crimes to claims made by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., more than 15 years ago about his military service. Blumenthal has previously admitted that he \"misspoke\" about serving in Vietnam. Blumenthal served six years in the Marine Reserve beginning in 1970, but none of that time was spent overseas.   \n   \"This is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\" Trump wrote.   So far during his second term, Trump has issued a slew of high-profile pardons and commutations. He issued a blanket pardon of more than 1,500 people charged with acts related to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich also received a pardon after he was convicted on a series of corruption-related crimes, including trying to sell a U.S. Senate seat vacated by former President Barack Obama. Trump commuted Blagojevich's 14-year prison sentence during his first term.\n",

And while the message on Liberty Vote's website notes KNOWiNK's ubiquity in U.S. elections, the Liberty Vote press release doesn't mention KNOWiNK and paints Leiendecker as more of an outsider, referring to him as a \"nationally recognized election reform advocate.\"   Leiendecker did not respond to NPR's requests for comment.   \n   A press release's partisan tone   The press release announcing the Dominion sale nodded at conservative election priorities, highlighting Liberty Vote's 100% American ownership and a mission to \"restore public confidence in the electoral process through transparent, secure, and trustworthy voting systems, including the use of hand-marked paper ballots.\"   Liberty Vote also promised to comply with Trump's March executive order on election security, which has largely been paused by federal judges.   David Becker, who runs the nonpartisan nonprofit Center for Election Innovation & Research, said that he couldn't remember an election vendor ever seeking out publicity in the way Liberty Vote did and that the partisan tone of the announcement may generate even more suspicion around the company than existed before.   \"I thought the announcement was weird — I'll be honest,\" Becker said. \"That just raised a lot of questions on the part of election officials. They're already under siege. There is already so much disinformation swirling about voting systems and their security. … They don't want drama around their voting systems.\"   \n   Some in the voting world see the difference in the public and private messaging as more of a rebrand aimed at capitalizing on doubts that people have about elections, rather than transforming the company into a partisan entity.   As one state voting official, who was not authorized to speak about the sale publicly, put it to NPR: \"[Leiendecker] sees an opportunity to sell Dominion to all the conservative jurisdictions who wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole the past five years.\"   \"It's all business for him,\" the official said.   \"Is this a GOP takeover?\"   Some Colorado clerks were frustrated they were given no notice before the sale was made public.   \"There was no notification to us that this was even a conversation,\" said Tiffany Lee, the politically unaffiliated clerk of La Plata County, in southwest Colorado. \"That's concerning to me that we didn't get any kind of information from [Liberty Vote] directly or Dominion.\"   \n   The announcement — along with Leiendecker's history as a Republican elections official — raised questions for some voters as well, Lee said: \"It was, 'Is this a GOP takeover? Are elections going away? What's happening?' Probably one of the biggest questions I've overall gotten is, 'Are we gonna continue to have elections?'\"   Lee and other election officials are urging calm, considering that nothing about the equipment used to scan and count votes is even changing in the short term. In most cases, voters whose ballots were tallied using Dominion technology in 2024 will have their votes counted in the 2026 midterms using the same machines.   \"From a security and technical perspective, everything still stands,\" Fitzpatrick, the Boulder County clerk, said. \"We still have multiple checks and balances to demonstrate and verify the integrity of the system. Everything that we have been saying for years is still the same.\"   The sale may not satisfy conspiracy theorists   Like most of the country, Colorado is a paper-ballot state, and by law, all Colorado counties conduct risk-limiting audits after each election, double-checking the scanning machines' tallies against the actual votes on the original paper ballots.   While audits and hand counts have shown that the state's election results are accurate, Colorado has been at the epicenter of false election claims.   That fact has many wondering whether a marketing campaign can actually win the buy-in of those convinced that Dominion was involved in stealing elections.   Indeed, after the sale was announced, conservative activist and podcaster Joe Oltmann, a prominent election denier based in Colorado, blasted Leiendecker in a Facebook post.   \"This guy is not a conservative... I truly hate what our country has become... it is literally a cartel that wear[s] different badges while stealing the voice in a sea of treason,\" posted Oltmann.      NPR's Miles Parks reported from Washington, D.C., and Colorado Public Radio's Bente Birkeland reported from Colorado.\n",

Instead, they think that we don't know what's best for ourselves.\"   Missouri is the second state in the country, alongside Texas, to gerrymander its congressional map after President Donald Trump set off a nationwide redistricting battle in July to try to maintain control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterms.   \n   Multiple other states, including North Carolina, Indiana, Florida, Ohio and Kansas could soon follow. California is trying to counter the Republican effort by redistricting in favor of Democrats, if voters pass a constitutional amendment next month.   Missouri's Republican Governor, Mike Kehoe, signed the new map into law late last month. The state had six Republicans and two Democrats in Congress, but the new plan targets longtime Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II's seat in Kansas City.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Leann Villaluz (right) has been going door to door for weeks to collect signatures for a petition to put Missouri's new congressional map to voters. She says most people she's talked to are willing to sign.\n                \n                    Savannah Hawley-Bates/KCUR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Savannah Hawley-Bates/KCUR\n    \n\n   \n   But with Villaluz and about 3,000 other volunteers, a group called People Not Politicians Missouri is working to overturn the state's new map. If they're successful in getting more than 106,000 signatures across the state by December 11, a referendum will go on the ballot in 2026 for voters to decide whether to want to keep or reject it.   The group says it's already gathered more than 100,000 signatures and is still collecting more. If they get the signatures they need, the referendum would stall the map until voters weigh in next year.   Villaluz says everyone she's spoken to has been excited to sign. She's visited five neighborhoods so far around Kansas City, which would be split into three Republican-leaning districts under the new map. Villaluz even took her petition to the recent Chappell Roan concert to get signatures.   \n   \"Just about anyone that stops and hears what the petition is about is ready and willing to sign,\" Villaluz says. \"Whatever your vote is, it's going to be diluted with the maps, and nobody wants that.\"   Missouri attorney general and secretary of state fight back    Not only does People Not Politicians Missouri have to gather enough signatures, it also has to take on pushback from top state election officials. The state's Attorney General Catherine Hanaway filed a lawsuit in federal court arguing that a referendum on redistricting violates both the U.S. and Missouri constitutions.   Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins did approve the group's referendum petition this week after initially rejecting it. But in a press release, Hoskins claims that none of the signatures gathered before his approval date are valid.   \"The process is clear,\" Hoskins said in the release. \"Every Missourian deserves confidence that ballot measures follow the law — not out-of-state agendas or confusion campaigns. Missouri values fairness and integrity, and this process reflects that.\"   The executive director of People Not Politicians Missouri, Richard von Glahn, said in a statement that Hoskins is \"deliberately spreading misinformation for political purposes,\" and that, according to the state constitution, the group was allowed to begin gathering signatures before the secretary of state's approval.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A group called People Not Politicians Missouri has been working to gather signatures to overturn Missouri's new congressional map. Signers have to leave one column on the petition, their congressional district, blank, because with the map changes, many don't know which district they're in.\n                \n                    Savannah Hawley-Bates/KCUR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Savannah Hawley-Bates/KCUR\n    \n\n   \n   \"Our campaign has gathered signatures at a historic pace — I've never seen Missourians unite and mobilize this quickly,\" von Glahn said in the statement. \"We will not be intimidated or distracted. This referendum will qualify, and Missourians — not politicians — will decide the future of fair representation in our state.\"   The Democratic National Committee has joined the referendum effort and is contributing more staff and money to the cause. A slew of lawsuits have also been filed challenging the new districts.   A legal effort, too    Rebeca Amezcua-Hogan is one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit that seeks to block Hoskins from using the map to hold a congressional primary or general election and argues mid-decade redistricting without a new census is unconstitutional.   \n   \"My own voting power would be watered down,\" Amezcua-Hogan says. \"I would feel like I'm not being represented. And I think that at least personally, for the issues that are close to my heart that I've been working on for years, it would be incredibly discouraging.\"   Amezcua-Hogan is running as a progressive for the Kansas City Council. The area she wants to represent would be split into three different congressional districts if the new map holds. When she talks to voters for her campaign, Amezcua-Hogan is also gathering signatures for the referendum effort.   She says Kansas City is already competing for federal resources and splitting it up into three districts will only make that more difficult.   \"Kansas City is already at a point where we're dealing with lack of affordable housing, lack of mental health resources, lack of transportation,\" says Amezcua-Hogan. \"It already feels like we're fighting an uphill battle, and that uphill battle is only going to get worse.\"   Most, but not Republicans, are on board   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Lawmakers convene in an extraordinary legislative session at the Missouri State Capitol on Monday, Sept. 8, 2025, in Jefferson City, Mo.\n                \n                    Brian Munoz/St. Louis Public Radio\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brian Munoz/St. Louis Public Radio\n    \n\n   \n   Missouri's new congressional map easily passed the Republican-dominated Missouri Legislature in its week-long special session.   Michael Davis represents a suburb south of Kansas City and is one of the lawmakers who championed the new map. He's part of the state's Freedom Caucus, a group of Republican legislators who aim to push the party further to the right.   Davis says Missourians elected Republican lawmakers because they trust them to do what they think is best with redistricting.   \"We should send a conservative message to D.C.,\" Davis says. \"The best way to do that is by sending seven Republicans who are going to ensure that Republicans keep control of the U.S. House of Representatives.\"   But 15 Republicans — including Jon Patterson, the speaker of the Missouri House — voted against the map in the state legislature. Nearly all of them are from parts of the state targeted by redistricting or in areas that would be moved into new districts.   \n   Republican state Rep. Bill Allen represents a part of Kansas City's northland that is evenly split between parties. He opposes mid-decade redistricting and said he was disappointed that Missouri seemed to follow Texas and Trump's lead in doing so.   \"I think I heard from one or two constituents that wanted me to vote in favor, and almost every other one that I heard was in opposition,\" Allen says. \"The job of the representative is to represent the district, not the party, certainly not the president. Just the district that I represent, the 39,000 people. Their will is my responsibility.\"   Villaluz says she plans to keep gathering signatures for the next two months, until the group finds out if it has done enough to put redistricting on the ballot and potentially reverse Missouri's gerrymandered map.   \"I feel that Missouri is used as a guinea pig by the GOP,\" says Villaluz. \"They think that the average Missouri voter is dumber than we are, and they think that they can get away with a lot more here in a red flyover state, but that's not the case.\"   Villaluz says voters across Missouri won't stand idly by, and she believes they'll get the last word.\n",

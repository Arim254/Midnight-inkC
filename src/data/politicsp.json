It was an early target of the Department of Government Efficiency this year.   On Wednesday, the State Department said it renamed the organization to the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace to \"reflect the greatest dealmaker in our nation's history.\" The new name could be seen on its building, which is near the State Department.   \n   Trump has spent months openly lobbying for a Nobel Peace Prize even though he was passed over for this year's installment — arguing he had a hand in easing a series of conflicts around the world. But Trump has also ordered strikes on suspected drug vessels off the coast of Venezuela and repeatedly threatened that attacks on land could be coming, which would be an act of war against that country.   The takeover of the Peace Institute was also anything but peaceful, with his administration seizing the independent entity and ousting its board before actually affixing his name to the building.   Anna Kelly, a White House spokesperson, said: \"The United States Institute of Peace was once a bloated, useless entity that blew $50 million per year while delivering no peace. Now, the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace, which is both beautifully and aptly named after a President who ended eight wars in less than a year, will stand as a powerful reminder of what strong leadership can accomplish for global stability.\"   She added, \"Congratulations, world!\"   George Foote, a lawyer for the former Institute leadership and staff, said the renaming \"adds insult to injury.\"   \"A federal judge has already ruled that the government's armed takeover was illegal. That judgment is stayed while the government appeals, which is the only reason the government continues to control the building,\" Foote said.   \n   Since March, the headquarters has switched hands multiple times in court actions related to the DOGE takeover. A final decision on its fate is pending in federal appeals court.   USIP has maintained the organization is an independent creation of Congress and outside the president's executive authority. The administration argues it is an executive branch organization.   After Trump fired the institute's board in the the spring, the staff was fired as well and the building was turned over to the General Services Administration.   A federal district court overturned the action in May, putting the headquarters back into the hands of USIP leadership. But that action was reversed weeks later by a federal appeals court.   \n   Employees at this juncture have been fired twice and the building is in GSA's possession.   The building is expected to be the backdrop for the signing of a peace agreement Thursday between Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi and Rwanda's President Paul Kagame. High-ranking officials from the African Union, Angola, Burundi, Kenya, Togo, Qatar, Uganda and the United Arab Emirates are also expected to attend the signing, according to Yolande Makolo, a senior adviser to Kagame.   The USIP website remained unchanged Wednesday night, but its lead item was headlined, \"President Donald J. Trump to Sign Historic Peace Agreement at USIP Headquarters,\" followed by a write-up of the deal between Congo and Rwanda that Trump was overseeing at the institute on Thursday.   The Institute of Peace was created by Congress in the 1980s. President Ronald Reagan signed the bill into law in 1985. Described as an independent, nonprofit think tank funded by Congress, its mission has been to work to promote peace and prevent and end conflicts while working outside normal channels such as the State Department. It was operating in 26 conflict zones, including Pakistan, Afghanistan, Mali and Burkina Faso, when DOGE shut the operation down.   \n   There is also broad speculation that Trump will be awarded a new peace prize from FIFA on the sidelines of the World Cup draw, happening in Washington on Friday.\n",

The directive, sent in an internal memo on Tuesday, is focused on applicants for H-1B visas for highly skilled workers, which are frequently used by tech companies, among other sectors. The memo was first reported by Reuters; NPR also obtained a copy.   \n   \"If you uncover evidence an applicant was responsible for, or complicit in, censorship or attempted censorship of protected expression in the United States, you should pursue a finding that the applicant is ineligible\" for a visa, the memo says. It refers to a policy announced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio in May restricting visas from being issued to \"foreign officials and persons who are complicit in censoring Americans.\"   The Trump administration has been highly critical of tech companies' efforts to police what people are allowed to post on their platforms and of the broader field of trust and safety, the tech industry's term for teams that focus on preventing abuse, fraud, illegal content, and other harmful behavior online.   \n   President Trump was banned from multiple social media platforms in the aftermath of his supporters' attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. While those bans have since been lifted, the president and members of his administration frequently cite that experience as evidence for their claims that tech companies unfairly target conservatives — even as many tech leaders have eased their policies in the face of that backlash.   \n   Tuesday's memo calls out H-1B visa applicants in particular \"as many work in or have worked in the tech sector, including in social media or financial services companies involved in the suppression of protected expression.\"   It directs consular officers to \"thoroughly explore\" the work histories of applicants, both new and returning, by reviewing their resumes, LinkedIn profiles, and appearances in media articles for activities including combatting misinformation, disinformation or false narratives, fact-checking, content moderation, compliance, and trust and safety.   \n   \"I'm alarmed that trust and safety work is being conflated with 'censorship',\" said Alice Goguen Hunsberger, who has worked in trust and safety at tech companies including OpenAI and Grindr.   \"Trust and safety is a broad practice which includes critical and life-saving work to protect children and stop CSAM [child sexual abuse material], as well as preventing fraud, scams, and sextortion. T&S workers are focused on making the internet a safer and better place, not censoring just for the sake of it,\" she said. \"Bad actors that target Americans come from all over the world and it's so important to have people who understand different languages and cultures on trust and safety teams — having global workers at tech companies in [trust and safety] absolutely keeps Americans safer.\"   \n   In a statement, a State Department spokesperson who declined to give their name said the department does not comment on \"allegedly leaked documents,\" but added: \"the Administration has made clear that it defends Americans' freedom of expression against foreigners who wish to censor them. We do not support aliens coming to the United States to work as censors muzzling Americans.\"   The statement continued: \"In the past, the President himself was the victim of this kind of abuse when social media companies locked his accounts. He does not want other Americans to suffer this way. Allowing foreigners to lead this type of censorship would both insult and injure the American people.\"   First Amendment experts criticized the memo's guidance as itself a potential violation of free speech rights.   \"People who study misinformation and work on content-moderation teams aren't engaged in 'censorship'— they're engaged in activities that the First Amendment was designed to protect. This policy is incoherent and unconstitutional,\" said Carrie DeCell, senior staff attorney and legislative advisor at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, in a statement.   Even as the administration has targeted those it claims are engaged in censoring Americans, it has also tightened its own scrutiny of visa applicants' online speech.   On Wednesday, the State Department announced it would require H-1B visa applicants and their dependents to set their social media profiles to \"public\" so they can be reviewed by U.S. officials.   NPR's Bobby Allyn and Michele Kelemen contributed reporting.\n",

On Thursday, The New York Times sued the Defense Department and Secretary Pete Hegseth over its new media policy.\n                \n                    Kevin Wolf/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kevin Wolf/AP\n    \n\n   \n   The New York Times sued Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Thursday over the Pentagon's new policy that requires media outlets to pledge not to gather information unless defense officials formally authorize its release.   That policy, unveiled in September, includes a ban on credentialed journalists reporting even unclassified material that isn't expressly approved for public consumption by Defense Department brass. The Times said the Pentagon policy represents an attempt to force reporters to rely solely upon officials for news involving the military and would unlawfully permit their punishment for failing to do so.   The Times — and NPR — are among the organizations that chose to give up their press passes rather than agree to the policy.   \n   In addition to the Defense Department and Hegseth, the lawsuit names Sean Parnell, the chief Pentagon spokesperson, as a defendant. \"We are aware of the New York Times lawsuit and look forward to addressing these arguments in court,\" Parnell said in a statement.   Despite surrendering their Pentagon credentials, news organizations have been aggressively reporting on military action, including U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites and Venezuelan vessels, breaking news that contradicts official accounts.   Most recently, an inspector general has found that Hegseth's private Signal chats with senior government officials about pending U.S. airstrikes in Yemen could have placed American troops in harm's way. The chats were first revealed by The Atlantic's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, whose number was mistakenly added to the chat. (NPR CEO Katherine Maher is the chairperson of the board of directors of the Signal Foundation, which oversees Signal.)   In its court documents, the Times is arguing that Hegseth's moves violate constitutional protections for free speech and freedom of the press.   \"It is exactly the type of speech and press-restrictive scheme that the Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit have recognized violates the First Amendment,\" states the brief. \"The Policy abandons scrutiny by independent news organizations for the public's benefit.\"   \n   The paper also alleges that the Pentagon violated its reporters' constitutionally protected rights to due process by making a decision on press passes out of the blue and without any path to appeal.   In its filings, the Times legal team invokes a decision from Trump's first term, in which the White House revoked then-Playboy reporter Brian Karem's permanent press pass over his coverage. A federal judge's ruling forced the administration to rescind that decision. The White House also had to return the pass of then-CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta.      The restrictions Hegseth has put in place parallel those taken throughout the second Trump administration against news outlets whose coverage it opposes. Earlier this week, the White House posted online a \"media bias offender tipline,\" inviting tips from the public about news coverage critical of the administration.   The New York Times is being represented by the noted free-speech litigator Theodore J. Boutrous. He is among the lawyers representing NPR in its suit against the White House over Trump's executive order barring all federal subsidies for NPR and PBS. A key hearing in that case is to be held Thursday afternoon in Washington, D.C.   In May, Hegseth revealed new rules limiting reporters' ability to move through many parts of the Pentagon without a formally designated escort — a change that broke years of tradition spanning Democratic and Republican administrations.   Then, in September, came the policy demanding that news organizations sign an acknowledgment they would not disclose — or even seek — unauthorized material. Hegseth posted on social media, \"The 'press' does not run the Pentagon — the people do.\"   Hegseth is a veteran and former Fox News host who came to President Trump's attention through his television presence. Fox was among the outlets whose defense correspondents banded together to object to the policy — and who left the building as a result.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Neil Wallace signals that the Fox News staff has cleared the contents of their broadcast booth in the press area of the Pentagon on Oct. 15 in Washington.\n                \n                    Kevin Wolf/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kevin Wolf/AP\n    \n\n   \n   \"The Pentagon's press access policy is unlawful because it gives government officials unchecked power over who gets a credential and who doesn't, something the First Amendment prohibits,\" Gabe Rottman, vice president of policy at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said in a statement. \"The public needs independent journalism and the reporters who deliver it back in the Pentagon at a time of heightened scrutiny of the Department's actions.\"   \n   This week, the Pentagon formally welcomed a new press corps willing to abide by its policy — correspondents and outlets that embrace a pro-Trump tilt or peddle conspiracy theories.   \"We're glad to have you,\" Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson told the newcomers on Tuesday. \"Legacy media chose to self-deport from this building. And if you look at the numbers, it's pretty clear why no one followed them. National trust in these mainstream media outlets has cratered to 28 percent, the lowest ever recorded. The American people don't trust these propagandists because they stopped telling the truth.\"   Among the new arrivals: the far-right political activist Laura Loomer, who often has Trump's ear; the Gateway Pundit, which declared bankruptcy to avoid liability for judgment in defamation suits; and LindellTV, backed by MyPillow founder Mike Lindell, who supported Trump's spurious claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential elections.   Several of the new arrivals posted separate photos on social media claiming they had been told they had been given the former Pentagon office of a Washington Post reporter. At least one corrected himself after being mocked online, saying he had been given mistaken information. He did not specify whether that incorrect information came from Pentagon officials.

Lawmakers in both chambers were shown video of the boat strike behind closed doors in briefings with Navy Admiral Frank M. Bradley, the Special Operations commander who oversaw the operation. After those briefings, leading Democrats expressed shock at what they saw, with the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee calling it \"one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service.\"   \n   \"You have two individuals in clear distress, without any means of locomotion, with a destroyed vessel, who were killed by the United States,\" said Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn. \"Under the D.O.D. manual for abiding by the laws of armed conflict, the specific example given of an impermissible action is attacking a shipwreck,\" he said. \"Any American who sees the video that I saw will see the United States military attacking shipwrecked sailors.\"   Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., told reporters the video showed \"two survivors trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for the United States, back over so they could stay in the fight.\" Cotton, who sits on the Armed Services Committee, described multiple strikes taking place \"minutes apart,\" but said he did not see \"anything disturbing about it.\" He called the strikes \"entirely lawful.\"   The briefings appeared to offer new specifics on an attack that has raised questions from lawmakers and military experts over whether the strikes broke U.S. law or if they constituted a war crime under the administration's assertion that the U.S. is at war with narco traffickers.   \n   When asked about it during a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, President Trump said he didn't know about the second strike.   \"I didn't know anything about people,\" Trump added, referring to the survivors. \"I wasn't involved in it.\"   Hegseth said he did not make the call for any subsequent boat strikes after authorizing the initial strike, but defended sinking the boat and Bradley's decision-making.   \"I watched that first strike live,\" Hegseth said. \"As you can imagine, the Department of War, we got a lot of things to do. So I moved on to my next meeting.\"   \n   During Thursday's briefings, Bradley told lawmakers that he was under no order to kill everyone on board, according to both Cotton and Himes.    \n   But lawmakers are still demanding additional transparency from the White House. After meeting with Bradley, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Jack Reed of Rhode Island, said he still had \"serious questions about the legality of all the strikes\" in the Caribbean.    \"If we don't insist upon strict observation of the rules of war, we can't expect our opponents to do it, and as a result we're jeopardizing the lives of young men and women in our armed services,\" he said in an interview with All Things Considered.     Reed is among several Democrats who have called on the administration to release the full video of the strike. Trump told reporters on Wednesday that he would be willing to release video from the strike, but added that he wasn't aware what footage was captured. He went on to broadly justify the administration's campaign, arguing that by stopping the flow of drugs into the U.S., it benefits the American people.   \"Every boat we knock out, we save 25,000 American lives,\" Trump said.   Watchdog report on Signalgate released   The focus on the boat strike was one of two high-profile operations under focus on Thursday. As Bradley was on Capitol Hill, a Pentagon watchdog released a report finding that Hegseth violated agency policy by using the Signal messaging app to discuss U.S. airstrikes in Yemen earlier this year.   The investigation's findings were the culmination of a months-long probe led by Pentagon Inspector General Steven Stebbins, following a request from the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. It was started after a journalist for The Atlantic reported in March that he had been added to a Signal group chat where a handful of top officials discussed plans to strike Houthi rebels in Yemen.   \n   The 84-page report concludes that Hegseth's decision to share highly sensitive military plans on the commercially available encrypted messaging app, using his personal cell phone, could have jeopardized the safety of American servicemembers and the mission.   \n   \"The Secretary sent nonpublic DoD information identifying the quantity and strike times of manned U.S. aircraft over hostile territory over an unapproved, unsecure network approximately 2 to 4 hours before the execution of those strikes,\" according to the report.   \"Using a personal cell phone to conduct official business and send nonpublic DoD information through Signal risks potential compromise of sensitive DoD information, which could cause harm to DoD personnel and mission objectives,\" it added.   \n   Hegseth declined to be interviewed for Stebbins' investigation and instead provided only a written statement where he argued that the information he shared in the Signal chat did not require classification.   In a statement issued ahead of the report's public release, Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said the findings showed Hegseth did nothing wrong.   \"The Inspector General review is a TOTAL exoneration of Secretary Hegseth and proves what we knew all along — no classified information was shared. This matter is resolved, and the case is closed,\" Parnell said.      NPR disclosure: Katherine Maher, the CEO of NPR, chairs the board of the Signal Foundation.

The decision released Thursday boosts the GOP's chances of preserving its slim majority in the House of Representatives amid an unprecedented gerrymandering fight launched by President Trump, who has been pushing Texas and other GOP-led states to redraw their congressional districts to benefit Republicans.   The high court's unsigned order follows Texas' emergency request for the justices to pause a three-judge panel's ruling blocking the state's recently redrawn map.   \n   After holding a nine-day hearing in October, that panel found challengers of the new map are likely to prove in a trial that the map violates the Constitution by discriminating against voters based on race.   \n   In its majority opinion — authored by a Trump nominee — the panel cited a letter from the Department of Justice and multiple public statements by key Republican state lawmakers that suggested their map-drawer manipulated the racial demographics of voting districts to eliminate existing districts where Black and Latino voters together make up the majority. For the next year's midterms, the panel ordered Texas to keep using the congressional districts the state's GOP-controlled legislature drew in 2021.   But in Texas' filing to the Supreme Court, the state claimed the lawmakers were not motivated by race and were focused instead on drawing new districts that are more likely to elect Republicans.   What the Supreme Court said    In its Thursday decision to side with Texas, the Supreme Court said the panel \"failed to honor the presumption of legislative good faith by construing ambiguous direct and circumstantial evidence against the legislature.\"   The high court also found that, given the release of the panel's ruling in the middle of Texas' candidate filing period, the lower court had \"improperly inserted itself into an active primary campaign, causing much confusion and upsetting the delicate federal-state balance in elections.\"   \n   In a dissenting opinion, however, Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan criticized the court's majority for reversing the panel's decision after a \"perusal, over a holiday weekend, of a cold paper record.\"   The high court's decision \"ensures that many Texas citizens, for no good reason, will be placed in electoral districts because of their race,\" wrote Kagan, who was joined by the court's two other liberals, Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson. \"And that result, as this Court has pronounced year in and year out, is a violation of the Constitution.\"   \n   In November, after the panel blocked the new map, Justice Samuel Alito allowed Texas to temporarily reinstate it while the Supreme Court reviewed the state's emergency request.   Texas state Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, cheered the Supreme Court's ruling on Thursday, saying in a statement that the GOP-drawn map \"reflects the political climate of our state and is a massive win for Texas and every conservative who is tired of watching the left try to upend the political system with bogus lawsuits.\"   Democrats criticized the high court. In a statement, U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in a statement that the \"people of Texas don't want this map, but it was put in place at the behest of national Republicans who are desperate to cling to their majority in the House of Representatives by decimating minority voting opportunity.\"   Texas kicked off a redistricting fight   The mid-decade redistricting plan Texas Republicans passed in August sparked a counter response by Democratic leaders in California, where voters in a special election in November approved a new congressional map that could help Democrats gain five additional House seats. A court hearing for a legal challenge to that map is set for Dec. 15.   The rest of the redistricting landscape remains unsettled as well. Lawsuits are challenging new gerrymanders in places like Missouri, where there is also a contested referendum effort. And other states, including Florida, Indiana and Virginia, may also pursue new districts prior to the midterms.   \n   Last week, a federal court ruled to allow North Carolina's midterm election to be held under a recently redrawn map that could give Republicans an additional seat.   Another wave of congressional redistricting may be coming soon depending on what — and when — the Supreme Court decides in a voting rights case about Louisiana's congressional map. After the court held a rare rehearing for that case in October, some states are watching for a potential earlier-than-usual ruling that may allow Republican-led states to draw more GOP-friendly districts in time for the 2026 midterms.

Newspapers across Europe ran analyses and commentaries about it, and left-wing politicians in Europe took heart from the success of the 34-year-old American democratic socialist.   \n   \"Echoes of hope\" beyond the U.S.   Claire Lejeune, a member of parliament from France's left-wing France Unbowed party, tells NPR Mamdani's victory was a \"beacon of hope.\"   \"Its message echoes not only in the U.S., but also for us in France,\" Lejeune says. Her party sent members to New York to study Mamdani's winning ways on the campaign trail.   In the United Kingdom, Mamdani's victory is even influencing a mayoral race in the seaside region of Sussex and Brighton. The election has now been postponed until May 2028. But a recent a campaign leaflet for the Green Party features two faces — that of the local party candidate, Rachel Millward, and another of New York City's mayor-elect — with the words \"Hope can win.\"   \n   \n            New York just elected @ZohranKMamdani, who offers real hope, over billionaire funded opponents. In May Sussex & Brighton will face a similar choice between real hope and real change with a @TheGreenParty mayor or a big money backed Reform mayor with no real plan for the future. pic.twitter.com/tmi2NiM8iJ— Rachel Millward (@rachelmillward) November 5, 2025\n   \n   The Green Party's national leader, Zack Polanski, has been called charismatic and social media savvy by the British media, with some commentators now asking whether he could be the \"British Mamdani.\" Smiley and upbeat, 43-year-old Polanski has made \"Let's make hope normal again\" his central message.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Zack Polanski, leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, demonstrates in support of a wealth tax in Parliament Square in London, on Nov. 25.\n                \n                    Guy Smallman/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Guy Smallman/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Polanski has helped the Green Party double its membership and perform much better in public opinion polls, rivaling big establishment parties such as the governing center-left Labour Party and the center-right Conservatives.   \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n                    YouTube\n                \n        \n   \"A right-wing newspaper recently called me a 'joyful warrior,' and I thought that was such an amazing description of Zohran, actually,\" Polanski tells NPR in an interview in London.   \n   But he says the two have more in common than their social media skills.   \"I think more important than any of that is the message. Lowering bills, taxing billionaires. For Zohran, it's about affordable rents, universal childcare,\" Polanski says. \"The message that he's sending ultimately about the inequality that exists in New York, I want to take that whole message and spread it across an entire country.\"   It's a message, he says, which is resonating with voters in towns and cities across England, as it did with New Yorkers.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Heidi Reichinnek, a German lawmaker with the Left party, speaks at a news conference before a meeting on the upcoming budget, Nov. 24.\n                \n                    Kay Nietfeld/picture alliance via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kay Nietfeld/picture alliance via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Heidi Reichinnek, co-leader of Germany's democratic-socialist Left Party, tells NPR her party also plans to focus on affordability and the cost of living in upcoming local elections.   \n   \"The [Mamdani] campaign was focusing on rent freeze, free and fast buses, free childcare, everything to make life better for the majority,\" Reichinnek says. \"When you listen to people and make their problems your agenda, that resonates with them.\"   Reichinnek says she was also heartened by Mamdani's inclusive message.   \"He never threw anyone under the bus to gain the approval of right-wing voters. He stood behind immigrants, queer people, unemployed people and never wavered. The best solution against right-wing propaganda is a strong leftist stand.\"   \n   Mamdani's campaign and message have also drawn criticism, with some claiming it was a gift to President Trump. \"The election of the left-wing extremist Mamdani as mayor of New York benefits Trump,\" far-right Alternative for Germany lawmaker Maximilian Krah wrote on X. \"He can now hold the entire Democratic Party jointly responsible for the foreseeable disaster in New York.\"   \n   And Mamdani has been attacked for his support for Palestinians and criticism of Israel, with French far-right politician Marion Maréchal suggesting New York could turn into a \"pro-Hamas\" zone. \"No country, no city is now safe from a takeover by the woke and Islamist left,\" she wrote on social media.   Mamdani, who is New York City's first Muslim mayor-elect, has called attacks about his faith and comparisons to extremists \"racist and baseless.\"   Europe's leftists hope to learn from Mamdani's winning ways   But progressive politicians are taking notes. U.K. Green Party leader Polanski tells NPR his video team is meeting some of Mamdani's videographers to pick up some tips.   \"It's exciting to see that cross-exchange happen,\" Polanski says, adding he hopes there will be more to come.   \n   In France, Lejeune hopes a Mamdani-inspired approach will help her party make gains in both local and presidential elections in the next couple of years.   \"If we want to stop the far right from getting into power in the next local elections then we've got to show the French people that we don't have to adopt the same kind of policies again and again that deteriorate the quality of life for everyone.\"   In Britain, national parliamentary elections are four years away. But the political landscape is changing, with a system once dominated by Labour and the Conservatives making way for others, including the far-right Reform U.K. and the Greens.   \n   Polanski sees in this an opportunity for his own leftist politics.   \"I can't tell you whether we're going to fall to the right and to fascism or whether we're going to go to the left, to a more progressive politics that cares about people and planet. I'm obviously hoping it's the latter, and I intend to do everything I can to make sure it's the latter.\"   Reichinnek, from Germany's Left Party, says her movement hopes to emulate the Mamdani campaign in upcoming elections in Germany, by \"going from door to door, talking to people, explaining that we can change something for the better.\"   \n   For now, Mamdani has given politicians on the left in Europe new momentum.   For Reichinnek, he's shown that success is possible.   \"We can face the billionaires, the right-wing extremists and win,\" she says.\n",

In the middle of his discussion, he threw in a mention of former President Obama, although Trump did not say what he thought Obama and Somalis might have in common. He was following up on Tuesday's ramble when he discussed Somalis and others convicted of defrauding social service programs in Minnesota.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: We're going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country. Ilhan Omar is garbage. She's garbage. Her friends are garbage. These aren't people that work. These aren't people that say, let's go. Come on, let's make this place great.MARTIN: NPR's Mara Liasson is here to tell us more about all this. Good morning, Mara.MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning.MARTIN: So, you know, Mara, we've heard Trump target immigrant groups before, from the first day of his first campaign for president, in fact. But calling an entire community of people garbage, I mean, is there something different here?LIASSON: Yes. I think even by Trump's standards of nativism and xenophobia, these attacks were pretty harsh. You know, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar has been one of Trump's favorite targets for quite some time. He belittled her on social media recently, saying she's, quote, \"always wrapped in her swaddling hijab.\" He's told her to go back where she came from, even though she's an American citizen. And this does come, as you say, at a time when there's this big financial scandal in Minnesota - federal prosecutors have convicted or indicted dozens of people for defrauding social services funding, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, according to Minnesota Public Radio. Most of those convicted are of Somali descent. The vast majority of Somalis in the Minneapolis region are U.S. citizens, but the situation has provided the chance for Trump to attack Omar and the entire Somali community. And here's what he said.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: They contribute nothing. The welfare is like 88%. They contribute nothing. I don't want them in our country. I'll be honest with you.MARTIN: So let me just say here that there's no evidence that what he said is accurate. But having said that, what do you think he gains from this?LIASSON: I think this has been a tried-and-true tactic for him over the last 10 years, these nativist attacks. I think they attract attention. They can distract from problems he's having. You know, he denigrated Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals. During the 2024 campaign, he and JD Vance repeated false rumors that Haitian immigrants were eating cats and dogs.MARTIN: Could it be that he's also lashing out because he's frustrated? I mean, he's - his approval ratings are low. He has not achieved a number of the things that he claimed he was going to achieve, including peace in Ukraine, etc, and I just wonder if this part of the way he reacts to situations where he's not doing well.LIASSON: I think that's right. His approval ratings are low. His base is solid, but independents give him a 25% approval rating, and Republicans are going to need those independent voters in the 2026 elections. Maybe they would rather have him bring prices down than attack immigrants.MARTIN: So we don't know whether this is going to continue. As we mentioned, this has gone on for a couple of days now. The President is meeting with some African leaders today. How do you...LIASSON: That's right.MARTIN: ...Think that's going to go?LIASSON: Well, they're not from Somalia. They're from Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. They're here to sign a U.S.-brokered peace deal. Trump is taking credit for solving the conflict between these two countries, and he's adding this to a long list of wars he claims to have ended. It's all part of him making the case for why he should get the Nobel Peace Prize.MARTIN: That is NPR's Mara Liasson. Mara, thank you.LIASSON: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

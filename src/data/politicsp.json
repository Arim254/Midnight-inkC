James Comer, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, continued to press for criminal contempt of Congress charges against both Clintons Monday evening for defying a congressional subpoena when attorneys for the Clintons emailed staff for the Oversight panel, saying the pair would accept Comer's demands and \"will appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates.\"   The attorneys requested that Comer, a Kentucky Republican, agree not to move forward with the contempt proceedings. Comer, however, said he was not immediately dropping the charges, which would carry the threat of a substantial fine and even incarceration if passed by the House and successfully prosecuted by the Department of Justice.   \n   \"We don't have anything in writing,\" Comer told reporters, adding that he was open to accepting the Clintons' offer but \"it depends on what they say.\"   \n   The last-minute negotiating came as Republican leaders were advancing the contempt resolution through the House Rules Committee — a final hurdle before it headed to the House floor for a vote. It was potentially a grave moment for Congress, the first time it could hold a former president in contempt and advance the threat of prison time.   As Comer and the Clintons negotiated over the terms of the depositions, the House Rules Committee postponed advancing the contempt of Congress resolutions.   \n   Comer earlier Monday rejected an offer from attorneys for the Clintons to have Bill Clinton conduct a transcribed interview and Hillary Clinton submit a sworn declaration. He insisted that both Clintons sit for sworn depositions before the committee in order to fulfill the panel's subpoenas.   A letter from the committee to attorneys for the Clintons indicated that they had offered for Bill Clinton to conduct a 4-hour transcribed interview on \"matters related to the investigations and prosecutions of Jeffrey Epstein\" and for Hillary Clinton to submit a sworn declaration.   \"The Clintons do not get to dictate the terms of lawful subpoenas,\" Comer said.   \n   The former president and secretary of state had resisted the subpoenas for months after the Oversight panel issued subpoenas for their testimony in August as it opened an investigation into Epstein and his associates. Their attorneys had tried to argue against the validity of the subpoena.   However, as Comer threatened to begin contempt of Congress proceedings, the Clintons started negotiating towards a compromise. The Republican-controlled Oversight committee advanced criminal contempt of Congress charges last month. Nine of the committee's 21 Democrats joined Republicans in support of the charges against Bill Clinton as they argued for full transparency in the Epstein investigation. Three Democrats also supported advancing the charges against Hillary Clinton.   Republicans push Bill Clinton's involvement   Bill Clinton's relationship with Epstein has reemerged as a focal point for Republicans amid the push for a reckoning over Epstein, who killed himself in 2019 in a New York jail cell as he faced sex trafficking charges.   Clinton, like a bevy of other high-powered men, had a well-documented relationship with Epstein in the late 1990s and early 2000s. He has not been accused of wrongdoing in his interactions with the late financier.   The Clintons have remained highly critical of Comer's decision, saying he was bringing politics into the investigation while failing to hold the Trump administration accountable for delays in producing the Department of Justice's case files on Epstein.   \"They negotiated in good faith. You did not,\" a spokesperson for the Clintons, Angel Ureña, said in response to Comer's threats on Monday. \"They told you under oath what they know, but you don't care.\"   Still, the prospect of a vote raised the potential for Congress to use one of its most severe punishments against a former president for the first time. Historically, Congress has given deference to former presidents. None has ever been forced to testify before lawmakers, although a few have voluntarily done so.   \n   House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said earlier Monday that his caucus would have a discussion on the contempt resolutions later in the week but remained noncommittal on whipping votes against them.   Jeffries said he was a \"hard no\" on contempt and accused Comer of focusing on political retribution rather than investigating the delayed release of case files. Democrats also say the Justice Department has not yet released all the material it has on the late financier.   \"They don't want a serious interview, they want a charade,\" Jeffries said.\n",

Some Democratic leaders have vowed to hold federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers accountable — even charging them with crimes.   After an ICE surge in Chicago last year, state leaders established the Illinois Accountability Commission to collect evidence from citizens about ICE's actions, including the agency's leadership, and to make accountability recommendations.   The chair of the commission and former federal judge, Rubén Castillo, says the group is having conversations with local law enforcement to \"suggest prosecutions that should be coming as we speak.\"   \n   Prosecutors in Philadelphia and California say they are also considering criminal charges against federal agents.   Can states charge federal agents with crimes?    White House officials have raised the idea of agents having immunity when they're on the job, but legal experts say that is not the case.   \"There is no structural or blanket barrier to states bringing a criminal prosecution against federal officials,\" says Harrison Stark, an attorney who works with the University of Wisconsin Law School's State Democracy Research Initiative.   \"If a state believes that a federal official has violated state criminal law,\" Stark says, \"the state has broad Investigatory Powers to collect evidence, to explore that criminal action, basically in the same way they would against anybody else.\"   And it's not just about criminal prosecutions; Illinois has a law on the books that allows people to sue federal agents in civil court. The Trump administration has sued to block the law, saying it violates federal powers. Democratic lawmakers in New York, California, Colorado and Oregon are considering similar laws.   Republican-led states lean into enforcement   After Trump took office last year, many red states jumped to support the president's mass deportation efforts.   In Tennessee, the state provides grants to law enforcement agencies that work with ICE. Since that was passed last year, the number of sheriff's offices and police departments that have signed a formal agreement with ICE has skyrocketed.   \n   Now, Republican lawmakers in the state are considering making that voluntary program involuntary as part of a bigger immigration package. Kentucky lawmakers are moving in the same direction.   This year, Tennessee is piloting legislation made in partnership with Steven Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, and the White House.   One of the policies would make it impossible for someone without legal status to buy a car, earn a nursing certificate or receive any government benefits. (Many government benefits are already off-limits to people living in the country illegally.) \"We're not spending taxpayer dollars on you unless you're in jail,\" is how Cameron Sexton, the Republican Tennessee House Speaker, explained it when announcing the legislation.   The Indiana Senate last week passed a measure that would tighten requirements for local agencies, including universities, to cooperate with immigration enforcement. Last month, New Hampshire took a page out of Tennessee's book by banning sanctuary cities. Meaning, cities can't impede federal immigration officers from carrying out their duties.   Blue states limiting ICE cooperation   Some Democratic-led states are considering mask bans or ID requirements for federal agents. California's law on that is currently tied up in court.   Illinois has a law limiting police cooperation with ICE that lawmakers say they want to expand this year. Last week, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced legislation to do that, too.   Maine has set up a tipline to report ICE activity and abuses.   Democrats in other states, including Massachusetts, are looking at creating \"safe zones\" around courthouses, schools, churches and hospitals where agents are not allowed to make arrests.   In a couple of weeks, the Minnesota legislature will meet for the first time since the ICE surge there. Democrats say they're ready to pass a bill that would enable Minnesotans to sue federal agents, and changes to help renters affected by immigration enforcement avoid eviction.    \n   While Democrats control the Minnesota Senate, the state House is split between the two parties, meaning Democrats will need some Republican support to pass any new proposals.\n",

As American athletes turn their attention to the Games here, some — including several from Minnesota, which is home to some of Team USA's biggest stars — have spoken out in the wake of the shooting deaths of two U.S. citizens by federal agents in January.   \"I want to make sure you know who I'm racing for when I get to the start line at the Olympics,\" wrote Jessie Diggins, the cross-country skiing star and three-time Olympic medalist, in a statement she posted to her Instagram on Saturday alongside a photo of herself celebrating with an American flag at the 2022 Olympics in Beijing.   \n   \"I'm racing for an American people who stand for love, for acceptance, for compassion, honesty and respect for others. I do not stand for hate or violence or discrimination,\" the post continued. Diggins, 34, grew up in Afton, Minn., less than an hour's drive from downtown Minneapolis. She is expected to compete in six cross-country events at the Olympics this month and could contend for a medal in all of them.   The day after 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti was shot to death by Customs and Border Protection agents on a Minneapolis street, Team USA hockey player Kelly Pannek paused a post-game press conference for her professional team, the Minnesota Frost, to call the aggressive immigration enforcement \"unnecessary and just horrifying.\"   \"It's obviously really heavy,\" said Pannek, who is from the Minneapolis suburb of Plymouth, as her Frost teammate and fellow Team USA member Taylor Heise — another Minnesota native — nodded. \"What I'm most proud to represent is the tens of thousands of people that show up on some of the coldest days of the year to stand and fight for what they believe in.\"   Other Olympians who are not from Minnesota, including snowboarders Stacy Gaskill of Denver and Bea Kim of Palos Verdes, Calif., have spoken out in advance of the Games. \"The Olympics are more than just sport. They represent global unity and peace,\" wrote the 19-year-old Kim in a post on Sunday. \"Diversity is what makes the United States so special. It is woven into the very fabric of our country.\"   \n   The Winter Olympians join a vocal chorus of prominent athletes who have spoken up about the Trump administration's tactics in Minneapolis.   Indiana Pacers point guard Tyrese Haliburton, who was part of Team USA's gold medal run at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, wrote that Pretti \"was murdered,\" and the three-time Olympic gold medalist Breanna Stewart held a sign that read \"Abolish ICE\" at a game for the 3-on-3 league Unrivaled last week. \"I think that when human lives are at stake, it's bigger than anything else,\" she said in a press conference afterward.   In Milan, a hospitality space for friends and family of Team USA athletes was renamed over the weekend to drop the word \"ice\" from the name.   In a statement, the three governing bodies who operate the newly-named \"Winter House\" said that the new name would better suit the intent of the space, which was originally called the \"Ice House.\"   \"Our hospitality concept was designed to be a private space free of distractions where athletes, their families, and friends can come together to celebrate the unique experience of the Winter Games,\" reads a statement released by U.S. Figure Skating, USA Hockey and US Speed Skating of the name change, which was first reported by USA Today. \"This name captures that vision and connects to the season and the event.\"\n",

Convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's private communications continue to reveal the web of powerful figures who sought his friendship and counsel. Internal notes from the Justice Department show the extent of allegations made against Epstein — but also against others who have not faced criminal charges for sex trafficking.   Speaking on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said new charges for anyone are unlikely.   \"I can't talk about any investigations, but I will say the following, which is that in July, the Department of Justice said that we had reviewed the 'Epstein files,' and there was nothing in there that allowed us to prosecute anybody,\" he said. \"We then released over 3 1/2 million pieces of paper, which the entire world can look at now and see if we got it wrong.\"   \n   Here are four takeaways from the latest release of the Epstein files.   The files aren't organized and have issues with redactions   NPR's review of the documents has found numerous examples of the Justice Department failing to redact names of publicly identified victims of sexual abuse as well as names of individuals who have not previously been publicized.   The Epstein Files Transparency Act, signed by President Trump last year, called for the Justice Department to minimize its redactions while turning over information about the life and death of Epstein and the criminal charges he and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell faced. Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence in federal prison for sexual exploitation and trafficking of children, crimes she committed with Epstein.   Those redactions, too, are inconsistent with what the law directs.   \"In addition to the documentary redactions, which includes personal identifying information, victim information and other privileges, there is extensive redaction to images and videos to protect victims,\" Blanche said Friday, announcing the final batch of files. \"We redacted every woman depicted in any image or video, with the exception of Ms. Maxwell. We did not redact images of any men unless it was impossible to redact the woman without also redacting the man.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A document with an email chain from Jeffrey Epstein photographed Sunday illustrates the amount of redactions of personally identifiable information that the U.S. Department of Justice was required to do before release of Epstein documents.\n                \n                    Jon Elswick/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jon Elswick/AP\n    \n\n   \n   But multiple examples can be found in the Epstein files repository that show the faces of women and hide the faces of men, including one text message conversation between former Trump adviser Steve Bannon and Epstein where Trump's face in a news article was obscured with a black box.   \n   The files aren't shared in chronological order or grouped in any identifiable way. Countless duplicate copies of email threads, investigative files and correspondence are spread throughout the database, sometimes with different levels of redactions applied.   The same PowerPoint presentation prepared last fall by the Justice Department detailing the timeline and cases against Epstein and Maxwell, alleged victims and powerful figures in his orbit who faced allegations of misconduct appears six times with different information blocked out in each version.   \n   Annie Farmer, one of the women who testified in court against Epstein and Maxwell, told NPR's All Things Considered on Monday that the redaction issues felt intentional.    \"There's just no explanation for how it could've been done so poorly,\" she said. \"They've had victims' names for a very long time. I don't think this is just about rushing to get this information out.\"   A Department of Justice spokesperson said in a statement to NPR that the department \"takes victim protection very seriously and has redacted thousands of victim names in the millions of published pages to protect the innocent.\"   \"The Department had 500 reviewers looking at millions of pages for this very reason, to meet the requirements of the act while protecting victims,\" the statement reads. \"When a victim's name is alleged to be unredacted, our team is working around the clock to fix the issue and republish appropriately redacted pages as soon as possible. To date, 0.1% of released pages have been found to have victim identifying information unredacted.\"   That number, if taken at face value, would suggest more than 3,000 pages revealed sensitive information about Epstein victims.    A federal judge in New York will hold a hearing Wednesday morning on a request from victims' lawyers to shut down the dedicated website for the trove of documents until all victim information is removed. Several files NPR previously identified that contained personally identifying information have since been removed.   \n   Epstein's connections are vast and personal   Epstein surrounded himself with wealthy and influential people throughout his life from a variety of disciplines and ideologies. A revealing prison psychiatric evaluation, published following his death by suicide while awaiting a federal trial in 2019, said the enigmatic financier had few close friends, despite having a huge social circle.   \"He had been a successful, wealthy businessman with a number of high-profile acquaintances that he accumulated through a combination of charisma, charm, and intelligence. Despite his many associates, he had limited significant or deep interpersonal ties,\" the evaluation said. \"Although Mr. Epstein appeared to cultivate a large social and professional network, he was estranged from his only brother. Indeed, his identity appeared to be based on his wealth, power, and association with other high profile individuals.\"   The more than 3 million pages released by the Justice Department last Friday show how many of his relationships with prominent figures in Hollywood, finance and politics continued well after Epstein was convicted in Florida in 2008 of sex crimes. Appearing in the files and in communications with Epstein is not an indication of wrongdoing or knowledge of Epstein's crimes.   Epstein and billionaire Elon Musk were in contact several times over many years, according to these documents, including several unsuccessful attempts for the two to meet.   \"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?,\" Musk asked in 2012.   \"sorry we didn't connect,\" Epstein wrote a few weeks later.   The newest batch of files includes numerous messages with the spiritualist Deepak Chopra about his finances, notes from a meeting with the founder of popular image board 4chan, Christopher Poole, and more conversations with figures like former Obama White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler and former Clinton Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who have already faced scrutiny for their Epstein ties.   A look into Epstein's finances   Epstein's notoriety stems in part from his work as a financial adviser and his sizable wealth.   \n   The new files fill in some pictures about his money and how he used it. As a child, Epstein attended the Interlochen Center of the Arts, a nonprofit that runs an arts-focused school and summer camp, in the summer of 1967. Records show Epstein participated in programs for the bassoon, radio and orchestra.   These records from Interlochen released by the DOJ also show that Epstein donated close to $400,000 to the center, which has a campus in Michigan, from 1990 to 2003.   Epstein's history at the camp and years of donations were confirmed by the center last December. The organization said it distanced itself from Epstein after his conviction in 2008.   \n   The organization said, \"Interlochen conducted an internal review and found no record of complaint or concern about Epstein. All donor recognition in his name was removed from campus at that time. Subsequent to Epstein's second arrest in July 2019, we again reviewed our records and found no report or complaint involving Epstein within our records.\"   Epstein and his ex-girlfriend and accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell are alleged to have used the Interlochen campus as a hunting ground, however. During Maxwell's criminal trial, a woman testified that she met the couple when she was a girl while in between classes at the camp in the early '90s. The couple gained her mother's trust and when she returned home to Florida, the girl and her mother visited Epstein and Maxwell. Afterward the girl said she was groomed and sexually abused.   Interlochen said in a statement following this testimony, \"No abuse is alleged to have taken place on the Interlochen campus. Our policies, then and now, do not permit unsupervised contact between students and donors.\"   Epstein updated his trust two days before death   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A document that was included in the U.S. Department of Justice release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, photographed Sunday, shows the report when Epstein was taken into custody on July 6, 2019.\n                \n                    Jon Elswick/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jon Elswick/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Just two days before his death by suicide in a Manhattan jail cell Aug. 10, 2019, Epstein updated his will for the last time. He planned to dole out his considerable wealth to a host of friends, employees, business associates and his brother's children upon his death.   \n   The deceased sex offender and disgraced financier's trust, which was not previously made public, details how Epstein wanted his millions of dollars, and his properties including the infamous Little Saint James Island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, distributed to at least 44 people.   Epstein signed his trust on Aug. 8, 2019. The document was signed by his longtime lawyer Darren Indyke on Aug. 18, 2019, eight days after Epstein's death. His accountant, Richard Kahn, signed it two days later.   Under this trust, Indyke was set to get $50 million and Kahn $25 million.   Epstein's last known girlfriend, Karyna Shuliak, was set to get the bulk of Epstein's fortune, including $50 million outright a year after his death, his New Mexico Zorro Ranch property, his two properties in the U.S. Virgin Islands, his Paris apartment, his Palm Beach home and his Upper East Side townhouse in Manhattan.   Epstein also bequeathed Shuliak multiple pieces of jewelry, including an almost 33 carat diamond ring and 48 separate loose diamonds previously given to her \"in contemplation of marriage,\" the trust says in a handwritten note in blue ink.   Maxwell and Epstein's brother were set to get $10 million each, with Mark Epstein's share intended to go to a trust to benefit his children.   It's unclear how much money each of these beneficiaries actually received following Epstein's death. At the time of his death, his estate was valued at close to $600 million, according to court documents from the U.S. Virgin Islands. But after he died, victims of Epstein received more than $120 million from a fund dedicated to compensating more than 100 victims.   According to the records released by the DOJ, the former billionaire updated and amended his will and trust more than two dozen times over many years. The regular changes offer some insight on the prominent people who circled in and out of Epstein's inner circle over the years.   \n   In a version of Epstein's trust from 2012, Jean Luc Brunel, a modeling scout and close associate of Epstein's for decades, is listed as getting as much as $5 million.   Brunel was arrested in 2020 by French authorities and held on charges of rape of minors and trafficking of minors for sexual exploitation. Before he could face trial, he died by suicide in a French jail cell.   Brunel denied any wrongdoing.\n",

David Ake/AP\n    \n\n   \n   After a turbulent first year of President Trump's return to the White House, 2026 could bring something singularly disruptive in the housing and mortgage markets: a partial sale of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled mortgage giants that underpin roughly 70% of U.S. home loans.   The idea, promoted by Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Director Bill Pulte and Trump himself, has alarmed critics, who warn that unwinding the 17-year federal conservatorship of the two firms could rattle financial markets and drive up mortgage rates, while potentially generating billions of dollars for key Trump supporters. Pulte has said the administration is \"looking to extract … value from [Fannie and Freddie] for the benefit of the U.S. taxpayers.\"   \n   Economists point out that there also could be significant risks for taxpayers and that the government would be giving up something of value that it currently controls and effectively owns.   What are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?   The Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac) sit at the core of the $13 trillion U.S. housing finance system, guaranteeing mortgages to keep credit flowing and homeownership accessible to more people. Buying a home is the biggest purchase most Americans ever make. And fronting all that money to people is a risky proposition for lenders. So loan guarantees provided by Fannie and Freddie remove some of the risk for mortgage companies, which makes them more willing to make home loans and brings down the cost of borrowing for homebuyers.   Formed more than 50 years ago as government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie and Freddie were owned by private stockholders before the 2008 housing crash, when the government took them over to prevent their collapse. Since then, Congress and previous administrations have deferred efforts to reprivatize them due to disagreement over the best approach and concern that a misstep could hurt the housing market and broader economy.   \n   Now the Trump administration says it may move ahead on at least a partial reprivatization of Fannie and Freddie. Conservatives generally don't like the government having as big a footprint in the mortgage market as it has now with Fannie and Freddie in conservatorship. But Pulte and other administration officials haven't presented a detailed case for why now is the time to start the process. And not everyone thinks it can work, at least given what the administration has said so far.   \n   \"I would be surprised if Mr. Pulte can do this,\" says Simon Johnson, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Johnson describes multiple proposals floated by the Trump administration as \"complete confusion.\"   Who is Bill Pulte?   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, speaks to reporters outside the West Wing of the White House on Jan. 9.\n                \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP vis Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brendan Smialowski/AFP vis Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Pulte, 37, has been at the center of controversy since March, when he was appointed by Trump to lead the FHFA,  the agency that has overseen Fannie and Freddie since the government assumed control over them. He is the grandson of William J. Pulte, who in 1950 founded Pulte Homes, a large homebuilding firm. Aside from serving on PulteGroup's board, however, the younger Pulte's housing experience is limited, and critics have repeatedly questioned his lack of expertise.   As head of the FHFA, Pulte quickly fired a large share of the companies' boards and installed himself as chairman of both Fannie and Freddie. It's a move that Johnson, who was one of the board members Pulte fired, considers legally dubious. Federal law states that the FHFA director may not hold any office or position at Fannie or Freddie or an affiliated entity, yet Pulte made himself chairman anyway.   \"It's very unorthodox,\" notes Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, while Johnson argues that it's \"striking and extremely weird\" that a \"fundamental legal underpinning\" of the FHFA is being ignored.   The FHFA maintains that Pulte has the legal authority to make himself chairman, and he does have broad powers over the companies while they are in conservatorship. The FHFA declined to comment for this story.   Pulte has joined the president in loudly demanding that the Federal Reserve lower interest rates, a move that economists warn threatens the independence of the central bank. He has also raised eyebrows by bringing to bear the agency's investigative authority to go after Trump's political opponents for alleged mortgage fraud.   \n   Last year, Pulte accused Federal Reserve Gov. Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud — an allegation that she has denied and that her attorney has called \"baseless.\" Cook, a Biden appointee, is the first Black woman to serve on the Fed's Board of Governors. The White House later cited the fraud accusation as grounds for removing her, a step without precedent in the Federal Reserve's more than 100-year history. The case is being considered by the Supreme Court, which has allowed Cook to remain in the job for now.   Pulte has also been at the center of other less consequential controversies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was asked on CNBC to respond to a number of media reports detailing how after Pulte bad-mouthed him to Trump, Bessent threatened to punch Pulte in the face. \"Treasury secretaries dating back to Alexander Hamilton have a history of dueling\" was Bessent's response.   Talk about selling shares of Fannie and Freddie   Throughout 2025, Pulte has floated the idea of a stock offering to sell off at least a portion of Fannie and Freddie to private investors. Although he has urged caution as to the shape of any offering, he has also repeatedly stressed that any decision about when it might proceed and how it might be structured is the president's alone. In an attempt to nudge down mortgage rates last month, Trump ordered the companies to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, increasing uncertainty about the timing of reprivatization. But in a recent interview on CNBC, Pulte declined to rule it out, saying the president would decide in the next month or two whether to move ahead with the plan.   \"It's entirely up to the president what he'll decide to do with regard to the IPO of Fannie and Freddie,\" he said, referring to an initial public offering.   If the administration decides to move ahead, the stakes are high.   \n   \"There are severe problems if they don't get it right. And there are potential financial systemic problems,\" says Susan Wachter, the co-director of the Penn Institute for Urban Research.   What's at stake is a lot of money, according to MIT's Johnson. \"If it's done wrong, then you could create risks for the government in the future.\" He says a misstep could drive up the interest rate that people have to pay on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages.   While Pulte has said selling shares of Fannie and Freddie would \"extract value\" for taxpayers, Zandi disagrees.   \"From a budgetary perspective, it means nothing,\" says Zandi. That's because, he says, the government controls and effectively owns these valuable institutions and even has the right to take all their profits — billions of dollars a year. So in a stock offering, he says, taxpayers would be giving up something of value in exchange for an equal amount of cash.   \" So at the end of the day, it has no benefit to taxpayers,\" Zandi says.   Key Trump donors could make billions   Some billionaire Trump donors could get a massive windfall in a reprivatization of Fannie and Freddie. When the companies had to be rescued in the 2008 housing crisis, their stock prices collapsed since the government then essentially owned and controlled them outright. Some investors later bought those shares at fire-sale prices, speculating that an eventual release of Fannie and Freddie from federal control would cause their stakes to be worth a lot more. Those shareholders have largely been at the mercy of what the government decides to do next. An exit from conservatorship could nearly wipe out the value of that old stock or could be structured in a way that significantly rewards those investors.   \"The government holds the cards here,\" says Mike Calhoun, president of the Center for Responsible Lending, a nonpartisan research and policy organization. He says shareholders have filed lawsuits demanding that the government pay the holders of that old stock something. But how much they get — a pittance or a massive profit —that's something the administration could dictate the terms on. \"How much hardball do they wanna play?\" asks Calhoun.   \n   The billionaire investors with large holdings of that old stock include prominent hedge fund managers who happen to be major Trump donors and vocal supporters: Bill Ackman, through his Pershing Square hedge fund, holds stakes in both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that a year ago were estimated to be worth about $1 billion. He has been publicly calling for the government-sponsored enterprises to exit conservatorship. Analysts who track the holdings of prominent investors suggest that John Paulson has made large investments in Fannie and Freddie, but the current size and value of his holdings are not publicly known. A spokesman for Paulson declined to comment.   \n   The potential for an investor windfall has not gone unnoticed by the ranking member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.   \" I am very worried that the Trump administration is very focused on how the billionaires are gonna do in any Fannie/Freddie deal,\" Warren told NPR, \"and not paying any attention at all to what the young family that's hoping to buy their first home is gonna do as a consequence of any deal.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., attends a hearing of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee on April 26, 2022.\n                \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Win McNamee/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   A spokesman for Pershing Square declined to comment, but in a post on X, Ackman said he was aware of suggestions that investors holding Fannie and Freddie stock, \"which include many supporters of @realDonaldTrump, are looking for a gift from the President.\"   \"Nothing could be further from the truth,\" Ackman said.   \n   Why exiting conservatorship is so tricky   \"The idea under conservatorship is that you kind of work through the problems, put these institutions back on a sound financial footing, and then at some point, you make them private again — you release them,\" Zandi says.   In an interview on Fox Business last year, Treasury Secretary Bessent suggested that selling even a small portion of Fannie and Freddie back to private investors might amount to about $30 billion, \"one of the biggest deals, maybe the biggest deal in history.\"   \n   \"These are very large companies — valuations in the hundreds of billions of dollars — so if we were to sell a 3% to 6% stake, it would work out to at least that,\" he said.   But releasing the companies back into private ownership — what some economists refer to as putting them \"into the wild\" — is easier said than done and involves making some big decisions that for well over a decade Congress and prior administrations have been unable to reach consensus on.   Since Fannie and Freddie are the cornerstone of the multitrillion-dollar U.S. mortgage market, they are the very definition of too big to fail. The federal government already showed that it is willing to step in with hundreds of billions of dollars if necessary to bail out the firms. The stark alternative would be systemic financial and economic calamity.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                James Lockhart, then the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, speaks at a meeting in Washington, D.C., in December 2008.\n                \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   James Lockhart, a former FHFA director appointed by President George W. Bush, says investors could profit by owning Fannie and Freddie stock from before the 2008 crash, but the government was on the hook for far too much risk. He says it was \"heads, the shareholders win; tails, the taxpayers lose.\"   Lockhart says that equation should be fixed before Fannie and Freddie are released. Given their systemic importance, Fannie and Freddie will always have some sort of implicit backing by the government.   \n   In a May post on Truth Social, Trump wrote: \"I am working on TAKING THESE AMAZING COMPANIES PUBLIC, but I want to be clear, the U.S. Government will keep its implicit GUARANTEES, and I will stay strong in my position on overseeing them as President.\"   But the details of that government backstop and how big a cash cushion the companies would be required to hold in reserve for emergencies to protect taxpayers from another bailout are key issues that have not been decided.   \n   What will the old shares of stock held by investors be worth? Under the terms of the government bailout, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac still owe hundreds of billions of dollars to the government. Will that debt be forgiven? And if Fannie and Freddie are reprivatized, what authority will the government retain over access to mortgage credit for everyday Americans seeking to buy homes?   Calhoun, of the Center for Responsible Lending, says uncertainty about a public stock offering would likely result in higher mortgage rates because the investors who bankroll those loans would demand higher compensation for the increased risk.   \"There's pretty wide agreement [that] there is a risk of disruption in the market from a Fannie and Freddie stock offering or release from conservatorship,\" Calhoun says.   In an interview in May on CNBC, Pulte seemed to walk back the idea that the administration had a plan to fully reprivatize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.   \"I didn't say privatize; Trump didn't say privatize,\" he said. \"We're talking about an IPO … but we could do that and keep them in conservatorship.\"   Calhoun says Pulte appears to be suggesting that the government could sell off just a slice of Fannie and Freddie to investors without rocking the housing-market boat too much, while figuring out the exit from conservatorship later. But until those larger questions are answered, experts say, it will be impossible for investors to know how to value any such stock offering.   \"There's really no value there unless the government decides to give up some of the value they have,\" Lockhart says.   Zandi points to the long list of unanswered questions: Will Fannie and Freddie truly be private? What will their capital standards be? What role will the government continue to play, and how will the companies be regulated? \"If you can't answer any of those questions,\" he says, \"how can an investor really, truly value these companies?\"   \n   \"I'm skeptical,\" Zandi says. \"Investors can't know what the value of these institutions are until they understand what the end state is.\"   If the Trump administration pushed ahead anyway, that would likely mean investors would offer a lower price for the stock than they would if an exit from conservatorship were more clearly defined, because without that clarity there's greater risk for investors.   \"Taxpayers wouldn't get a fair price for the companies' stock,\" Calhoun says.\n",

It was the speed of his deportation — from working in Maryland one week, to getting whisked off to a notorious prison in El Salvador the next. But it was also because it was a mistake: something a government lawyer admitted in court.   Immigration lawyers said Abrego Garcia's landmark case highlights the challenges with the speed and scale of the Trump administration's goal of mass deportations.   \"We really thought this was going to be one of a kind,\" said Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Abrego Garcia's lawyers. \"If anything, it was just the tip of the spear. There have been countless illegal deportation cases since then. If anything, the problem is getting worse and not better.\"   \n   Sandoval-Moshenberg said he alone has a dozen other plaintiffs like Abrego Garcia. It's impossible to quantify how many such mistaken deportations are happening — as only a small subset of immigrants have lawyers to argue for their return. But judges have stepped in with other cases.   \n   For example, last April — the same month a Maryland judge told the government to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. — another judge in the state asked for the return of Daniel Lozano-Camargo, a 20-year-old Venezuelan man, identified in court documents as \"Cristian.\"   And in July, a New York appeals panel ordered immigration officials to return Jordin Melgar-Salmeron, a 31-year-old Salvadoran.   All three were held at a notorious prison in El Salvador that has since been described by detainees as unsanitary and violent. Judges said that these removals violated court orders.   \n   Meeting deportation targets   Advocates warn that the speed at which the administration is removing some people increases the possibility of errors. President Trump has set a target of one million deportations a year, and administration officials have often set daily quotas for removals.   In some cases, people have been in custody for just days before they're deported — either to their home countries or to third countries that agree to take in deportees from the U.S.   \"They are errors that result when different parts of the system aren't communicating well or when things are moving too fast. And things moving too fast is really where we've seen this administration lean in,\" said Dara Lind, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council.   \n   Some people get sent to countries where judges have specifically prohibited it. That's what happened with Abrego Garcia's deportation to El Salvador, even after an administrative judge agreed he had a credible fear of being tortured there.   Other people are deported while they're still pursuing legal processes to stay in the U.S., such as asylum cases.   \n   \"The question is really, is the government making sure that an individual person is removable and doing the things it's legally obligated to do to remove them? Not, 'Does somebody have legal status or not?'\" Lind said.   For its part, the Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on Abrego Garcia's specific case this week, but has argued that judges erred in their decisions, and that anyone who's in the U.S. illegally should be deported. It's also said it complies with all court orders.   Deportation errors not new, but appear more frequent   The administration's spotlight on immigration has resulted in more cases coming across the radar of attorneys, said Lind. But she said it is difficult to say whether these kinds of incidents are happening more frequently than they have under prior administrations.   For example, a 2021 Government Accountability Office report found that over a five year period, U.S. citizens had encounters with immigration officers that could lead to their arrest and even deportation.   \"Wrongful deportations have taken place under all different administrations, so this is not novel,\" echoed Trina Realmuto, executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, which is a nonprofit that provides legal assistance to organizations and immigrants. But she said she has noticed an uptick in these cases coming to her organization over the past year.   Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Abrego Garcia's lawyers, said he currently has about a dozen similar cases of wrongful deportations — with more people likely turning to him after he gained a reputation for defending such cases.   \n   \"It's been lots of people who were deported precisely to the country that they were not allowed to be deported to,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said. \"And it's amazing to me because usually it used to be that when the government gets in trouble for doing something, they would at least tighten up and make an effort not to do it again. And that just doesn't seem to be the case here.\"   The Trump administration has, without evidence, accused Abrego Garcia of being a member of the Salvadoran-affiliated gang MS-13 and a terrorist and dubbed him a \"wife beater\" and \"child predator.\" They also charged him with human smuggling after bringing him back to the country — something he's denied.   Generally, the Trump administration in public statements has defended its deportations, often arguing that anyone without legal status is subject to removal – even if government lawyers admit the mistake in court.   \n   Another case involved a plaintiff who goes by O.C.G., a Guatemalan man wrongfully deported to Mexico despite a legal order prohibiting his deportation there. Mexico turned around and sent O.C.G. to Guatemala, even though a judge had issued an order of protection blocking him from deportation to his homeland. His lawyers say he then went into hiding.   The administration eventually brought him back to the U.S. and he was granted bond to stay out of detention while his case is adjudicated.   \"America's asylum system was never intended to be used as a de facto amnesty program or a catch-all, get-out-of-deportation-free card,\" said Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security.   \"Yet, this federal activist judge ordered us to bring him back, so he can have an opportunity to prove why he should be granted asylum to a country that he has had no past connection to.\"   \n   Immigration lawyers said that O.C.G's case exemplifies one of the reasons why mistakes can happen more frequently: the expanded use of \"third country\" removals.   \"Those countries are then turning around and deporting people to countries where a U.S. immigration judge has said they will be persecuted or tortured,\" Realmuto with the National Immigration Litigation Alliance said.   \n   Caught in the grind of immigration bureaucracy    Immigration enforcement is generally decentralized.   People are shuffled around various detention centers in the U.S. They might have cases within the Justice Department's immigration court system, or in federal courts.   Various legal protections from deportation, including deferred action and humanitarian parole programs, are administered by different agencies than those that are detaining people.   That means immigrants who should have protection from deportation are sometimes caught in the crosshairs.   \n   For example, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA program grants people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children protection from deportation.   But in March, officials deported Evenezer Cortez Martinez, a DACA recipient in Missouri, to Mexico. He was allowed to return after two weeks.   The advocacy coalition Home is Here has tracked at least 22 instances of people with valid DACA status getting swept up in arrests, placed in detention or deported. In 2025, it also found additional instances of people waiting for their DACA renewal who were deported.   \n   Speed of deportations   The speed of immigration enforcement compounds the problems. Lawyers have cited numerous instances of court orders or protections from removal being issued minutes before someone is supposed to be on a flight, or already in the air.   Federico Reyes Vasquez was deported to Mexico four days after he was first detained in December, and after a federal district judge in Utah issued a stay in his removal.   \n   \"It is nearly impossible to get information from the Department of Homeland Security when an individual is detained. We didn't know where he was. His status on the detainee locator showed that he wasn't in their custody when we knew that he, in fact, was,\" said Alec Bracken, the immigration attorney representing Reyes Vasquez.   He said he was trying to release Reyes Vasquez from detention when he suddenly learned his client was in Mexico.   Utah District Court Judge Jill Parrish ordered the administration to facilitate Reyes Vasquez's return. According to court records, the administration admitted that the removal was in violation of the court order and that information on the stay had not been correctly communicated to the people deporting him.   \n   \"At a hearing on this issue held on December 31, counsel for Respondents acknowledged the removal was in violation of the court's Order and asserted Respondents are working with petitioner's counsel to facilitate petitioner's return to the United States,\" according to Parrish's order. It notes the government said ICE was made aware of the order not to remove Reyes Vasquez — but the agency's Enforcement and Removal Operations division wasn't aware of it before they transferred and deported him.   \n   Still, McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, said \"there was no mistake,\" in response to NPR's questions about the case.   \"This [temporary restraining order] was not served to ICE until after the criminal illegal alien was removed,\" she said, noting that Reyes Vasquez has a conviction for driving under the influence.   \"Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, if you break the law, you will face the consequences. Criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the U.S.\"   Bracken argued that he never got information from the Homeland Security Department about why they wanted to deport his client in the first place. When he was deported, lawyers on both sides were in the early stages of litigating whether he should even be detained.   \"The U.S. government has 90 days to execute [a removal] order. They didn't have to do it so quickly,\" Bracken said. \"Instead, they wanted to circumvent the law and do it faster.\"   DHS has a new deadline of Feb. 5 to bring Reyes Vasquez back to the U.S.   \n   Where are they now?   Lawyers for Reyes Vasquez remain in contact with him while he's in Mexico.   Other people whom judges have said were wrongly deported face a more uncertain fate.   Lozano Camargo, the Venezuelan man sent to El Salvador, was later returned to Venezuela as a part of a broader prisoner exchange.   \n   According to court documents, DOJ lawyers said that should he be returned to the U.S. — he would be placed in indefinite detention while his asylum case played out. Lawyers representing Lozano Camargo said their client was apprehensive to return to the U.S. given his four-months-long incarceration in the El Salvador prison; he was afraid of being detained again or sent to another third country.   Court records show attorneys lost touch with their client in August \"and are concerned about his safety and well-being.\"   \n   \"The President and Secretary Noem will not allow a foreign terrorist organization to operate on American soil,\" McLaughlin said in response to NPR's questions about this case.   Melgar-Salmeron, a native of El Salvador, remains in the notorious prison there. Despite a court ordering that communication between Melgar-Salmeron and his lawyers be facilitated by El Salvador, court records show his attorneys have struggled to get back in contact with him.   \n   Melgar-Salmeron was removed due to a \"confluence of errors\" minutes after a judge ordered the government to keep him in the U.S., according to court records. McLaughlin said he had a final order for removal in 2023.   As for Abrego Garcia, he's out of detention for now. The judge in his case is still weighing whether to allow immigration officers to detain him again while his criminal and immigration cases play out.\n",

While many other world leaders have flattered or bowed down to Trump, Petro has gone out of his way to defy the American president. The Colombian leader has lambasted Trump on everything from his lethal strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific, to his support for Israel's invasion of Gaza.   For his part, Trump has accused his Colombian counterpart of flooding the U.S. with cocaine and at one point hinted that he could be targeted by the U.S. military.   \n   As a result, some analysts expect fireworks between the two strong-willed leaders. Writing in El Tiempo, Colombia's most influential newspaper, columnist Juan Lozano declared: \"I am very worried for our country.\"   Trump and Petro make for an odd couple. Trump started out as a real estate tycoon, while Petro got his start preaching revolution as part of a left-wing guerrilla group before he disarmed and jumped into Colombian politics.   Their first clash came shortly after Trump was sworn in for his second term in January 2025 when Petro refused to accept U.S. military flights bringing undocumented immigrants back to Colombia. Trump responded by threatening a devastating trade war with Colombia, and Petro was forced to retreat.   Trump then mercilessly mocked Petro, telling an audience: \"Remember, Colombia said: 'We will not take them back!' And within about 13 minutes, I think, (Colombia said) 'We would love to take them back.'\"   In his most provocative move, Petro, who was attending the U.N. General Assembly last September, took to the streets of New York with a bullhorn to publicly urge American soldiers to disobey Trump. That prompted Washington to revoke Petro's U.S. visa and to place financial sanctions on him, his wife, and his interior minister.   \n   \"Petro is trying to rally the world to oppose Donald Trump, or at least to resist him. I think a lot of people find that inspiring,\" said Sergio Guzmán, director of the Bogotá consulting firm Colombia Risk Analysis. \"But his actions are also hurting the people in this country.\"   Indeed, Trump has suspended immigrant visas for Colombians, slapped higher tariffs on Colombian exports to the U.S. and threatened to send in U.S. troops to destroy the country's drug trafficking organizations.   Cocaine production in Colombia hit a record high at about 3,000 tons in 2024, according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime. That's more than double the figure for 2021, the year before Petro was sworn in as president. Trump has even gone so far as to label Petro, without evidence, as a \"drug leader.\"   Following the U.S. raid last month that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and brought him to New York to face drug charges, Trump suggested to reporters aboard Air Force One that Petro could meet a similar fate.   But unlike Venezuela, Colombia has been for decades Washington's closest ally in Latin America and a key trade partner. It is often portrayed as a U.S. foreign policy success story given that huge sums of American aid helped bring Colombia back from the brink in the 1990s and early 2000s when the country was under siege from guerrilla groups and cocaine kingpins.   \"Both on the Republican and on the Democratic side, there is an understanding that Colombia worked out well and that this is not a partner that you want to alienate,\" Guzmán said.   Finally, after much backdoor diplomacy, Petro announced in a speech last month that for the first time ever, he had spoken with President Trump. Their phone conversation lasted nearly an hour, with Trump later commenting that it was \"a great honor\" to speak with Petro.   \n   \"It's hard to say how hunky-dory the relationship is going to remain, but there is this détente right now because the two men had a chance to talk to each other,\" said Adam Isacson of the Washington Office on Latin America, a research and advocacy group. They are \"two populist leaders who are outspoken, who tweet 50 times a day. They are kind of similar personalities.\"   Trump is expected to press Petro for more cooperation on the drug war and on stopping illegal immigration. Petro may press for trade benefits, as well as for the removal of personal sanctions against him.   But if Trump and Petro get off on the wrong foot, their meeting could resemble last year's infamous Oval Office dust-up between Trump and Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.   Either way, they won't have to deal with each other much longer. Petro will leave office in August when his four-year term comes to an end.\n",

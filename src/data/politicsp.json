The suit, filed in a Florida federal court Thursday, includes the president's sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. and the Trump organization as plaintiffs.   The filing alleges that the leak of Trump and the Trump Organization's confidential tax records caused \"reputational and financial harm, public embarrassment, unfairly tarnished their business reputations, portrayed them in a false light, and negatively affected President Trump, and the other Plaintiffs' public standing.\"   \n   In 2024, former IRS contractor Charles Edward Littlejohn of Washington, D.C. — who worked for Booz Allen Hamilton, a defense and national security tech firm — was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to leaking tax information about Trump and others to news outlets.   Littlejohn, known as Chaz, gave data to The New York Times and ProPublica between 2018 and 2020 in leaks that appeared to be \"unparalleled in the IRS's history,\" prosecutors said.   The disclosure violated IRS Code 6103, one of the strictest confidentiality laws in federal statute.   The Times reported in 2020 that Trump did not pay federal income tax for many years prior to 2020, and ProPublica in 2021 published a series about discrepancies in Trump's records. Six years of Trump's returns were later released by the then-Democratically controlled House Ways and Means Committee.   Trump's suit states that Littlejohn's disclosures to the news organizations \"caused reputational and financial harm to Plaintiffs and adversely impacted President Trump's support among voters in the 2020 presidential election.\"   Littlejohn stole tax records of other mega-billionaires, including Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk.   The president's suit comes after the U.S. Treasury Department announced it has cut its contracts with Booz Allen Hamilton, earlier this week, after Littlejohn, who worked for the firm, was charged and subsequently imprisoned for leaking tax information to news outlets about thousands of the country's wealthiest people, including the president.   \n   Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at the time of the announcement that the firm \"failed to implement adequate safeguards to protect sensitive data, including the confidential taxpayer information it had access to through its contracts with the Internal Revenue Service.\"   Representatives of the White House, Treasury and IRS were not immediately available for comment.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks with Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, about his visit to the immigration facility where a 5-year-old and his father have been detained since last week.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Five-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos is among the detainees at an immigration detention center in Texas. You have probably seen the photo of him being detained in Minnesota last week, that blue beanie hat with bunny ears, that Spider-Man backpack. The Department of Homeland Security says Conejo Ramos and his father entered the U.S. illegally in 2024. Now, the family disputes that and says they came here legally to seek asylum. Well, Texas Congressman Joaquin Castro, a Democrat, visited Liam yesterday at the detention center and joins us now to talk about that visit. Welcome, Congressman.JOAQUIN CASTRO: Good to be with you.CHANG: So how is Liam doing right now?CASTRO: He didn't look well to me, to be honest. Jasmine Crockett and I spent about 30 minutes with Liam and his dad, and his dad said that he'd not been eating well, that he's been sleeping a lot because he's depressed, and asking for his mom and for his classmates and to be back at school. But yeah, he didn't look good.CHANG: I'm so sorry to hear that. What about Liam's father, Adrian Conejo Arias? How is he doing?CASTRO: You know, I think for both of them, it's a kind of trauma being at Dilley. And my sense was that he was trying to hold things together as much as possible for his son. And he's worried about his wife 'cause his wife is four months pregnant and had to go to the emergency room right after Liam was taken in. And, you know, there's obviously a lot of concern for his family.CHANG: Is she doing all right at the moment? Do you know?CASTRO: Yeah, I - right after I finished the inspection of Dilley, the first thing I did was to call Liam's mom. She said she was OK, but, you know, I think a lot of it is folks trying to kind of grin and bear it, so to speak, and deal with what is a real tragedy 'cause these folks did come to the country legally. They had permission to be in the United States while their asylum claim is processed.CHANG: I do want to say that the Department of Homeland Security is maintaining that they came into the country illegally. But you dispute that, yes?CASTRO: Yeah. I mean, our best understanding from their attorney and even in other reporting is that they had applied for asylum.CHANG: With respect to the conditions at Dilley, I want to note that one of your colleagues, Republican Congressman Tony Gonzales, also of Texas, I saw that he told a local station that when he visited the facility, he said the conditions weren't that bad. I'm going to use his words here. Quote, \"To be frank, it is in better condition than some of our schools here in San Antonio.\" What do you make of Gonzales' characterization of Dilley there?CASTRO: Yeah, you know, Tony and I both represent the San Antonio area. And I've not talked to him about this, but, for example, when I went into the medical area in all the exam rooms, there was nobody there. There were so many people that said that they had not gotten their medicine, their medicine was late, that people have some serious food allergies, for example, and that's not being taken into account. So, you know, on the surface, I think you might go there and say, oh, well, yeah, look, everything looks kind of OK. But when you talk to the people and hear what's going on, it's a very different story.CHANG: If we can talk about the larger backdrop, though, you know, the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, President Trump has tried to shake up the leadership there now, replacing the Border Patrol official Greg Bovino with border czar Tom Homan. And Homan said today that he is going to fix the situation in Minneapolis. Are you encouraged to see this change in leadership? Do you think it's a step forward to fixing what's going on there?CASTRO: I don't think it's a step forward to fixing it. I certainly hope it is. I don't think it is. When Tom Homan gets up there and says we're going to start narrowing this operation and pulling some ICE officers out, to me, what that means is they know that they're wrong, they know that they killed two American citizens and they just don't want to admit they're wrong, don't want to admit mistakes and don't want to apologize.CHANG: What specifically do you think needs to change in how immigration enforcement operations are conducted at the moment?CASTRO: Well, I believe that ICE should be disbanded. I believe that it's become an abusive organization. And, you know, don't get me wrong, we still need to have immigration enforcement in the United States of America. I think, you know, we can all agree on that. But it shouldn't look like this, and I don't think it should be done by ICE.CHANG: Then who should it be done by?CASTRO: I think that you've got to create a new organization, a new agency. And remember, ICE was created during the war on terror in the early 2000s, and that's why you see these very intense and brutal crackdowns, because ICE starts with the assumption that everybody's a criminal, and so we're going to treat you like a criminal, including a 5-year-old boy with a backpack and a hat.CHANG: That is Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro of Texas. Thank you very much for your time today.CASTRO: Great to be with you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Senators have reached a deal they hope will avoid a lengthy government shutdown and allow time to negotiate reforms to the Department of Homeland Security.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  All right, the Senate is scrambling to finalize a deal that will keep funding flowing to much of the government and address bipartisan distrust over President Trump's immigration enforcement tactics. But even as senators say that they have an agreement to do that, a partial government shutdown is still all but inevitable, at least for a short time. NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas joins us now from the Capitol. Hi, Sam.SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa.CHANG: OK, so what exactly has been agreed to at this point?GRINGLAS: OK, so Congress already approved several spending bills. This deal focuses on six of them that have not been approved yet, but these bills that are left account for huge swaths of the government, including the Pentagon, Health and Human Services and Homeland Security, which includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection. So what the Senate is going to do is vote to fund almost everything through September. But Homeland Security funding will be extended only for two weeks, and that'll allow lawmakers to negotiate some guardrails for federal immigration enforcement. Senate Republicans and Democrats are on board, and President Trump tonight posted that he is too.CHANG: OK, so there is a deal, but, Sam, that usually means a shutdown is averted. So explain why that is not the case here.GRINGLAS: The deadline to do all of this is at midnight tomorrow, but the House has to sign off again once the Senate completes its work because they sent all the spending bills over to the Senate tied together, and so the House has to approve this plan too. The problem is that the House is on recess until Monday, and it's not clear if they could come back any earlier. So funding to all the agencies in the middle of this is going to stop, at least for a little bit.CHANG: At least for a little bit. That's where we are. OK, so do we know what the actual impact of even a very short shutdown would be?GRINGLAS: So you know how I mentioned that a handful of spending bills were already done? That means, for example, the Department of Agriculture is funded, and so food aid won't be affected this time around. But at stake right now are still some really key agencies like the Pentagon and Health and Human Services. Though if the shutdown is short, it is less likely that we're going to see, you know, federal workers missing paychecks like we did last time.CHANG: Absolutely. OK, explain more about, like, why did Republicans come around to a deal, and why were Democrats willing to risk a shutdown?GRINGLAS: You know, just a week ago, Congress was on track to easily approve all these final spending bills. But the second deadly shooting in Minneapolis by federal immigration officers really upended that. You know, Democrats, who still had heartburn from the shutdown last time over health subsidies in the fall - including those who voted with Republicans to end it - now said that they would be willing to withhold their support for the funding without these policy changes to immigration enforcement. Democrats think the public is on their side here and that the issue has captured their attention, you know, even more than that health debate did last fall.CHANG: Yeah.GRINGLAS: And, you know, more Republicans have also acknowledged that what was unfolding in Minneapolis just couldn't be ignored and saw their party losing ground on an issue that they felt like they used to really own.CHANG: OK, so once the House approves this plan, that leaves - what? - just two weeks before Homeland Security funding runs out again.GRINGLAS: Yep.CHANG: Am I right?GRINGLAS: Yep, yep. So lawmakers will have this very short window then to agree on some, you know, knotty policy questions like should the law expressly require immigration agents have judicial warrants? Should officers be required to wear body cameras? And how should incidents be investigated, and how should officers be held accountable? So a lot to wrap up in just two weeks.CHANG: Yeah. That is NPR's Sam Gringlas. Thank you so much, Sam.GRINGLAS: Thanks, Ailsa.(SOUNDBITE OF DELUSIONALPATH AND RETROCANON'S \"V12 (432HZ)\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Ailsa Chang talks with Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin about the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis and the impasse over Department of Homeland Security funding on Capitol Hill.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Lawmakers in Washington are once again at an impasse over how to keep the government open. At the center of that conflict is funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Senate Democrats want to carve off that DHS money from the broader spending package, and they want new limits on immigration agents, like a prohibition on masks and a requirement that officers carry ID. We called up Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin earlier today, and I asked him whether he even agrees that ICE needs these sort of reforms.RON JOHNSON: Well, what I agree is that we needed to secure our border. What I believe is that what we're dealing with right now is the enormous mess created by President Biden and Democrats who opened up our border, allowed millions of people to flood in this country. Where ICE is doing enforcement actions, just like they've always done - under the Obama administration, the Biden administration - where they're doing these enforcement actions and local police are cooperating, there's no violence. There's no problem. We're just enforcing the law. The problem in Minneapolis is we have a governor and a mayor who are resisting and trying...CHANG: You don't think that ICE needs any reforms then? There should be no changes on the federal government side when it comes to immigration agents.JOHNSON: When you ask that question, when Democrats focus on that, they're focusing on the wrong problem. The root cause of this problem is the border they opened up, the millions of people, including criminals, that they've allowed to flood in this country, and now law enforcements has to take care of that problem. But (inaudible)...CHANG: So what changes do you think need to be seen for law enforcement...JOHNSON: Well, first of all...CHANG: ...To better take care of this problem that you have identified, that you have characterized?JOHNSON: The first change was we secured the border. It has to remain secure. The second change is there are people that need to be apprehended because they're criminals, murders, rapists, sex, human and drug traffickers that need to be apprehended and either jailed or deported. And that right now is what these sanctuary cities and people like Mayor Frey and Governor Walz are resisting, and that have led to the tragedy. Had there not been an organized effort to resist those law enforcement actions, those two individuals in Minneapolis would still be alive.CHANG: President Trump has tried to shake up the leadership for the federal immigration crackdown in Minneapolis. He's replaced the Border Patrol official Greg Bovino with border czar Tom Homan. Homan said today that he is going to, quote, \"fix the situation there.\" Do you believe it is possible to fix the situation in Minneapolis with this change in leadership?JOHNSON: If Governor Walz and Mayor Frey would cooperate with ICE rather than resist them, rather than send people into harm's way to create these types of martyrs, yeah. I think it can be fixed. Again, I personally - I want to target the criminals. You know, I don't want right now...CHANG: I understand that, Senator.JOHNSON: ...ICE targeting other people who are here working and contributing to society. But there are a lot of criminals. There are a lot of criminals that have been let in that need to be apprehended and jailed and deported.CHANG: OK. You keep shifting blame to the mayor in Minneapolis and the governor in Minnesota. Can you tell me specifically...JOHNSON: That's where it lays.CHANG: ...What you want to see from - well, what do you need to see from them that's - specifically to fix the situation in Minneapolis?JOHNSON: Do what other governors and mayors have done. Cooperate with ICE. Cooperate with federal law enforcement when they're carrying out completely legal enforcement actions. Cooperate with them. Don't resist. Don't send to your citizens in harm's way to resist them and protest against them. Cooperate. When you arrest an illegal immigrant, hold them for detention...CHANG: And what are state and local officials supposed to...JOHNSON: ...So that ICE can pick them up and in jail, rather than have to engage in these...CHANG: What are state and local officials supposed to do if they see federal immigration agents doing unlawful actions, such as fatally shooting people when it's not in self-defense, when there is no imminent danger in that situation, there's no weapon being wielded right in the face of the federal agent?JOHNSON: Their open borders, their lack of cooperation created this circumstance for that tragedy. So they should've cooperated on the front end. Right now, there will be a thorough investigation in terms of exactly what happened, and I'm just saying I've got a great deal of sympathy for those ICE officers who are under constant threat. How would you like to be in law enforcement and everybody - all of a sudden, you've got people who are opposed to what you're trying to do, showing up. You don't know whether they're armed, whether they're just, you know, brandishing cameras. You don't know. You're going to be on hair-trigger alert, and that's what caused that tragedy.CHANG: There are still legal requirements for when any law enforcement officer can use lethal force. It's not just if they don't know if the person is armed or not. Last question, going back to the federal spending package, Democrats at least - at the very least, they just want to split DHS funding from the rest of the spending package to keep the government open. Do you agree with that idea?JOHNSON: Then they will never fund DHS. So this is a ploy. I mean, they'll do it. They'll convince people like you that, oh, they're just being very reasonable. This is a way that they can defund DHS, just like they want to defund the police to disastrous consequences. So no, I can't support that effort.CHANG: Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, thank you very much for joining us.JOHNSON: Have a good day. Take care.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

Under the plan, the Senate will vote on five appropriations bills before the weekend, according to sources familiar with the agreement who were not authorized to discuss details publicly. They will not vote on the sixth bill — which funds the Department of Homeland Security — as it is currently written. Instead, they'll vote on a separate two-week continuing resolution for DHS.   This will allow various federal agencies to be funded, pending House approval, while carving out time for negotiators to make changes to the DHS appropriations bill.    \n   President Trump endorsed the deal on social media, writing he was working with Congress \"to ensure that we are able to fully fund the Government, without delay.\"   \"Republicans and Democrats in Congress have come together to get the vast majority of the Government funded until September, while at the same time providing an extension to the Department of Homeland Security (including the very important Coast Guard, which we are expanding and rebuilding like never before). Hopefully, both Republicans and Democrats will give a very much needed Bipartisan \"YES\" Vote,\" Trump wrote.    After Senate passage, the House will need to pass these bills in order to avoid a lapse in government funding. Because the House is currently on recess until Monday, a short-term shutdown appears all but inevitable.   If the House acts quickly upon returning, the effects of a shutdown could be extremely limited, as most federal offices are closed on the weekend.   Democrats want to see major changes to DHS   In the aftermath of the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis by federal agents on Saturday, Democrats have demanded significant reforms at the Department of Homeland Security and the ongoing immigration enforcement actions led by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).   \n   Democrats are calling for broad changes to the way DHS agents are carrying out their work. This includes barring them from wearing masks, requiring body cameras, setting rules around warrants and creating a uniform code of conduct and use-of-force rules.   \"Until ICE is properly reined in and overhauled legislatively, the DHS funding bill doesn't have the votes to pass,\" Schumer said Wednesday.   The Senate failed to advance the complete six-bill funding package Thursday, as eight Republicans joined with Democrats to prevent the plan from clearing a procedural vote. The final tally was 45 to 55.\n",

    "body": "\n      The presence of ICE in Minnesota, including the shooting deaths of two U.S. citizens, is rewriting how Democrats and Republicans are messaging ahead of the 2026 midterms.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Ailsa Chang in Culver City, California.JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  And I'm Juana Summers in St. Paul, Minnesota, one of the twin cities at the center of the national political fight over immigration enforcement.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)AMY KLOBUCHAR: Three thousand ICE agents on our streets and in our towns, sent by an administration that relishes division. We cannot sugarcoat how hard this is.SUMMERS: That is U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar in a video she released earlier today, announcing her run for governor of Minnesota. The federal immigration enforcement push here has scrambled political messaging. President Trump has been trying to address concerns over the economy in the lead-up to midterm elections, but Democrats like Klobuchar are pointing to what's happening in Minneapolis. We are here at Minnesota Public Radio, where I'm joined by ALL THINGS CONSIDERED host Clay Masters. Hi.CLAY MASTERS, BYLINE: Hi, Juana.SUMMERS: Let's start, if we can, with Senator Klobuchar. Her name immediately popped up as a potential candidate when the state's governor, Tim Walz, announced that he would suspend his campaign for a third term. And that was, of course, before two U.S. citizens were killed by federal agents in Minneapolis. What does the ICE presence here do for Klobuchar's campaign, if anything?CLAY MASTERS: I mean, still a lot of months until November, and voters have a short attention span, right? I mean, the killings of Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti have brought a lot of awareness to the way the president's immigration policies are being enforced. That seems to be helping Democrats, which could include Klobuchar. Locally here, a Republican running for governor, Chris Madel, ended his governor run, calling what's happening in the Twin Cities and across the state an unmitigated disaster. That's a Republican.Democrats here really haven't had a lot of power to do anything about ICE's presence in the state other than, you know, condemn it publicly. I've asked Senator Klobuchar what her party can do, and she largely talks about having a check on the president. You know, having a chamber in Congress with a Democratic majority would do that, but again, quite a ways off until voters are making that decision.SUMMERS: Now, the Trump administration has been signaling that it is trying to make some changes on the ground here by bringing in Tom Homan. He's the border czar. But does that actually change anything?CLAY MASTERS: I mean, not yet. Homan got here this week after President Trump and Governor Walz had a phone call. Homan replaced Gregory Bovino with Border Patrol, who had been the face of the federal surge. Homan held a press conference this morning in Minneapolis, talking about how he says Minnesota officials need to cooperate if ICE is ever going to leave here.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TOM HOMAN: Matter of fact, I have staff from CBP and from ICE working on a drawdown plan. What does that look like based on the cooperation? What does that look like based on how many targets we have left to find?CLAY MASTERS: But, Juana, I should say there is no real evidence on the streets of de-escalation. Just yesterday, I spoke to Democratic state Senator Doron Clark from Minneapolis about ICE's ongoing presence. That includes ICE agents attempting to enter the Ecuadorian consulate, allegedly without a warrant.SUMMERS: Right.CLAY MASTERS: The mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, who has regularly been tangling with President Trump, responded to Homan's press conference today. Frey says any drawdown of ICE agents is a step in the right direction, but his ask remains the same - Operation Metro Surge must end - and that's a reference to the ramped-up presence ICE has had in Minnesota, which goes back to early December. We should also bring up Maine.SUMMERS: Yeah.CLAY MASTERS: There has also been an increased ICE enforcement presence in that state. Republican U.S. Senator Susan Collins says DHS has told her enhanced operations there have ended.SUMMERS: And last thing, Clay, I do want to bring it back to the midterms again for a moment. Can Republicans really make it about anything but ICE right now?CLAY MASTERS: I mean, President Trump certainly is trying to change the subject. He was in Iowa earlier this week, holding a rally in suburban Des Moines. That state has gone for him in the last three presidential elections, but there are a couple of competitive congressional House seats there this year. He spent the majority of his speech talking about the economy. Republicans want to keep control of Congress, and political arguments over ICE's presence here in Minnesota and the death of two U.S. citizens at the hands of federal agents is not helping them.SUMMERS: Thank you, Clay.CLAY MASTERS: Thank you.SUMMERS: That's Minnesota Public Radio's Clay Masters.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

    "body": "\n      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Trump administration official Kari Lake praised the president effusively in a January 2026 appearance on Voice of America's Persian language service. As she oversees the network's parent agency, critics say her comments violated the spirit and perhaps even the letter of federal law that seeks to safeguard Voice of America's editorial independence.\n                \n                    Voice of America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Voice of America\n    \n\n   \n   Kari Lake, who oversees the parent agency of the Voice of America, has hit legal and political roadblocks in her drive to dismantle the government-funded broadcaster.   She has instead accelerated her use of the U.S. government-owned network to promote President Trump and his views — in possible violation of federal law and policies.   To mark the completion of Trump's first year in office last week, Lake was interviewed on Voice of America's Persian-language service through an interpreter. During the five-minute segment, she praised Trump repeatedly.   Lake lauded Trump's actions toward Iran, called him \"the president of peace\" and reiterated Trump's tenuous claims he had ended eight wars and conflicts.   \n   Lake said Trump was \"putting out fires\" throughout the world with a policy of \"peace through strength.\" She also castigated judges who ruled against Trump and the administration, citing an \"out-of-control judiciary,\" and she trashed former President Joe Biden's record, which she termed \"horrific.\" NPR reviewed her original remarks in English and the interpretation offered to viewers in Iran, the service's target audience.   \"VOA is telling the story of the brave Iranian people and their fight for freedom,\" Lake says in a written comment to NPR. \"That story cannot be told without sharing statements from President Trump or the support the Iranian people have for him.\"   The segment, part of a glowing one-hour special on Trump's first year back in the White House, was also broadcast on Voice of America's Chinese language service, in which her remarks could be heard in English.   Lake is a familiar pro-Trump guest on such conservative news outlets as Fox, Newsmax and OANN, where she shares baseless claims of election fraud and comments on topics like immigration and Venezuela. None of them have any direct link to her federal job.   Given Lake's role overseeing the parent agency of Voice of America, her appearance last week was a sharp departure for the network.   \n   In separate interviews, 11 current and former Voice of America journalists and officials at its federal parent, the U.S. Agency for Global Media, said they could not recall anything like it. Most spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing professional retribution, given ongoing links to the agency, its broadcasters or the federal government.   By law, the chief executive of the U.S. Agency for Global Media is required to respect what is often called a firewall, designed to shield editorial staffers and their news decisions from politics. Since late July, Lake has periodically fashioned herself as the agency chief, though she is currently signing her official emails as deputy CEO.   Critics say her recent appearance on Voice of America tramples on that firewall.   \"These are precisely the reasons why you would have a charter and why you would have to adhere to the highest principles of journalistic ethics — to avoid these kinds of situations,\" says David Kligerman, the former general counsel of the U.S. Agency for Global Media under both Trump and Biden.   During Trump's first term, Voice of America host Greta Van Susteren interviewed then-Vice President Mike Pence and twice interviewed President Trump during foreign trips, all in 2018. No one objected: Trump and Pence were powerful public officials. The interviews were newsworthy.   Veterans of the agency and Voice of America tell NPR that having their boss on the air in a partisan role is different.   \"It seems to contradict the spirit and the sense of the firewall,\" says Rick Stengel, the former top editor of Time magazine, who sat on the agency's governing board while serving in the U.S. State Department during the Obama administration.   \"Listening to Kari Lake, she sounded more like a press secretary for the president than the head of an independent news service,\" Stengel says. \"We never wanted it to sound like a state broadcaster in an authoritarian country that would air hagiographic biographies of the Dear Leader.\"   \n   After losing elections, Lake rises at broadcast agency   Lake is a former local TV news anchor turned unsuccessful MAGA candidate in Arizona, where she ran for both governor and U.S. Senate and lost. Early last year, Trump installed her atop the U.S. Agency for Global Media. But Lake's ability to lead the agency is being challenged in court.   Before taking office, Trump announced he wanted to name Lake to be the director of the Voice of America.   According to two journalists at the network with knowledge, Voice of America editors were nervous enough about her arrival that they half-jokingly discussed offering Lake her own show in hopes of saving the network from evisceration or being turned into a pro-Trump propaganda channel. (Those people spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.)   Yet Trump does not have the legal authority to appoint the agency's chief executive. That power rests with a bipartisan oversight board whose members are confirmed by the U.S. Senate, under laws designed to insulate the network from political interference.   Upon entering the White House, Trump dismissed the board members. That meant there was no legal way for him to install Lake or anyone else atop Voice of America.   Instead, last March, Trump issued an executive order that the agency be reduced to the bare minimum required by law. He named Lake as senior advisor to the U.S. Agency for Global Media. She testified that she held all but five percent of the power the agency's CEO would normally wield.   \n   Lake moved swiftly to lay off 85% of the workforce in response to Trump's executive order. Those staffers have been whipsawed by a series of court rulings that reinstated their jobs, followed by fresh rounds of layoffs.   Last July, the White House named Lake deputy CEO at her own urging, according to her testimony in court.   Lake said in a sworn affidavit that she became acting CEO in late July, though the White House made no formal announcement of it.   Trump has not nominated her to be CEO, which would require confirmation from the U.S. Senate. As NPR has reported, under the law it's not clear she is eligible to hold the position of acting CEO, either.   \n   Neither the U.S. Agency for Global Media nor the White House has responded to NPR's numerous requests for documentation of her appointment as acting CEO. Nor has Lake, for that matter.   \n   U.S. District Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth, who is presiding over a series of cases challenging her actions at the agency, has questioned Lake's honesty and the validity of the administration's legal defenses. He has ordered her to bring back enough employees to meet the expectations set by Congress when it put money aside for the agency. He has not yet ruled on the legality of Lake's authority.   Compelled to bring back some VOA journalists, Lake has emphasized the Persian-language service   In recalling some journalists to work, Lake has put a special emphasis on the Persian-language service, given the current upheaval and crackdown in Iran.   Lake's choice to run that service is a veteran former Voice of America journalist, Ali Javanmardi, who left the network in 2019, according to current and former colleagues. Javanmardi also has praised Trump on the air: \"Perhaps for the first time,\" Javanmardi told viewers this month, \"the leader of the free world is standing alongside the people of Iran.\" His X (formerly Twitter) feed and his LinkedIn profile display in the background a photograph of a bloodied but undaunted Trump just after the unsuccessful assassination attempt on his life in Butler, Pa.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The LinkedIn profile for Ali Javanmardi, who is overseeing the Voice of America's Persian-language service, features a photograph of President Trump moments after the unsuccessful assassination attempt in Butler, Pa. Under Javanmardi's leadership, the service has promoted Trump and kept his critics off the air.\n                \n                    AliJavanmardi's LinkedIn account/LinkedIn\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        AliJavanmardi's LinkedIn account/LinkedIn\n    \n\n   \n   Javanmardi has urged editors and producers not to book guests who may be critical of Trump, according to colleagues who spoke on condition they not be named. (They cited fears of workplace retaliation.)   NPR has also reviewed a text from a Voice of America journalist who said the Persian-language service canceled an appearance by a former Trump foreign policy adviser, Elliot Abrams, because he had been critical of the president on Iran. (Abrams did not respond to an email seeking comment.)   \n   In another instance, a journalist for Voice of America Persian told a foreign policy commentator that the network's management could not allow any critique of the president. The commentator declined to appear on air, the text exchange shows.   During the hour-long special on which Lake appeared, Voice of America Persian host Payam Yazdian offered effusive praise of Trump's return to the White House. Yazdian called Trump's first year back \"the start of an exciting period of national success, and the return of global respectability.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Voice of America Persian anchor Payam Yazdian presented a one-hour program last week that presented a glowing assessment of President Trump's first year in office for viewers in Iran. Kari Lake, who is running the network's federal parent agency, repeatedly praised the president in her appearance on the show.\n                \n                    Voice of America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Voice of America\n    \n\n   \n   Additionally, Javanmardi has discouraged coverage of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's last shah, according to two journalists with knowledge of events who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing concerns of professional reprisals.   Pahlavi has become a rallying point for some of those opposed to the current regime, even as the repressive record of Pahlavi's father repels many Iranians and Iranian-Americans.   \"Ignoring or sidelining [Pahlavi] is not neutrality, it's an editorial failure,\" wrote former BBC journalist Ali Hamedani, who runs his own Persian-language radio service in London.   Javanmardi blames the Iranian government for online criticism of his work.   \"In my new job at VOA, my primary mission is to ensure it aligns with the US foreign policy and conveys @POTUS's support for the people of Iran,\" he wrote in a social media post on Jan. 18.   Lake is backing him up.   \"We are not in the business of selecting Iran's political leadership. That would be irresponsible of any outside news organization,\" she writes in the statement to NPR. \"That decision belongs solely to Iran's 93 million citizens, who have a right to self-determination.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Iranians gather while blocking a street during a protest in Tehran, Iran on Jan. 9.

He has been described on the network's airwaves as a senior adviser overseeing Voice of America's Persian, Kurdish and Afghan television services.   According to three colleagues who spoke on condition of anonymity, however, Javanmardi works for the U.S Agency for Global Media, not Voice of America. His email address has a USAGM domain. (The colleagues spoke on condition of anonymity, citing fears of retribution.)   \n   As an employee of the parent agency, his involvement in news decisions could run afoul of the same firewall that critics say Lake ignored by appearing on Voice of America.   Javanmardi and USAGM did not respond to NPR's requests for comment or questions about his job or title.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Kari Lake, who at the time was running for one of Arizona's U.S. Senate seats, spoke at the Road to Majority conference in Washington, D.C. on June 21, 2024.  The conference host, Faith and Freedom Coalition, advocates for incorporation of Christianity in American government.\n                \n                    ALLISON BAILEY/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty/AFP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        ALLISON BAILEY/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty/AFP\n    \n\n   \n   Largely ignored by Lake, Congress moves to sustain international networks   In a rebuke of the Trump administration, House and Senate lawmakers have drafted spending bills that include $643 million for the U.S. Agency for Global Media for fiscal year 2026.  The House passed its version of the legislation earlier this month.   While that amount is far less than what Congress allocated in the past, it is four times what the Trump administration had requested for the agency, funds that Lake intended to use to shut it down.    The lawmakers also set aside money for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. It has operated on a shoestring since Lake sought to cut off its funds. Like Voice of America Persian, its Persian-language service, called Radio Farda, is aimed at audiences inside Iran.   When authorities severed access to the Internet, the network's executives appealed to the U.S. Agency for Global Media to use their shortwave and mediumwave radio transmitters in Kuwait and elsewhere.    Lake has repeatedly condemned Radio Free Europe for broadcasting into Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has cracked down on the independent press. In June, when the U.S. bombed Iran and the Iranian regime blocked web access, she did not allow Radio Farda access to the transmitters.   In a posting on Facebook on Jan. 13, Lake said she and Radio Free Europe CEO Steve Capus agreed \"we need to have a unified message so we are not sending mixed messages to the people of Iran.\" But she said Capus has not fulfilled his side of the bargain. (Capus and Radio Free Europe did not comment for this story.)   \n   Radio Farda still has not been allowed to use the transmitters.   Her refusal has frustrated some influential lawmakers.   \"It's been a week since the regime in Tehran blacked out the internet, and 10 months since USAGM blacked out its transmitters for Persian-language @RadioFarda_ from @RFERL,\" Republican Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky tweeted on Jan 15. \"What a waste of America's tremendous capacity to share the truth.\"   On a conservative commercial talk radio show last week, Lake called Radio Farda \"a propaganda site run by Radio Free Europe.\"   NPR's Ayda Pourasad and D. Parvaz contributed to this story.\n",

Scott Applewhite/AP\n    \n\n   \n   With the government on the brink of a partial shutdown, the Senate is scrambling to keep funding flowing and address bipartisan distress over President Trump's immigration enforcement tactics.   But even with an agreement to fund the government, a short-term partial shutdown appears all but inevitable. The Senate still needs to vote on a plan announced by Senate Democrats, and then the House, which is in recess until Monday, needs to sign off, too.   The agreement reached Thursday night and endorsed by Trump will fund much of the government through the end of September and temporarily fund the Department of Homeland Security for two weeks while lawmakers negotiate provisions to rein in federal immigration agents.   \n   Just a week ago, Congress was on track to approve nearly $1.3 trillion in spending for defense, health, transportation, housing and more before government funding expires at midnight.   But the second deadly shooting of a U.S. citizen in Minneapolis by federal immigration officers on Saturday upended those plans, as Democrats pledged to withhold support for the funding package without policy changes on immigration enforcement.   And unlike the shutdown standoff last fall over expiring health insurance subsidies, more Republicans acknowledged that what was unfolding in Minneapolis was an inflection point that could not be ignored.   Democrats are demanding changes to how immigration officers carry out arrests and incidents are investigated, as well as mandating the use of body cameras and other reforms.   Some of the recommendations could attract Republican support. But there is still an arduous road ahead for any of them becoming law.   Why some Republicans are alarmed   In an era when congressional Republicans rarely criticize the Trump administration, the killing of 37-year-old Alex Pretti in Minneapolis sparked unease from unexpected corners of the caucus.   \"Initial rushes to judgment did not meet the standard that Americans should expect from their government officials,\" Sen. Ted Budd, R-N.C., wrote on social media, referring to remarks by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and others who had swiftly labeled Pretti a \"domestic terrorist.\"   \n   \"Enforcing our immigration laws makes our streets safer. It also protects our national security,\" Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., wrote in a statement the day after the shooting. \"But we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble.\"   Several Republicans called for hearings and an independent investigation; DHS leaders are expected to testify in back-to-back oversight hearings next month and Noem is now due to testify in March. Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., more frequent Trump critics, have called for her resignation.   Tillis told reporters that the images coming out of Minneapolis were souring the public on the Trump administration's handling of immigration more broadly.   \"It is regrettable that the issue that Republicans always lead on, we're losing on,\" Tillis told NPR.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., speaks to reporters at the Capitol on Thursday. Tillis says the images coming out of Minneapolis have soured the public on the Trump administration's immigration policy.\n                \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   And despite initially resisting Democrats' demands to split the homeland security funding bill from the overall spending package, key Republicans eventually softened to the idea.   \"If the pathway exists that we get these five bills done and then we have time to continue to review Homeland [Security], I'm here for it,\" said Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., an appropriations committee member.   But divides continue to persist within the Republican Party.   \"We're not going to keep ICE from doing their job,\" said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla. \"The American people wanted the president to enforce law and order and ICE is doing their job.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., says Republicans are \"not going to keep ICE from doing their job.\"\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican who sits on the homeland security committee, said he did not see a need for any further policy changes. He noted that the current DHS funding bill awaiting a vote already includes additional funding for body cameras and oversight.   \"I don't see one that's needed above and beyond what's already there,\" Lankford said.   What Democrats want: judicial warrants, masks off and cameras on   Democrats secured a handful of wins in the current version of the spending bill, such as reducing funding for immigration enforcement and reducing capacity at detention centers. But in the wake of Pretti's death, they say further reforms are needed.   \n   Senate Democrats have outlined three buckets of policy changes they are pursuing.   Democrats want rules around the kinds of warrants immigration officers can use to enter homes and an end to so-called \"roving patrols\" when officers conduct broad searches and stops of people they suspect of being in the country illegally.   An ICE memo unveiled in a whistleblower complaint first reported by the Associated Press last week detailed how Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were using administrative warrants as opposed to judicial warrants, which are signed by a judge.   These administrative warrants, according to the whistleblower report, are signed by immigration agents and deportation officers.   In a letter to DHS, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said these kinds of warrants are an unlawful method of entering private residences. Administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance, have defended the approach as lawful, saying administrative warrants are still warrants.   The broad authority DHS is using has alarmed some Republicans.   \"I am not a big fan of administrative warrants. I think warrants to enter someone's house should be Fourth Amendment warrants,\" said Senate Homeland Security Committee Chair Rand Paul, R-Ky.   Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, had called for an end to the large-scale operation in her state, which resulted in the arrest of over 100 people in what ICE dubbed, \"Operation Catch of the Day.\"   \"I have been urging Secretary Noem and others in the Administration to get ICE to reconsider its approach to immigration enforcement in the state,\" Collins said in a statement, writing that she had spoken to Noem and the operation there was no longer ongoing.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem speaks during a news conference following the death of Alex Pretti. Noem and other administration officials have faced criticism, including from some Republicans, for accusing Pretti of domestic terrorism.\n                \n                    Al Drago/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Al Drago/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   But Democrats want guardrails to prevent similar \"roving\" operations in other places.   Democrats want to make it easier to pursue legal action against immigration officers and \"independent investigations\" into ICE and other federal enforcement misconduct.   Democrats have previously raised questions about the efficacy of DHS oversight mechanisms to investigate employee misconduct and critics have pointed out that the department, which houses ICE, is investigating itself in the most recent deadly incidents.   \n   In the aftermath of the shooting of Renee Macklin Good, the 37-year-old killed by an ICE officer earlier this month, the Federal Bureau of Investigations and ICE announced they would run parallel investigations and not conduct a joint investigation with state officials.   The move prompted backlash from local officials, like Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who argue that the investigation may not be fair since agency leaders were already defending the officers' conduct.   Democrats want to mandate that agents display clearer identification, not cover their faces and wear body cameras.   DHS leaders have defended the use of masks arguing that there is an increased threat of doxxing and physical threats to identified agents and their families.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A member of the U.S. Border Patrol confronts the driver of a vehicle that was following them on Jan. 29, in Minneapolis. Democrats want immigration officers to not cover their faces and wear body cameras, among other changes.\n                \n                    Stephen Maturen/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Stephen Maturen/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Body camera requirements have also come into focus after the two shootings in Minneapolis. DHS has long said it does not have enough body cameras for every single agent.   To address concerns about the lack of body cameras, the current version of the DHS spending bill, which has already passed the House, includes $20 million for cameras for ICE and Customs and Border Protection. But the bill only mandates the money be spent — it does not mandate the use of the cameras.   \"Funding them without wearing them means nothing,\" Blumenthal told NPR.   Why Democrats feel emboldened    After a record 43-day shutdown last fall, many Democrats were weary of even a short funding lapse.   But that environment changed this week. Even five of six Democrats who broke with their party to end the last stalemate now said the risk of another shutdown was something they were willing to take on.   \"ICE is out of control, Donald Trump is out of control,\" said one of those Democrats, Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada. \"Our Constitution, not a suggestion, our Bill of Rights, not a suggestion.\"   \"I think if we're fighting for these reforms, we're exactly where the American people want us to be,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who early on urged his colleagues to oppose homeland security funding.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Healthcare workers attend a vigil for VA nurse Alex Pretti at VA NY Harbor Healthcare System Thursday in New York City.\n                \n                    Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Drew Hammill, who worked for former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who as the House minority leader helped direct Democrats' strategy during the 2018-2019 shutdown over border wall funding, said the debate over ICE tactics cuts much closer to home for most Americans.   \n   \"From a debate about a distant wall to your own neighborhood, your own backyard, the safety of your community — that's a different scenario,\" Hammill said. \"Voters want and expect a fight. And I think this is one of the few opportunities with a lawless president to have any impact.\"   Republican Capitol Hill veteran Antonia Ferrier says her old boss, former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, used to describe shutdown standoffs as box canyons — narrow gorges with no exit on the other end. \"You're making demands and there is no way out,\" Ferrier said.   But she says Democrats may feel emboldened because this moment is spurring anger and passion on both sides of the aisle that strikes at something more fundamental about the direction of the country in a way that the health subsidies debate did not.   \"What I think we're seeing right now is markedly different,\" she said. \"It was a very significant inflection point, and I think now there is just so much attention and outrage that many Republicans agree there has to be some kind of changes made.\"\n",

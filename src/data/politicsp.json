How are higher prices changing the way you live? Fill out this form to share your story with NPR.      What's the item?   Furniture   How has the price changed since before the pandemic?   The price of bedroom furniture rose 11% since February 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The price of living room, kitchen and dining room furniture rose 25%.   \n   Loading...\n   Why has the price gone up?    Like all industries, furniture makers and sellers are dealing with higher expenses: utilities, insurance, wages. Big cost spikes came during the pandemic, when shoppers raced to buy desks for home offices and patio sets, and shipping costs soared.   But if you ask furniture industry insiders, the first thing they'll reply is that the price of furniture has actually grown slower than overall inflation, which has risen nearly 26% since February 2020.    Then, the experts will note that prices are down from their peak in 2022. And then — like David Koehler did — they'll deliver the popular adage:   \"You could buy a $399 sofa in 1984, and you could still buy a $399 sofa today,\" says Koehler, who runs the Delaware chain Johnny Janosik Furniture.   Of course, not everyone wants a $399 sofa, but the fact that it still exists makes furniture different from other big-ticket items, like cars or appliances.   Overseas competition has kept prices lower    Setting aside high-end woodwork and heirloom craftsmanship, sellers of mass market furniture feel intense pressure to keep prices down.   \"The barriers to entry are very, very low, and the furniture business is incredibly fragmented,\" says Bill McLoughlin, editor in chief of Furniture Today, a trade publication.   \n   Besides, furniture sellers compete not just with second-hand goods, but with any expensive plans you may have, say, for a trip or home repairs.   \n   And the race for cheapest prices has moved a lot of the industry abroad.   \"Manufacturing follows low-cost labor. That has been true for 60 years,\" says McLoughlin. \"Because labor is such a large component of the cost of a product.\"   American wages tend to be a lot higher than those overseas, on top of the bigger costs of U.S. environmental standards. So even at domestic furniture-making hubs in Mississippi or North Carolina, many components — fabrics, handles and electronics, like the power button for your recliner — still ship from abroad, mainly China.   Enter: tariffs    During his first term, President Trump's tariffs made it pricier to ship furniture from China, so a lot of manufacturing moved out — though not to America, but to Vietnam.   This year, Trump raised tariffs on imports from almost all countries. And he's set new double-digit tariffs specifically for kitchen cabinets, vanities and upholstered furniture.   The furniture giant Ashley Furniture in June raised the price of the majority of its products as a result of tariffs. The Home Furnishings Association, an industry trade group, has warned of cumulative cost increases for both retailers and shoppers.   What are people doing about it?   As importing furniture becomes pricier, American-made furniture may start looking more attractive in comparison. But seller Koehler worries about how shoppers will react.   \"The consumer, when we get feedback, they say, 'We would love to buy American,'\" he says. \"But when they vote with their dollars and see, this item is $500 and that item is $1,200, they say, 'I think I can only afford the $500.' So they end up buying an imported item anyway, just because there is such a difference in price.\"   \n   Many shoppers find themselves in the same spot as Erin Cummins in Connecticut: watching their spending rise on other, more critical costs, such as health insurance, or car insurance, or groceries.   \"Every time we're having company over, I look at that furniture and I'm going, 'I really need to replace that,'\" says Cummins, whose threadbare couches have been well-loved by three dogs and three children. \"I have priced it out a bit, but every time I do, I get sticker shock and walk away.\"   \n   Cummins says at this point, the cost of new furniture displeases her more than the state of what she already owns, and her couches — still standing, even if covered by a blanket — feel more stable than her budget.\n",

    "body": "\n      Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the first woman ever elected Speaker of the House, announced Thursday that after 38 years in Congress, she will not seek another term.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  Democratic representative Nancy Pelosi, the first woman ever elected speaker of the House, announced today that she will not seek another term. Pelosi spent 38 years representing her San Francisco constituents in Washington. KQED senior politics correspondent Scott Shafer looks back at her historic legacy.SCOTT SHAFER, BYLINE: As Representative Nancy Pelosi prepares to exit the political stage at age 85, she leaves behind a long list of accomplishments, including passage of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Pelosi was first elected in 1987 to fill a seat left vacant by the death of Representative Sala Burton. Her first campaign was no cakewalk. Some of her opponents painted her as privileged and out of touch, including city supervisor Carol Ruth Silver at a televised debate held at KQED.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CAROL RUTH SILVER: How can she relate to people like me - a single parent, working mother?SHAFER: But Pelosi held her ground.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NANCY PELOSI: My attitude is, they'll take the low road and I'll take the high road, and I'll get to Congress before them.SHAFER: And she did, quickly showing her political chops. Years later, her reputation as a tough-as-nails street fighter was well established, as she acknowledged in 2018.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PELOSI: As I always say to the candidates, you have to know how to take a punch and throw a punch.SHAFER: Pelosi arrived in Washington as the AIDS epidemic was ravaging her district. She pushed for more federal funding at a time when the Reagan administration was ignoring it. Ernest Hopkins with the San Francisco AIDS Foundation said Pelosi's impact was felt far outside her own district.ERNEST HOPKINS: She understood that we could not end the HIV epidemic without addressing the epidemic in Black and Latino communities, and so she was all in.SHAFER: But Pelosi's rise to power within the Democratic Party was not easy.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PELOSI: And when I did run for high office and leadership, some of the men said, who said she could run (laughter)? Well, that just lit my fire, really.SHAFER: In 2006, Democrats reclaimed a majority in the House for the first time in 12 years. They elected Pelosi to be the next speaker. Pelosi was a partisan warrior, but Republicans used her as a foil, a liberal Democrat from San Francisco, tying her to other Democrats running in more conservative parts of the country.There were times when she worked across the aisle. During the last year of George W. Bush's presidency, when the economy was cratering from the subprime mortgage crisis, she rounded up enough Democratic votes to save financial institutions, which critics described as a Wall Street bailout. Even former Republican speaker John Boehner praised her at the unveiling of Pelosi's official portrait in 2022.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN BOEHNER: And the fact of the matter is, no other speaker of the House in the modern era, Republican or Democrat, has wielded the gavel with such authority or with such consistent results.SHAFER: Pelosi's superpower was cultivating relationships and understanding how to win enough votes to pass legislation. She was also a thorn in the side of President Trump. In a meeting in the Oval Office during Trump's first term, Pelosi said the blame belonged squarely on the president if there were a government shutdown.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PELOSI: You should not have a Trump shutdown. Are you having a (ph)...PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: A what? Did you say Trump?PELOSI: A Trump shutdown.SHAFER: A photo of her emerging from that meeting with the president wearing a vibrant red coat and sunglasses became an iconic image. Democrats retook the House in 2019, and Pelosi was elected speaker a second time, guiding two impeachments of Trump, efforts that ultimately failed in the Senate. She became the face of the Democratic Party's resistance, dramatically ripping up a copy of Trump's State of the Union speech in 2020. She later gave her reason in an interview with KQED, saying it was, quote, \"full of lies.\" Pelosi made history as the first woman and the first Californian to become speaker. But as Governor Gavin Newsom notes, it's what she did with that power that mattered.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GAVIN NEWSOM: You may never get something like this back. It will take 40, 50 years for someone to build the kind of credibility that she's built and the influence and the capacity to deliver.SHAFER: Several candidates are already vying to replace her. Whoever wins will be hard-pressed to match Pelosi's ability to wield power.For NPR News, I'm Scott Shafer in San Francisco.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Mary Louise Kelly speaks with domestic extremism correspondent Odette Yousef about Tucker Carlson's interview with white nationalist and holocaust denier Nick Fuentes and the rift it's creating.   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  It's Thursday, and that means another drop of NPR's national security podcast. On this week's Sources & Methods, how extreme views on the far right are dividing Americans. Now, that is clearly a political story, but what does it have to do with national security? I put that to NPR domestic extremism correspondent Odette Yousef.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)ODETTE YOUSEF: You know, 9/11 was a physical assault on U.S. soil by a foreign enemy, and I think that that is sort of traditionally how we've thought about the question of national security. And so now, fast-forward to January 6, when we look at what happened that day, sort of the attempt to forcefully prevent the results of a Democratic election from going forward, that was a threat from within. So national security does include sort of this concern about domestic extremism. The way that I think about it is that these strands of an authoritarian movement that we're seeing on the right really are about taking apart the very principles of inclusive democracy that distinguished America from its enemies on 9/11.KELLY: Now, Odette and I were talking about this because of a controversy that's splitting the Republican Party. Specifically, conservative talk show host Tucker Carlson's interview with Nick Fuentes. Fuentes has praised Hitler, defended Jim Crow and called for a holy war against Jews. A think tank closely aligned with the Trump administration initially defended the interview.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)KELLY: This was not a hard-hitting interview. This was a friendly chat.YOUSEF: It was. I mean, you can find many of Nick Fuentes' statements online. I mean, he's online all the time. You know, at one point in the interview he talks about his love for Stalin.KELLY: Stalin who - just for the record, the Soviet leader who killed millions of his own people. Go on.YOUSEF: That's right. So yeah, it was an odd sort of treatment of the opportunity to really query Nick Fuentes, I would say.KELLY: Although, why did this interview in particular trigger such a big fight within the GOP that we're sitting here talking about it as a national security story? Because Tucker Carlson has had - I'm trying to remember - a Holocaust conspiracist on his show before. He has promoted the racist theory, the Great Replacement conspiracy theory.YOUSEF: So the furor seems really to be centering on the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank based in Washington, D.C., that played a large role in creating Project 2025. Carlson is a close friend to the Heritage Foundation. And there were calls for the Heritage Foundation basically to chastise Tucker Carlson for having platformed Nick Fuentes.KELLY: And they did the opposite, at least initially.YOUSEF: Yes. The head of the Heritage Foundation, Kevin Roberts, declined to do that. He posted a video on X where he said they wouldn't capitulate to pressure from the, quote, \"globalist class\" to cancel people on the right. Globalists, this is a well-known dog whistle among antisemitic conspiracists. So his refusal to sort of distance the Heritage Foundation from this created this uproar on the right. And so several people working at the Heritage Foundation, particularly on their effort to fight antisemitism, left the organization. But there was also, like, a wider controversy just within the Republican Party, where current and former senators basically were like, it's time to draw the line and disavow the, quote, \"Hitler is cool\" wing within the party.KELLY: Yeah. I'll just name-drop a few of them. Senator Ted Cruz. Senator Mitch McConnell. We also heard from conservative podcaster Ben Shapiro. There are plenty of conservatives out there...YOUSEF: Senator Lindsey Graham.KELLY: Right - condemning the Fuentes appearance. But I - you know, there's a bigger context. This interview did not happen in isolation. And I'm thinking of some other racist rhetoric coming from parts of the political right just a couple of weeks ago. Politico published this - excerpts from a group chat. This was leaders of Young Republican groups.YOUSEF: Yeah, that's right. So private chats that were happening among leaders of Young Republicans in four states, where they were saying things like, I love Hitler and...KELLY: Joking about sending political opponents to the gas chamber and so on. I do need to note, NPR has not independently verified those texts. We're citing Politico reporting here. Which did not stop Vice President JD Vance from leaping into the fray. This is him talking about pearl-clutching in an episode of \"The Charlie Kirk Show.\"(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE CHARLIE KIRK SHOW\")JD VANCE: And I really don't want us to grow up in a country where a kid telling a stupid joke - telling a very offensive, stupid joke - is cause to ruin their lives.KELLY: I don't want to grow up in that kind of country either, but I will note that the people in this alleged chat were all adults, right, Odette?YOUSEF: Yeah. I mean, Young Republicans goes up to the age of 40, and some of them held elected positions. These weren't people that were still in college, necessarily.KELLY: NPR's Odette Yousef on our national security podcast Sources & Methods. You can hear it wherever you get your podcasts.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

That support is deeply rooted in their evangelical faith, he said. But recently, Lahmeyer has noticed the conversation around Israel is changing quite a bit — particularly online.   \n   \"Some very influential leaders, all of whom I like — Tucker Carlson, Candace Owens, Marjorie Taylor Greene — have taken a very controversial stance in regards to the nation of Israel,\" he said.   Last week, Carlson hosted a prominent white nationalist named Nick Fuentes on his show. Although Carlson disagreed with Fuentes on his most antisemitic statements, such as American Jews are more faithful to Israel than they are to the United States, he did broadly align with Fuentes on his views about the country itself.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                White nationalist Nick Fuentes recently appeared on Tucker Carlson's podcast where he promoted antisemitic ideas. While Carlson disagreed on many topics, he said that America's support for Israel needed to be questioned: \"We get nothing out of it, I completely agree with you there,\" Carlson told Fuentes.\n                \n                    Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n    \n\n   \n   \"I've always thought it's great to criticize and question our relationship with Israel because it's insane and it hurts us. We get nothing out of it, I completely agree with you there,\" Carlson said.   Opposition to Israel on the right isn't new, but younger conservatives appear to be rapidly moving away from supporting the close U.S. relationship with the country. Among several polls, one from the Pew Research Center out earlier this year showed that conservatives under 50 were increasingly skeptical of Israel. Over the past three years, the group's negative views of the country jumped from 35% to 50%.   Loading...\n   The stakes for Israel are enormous. If skepticism starts spreading from conservative influencers to elected officials, it could threaten billions in military and foreign aid that Israel receives each year from the U.S.    For more than a decade, the majority of its political support in America has come from Christian conservatives, said Daniel Hummel, a historian at the University of Wisconsin, Madison who's studied Christian support for Israel. Today, with many on the left angry over the war in Gaza, their backing is more important than ever.   \"They're the last bastion of organized, large-scale national support for Israel,\" he said.   Biblical roots   Christian support for Israel is rooted in the Bible itself. Many evangelical Christians believe that the promises God made to the Jewish people in the Old Testament still hold, Lahmeyer said.   \"God's made a covenant with the Jewish people and he's not going to break that covenant,\" he said.   Evangelicals see support of the modern state of Israel as a way of honoring that divine will. \"If God says, 'This land belongs to you eternally,' then it belongs to you eternally — because God's the creator, he's the owner,\" Lahmeyer said.   \n   Many also believe the return of the Jewish people to Israel is a prerequisite for the second coming of Christ, he added.   From a modern standpoint, Hummel says, Christian support for the state of Israel has been growing in fits and starts since the nation was founded in 1948. The famous evangelical pastor Billy Graham visited Israel in the 1960s. By the 1980s and 1990s many large Christian groups, like the Moral Majority and the Christian Coalition, were supporting Israel.   \n   Evangelical support for Israel grew vastly in the years following the 9/11 terror attacks, Hummel said. Particularly in 2006, support for the country took off with the formation of a group known as Christians United For Israel (CUFI). The group became a single-issue lobby that claimed support from millions of American evangelicals, Hummel said. CUFI has been a staunch advocate for Israel and some of its most expansionist policies — such as settlements in the West Bank. (CUFI did not respond to NPR's request for an interview for this story.)   Because of their biblical beliefs about Israel, Hummel said, evangelical backers, known as Christian Zionists, have become central to American support. The backing of Christian Zionists kept growing, even as traditional supporters on the American left grew increasingly skeptical of Israel's policies in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                New housing projects are seen in the West Bank Israeli settlement of Givat Ze'ev,  June 18, 2023. Evangelical Christians have supported the expansion of Israeli settlements.\n                \n                    Ohad Zwigenberg/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Ohad Zwigenberg/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Today Christian Zionists \"are really valuable to Israel,\" he said. \"They tend to say, 'We think Israel knows its interests best… and we just want to support what they decide.'\"   Cracks over Gaza   But Israel's war in Gaza has challenged that view. \"Over the last two years, there has been this kind of gnawing away of support of Israel among evangelical Christians,\" Lahmeyer said.   The polls support that observation, said Shibley Telhami, the Anwar Sadat Professor for Peace and Development at the University of Maryland, who tracks public opinion about Israel. He says that since the war in Gaza, support has plummeted among young conservatives.   \n   Telhami's own work shows that today, only 32% of evangelicals aged 18-34 sympathize with Israel over the Palestinians — that's more than 30 points lower than the older generation. Support more broadly from Republicans in the same age range is only 24%.   Loading...\n   Telhami believes that shift in sentiment has emboldened longtime opponents to Israel on the right.   In addition to Tucker Carlson, prominent Republican influencers like Candace Owens and Stephen Bannon have publicly criticized Israel recently.   Many of these personalities never supported Israel, and they sense that now is the moment to speak up, said Curt Mills, editor of the American Conservative Magazine, which opposes Israeli policies and was founded by Pat Buchanan – a Christian conservative, former presidential hopeful and political commentator.   \n   \"Tucker and Bannon are political operators and in a lot of ways true believers, but they are also very effective businessmen and they would not be doing these programs if nobody gave a hoot,\" he said. \"There's an audience for this, people are frustrated, people are angry and they have reason to be.\"   In addition to anger over the way Israel has conducted its war in Gaza, Mills says many conservatives want America to avoid becoming entangled in new wars, particularly in the Middle East. And they worry Trump is allowing Israel to drive military decisions. That anxiety grew after America bombed Iranian nuclear sites earlier this year.   \"They are using Donald Trump's presidency like a rented car. The Israelis, the Israeli lobby, the Netanyahu Government, the neoconservatives in his ranks,\" he said.   Resurgent antisemitism   A desire for American isolationism and outrage over how Israel has conducted the war have driven some to speak up. But other influencers are using the war as an opportunity to peddle antisemitic conspiracies.   One example came last month, when podcaster Candace Owens discussed a meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a group of U.S. social media influencers:   \n   \"Two years ago, the mere idea that you might share a perspective that Jews are controlling the media, that would be considered antisemitic. You would be called a Jew hater. Fast forward to 2025, and Bibi Netanyahu is now hosting an on-camera meeting,\" she said.   The idea that \"Jews control the media\" is a long-held antisemitic trope. Owens has made other antisemitic remarks in the past, though she has repeatedly said that she does not hate Jewish people.   White nationalist Nick Fuentes used his appearance on Carlson's show to promote numerous antisemitic ideas: including that he believed Jews naturally dislike Europeans and that Jewish people prevent America from unifying around a common vision for itself.   \"The main challenge to that, a big challenge to [unifying the country] is organized Jewry in America,\" he told Carlson.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee (Center) tours the fifth-century Church of St George in the Palestinian Christian village of Taybeh, northeast of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, on July 19, 2025. Huckabee and others in the Trump Administration continue to be highly supportive of Israel.\n                \n                    JAAFAR ASHTIYEH/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        JAAFAR ASHTIYEH/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Hummel points out that much of this antisemitism is entangled in a theological divide over Israel. Many conservative opponents to Israel are Catholic or non-evangelical Protestants, he said. Those sects do not share the view that the Jewish people share a sacred covenant with God. And some, like Fuentes, are resurfacing centuries-old Christian conspiracy theories about the Jewish people.   Telhami says that it remains to be seen what all this actually means for the relationship between America and Israel. The Trump administration continues to be broadly supportive, and the U.S. ambassador to Israel is Mike Huckabee — a devout evangelical Christian.   \"The question of course is whether the shift in public opinion in-and-of-itself would lead to a shift in policy. And that's not a straightforward line,\" Telhami said.   But he added, it is clear that on the American right, support for Israel is no longer the given it once was.\n",

His company has become an important supporter of the Trump family's own crypto business. NPR's Bobby Allyn reports.BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: CZ predicted it. In May, eight months out of prison, he appeared on a tech-friendly podcast to discuss Trump's pro-crypto policies.(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"FAROKH RADIO\")CHANGPENG ZHAO: I was like, yeah, well, obviously, this will be a good guy for our industry...FAROKH SARMAD: Yeah.ZHAO: ...And also for any sort of people who have a criminal charge.SARMAD: Yeah.ALLYN: Like himself. During the Biden administration, federal prosecutors said CZ turned a blind eye to criminal activity on Binance. CZ pled guilty to money laundering charges and stepped down from the company. It was forced to shut down in the U.S. After Trump was elected, CZ - a China-born, Canadian-raised billionaire - pushed for a pardon. Binance struck a multibillion-dollar deal with World Liberty Financial, the Trump family's crypto venture. Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economics professor, says the pardon looks like a quid pro quo.ESWAR PRASAD: The Trump administration seems to be willing to use the U.S. government machinery to support the Trump family's crypto-related interests.ALLYN: Not so, says White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. She says the pardon was appropriate because the Biden White House was too harsh on crypto companies.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KAROLINE LEAVITT: The president wants to correct this overreach of the Biden administration's misjustice, and he exercised his constitutional authority to do so.ALLYN: The pardon could pave the way for Binance to reenter the U.S., according to Henry Farrell. He's a political scientist at Johns Hopkins University.HENRY FARRELL: I would expect that we are going to see a return to a world in which a lot of crazy things will happen on these crypto platforms without the same kinds of controls or without any great degree of fear from the owners of these crypto platforms.ALLYN: CZ, who now lives in the United Arab Emirates, has some other plans. Shortly after the pardon he posted on X - book releasing soon.Bobby Allyn, NPR News.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Republicans in Georgia are worried about losing a rare off-year election in November because rural voters might not show up at the polls.   \n\n    ADRIAN FLORIDO, HOST:  Rare off-year elections for two seats on a little-known utility board in Georgia are making Republicans nervous. That's because Democrats have more reasons to come out and vote. Emily Jones of member station WABE reports.EMILY JONES, BYLINE: Some of Georgia's top Republicans gathered in a barn-style wedding venue in Forsyth County, north of Atlanta, recently for a show of party unity and patriotism.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BUBBA MCDONALD: (Singing) And I'm proud to be an American, where at least I know I'm free.JONES: Bubba McDonald led them in song. He's a longtime member of the Public Service Commission, which regulates the state's largest electric utility, Georgia Power. Everyone on the commission is a Republican right now, and state party chair Josh McKoon told the crowd to keep it that way.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOSHUA MCKOON: We are all united in one goal, and that is to send the message that Georgia is closed to the Democratic party.JONES: Georgia hasn't voted for this commission in five years because a lawsuit disrupted the election schedule. Then in June, only 2% of Georgia voters turned out for the party primaries. About twice as many Democrats showed up as Republicans. So now the Republicans are spending time and money, from the governor on down, to get their voters to the polls. Republican state representative Todd Jones says that's key because many counties like Forsyth, which he represents, don't have local elections this year, unlike some of the state's Democratic strongholds.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TODD JONES: The fact is, we have over 100,000 voters who sit not attached to a city, which means they don't have a mayor's race, a city council race - you name it - to get them out. It's our job to get them out.JONES: Ron Ray got the message. This commission is important. It has final say over power bills, which it raised six times in the last three years but froze this year. Democrats want more solar and batteries, saying they're cheaper. Republicans say coal and gas are more reliable.RON RAY: I wasn't aware of how big a deal it was, honestly, until tonight.JONES: He learned about the rally from a Republican email list. He says the PSC wasn't on his radar before, but now he'll go vote.For their part, the Georgia Democrats see a chance for a rare statewide win that could bode well for next year, when they're trying to defend a seat in the U.S. Senate. So state chair Charlie Bailey says they're investing in this race in a way they haven't before.CHARLIE BAILEY: The state party's never spent any money on a PSC race, period.JONES: He says they're running phone banks, sending out thousands of mailers and knocking on doors. This battle over voter turnout is testing the strength of the Republican Party that has run Georgia for the last few decades and gives Democrats a rare shot at statewide victory. But even if the Democrats pull out a win, Georgia State University political scientist Tammy Greer says it might just be a blip.TAMMY GREER: We'll get to the end, and then someone will do a real quick analysis and say it was because of a Democratic wave or whatever that it looks like, rather than, you know, it just so happened because of the way that the calendar fell.JONES: For Democratic Chair Bailey, the fight over these obscure seats is a sign Georgia is still in battleground territory. The state narrowly voted for Biden in 2020 and for President Trump last year by 50.7%.BAILEY: A close election is yet another piece of evidence that this is a battleground. A battleground, by its very definition, can be won and it can be lost.JONES: And both parties have decided they're out to win, this year and next. For NPR News, I'm Emily Jones in Forsyth County, Georgia.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      President Trump's interest in curating his public image is closely linked to how he wields power as president.   \n\n    ADRIAN FLORIDO, HOST:  The East Wing of the White House is gone. President Trump once said that the White House would go untouched during the construction of a massive, privately funded ballroom. The sudden unannounced destruction is the latest example of the president's explicit quest to remake the White House and the presidency in his image.I'm joined now by NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith and senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro to look at how Trump's curated image is part of how he wields power. Hey to you both.TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hello.DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there.FLORIDO: Tam, let's start with you. Images of the demolition at the White House have been pretty jarring for people who see the building as a physical symbol of the U.S. What does the ballroom symbolize for Trump, though?KEITH: Trump often talks about this as the golden age of America - golden because he is back in office. He has an opulent ballroom at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and has long complained that the White House doesn't have a world-class ballroom. He says the ballroom he is building will be one of the most beautiful ballrooms anywhere in the world. He sees this as a necessary element of displaying American greatness to the rest of the world.MONTANARO: You know, and in the end, this very well may turn out to be something beautiful, but it - you know, that's not quite the point. I mean, there have been two big issues. First, there's been no debate, and second, there's very little transparency.And the White House is supposed to be the people's house, and has always been something more humble than exuberant palaces you might see in the Middle East or the very kind of monarchy the American colonies were breaking away from in the first place. All of this really is representative of how Trump has gone about his presidency - unilaterally and with little to no input or consideration from Congress or the public.FLORIDO: I mean, and it's not just the ballroom, right? Trump has made some other physical changes at the White House.KEITH: Yeah, there is so much gold in the Oval Office. It seems like every other day there is some new piece of flare added - always gold. Trump is obsessed with the decor in the White House. Take this from a cabinet meeting earlier this year, where he talked about selecting portraits for the cabinet room.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I love the frame of those pictures. Look at those frames, you know? I'm a frame person. Sometimes I like frames more than I like the pictures.(LAUGHTER)KEITH: And he has a whole bit he delivers about gold leaf.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: And the only question is, do you gold leaf it? - because you can't paint it. If you paint it, it won't look good 'cause they've never found a paint that looks like gold. You see that in the Oval Office.KEITH: Trump is definitely putting his stamp on the White House in a way that is synonymous with the brand he built before he was elected.FLORIDO: You know, you could possibly dismiss all of this as just an interest in aesthetics. But why does it matter beyond the aesthetics of it all?KEITH: This is definitely a metaphor for Trump's approach to his second term in office. He is emboldened and unbound. In the first term, he was at least a little deferential to institutions and the way things have always been done. Like, he didn't make any major changes to the White House then. This time, he is doing what he wants, and that certainly does extend to the aesthetics. In August, Trump even signed an executive order imposing personal style choices on federal buildings, saying they need to be traditional and neoclassical. I spoke with Lynn Vavreck, who specializes in political messaging at USC (ph).LYNN VAVRECK: A real estate developer who puts their name on many, many buildings is legacy-oriented. I think we have some clear signals that that has to be an underlying latent trait.KEITH: She says MAGA - the red hats, the gold, the branding of it all - has been wildly effective. Like, it isn't just a political slogan. It is a social identity, like being a die-hard fan of a football team.FLORIDO: Yeah. And I mean, Domenico, isn't this image curation TV producer Trump? It's sort of just who he always has been.MONTANARO: Yeah, of course. I mean, this is what Trump has always been known for - branding. You know, and that really speaks to who he is and how he's governed. You know, so much of it and his life in business has been about image, the power of positive thinking. You say it's true, and it is.You know, this is someone who took four companies into bankruptcy, and yet, with the help of \"Celebrity Apprentice\" on TV, his name on the sides of all those buildings that he didn't own, you know, he was able to convince a lot of people that he was wildly successful and represented luxury, when that just wasn't his reputation in New York.FLORIDO: And what else is there to it beyond just, you know, projecting power?MONTANARO: Well, in his view, the image becomes the power, you know, whether it's real or not. He's become a lifestyle brand meant to project wealth, power and an old-school masculinity of sorts - the tough guy who people don't mess with and gets the girls. It works for a large segment of the country, but it also has created a polarization because for half the country, his showiness, the braggadocio and lack of humility is a turnoff and something many don't see as what an American president should be.FLORIDO: What have the real-world consequences of all of that been, Tam?KEITH: His image has always been being a winner, and that is why the results of the 2020 election were such a low point for him. He lost, and then to this day, he refuses to acknowledge it. In part, that lack of acknowledgment led to what happened on January 6. Then in 2024, he won, but he still inflates the size of his win and overstates his mandate. He is governing in a way, though, that reflects the self-image he is projecting of dominance, inevitability, invincibility.FLORIDO: On the flip side, though, Tam, Trump - I mean, he really is focused on attacking and diminishing the people who disagree with him. What does he achieve with that?KEITH: Well, just look at this past weekend, where millions of people in thousands of American cities and towns showed up for No Kings protests. That showing contradicted the image that Trump has curated of ultimate power and adulation, so he downplayed the protests. Here he was on Air Force One.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MONTANARO: The demonstrations were very small, very ineffective, and the people were wacked out. When you look at those people, those are not representative of the people of our country.KEITH: Not representative of the people of our country - so essentially, he's saying that those who are against him aren't real Americans.MONTANARO: Yeah. I mean, in truth, Trump's popularity is low, and he's trying to project this image that he's powerful and beloved by all. But just because something looks like gold doesn't make it so.FLORIDO: Domenico Montanaro, Tamara Keith, thanks for swinging by.KEITH: You're welcome.MONTANARO: You got it.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "\n      Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland introduced a bill that would have paid all federal workers. It didn't pass. NPR's Steve Inskeep speaks to Van Hollen about the stalemate in Congress.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  We've been hearing about the shutdown from Democrats and Republicans on the program. And today, it's Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who represents a lot of federal employees. Senator, welcome back.CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Steve, good to be with you.INSKEEP: OK. So you have these competing bills. Democrats and Republicans didn't agree on paying all federal workers, which was your idea, but you did agree on paying people who are working currently. Why didn't you vote for that?VAN HOLLEN: Well, Steve, I should first say that the best way to reopen the government is for President Trump to negotiate with Democrats so that we can get the government up and running. My proposal is based on the idea that no federal employee should be punished for a shutdown that they have nothing to do with. What Senator Johnson proposed was to pay those federal employees who Donald Trump has decided to keep on the job. If you think about it, that gives President Trump the sole power to decide who stays on the job and who gets paid. So it essentially would allow him to keep parts of the government that he doesn't like shut down forever and keep those parts of the government he likes going, like, for example, ICE. And that would give him zero incentive to actually end the shutdown. So my proposal and the Democratic proposal was no federal employee should be punished for something that they have nothing to do with.INSKEEP: Got it. Let me ask about what happens next. SNAP benefits expire in a few days, as we've been reporting. People have to sign up for Obamacare in a few days, and the subsidies aren't going to be there. What do you foresee politically as the endgame here, Senator?VAN HOLLEN: Well, what we see is Donald Trump finally deciding, you know, not only to negotiate, you know, in the Middle East and not only to negotiate with Vladimir Putin but actually being willing to sit down to negotiate opening the government so not only can the government provide services to the American people, but we can also address this huge spike in health care costs that is upon us that people...INSKEEP: But do you think that the increasing pain that people feel will cause the president to negotiate with you in the way that you want?VAN HOLLEN: I think it's the fact that people are now getting these notices, seeing their premiums and health care costs doubling and tripling that will bring the president to the table. I mean, you already see Republicans calling upon the president to work on this issue. He should work on this issue. They left this ticking time bomb in place on people's health care costs that's going to explode. So, you know, the question is, why won't Donald Trump negotiate an end of the shutdown? When he's, you know, spending $20 billion to bail out his pal in Argentina, asking the Justice Department to pay him $230 million for his legal bills, why won't he just sit down to find a way to end the shutdown?INSKEEP: I'll just note before we move on, you mentioned the ticking time bomb. Republicans will point out that a Democratic Congress passed the Obamacare subsidies with an expiration date. But I want to move on to one other thing, and that is, because you're on the Foreign Affairs Committee, gives you an interest in what the U.S. military does. You've also got a lot of constituents who are in the military. And NPR has obtained a memo, as others have, from Secretary Pete Hegseth's office telling the military to stop communicating so much with Congress, stop telling you so much information. Here's a quote - \"unauthorized engagements with Congress, no matter how well-intentioned, may undermine department-wide priorities.\" What do you make of that, Senator?VAN HOLLEN: Steve, very quickly, I would say that Republicans extended tax cuts for billionaires permanently. The one tax cut they let lapse was the one that allows middle-class families to afford their health care.INSKEEP: OK, got it. Go on.VAN HOLLEN: Look; this is part of a pattern of the Trump administration trying to shut down information, facts to the public. We already saw Secretary Hegseth say to journalists that they had to essentially sign up for a self-censorship agreement. I'm glad to see so many journalists in the media reject that. You're seeing the same kind of thing now, trying to limit information going to Congress, even as the administration's engaged in this sort of lawless activities with respect to, you know, blowing boats out of the water. What Pete Hegseth wants to do is to shut down information.INSKEEP: Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland. Thanks so much. I really appreciate you taking the time this morning.VAN HOLLEN: Good to be with you, Steve. Thanks.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

BROWN/AFP via Getty Images/AFP\n    \n\n   \n   Annual inflation rose less than expected in September, according to a crucial report published Friday, nine days later than normal due to the government shutdown.   Consumer prices rose 3.0% in September from a year ago, slightly below forecasters' expectations, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). On a month-to-month basis, prices rose 0.3%, cooling slightly from the 0.4% inflation reported in August.     Loading...\n   Overall, the inflation data will likely add fuel to expectations that the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by another quarter percentage point at its policy meeting next week — its second consecutive cut.   Wells Fargo economist Nicole Cervi is among those expecting a cut — despite the latest evidence that prices are still rising faster than the Fed's 2% target.     \n   \"Even if the monthly inflation data came in softer than expected,\" the underlying trend is that \"inflation remains persistent,\" she says.    The Fed is missing a lot of other key economic data since most BLS workers were furloughed at the beginning of the month, when the shutdown began. Most government economic reports have been suspended until funding is restored.   But a core group of BLS number-crunchers were recalled specifically to publish the September inflation report, which was initially set to publish on Oct. 15. That's because it's a key part of the formula used to calculate the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) that 75 million Social Security recipients will receive next year.   \n   The Social Security Administration (SSA) later on Friday said that payments to recipients will increase by 2.8% next year, or an increase of about $56 per month starting in January.   The COLA increase for next year is higher than the 2.5% increase that Social Security beneficiaries got this year, but it's below the 3.1% average over the past decade, according to the SSA.   \"That's better than nothing ... but there's so many more things that need to get fixed,\" says Jim Pedersen, a 66-year-old retired autoworker who's also the president of the Michigan Alliance for Retired Americans, a nonprofit founded by the AFL-CIO.   \n   He points out that seniors tend to spend more money on health insurance and prescriptions than younger Americans — and that the prices for health care are outpacing inflation. Medicare premiums are projected to rise by more than 11% next year, according to AARP.   \"So they're going to outstrip that 2.8% really fast,\" he says.   The raw material for the inflation report – the price checks on hundreds of goods and services around the country – was collected in September. Tariffs continue to put upward pressure on the price of imported goods, while other components of inflation, such as housing costs, have been moderating somewhat.\n",

White House officials said Trump's reaction was a culmination of the administration's long, pent-up frustration about Canada's strategy in trade talks.   Later Friday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose province had sponsored the ad, said it would be taken down.   \n   Ford said after talking with Prime Minister Carney he's decided to pause the advertising campaign effective Monday so that trade talks can resume. Ford said they've achieved their goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels.   \"Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses,\" Ford said. \"We've achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels.\"   The U.S. president alleged the ad misrepresented the position of Reagan, a two-term president who remains a beloved figure in the Republican Party, and was aimed at influencing the U.S. Supreme Court ahead of a hearing scheduled for next month that could decide whether Trump has the power to impose his sweeping tariffs, a key part of his economic strategy. Trump is so invested in the case that he has said he'd like to attend oral arguments.   \n   \"CANADA CHEATED AND GOT CAUGHT!!!\" Trump wrote on his social media site Friday morning. \"They fraudulently took a big buy ad saying that Ronald Reagan did not like Tariffs, when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY. Canada is trying to illegally influence the United States Supreme Court in one of the most important rulings in the history of our Country.\"   Canadian premier digs in after Trump ends talks   The ad was paid for by Ontario's government, not the Canadian federal government. Ford, the premier, didn't initially back down, posting Friday that Canada and the U.S. are allies \"and Reagan knew that both are stronger together.\" Ford then provided a link to a Reagan speech where the late president voices opposition to tariffs.   \n   Ford had said the province plans to pay $54 million (about $75 million Canadian) for the ads to air across multiple American television stations using audio and video of Reagan speaking about tariffs in 1987.   Even though the ad will eventually be taken down, it'll still run this weekend, including Game 1 of the World Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Dodgers on Friday night.   Ford is a populist conservative who doesn't belong to the same party as Carney, a Liberal.   For his part, Carney said his government remains ready to continue talks to reduce tariffs in certain sectors.   \"We can't control the trade policy of the United States. We recognize that that policy has fundamentally changed from the 1980s,\" he said Friday morning before boarding a flight for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Malaysia. Trump is set to travel to the same summit Friday night.   Reagan's foundation speaks out against ad   Earlier Thursday night, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute posted on X that the ad \"misrepresents the 'Presidential Radio Address to the Nation on Free and Fair Trade' dated April 25, 1987.\" It added that Ontario did not receive foundation permission \"to use and edit the remarks\" and said it was reviewing legal options.   The foundation in Simi Valley, California, is perhaps best known for maintaining the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum. Its board includes longtime Republican Party stalwarts such as former Trump Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who resigned after the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol, and former House Speaker Paul Ryan, whose free-market philosophy often clashes with Trump's protectionist tendencies.   Another board member is Lachlan Murdoch, the son of Rupert, who is executive chairman and CEO of Fox Corporation. The board is chaired by Fred Ryan, the former publisher and CEO of The Washington Post.   \n   Trump wrote Thursday night that \"The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs.\" He added, \"TARIFFS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY, AND ECONOMY, OF THE U.S.A. Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED.\"   Reagan did not actually love tariffs. He often criticized government policies — including protectionist measures such as tariffs — that interfered with free commerce and he spent much of that 1987 radio address spelling out the case against tariffs.   Blowup was a long time coming, administration officials indicate   White House spokesman Kush Desai said the ad was the \"latest example of how Canadian officials would rather play games than engage with the Administration.\"   Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told reporters at the White House on Friday that Canada has shown a \"lack of flexibility\" and also cited \"leftover behaviors from the Trudeau folks,\" referring to former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who had a frosty relationship with the Trump administration.   \"If you look at all the countries around the world that we've made deals with, and the fact that we're now negotiating with Mexico separately reveals that it's not just about one ad,\" Hassett said.   Carney met with Trump earlier this month to try to ease trade tensions, as the two countries and Mexico prepare for a review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal Trump negotiated in his first term but has since soured on.   More than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the U.S., and nearly $3.6 billion Canadian ($2.7 billion U.S.) worth of goods and services cross the border daily.   Trump initially appeared unfazed by the ad   Trump said earlier in the week that he had seen the ad on TV and didn't seem bothered by it. \"If I was Canada, I'd take that same ad also,\" he said Tuesday during a lunch with Republican senators.   \n   Ontario bought more than $275,000 of ad reservations for the spot to air in 198 of the nation's 210 media markets this month, according to data from the nonpartisan media tracking firm AdImpact. It was broadcast most frequently in the New York market, with more than 530 airings, followed by Washington, D.C., at around 280. The only other markets with more than 100 airings were those around Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and West Palm Beach, Florida.   Ford previously got Trump's attention with an electricity surcharge to U.S. states. Trump responded by doubling steel and aluminum tariffs.   \n   The president has moved to impose steep U.S. tariffs on many goods from Canada. In April, Canada's government imposed retaliatory levies on certain U.S. goods -- but it carved out exemptions for some automakers to bring specific numbers of vehicles into the country, known as remission quotas.   Trump's tariffs have especially hurt Canada's auto sector, much of which is based in Ontario. This month, Stellantis said it would move a production line from Ontario to Illinois.\n",

But he said he did not think the administration would ask for a declaration of war.\n                \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The U.S. military carried out three more strikes on alleged drug boats this week. Two of those attacks were not in the Caribbean Sea but in the eastern Pacific Ocean, signaling an expansion of the Trump administration's campaign against drug trafficking from South America.   Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted a video on X of a blue speedboat skipping along the ocean waters before being hit and then bursting into flames.   \"Just as Al Qaeda waged war on our homeland, these cartels are waging war on our border and our people,\" Hegseth wrote in the Wednesday message. \"There will be no refuge or forgiveness — only justice.\"   \n   The Pacific strikes represented the eighth and ninth known boat attacks. On Friday, Hegseth announced an additional strike in the Caribbean, raising the known death toll to 43. The Trump administration has yet to provide public evidence to support its assertions that the individuals on the boats were cartel members and that the vessels were transporting drugs, raising concerns about the legality of the strikes and the real goals of the White House campaign.   Prior to the strikes in the Pacific, the U.S. military had been ramping up the number of troops and naval ships in the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Venezuela. On Friday, the Pentagon said the Gerald Ford Carrier Strike Group is being sent to the U.S. Southern Command area of responsibility, which includes the Caribbean.    International law experts say it's an unprecedented amount of military hardware to confront suspected drug boats, which has fueled questions about whether the operation is about countering narcotics trafficking or instead toppling Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.   \n   \"It's such overkill in this naval deployment that there could be no justification if all the United States is trying to do is to attack a couple of small boats and intimidate drug traffickers,\" said Benjamin Gedan, who led the Venezuela portfolio at the Obama White House. \"It's either a bluff meant to scare the pants off the Venezuelan generals and encourage them to rise up and remove the president … or actual preparations for some sort of war with Venezuela.\"   \n   Trump has insisted that he has the legal authority to launch the attacks in international waters, calling it a national security issue to save American lives.   During a meeting on Wednesday with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, Trump boasted about the expanded use of force.   \"They had one today in the Pacific. And the way I look at it, every time I look because it is violent and it is very — it's amazing, the weaponry,\" he said. \"They have these boats that go 45, 50 miles an hour in the water, and when you look at the accuracy and the power. Look, we have the greatest military in the world.\"   He asserted that his actions are saving the lives of tens of thousands of Americans without providing evidence. He also said the U.S. may conduct strikes on land next.   \"We will hit them very hard when they come in by land,\" he said. \"We're totally prepared to do that. And we'll probably go back to Congress and explain exactly what we're doing when we come to the land.\"   Some lawmakers are raising concerns    The power to declare war rests with Congress, not the White House.   After the al-Qaida attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, which killed some 3,000 Americans, Congress passed an authorization for use of military force, granting the president the ability to use the U.S. military against the terrorist group responsible for the attacks.   The Trump administration has designated several South and Central American drug cartels and gangs as foreign terrorist organizations, but Congress has not authorized the use of force against them.   Lawmakers — Democrats and some Republicans — have expressed concerns that the strikes on suspected drug boats violate domestic and international laws.   \n   Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky charged that Trump has set a new precedent of shoot first, ask questions later.   \"The idea of indiscriminately killing people without knowing their names, without seeing any evidence, without making a formal accusation or without collecting evidence,\" he said. \"It's kind of ironic that we think these people are so dangerous, we're going to kill them without any information.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., is among those in Congress raising questions about the Trump administration's strikes on alleged drug boats. \"It's kind of ironic that we think these people are so dangerous, we're going to kill them without any information,\" he says. Pictured here is Paul on Capitol Hill on June 26.\n                \n                    Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   At the White House on Thursday, Trump said he thinks lawmakers will support his administration's efforts, but when asked why he wouldn't just ask Congress for a declaration of war, he said: \"I don't think we're going necessarily to ask for a declaration of war. I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. OK. We're going to kill them. They're going to be, like, dead.\"   \n   The Trump administration has given few specifics about its legal justification for the military strikes other than that the president is taking action under his Article II powers as commander in chief and as a defensive measure.   In a notification to Congress last month, the administration said the president has determined that unspecified cartels are nonstate armed groups and that their actions amount to an \"armed attack\" on the United States.   The administration also said Trump has determined that the U.S. is in an armed conflict with nonstate actors — cartels in South America — and that the Defense Department is conducting operations against them pursuant to the laws of armed conflict.   Questions about the legality of the strikes    But legal experts say the administration's justification is full of holes.   \"What this boils down to is the president of the United States asserting a prerogative to kill people based solely on his own say-so,\" said Brian Finucane, a former legal adviser for the State Department.   Finucane, who is now with the International Crisis Group, says the pivotal legal conclusions \"are simply reached by executive fiat,\" thus \"making it permissible for the president to engage in premeditated killing.\"   \"Outside of armed conflict, there is a word for the premeditated killing of people, and that word is 'murder,'\" he said. \"And just because the administration puts together this fig leaf of a legal justification does not legitimize these premeditated killings in the Caribbean.\"   It's not just Venezuela that feels targeted. The latest strikes raised particular concerns in Colombia, which has coastlines on both the Caribbean and Pacific.   Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the U.S. of murder and charged that some of the strikes killed Colombians. Trump responded by announcing that he would stop aid payments to Colombia.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Colombian President Gustavo Petro speaks during the United Nations General Assembly in New York City on Sept. 23. Petro has said that some of the U.S. strikes have killed Colombians.\n                \n                    Leonardo Munoz/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Leonardo Munoz/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"They're not going to get away with it much longer,\" Trump said on Thursday. \"We're not going to put up with it much longer. Colombia is very bad.\"   \n   This week, a group of independent United Nations experts said even if the boats are transporting drugs, as the White House asserts, \"the use of lethal force in international waters without proper legal basis violates international law of the sea and amounts to extrajudicial executions.\"   \"These moves are an extremely dangerous escalation with grave implications for peace and security in the Caribbean region,\" wrote the experts, who are appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council.   On Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio largely listened as Trump sparred with reporters about his legal authority and allowing Congress to weigh in.   \n   When Trump turned to his top adviser on foreign policy for his thoughts, Rubio was blunt.   \"Bottom line, these are drug boats,\" he said. \"If people want to stop seeing drug boats blow up, stop sending drugs to the United States.\"   Claudia Grisales contributed reporting. \n",

After a two-hour wait, Wanda Bright had finally reached the front of the line — just as the first batch of supplies ran out.   The Capital Area Food Bank had started the day with 300 boxes, enough for 150 government employees to receive two boxes each. It turned out that the need was even greater.   Fortunately, reinforcements had been called in, and cheers erupted as a second truck backed into the shopping center parking lot. Bright sighed with relief as volunteers handed over bread and other provisions to help get her family through the week.   \n   \"A lot of us are stressed, and it takes a toll on our mental health,\" says Bright, one of an estimated 700,000 federal workers across the U.S. now furloughed, meaning they are not working at the moment. \"Some people can handle this. A lot of people cannot.\"   For many federal workers, Friday is supposed to be payday. Instead, they are getting nothing. No partial pay. No sign of when their paychecks might resume.   Meanwhile, the Trump administration has managed to move money around to ensure that some people get paid, particularly those doing work deemed critical to President Trump's priorities.   \"We got the people that we want paid, paid, OK?\" Trump said at the White House last week.   1.4 million going without pay   Altogether, about 1.4 million civilian federal employees across the country are going without pay, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank in Washington, D.C. Roughly half of them are furloughed. The other half has been deemed essential and so is continuing to work.   For many people in both groups, the lapse in congressional appropriations has brought on new financial strain in a year that has already been tough.   \n   \"This whole fiscal year — 2025 — I was worried about my job, worried about getting RIF'd,\" says Jay, a furloughed worker from the National Institutes of Health, referring to the reductions in force, or layoffs, that have already hit a number of agencies. \"It was draining, emotionally draining. Now the reality is setting in when you're not getting checks and you need to provide for your family.\"   Jay, who asked to be identified by only his first name out of fear of losing his job, carried his two boxes away from the food distribution site in a stroller. He has a 1-year-old and a 5-year-old waiting for him at home.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Pastor Oliver Carter explains the procedures for the food distribution to federal workers in line in Hyattsville.\n                \n                    Tyrone Turner/WAMU\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Tyrone Turner/WAMU\n    \n\n   \n   In Tampa, Fla., Tierra Carter is still going to work, answering calls placed to the Social Security Administration's 1-800 number. Carter, who serves as a union representative with the American Federation of Government Employees, says the lack of a paycheck has forced her to take out loans and seek a hardship withdrawal from her 401(k).   \n   \"I kind of feel like I'm in a pool and I'm trying to swim to the top, but every time I get to the middle, I'm getting knocked back down,\" she says.   Offering help to pay the bills   Many federal workers earn less than $90,000 a year — 43%, according to an analysis of March 2024 government data by the Pew Research Center. Even those earning more could see bills pile up quickly.   Credit unions, where many federal workers do their banking, have started providing some financial relief. By Wednesday, Iowa-based Veridian Credit Union had already approved more than $55,000 in \"Government Advance Loans\" — short-term, interest-free loans — for 32 members affected by the shutdown. It had also processed 80 no-fee \"Delay-a-Pays\" for members. Similarly, Denver-based Westerra Credit Union and Redwood Credit Union in Northern California have each already provided nearly $100,000 in short-term, interest-free loans to members, with more applications coming in every day.   \n   In Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia, the Community Services Agency of the Metropolitan Washington Council, AFL-CIO, has been providing emergency financial support through its Federal Worker Solidarity Fund since February. But in recent days, requests for help with groceries, rent, mortgage payments and utility bills have soared, says Sig Meilus, the organization's director.   Thursday morning, Meilus woke up to 20 new applications for assistance that had come into her inbox overnight. With no end to the shutdown in sight, she expects the trend to continue.   \"Which also means that, unfortunately, our funds are dwindling quickly,\" she says.   Shutdown begins to impact communities   Because roughly two-thirds of the civilian federal workforce is still working despite the lapse in annual appropriations, the shutdown may not be all that apparent to a lot of Americans.   But the longer it drags on, the more the public will begin to feel its economic effects, says Shai Akabas, vice president of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.   \n   Already, Akabas says, there might be a grocery store next to a federal building that's not getting as much foot traffic, or a day care that's seeing fewer children show up because their parents are furloughed. Over time, communities that have higher densities of federal workers could see less spending overall.   \"Not everybody feels it yet, but it's actually affecting the broader economy,\" Akabas says.   While Congress passed a law in 2019 ensuring back pay for federal employees after a shutdown ends, Trump suggested recently that furloughed workers shouldn't count on it.   \"We're going to see,\" Trump said a week into the shutdown. \"Most of them are going to get back pay, and we're going to try and make sure of that. But some of them are being hurt very badly by the Democrats and they therefore won't qualify.\"   Trump administration finds ways to pay some federal workers   Across the government, many federal workers are still getting paid as usual during the shutdown. Salaries for some federal employees, including the vast majority of those at the Department of Veterans Affairs, do not come out of appropriations that Congress must approve every year.   In recent weeks, the Trump administration has also engaged in what the director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, called \"budgetary twister\" in an interview on The Charlie Kirk Show.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Customs and Border Protection agents stand outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland, Ore., on Oct. 4.\n                \n                    Jenny Kane/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jenny Kane/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Active-duty military personnel got their paychecks on schedule last week, after the Defense Department dipped into its unused research and development funds to find the money.   Some 70,000 law enforcement officers with the Department of Homeland Security are also now being paid from funds allocated to the department in Trump's tax-and-spending bill last summer. Yet many of their own colleagues are not getting paid — and likely won't be until the shutdown is over — creating an unequal playing field among federal employees that grows more slanted as the shutdown continues.\n",

Today's top stories   Close to a million and a half federal workers across the U.S. are going without pay today as the government enters day 24 of the shutdown. Yesterday, the Senate blocked dueling bills to pay federal employees. The Republican bill would have paid the people still working despite the shutdown. The Democratic option would have paid everybody, including furloughed workers.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A woman walks past a sign indicating the National Gallery of Art is closed as the US government continues its shutdown Oct. 6 in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Tierra Carter, who works at the Social Security Administration, tells NPR's Andrea Hsu that she's had to take out loans and seek a hardship withdrawal from her 401(k) due to the shutdown. Carter says it feels as if she is trying to swim to the top of a pool, but every time she gets to the middle, she is knocked back down. Hsu tells Up First that if the shutdown continues, experts believe the general public will begin to feel the economic effects in their communities. Grocery stores near federal buildings are already experiencing less foot traffic.   Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier were among the more than 30 people arrested yesterday in an FBI investigation into illegal gambling. The arrests stem from their alleged involvement in two major schemes: one involving bets placed on NBA games and the other concerning underground poker games. Billups and Rozier have been placed on leave.    \n   🎧 This case is a big deal because the scandal involves leaks from multiple teams and players or coaches allegedly sharing non-public information with gamblers, says NPR's Becky Sullivan. The scheme came to light thanks to monitoring services that track bets and look for unusual patterns. For example, Rozier allegedly told a friend he would withdraw from a game with an injury, which led that friend to sell the information to a gambler. As a result, organized bettors placed about a quarter of a million dollars on proposition bets predicting Rozier would underperform.   This week, the Trump administration announced new sanctions on Russia aimed at bringing Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table to end the war in Ukraine. The sanctions target two oil giants, Rosneft and Lukoil, which make up nearly half of Russian oil exports, according to NPR's Charles Maynes. This move to sanction comes after President Trump reversed his decision after initially saying he would hold another summit meeting with Putin.    🎧 The sanctions are significant as they mark the first time Trump has followed through on threats to hold Russia accountable for the war, Maynes says. The idea for the summit came after a phone call Putin initiated with Trump. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was set to meet with Trump about the possibility of the U.S. providing Ukraine with long-range weapons. Trump decided not to give the weapons to Ukraine and said he'd meet with Putin instead. Putin informed reporters last night that the canceled meeting and sanctions undermined recent progress in restoring relations with the U.S.   \n   Today's listen   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Members of a youth orchestra outside Kyiv perform a composition they wrote about the sounds of the war in Ukraine at night.\n                \n                    Hanna Palamarenko/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Hanna Palamarenko/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   The lives of Ukrainians have changed in many ways since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, including the way nighttime sounds. Since the start of the war, the country has been hit with over 50,000 drone strikes. Members of a youth orchestra outside of Kyiv know the new sounds of their country well and are working on a sonic poem about it. The sound of the piece begins as a peaceful night or an ordinary day in an ordinary city, until chaos rocks the city.

A partisan argument over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces led to the current shutdown. Some 24 million people — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans.   Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the heath care of undocumented immigrants. That is not true.   Democrats in the Senate refused to vote for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP spending and tax bill that passed over the summer.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), joined by House Minority Whip Katherine Clark (D-Mass.)

That date marks the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the ACA, when most states will send notices to subscribers laying out the cost of coverage without subsidies.   \n   In Vermont, where notices started going out on Oct. 15, for example, some families are facing increases of $25,000, according to Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt.   Read more about more about the health care fight behind the shutdown here.

Of those, roughly half are furloughed, which means they are not working and not getting paid, but expect to return to work once the federal shutdown is over.   The other half have been deemed essential and so are continuing to work.   Thursday, the Senate failed to advance a pair of competing measures to pay at least some federal employees during the government shutdown.   During the shutdown, the Trump administration has managed to move money around to ensure that some people get paid, including active duty military and law enforcement officers with the Department of Homeland Security.   Many other federal workers are also still getting paid as usual during the shutdown. Salaries for some federal employees, including the vast majority of those at the Department of Veterans Affairs, do not come out of appropriations that Congress must approve every year.   Are government workers being laid off during the shutdown?   The Trump administration has been following through on threats to further slash the size of government during the shutdown, seeking to layoff roughly 4,000 workers earlier this month. Some unions that represent workers are fighting back in court; the judge overseeing the case issued a temporary restraining order directing the Trump administration to pause reduction in force (RIF) efforts that affect certain unionized employees.   Read more about the case and how the Trump administration has reacted to the temporary court order   \n      How is the shutdown impacting active duty military?    The Trump administration earlier this month found unused research and development funds to pay active military members, according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly. So they didn't miss a full paycheck earlier this month, but it only covered one pay cycle. Many are expecting their next paycheck at the end of this month.   Military families are already seeking additional assistance from food banks and other groups to help with paying bills.      What about WIC and SNAP benefits?   Tens of millions of people are at risk of losing food and nutrition aid if the shutdown continues into November. That includes 7 million for the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) and nearly 42 million who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP, previously known as food stamps. Their debit-like cards were funded a month in advance through October, but the Trump administration has warned the program will run out of money Nov. 1.    In a letter dated Oct. 10, the USDA told state agencies to hold off distributing November benefits \"until further notice\" because of insufficient funds. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has called on the agency to shift money from its contingency fund and other places to keep SNAP at least partially funded.   Meanwhile, WIC was initially slated to lose funding after only a couple weeks. The Trump administration shifted $300 million in tariff revenue to keep it afloat, but the National WIC Association says that emergency funding will only last through October. It's calling for an additional $300 million to keep WIC operating for a couple more weeks. Some states could step in to help fill the gap, depending on their resources.   — Jennifer Ludden, NPR   Read more on the impact to food aid for millions of Americans, here.    \n   And what about school lunches?   Some state agencies say they may not have the funds to reimburse schools providing free and low-cost meals.   Diane Pratt-Heavner, a spokesperson for the School Nutrition Association, says some agencies have told her organization they don't have the money to pay schools back for meals during the shutdown.   \"There is a strong commitment on both sides of the aisle to make sure that kids have access to healthy meals at school, so we are hopeful that the administration and Congress will act before this becomes an issue.\"   According to Pratt-Heavner, USDA released funds to regional offices for meals served in October. But some states report they have yet to receive any money, she said. Before the shutdown, USDA released a contingency plan outlining funds states could tap into to cover any gaps. A USDA spokesman did not directly answer NPR when asked if the agency would advance funding to state agencies should the shutdown persist.   — Kadin Mills, NPR      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A United States Postal Service (USPS) mail box stands in Manhattan on Aug. 5, 2020 in New York City.

The postal service is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual.      IRS furloughs nearly half its staff   A contingency plan from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS' approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees were issued reduction in force, or RIF, notices on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9.   The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year's tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data.   \n   — Scott Horsley, Andrea Hsu and Stephen Fowler, NPR      National Nuclear Security Administration furloughs 1,400 employees   On Oct. 20, the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the nation's nuclear weapons, said it is furloughing approximately 1,400 employees. The agency is responsible for overseeing thousands of warheads that are not currently deployed on missiles, bombers and submarines.   According to an Energy Department spokesperson, the furloughs are due to the \"Democrat shutdown.\"   Roughly 400 employees remain on the job providing security and safety oversight. And the office responsible for moving nuclear weapons around the country remains funded until next week.   — Geoff Brumfiel, NPR   In addition, Nevada Public Radio is reporting more than 1,000 nuclear contractors in Nevada could receive notices by the end of the month, because their work relies on the federal government remaining open.      Teachers and schools won't be directly impacted, but federal education functions might   Eighty-seven percent of Department of Education employees have been temporary furloughed, as detailed in agency shutdown contingency plans.   At the same time, the administration is trying to use a new round of layoffs to gut multiple offices inside the department, including the Office for Civil Rights and the office responsible for overseeing special education, according to multiple sources within the department.   This latest reduction-in-force (RIF) cut at least 121 staffers responsible for overseeing roughly $15 billion in special education funding and for making sure states provide special education services to the nation's more than 7.5 million children with disabilities. According to multiple sources, the special education office is now left with just a handful of top executives and support staff.   In addition, many Department of Education employees who were furloughed were surprised to see a message blaming Democrats for the government shutdown inserted into their out-of-office replies. A federal workers union is suing the Trump administration for inserting the language into employees' out-of-office email messages.   \n   — Shannon Bond and Cory Turner, NPR   The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 2026 went live as scheduled at the start of October. As WPR's Corrinne Hess reports, the U.S. Department of Education says that student financial aid programs will continue, despite the shutdown.      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Greg Freeman, a National Park Service ranger closes the entrance gate due to the government shutdown at the Everglades National Park Shark Valley on Oct. 1 in Florida.

That includes the National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities. NPR's Alana Wise reports that the Smithsonian assured the public that animals would still be cared for during the zoo's closure. Animal cams are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown.   As KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported, a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails \"will generally remain accessible to visitors\" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided.   Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services.   The Salem, Mass. visitor center will be open through Halloween thanks to community support   WBUR's Andrea Shea reports that local leaders in Salem, Mass., learned a National Park Service visitor center and its bathrooms would be closed during their busiest tourist season so they took action on a plan to keep them open.   Shea reports that NPS agreed to let Salem reopen the center if the community covered costs through Halloween weekend. Annie Harris — CEO of the non-profit Essex Heritage that helps staff and run the facility — sent out a flurry of emails including to the mayor. Within 48 hours businesses and non-profits raised $18,000 — keeping the center open until Nov. 2.      Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue   Social Security, VA and other benefits will continue.   \n   But employees at Social Security field offices earlier this month said the government shutdown has left them unable to carry out an important service for some recipients. As NPR's Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These official letters act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits.   In an Oct. 21 email to users answering commonly asked questions about how shutdown impacts, SSA noted the online portal can still be used to access benefit verification letters.   Some furloughed employees at the Labor Department were brought back to work, in order to complete the September inflation report, which is a key ingredient used to calculate the cost of living adjustment that Social Security recipients will receive next year. Friday, the SSA said the payments to recipients will increase by 2.8% next year, or an increase of about $56 per month starting in January.

ICE will mostly continue uninterrupted   Immigration cases and enforcement are proceeding as usual during the government shutdown, with a few small exceptions. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the employees in the Office of Detention Oversight, which inspects immigration detention centers, is currently not working. \"We hope Democrats will open up the government swiftly so that this office can resume its work,\" McLaughlin said.   According to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, DHS law enforcement, including ICE agents, will be paid for work done during the shutdown.   \"More than 70,000 sworn law enforcement officers across DHS including those serving in CBP, ICE, Secret Service, TSA and other critical mission areas will be paid for all hours worked during the shutdown period,\" Noem posted on X last week. \"By Wednesday, October 22, law enforcement officers will receive a \"super check\" — which covers the 4 days lost, their overtime, and their next pay period.\"   \n   The U.S. Coast Guard, which is housed within DHS, will continue to be paid, also according to a post last week from Noem, from funds appropriated in the reconciliation bill earlier this year.   — Ximena Bustillo, NPR      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                An air traffic control tower at the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport on Oct. 1 in Austin, Texas is seen following the federal government shutdown.\n                \n                    Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   If you're flying soon …   Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees are considered \"essential workers\" and have to stay on the job.

Here's what we know so far about how the shutdown is affecting specific communities across the country:      Alaska   The U.S. Transportation Department says it has secured funding to continue the Essential Air Service program, subsidizing routes to 65 Alaska communities and more than an additional 100 communities nationwide, through Nov. 2. [Alaska Public Media]About 15,000 federal employees live in Alaska, one of the highest percentages of federal employees when compared with other states.

[KQED]Well over 1 million people in L.A. County get food benefits from CalFresh — the state's implementation of the federally funded SNAP program. The other major SoCal counties — San Bernardino, Riverside and Orange — each have more than 300,000 people on CalFresh, according to state data. [LAist]The shutdown of the federal government has brought the full or partial closure of many National Park Service sites across California: Muir Woods is fully closed. Alcatraz Island is slated to stay open. Other sites like Point Reyes National Seashore and Fort Point have partial closures, with some parking lots blocked or bathrooms locked. Even some park staff said they didn't learn the plan until Sept. 30 — the afternoon before the government shut down. Yosemite is open, but with lots of changes for visitors. [KQED]      Colorado   Sites and lands in Colorado operated by the National Park Service are open, but \"some services may be limited or unavailable,\" according to the agency's website. [Colorado Public Radio]In Colorado, the federal government employs thousands of workers at climate or land-management agencies. An EPA spokesperson told CPR News that the agency is operating under its shutdown plan, which would furlough thousands of employees. [Colorado Public Radio]Court documents show almost 200 Colorado-based positions that the Interior Department wants to cut. [Colorado Public Radio]Unemployment claims from Colorado's federal workers are surging amid the U.S. government shutdown. Stephanie Rogers, a Colorado-based microbiologist with the Food and Drug Administration, told CPR she filed for unemployment the day after the shutdown started.

[WSHU]Connecticut has a $2.5 billion budget surplus this year — its second largest in history. Advocates are asking Lamont to consider using it to help offset the federal shortfall. Legislative leaders are considering appropriating the money during a special session next month. [WSHU]      Georgia   For federal workers living paycheck to paycheck, one option to get through being furloughed could be filing for unemployment insurance, Georgia Labor Commissioner Barbara Rivera Holmes said. The employees will have to pay the benefits back once the shutdown ends and they receive back pay, but the benefits can help them make ends meet while they are not being paid. [GPB]Georgia farmers could also face delays in block grant funding and commodity data they rely on during the time-sensitive season of planting and harvesting.

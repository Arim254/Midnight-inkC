Because if we go in, all they do is complain,\" Trump said.   He predicted that those cities would need help, but said if the leaders of those cities seek it from the federal government, \"They have to say, 'Please.'\"   The Trump administration has already deployed the National Guard, or federal law enforcement officials, in a number of Democratic areas, including Washington, Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland, Oregon. But Saturday's order comes as opposition to such tactics has grown, particularly in Minnesota's Twin Cities region.   Trump said Saturday night that protesters who \"do anything bad\" to immigration officers and other federal law enforcement, \"will have to suffer\" and \"will get taken care of in at least an equal way.\"   \"You see it, the way they treat our people. And I said, you're allowed, if somebody does that, you can do something back. You're not going to stand there and take it if somebody spits in your face,\" Trump said.   \n   Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul have challenged a federal immigration enforcement surge in those cities, arguing that DHS is violating constitutional protections.   A federal judge says she won't halt enforcement operations as the lawsuit proceeds. State and local officials had sought a quick order to halt the enforcement action or limit its scope. Justice Department lawyers have called the lawsuit \"legally frivolous.\"   The state, particularly Minneapolis, has been on edge after federal officers fatally shot two people in the city: Renee Good on Jan. 7 and Alex Pretti on Jan. 24. Thousands of people have taken to the streets to protest the federal action in Minnesota and across the country.   Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, has suggested the administration could reduce the number of immigration enforcement officers in Minnesota — but only if state and local officials cooperate. Trump sent Homan to Minneapolis following the killings of Good and Pretti, seeming to signal a willingness to ease tensions in Minnesota.   The president on Saturday night said he intended to speak to Homan and Noem on Sunday and he seemed to endorse the idea of immigration agents wearing body cameras or having their interactions filmed.   Trump was asked by a reporter if he thought it was a good thing having lots of cameras capturing incidents with law enforcement.   \"I think it would help law enforcement but I'd have to talk to them,\" Trump said.   He went on and added: \"That works both ways. But overall, I think it's 80% in favor of law enforcement.\"\n",

Rehmet, a labor union leader and veteran, easily defeated Republican Leigh Wambsganss, a conservative activist, in the Fort Worth-area district. With almost all votes counted, Rehmet had a comfortable lead of more than 14 percentage points.   \"This win goes to everyday working people,\" Rehmet told supporters.   His victory added to Democrats' record of overperforming in special elections so far this cycle. Democrats said it was further evidence that voters under the second Trump administration are motivated to reject GOP candidates and their policies.   \n   Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin called it \"a warning sign to Republicans across the country.\"   The seat was open because the four-term GOP incumbent, Kelly Hancock, resigned to take a statewide office. Hancock easily won election each time he ran for the office, and Republicans have held the seat for decades.   The district is redder than its home, Tarrant County. Trump won the county by 5 points in 2024, but Democratic President Joe Biden carried it in 2020 by about 1,800 votes out of more than 834,000 cast.   Trump posted about the race on his social media platform earlier Saturday, urging voters to get out to support Wambsganss. He called her a successful entrepreneur and \"an incredible supporter\" of his Make America Great Again movement.   But Rehmet had support from national organizations, including the DNC and VoteVets, a veterans group that said it spent $500,000 on ads. Rehmet, who served in the Air Force and works as a machinist, focused on lowering costs, supporting public education and protecting jobs.   Democrats have been encouraged by their performance in elections since Trump took office. In November, the party dominated the first major Election Day since his return to the White House, notably winning governor races in Virginia and New Jersey.   \n   Democratic candidates also have won special elections in Kentucky and Iowa. And while Republican Matt Van Epps won a Tennessee special election for a U.S. House seat, the relatively slim margin of victory gave Democrats hope for this fall's midterms.   Rehmet's victory allows him to serve only until early January, and he must win the November general election to keep the seat for a full four-year term. The Texas Legislature is not set to reconvene until 2027, and the GOP still will have a comfortable majority.\n",

Reopening the border crossing is a key step as the Israel-Hamas ceasefire moves ahead.    \n   Israel announced Sunday that the crossing has opened in a test. COGAT, the Israeli military agency that controls aid to Gaza, said in a statement that the crossing was actively being prepared for fuller operation, adding that residents of Gaza would begin to pass through the crossing once preparations were complete.   Palestinian security officers passed through the crossing's Egyptian gate and headed toward the Palestinian gate to join an EU mission that will be supervising exit and entry, said an Egyptian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to talk to the media. Ambulances also crossed through the Egyptian gate, the official added.   \n   The head of the new Palestinian administrative committee governing Gaza's daily affairs has said travel in both directions would start Monday.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Trucks carrying humanitarian aids line up to enter the Egyptian gate of the Rafah crossing, heading for inspection by Israeli authorities before entering the Gaza Strip, in Rafah, Egypt, Sunday, Feb. 1, 2026.\n                \n                    Mohammed Arafat/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mohammed Arafat/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Rafah, which Palestinians see as their gateway to the world, has been largely shut since it was seized by Israel in May 2024.   Few people will be allowed at first, and no goods allowed to cross. About 20,000 Palestinian children and adults needing medical care are hoping to leave war-devastated Gaza via the crossing, and thousands of other Palestinians outside the territory hope to return home.   \n   Zaher al-Wahidi, head of the Health Ministry's documentation department in Gaza, told The Associated Press that the ministry hasn't yet been notified about the start of medical evacuations.   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will allow 50 patients a day to leave. An official involved in the discussions, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the diplomatic talks, said each patient would be allowed to travel with two relatives, while some 50 people who left Gaza during the war would be allowed to return each day.   Israel has said it and Egypt will vet people for exit and entry through the crossing, which will be supervised by European Union border patrol agents. The number of travelers is expected to increase over time if the system is successful.   \n   Israeli troops seized and closed the Rafah crossing in May 2024, calling it part of efforts to combat Hamas arms smuggling. The crossing was briefly opened for the evacuation of medical patients during a ceasefire in early 2025. Israel had resisted reopening the Rafah crossing, but the recovery of the remains of the last hostage in Gaza last week cleared the way to move forward.   The reopening is a key step as last year's U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement, which took effect on Oct. 10, moves into its second phase.   Before the war, Rafah was the main crossing for people moving in and out of Gaza. Although Gaza has four other border crossings, they are shared with Israel. Under the ceasefire terms, Israel's military controls the area between the Rafah crossing and the zone where most Palestinians live.   Fearing that Israeli could use the crossing to push Palestinians out of the enclave, Egypt has repeatedly said it must be open for both entry to and exit from Gaza. Historically, Israel and Egypt have vetted Palestinians applying to cross.   The current ceasefire halted more than two years of war between Israel and Hamas that began with a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The truce's first phase called for the exchange of all hostages held in Gaza for hundreds of Palestinians held by Israel, an increase in badly needed humanitarian aid and a partial pullback of Israeli troops.   The second phase is more complicated. It calls for installing a new Palestinian committee to govern Gaza, deploying an international security force, disarming Hamas, and taking steps to begin rebuilding.\n",

Many of the Italians who chanted and blew whistles near the grand stone arch in the Piazza XXV Aprile said they had been horrified and angered by images and videos on social media showing ICE agents operating violently in Minneapolis.   \"All the videos are public and everyone can see what's happening,\" said Bruna Scanziani, age 18, who held up a sign with photographs of Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti, two American citizens  killed by ICE agents.  \"The perception of America has changed.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Bruna Scanziani, age 18, who lives outside Milan, told NPR that she's been frightened and angered by images of ICE operating in Minneapolis.

In the past, that kind of activity by U.S. agents has been a normal part of major international events like the Olympics.    But many Italian politicians, including Milan's mayor, have said that in the wake of violence in Minneapolis, ICE officers are no longer welcome in the city.   \n   \"This is a militia that kills, a militia that enters into the homes of people, signing their own permission slips,\" Milan Mayor Giuseppe Sala told local media last week. \"It is clear they are not welcome in Milan, without a doubt.\"   That view was shared by Francesco Tattoni, who said he attended Saturday's protest in Milan, in part to show solidarity with people in Minneapolis.   \"I don't like what's happening with ICE. I don't want that to come here to Italy,\" Tattoni said. \"We believe they are doing the same thing the fascists were doing in the 1930s and 1940s.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                ICE agents in Milan?

Lemon, a former CNN anchor, and Fort, a Minnesota reporter, were released from federal custody on Friday, following criticism from human rights advocates and journalism organizations over their arrests.   A federal grand jury in Minnesota indicted Fort and Lemon on charges related to the interruption of a religious service at the Cities Church in St. Paul, where a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official is a pastor. Both Fort and Lemon have maintained that they were not participating in the protest at the church but were reporting on the incident as journalists.   \n   Speaking during his YouTube show on Friday, Lemon said that this is a moment for journalists around the world \"to stand up for each other.\"   \"It may have started with people having their due process rights violated on the streets, violently violated on the streets. But now they're trying to silence journalists. And I will not be silenced,\" Lemon said on his show.   Fort, a Minnesota native who filmed her arrest as federal agents showed up to her home early Friday, told CNN's Anderson Cooper shortly after her release that she will \"continue to tell the stories of my community.\" She also said the arrests have sent \"a chilling message\" to the media industry.   \"As journalists, we never want to be the story. But unfortunately, I did find myself in a predicament where I felt that I needed to be able to tell my own story, that I needed the world to see that journalism is on trial,\" Fort said on Anderson Cooper 360°.   She added: \"If they can criminalize a journalist here in Minnesota, whether you're independent or not, I think that we've seen a track record where this is just going to continue to escalate.\"   \n   A federal magistrate judge previously declined to approve Lemon's arrest, citing a lack of evidence. A few days later, the chief federal appeals court judge in Minnesota rejected a prosecutor's appeal of the decision, writing that there was \"no evidence\" of any criminal behavior in Lemon's work.   Abbe Lowell, an attorney representing Lemon, called the arrest \"an unprecedented attack on the First Amendment\" in a social media post on Friday. Lowell also said Lemon will \"fight these charges vigorously and thoroughly in court.\" Leita Walker, an attorney for Fort, told the Columbia Journalism Review that her client \"will be vigorously defending herself against these charges.\"   \n   Disclosure: This reporter and Don Lemon were colleagues at CNN from August 2019 to April 2023.\n",

    "body": "\n      The Senate voted Friday to approve a spending deal meant to keep the government running, but the measure still needs to be approved by the House, and the shutdown deadline has passed.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  There's a federal government shutdown again today, but unlike the record-long shutdown last fall, this funding lapse does not affect the whole government and may last only a few days. This comes as Democrats press for additional guardrails to try to rein in federal immigration officers after the killings of two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis. We're joined now by NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas. Sam, thanks for being with us.SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: Hey, Scott. Good morning.SIMON: Will most Americans even notice the shutdown?GRINGLAS: Probably not. You know, the Senate voted last night to fund large parts of the federal government that ran out of money at midnight. But the House still needs to greenlight this final deal, and that will not happen until at least Monday. So if all goes smoothly, this could be really brief, you know, not enough time for most federal workers to miss paychecks, though some might be furloughed or have to work without pay, like TSA agents. And while some government services may be affected, other pinch points that we saw during the last shutdown, like food assistance, will not be impacted now because Congress managed to fund a few of these agencies through September since the last shutdown.SIMON: And Congress just got through that funding standoff in November. How did they get to the same brink just a few months later?GRINGLAS: Congress had been on track to avert a shutdown, but after that second deadly shooting in Minneapolis, Democrats pledged to oppose the Homeland Security funding bill, which includes funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But the money for the Department of Homeland Security was tied together with more than a trillion dollars for other departments, including defense, health and housing. Republicans agreed to Democrats' demands to isolate DHS funding from the rest and only extend it for two weeks, giving them time to negotiate policy changes to restrain the actions of federal immigration agents. But, Scott, it's not clear that lawmakers can come up with an agreement on that.SIMON: What do Democrats want, and why have they been willing to risk another shutdown?GRINGLAS: Yeah. Democrats are demanding a suite of changes, like requiring judicial warrants for immigration raids, ensuring impartial investigations and accountability after incidents and mandating immigration officers wear body cameras and remove their masks. Democrats like Chris Murphy of Connecticut feel emboldened because they think the public agrees with them.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHRIS MURPHY: I think people want us to fight. People want us to act in an urgent way. So I think if we're fighting for these reforms, we're exactly where the American people want us to be.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Have you spoken...GRINGLAS: And even more than the last shutdown debate over those health subsidies last fall, what's unfolded in Minneapolis maybe speaks to something more fundamental about the country at this moment. Last fall, six Senate Democrats broke with their party to reopen the government, saying the consequences of the shutdown were just too much. This time, though, five of those six say that they were willing to risk another shutdown here.SIMON: And, Sam, what have you noticed in the Republican response this week?GRINGLAS: So we are in an era when congressional Republicans rarely criticize the Trump administration. But the images coming out of Minneapolis have made even many Republicans uneasy. Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina told reporters this week that immigration was an issue that helped Republicans win, and this was undercutting all of that.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)THOM TILLIS: It's making the president look bad on policies that he won on. He won on a strong message about immigration. And now nobody's talking about that. They're not talking about securing the border. They're talking about the incompetence of the leader of the Homeland Security. These people are amateurs.GRINGLAS: We also heard some Republicans calling not just for an investigation or hearings, but also saying they're open to policy changes. Though, this is far from universal. Many Republicans like Senator Markwayne Mullin, Republican of Oklahoma, have praised the work of ICE and called the Minneapolis shootings an anomaly.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARKWAYNE MULLIN: We're not going to keep ICE from doing their job. The American people wanted the president to enforce law and order, and ICE is doing their job.SIMON: And what happens if the two parties can't come to an agreement on ICE restrictions?GRINGLAS: OK. So I mentioned the House on Monday has to give this final green light, and that is not a foregone conclusion. House Democrats are saying they're still weighing this deal, thinking maybe their party should hold up funding further to maximize their ability to extract policy changes. And then if this deal does pass funding for Homeland Security, it's just temporary. Congress will have less than two weeks to coalesce around policy changes, and that is a really tall order here, especially for this Congress, where bipartisan agreement has often proved so elusive.SIMON: NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas.

The comments from the 86-year-old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei are the most-direct threat he's made so far as the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and associated American warships are in the Arabian Sea, sent by Trump there after Tehran's bloody crackdown on nationwide protests.   \n   It remains unclear whether Trump will use force. He's repeatedly said Iran wants to negotiate and has brought up Tehran's nuclear program as another issue he wants to see resolved.   But Khamenei also referred to the nationwide protests as \"a coup,\" hardening the government's position as tens of thousands of people reportedly have been detained since the start of the demonstrations. Seditious charges in Iran can carry the death penalty, which again renews concerns about Tehran carrying out mass executions for those arrested — a red line for Trump.   \n   Iran had also planned a live-fire military drill for Sunday and Monday in the strategic Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which a fifth of all oil traded passes. The U.S. military's Central Command had warned against threatening American warships or aircraft during the drill or disrupting commercial traffic.   Khamenei warns US   Iranian state television reported Khamenei's comments online before airing any footage of his remarks.   \"The Americans should know that if they start a war, this time it will be a regional war,\" Khamenei was quoted as saying.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A woman walks through the Shiite Saints Abdulazim and Taher shrine in Shahr-e-Ray, south of Tehran, Iran, Thursday, Jan. 29, 2026.\n                \n                    Vahid Salemi/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Vahid Salemi/AP\n    \n\n   \n   It added that Khamenei said: \"We are not the instigators and we do not seek to attack any country. But the Iranian nation will deliver a firm blow to anyone who attacks or harasses it.\"   \n   Khamenei also hardened his position on the demonstrations after earlier acknowledging some people had legitimate economic grievances that sparked their protests. The demonstrations began Dec. 28, initially over the collapse of Iran's rial currency. It soon grew into a direct challenge to Khamenei's rule.   \"The recent sedition was similar to a coup. Of course, the coup was suppressed,\" he said. \"Their goal was to destroy sensitive and effective centers involved in running the country, and for this reason they attacked the police, government centers, (Revolutionary Guard) facilities, banks and mosques — and burned copies of the Quran. They targeted centers that run the country.\"   Parliament speaker says EU militaries considered terrorist groups.   The speaker of Iran's parliament, meanwhile, said that the Islamic Republic now considers all European Union militaries to be terrorist groups, lashing out after the bloc declared the country's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard a terror group over its bloody crackdown on nationwide protests.   Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, a former Guard commander, announced the terror designation, which will likely be mostly symbolic. Iran has used a 2019 law to reciprocally declare other nations' militaries terror groups following the United States declaration of the Guard a terror group that year.   Qalibaf made the announcement as he and others in parliament wore Guard uniforms in support of the force. The Guard, which also controls Iran's ballistic missile arsenal and has vast economic interests in Iran, answers only to Iran's 86-year-old Khamenei.   \"By seeking to strike at the (Guard), which itself has been the greatest barrier to the spread of terrorism to Europe, Europeans have in fact shot themselves in the foot and, once again, through blind obedience to the Americans, decided against the interests of their own people,\" Qalibaf said.   Lawmakers at the session later chanted: \"Death to America!\" and \"Death to Israel!\" at the session.   \n   Trump says Iran is 'seriously talking' to US   Trump has laid out two red lines for military action: the killing of peaceful protesters or the possible mass execution of those detained in a major crackdown over the demonstrations. He's increasingly begun discussing Iran's nuclear program as well, which the U.S. negotiated over with Tehran in multiple sessions before Israel launched a 12-day war with Iran back in June.   The U.S. bombed three Iranian nuclear sites during the war. Activity at two of the sites suggests Iran may be trying to obscure the view of satellites as it tries to salvage what remains there.   Trump on Saturday night declined to say whether he'd made a decision on what he wanted to do regarding Iran.   Speaking to reporters as he flew to Florida, Trump sidestepped a question about whether Tehran would be emboldened if the U.S. backed away from launching strikes on Iran, saying, \"Some people think that. Some people don't.\"   Trump said Iran should negotiate a \"satisfactory\" deal to prevent the Middle Eastern country from getting any nuclear weapons, but said, \"I don't know that they will. But they are talking to us. Seriously talking to us.\"   Ali Larijani, a top security official in Iran, wrote on X late Saturday that \"structural arrangements for negotiations are progressing.\" However, there is no public sign of any direct talks with the United States, something Khamenei has repeatedly ruled out.\n",

The woman in the video is Aliya Rahman, a Bangladeshi-American and a U.S. citizen. The day she was arrested, Rahman was on her way to the doctor, when she came across an ICE operation and a group of people protesting. She said the ICE officers told her to move her car, but the scene was chaotic and she received multiple instructions at once.   \n   The Department of Homeland Security said in an earlier statement they arrested Rahman because she \"ignored multiple commands.\" But Rahman, who is autistic and also recovering from a traumatic brain injury, says it sometimes takes her a moment to understand auditory commands. Before she knew it, the officers were carrying her away by her limbs.    \n   \"I thought I might well die,\" Rahman said. She was placed in an SUV with three ICE officers.   \"I heard the laughing driver radio in, 'we're bringing in a body,'\" she recalled. It took her a second to realize they meant her.   In recent days, federal officials have signaled a willingness to reduce the large number of immigration agents in Minnesota, though they say any decrease will depend on state and local cooperation. Even if a draw-down occurs, they'll leave behind a changed community, including many citizens questioned and detained by immigration officers in recent weeks.   Rahman was taken to the Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis, where immigration agents have brought detainees before releasing them or sending them out of state. While at Whipple, Rahman experienced a severe headache, and asked for medical care for more than an hour. Eventually, she passed out. She says she woke up in a downtown hospital, where doctors told her she had suffered a concussion.   \n   Her arrest was more than two weeks ago, but she can't shake the fear.   \"I do not feel safe being in my own home, driving these streets,\" she said. \"And even then, I am in a significantly better place than a lot of the other folks who have been detained.\"   \n   Rahman is far from the only U.S. citizen in Minnesota with such a story.   ChongLy Scott Thao, a Hmong man and U.S. citizen, was pulled from his home wearing only sandals, underwear and a blanket around his shoulders. Thao said the immigration agents drove him \"to the middle of nowhere\" and photographed him. He told reporters he feared they would beat him. They later brought him back to his house.   Mubashir Khalif Hussen, a Somali-American and U.S. citizen, also was detained by ICE.   \"I wasn't even outside for mere seconds before I seen a masked person running at me full speed,\" Hussen said at a news conference last month. \"He tackled me. I told him, 'I'm a U.S. citizen.' He didn't seem to care. He dragged me outside to the snow while I was handcuffed, restrained, helpless and he pushed me to the ground.\"   Hussen is now suing the Trump administration as part of a class action lawsuit, accusing it of racial profiling. According to the lawsuit, ICE eventually released Hussen outside the Whipple building, telling him to walk the seven miles back to where they detained him.   In a statement to NPR, the Department of Homeland Security said \"allegations that ICE engages in 'racial profiling' are disgusting, reckless and categorically FALSE.\"   \n   But Walter Olson, a senior fellow with the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, says many legal experts are coming to a different conclusion.   \"This is no longer just a series of accidents that could have been due to someone being badly trained or being a bad apple. This is a systematic assault on constitutional rights,\" he said.   The Fourth Amendment protects people from being stopped without reasonable suspicion and arresting without probable cause, a higher standard. Courts in the U.S. have decided skin color alone does not meet either bar.   \n   Last fall, however, the Supreme court ruled that \"apparent ethnicity\" could be used to determine reasonable suspicion, as long as there were other factors too. Legal experts say the decision may give ICE more discretion.   Olson says even if the Minnesota immigration crackdown eases, these same concerns could arise elsewhere. He noted that judges ruled against the federal government during its crackdowns in Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland.   \"And they were not led to call off or rethink the campaign. They just regrouped and came back to another state,\" Olson said.   Even citizens who were not arrested but still questioned are rattled after run-ins with immigration officers. Luis Escoto, the owner of El Taquito Taco Shop in West St. Paul, said immigration agents surrounded his wife Irma's car in their restaurant's alley when she went out to get more lettuce before the dinner hour. Escoto ran outside.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Luis Escoto poses for a portrait inside of his restaurant, El Taquito in West St. Paul, Minnesota.\n                \n                    Jaida Grey Eagle for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jaida Grey Eagle for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"I said, 'Hey, hold on. That's just my wife,'\" Escoto said. \"They said, 'We need proof of U.S. citizenship,' and I said, 'She's a U.S. citizen.'\"   Luis and Irma Escoto are both citizens. Escoto showed one of the officers their passport cards, which he still had in his wallet after a recent trip to Mexico.   \"He said, 'Well, next time she should carry that all the time, because if she doesn't have proof of citizenship we're going to arrest her,'\" Escoto recalled.   The immigration agents left. But weeks later, Escoto is still shaken and angry. Some of his customers are now escorting him and his wife home each night when the restaurant closes.   When he became a citizen 35 years ago, Escoto said he was nervous because the government took away his green card. He asked the judge about it.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Irma Escoto poses for a portrait inside of her restaurant, El Taquito in West St. Paul, Minnesota.\n                \n                    Jaida Grey Eagle for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jaida Grey Eagle for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"I said, 'Sir, what happens if the immigration officers stop me?' And he said 'Well, today you're proud to be a United States citizen,'\" Escoto said.   \n   The judge told him you don't need documentation when you're a citizen. But now, Escoto said, that doesn't seem so true anymore.\n",

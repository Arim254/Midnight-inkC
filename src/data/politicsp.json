Gov. Andrew Cuomo talks about Zohran Mamdani's lack of experience, it's impossible to miss the outrage that drives Cuomo as he fights to end his own time in the political wilderness.   \n   \"He is dangerously unqualified,\" Cuomo said Saturday during an appearance in Queens. \"When you are mayor of the city of New York, that is a big job. You are responsible for eight and a half million lives. Mayor of New York City should not be your first job.\"   This would not be a first job for Mamdani, who turned 34 last month. He was once a rapper who performed under the name Mr. Cardamom, a gig Cuomo regularly mocks. But Mamdani was elected as a state Assemblyman serving in New York's legislature since 2020.     \n   Still, the difference between the two leading mayoral candidates' resumes is significant.    Cuomo, age 67, led the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development under President Clinton in the late 1990s. In 2006, he was elected New York State Attorney General, and he served as governor for a decade beginning in 2011.    Cuomo was often controversial — clashing with Democrats in Albany and Washington D.C., almost as often as he feuded with Republicans — but he also built a reputation as a leader who tackled big problems and took on large-scale projects.     \n   \"He has governed as a pragmatist, focused on solving problems rather than engaging in ideological or partisan warfare,\" said former NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg, in his endorsement of Cuomo.     \"And he has shown that he can get big things done, including the redevelopment of LaGuardia Airport, the opening of the 2nd Avenue Subway, and the creation of Moynihan Station — all long-stalled projects that he jump-started and completed,\" Bloomberg said.    \n            I care deeply about the future of our city, and since leaving office, it has been difficult to watch its struggles, especially since the pandemic. In sizing up the field in the race for mayor, there is one candidate whose management experience and government know-how stand above… pic.twitter.com/Whqxc8Daql— Mike Bloomberg (@MikeBloomberg) June 10, 2025\n   \n   Cuomo's long run at the top of the Democratic Party's elite — his father was Democratic icon Mario Cuomo — peaked in 2020 during the COVID pandemic. As governor, his folksy, hopeful online webcasts drew national viewership.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Andrew Cuomo, then governor of New York, spoke during a news conference at Grand Central Terminal in New York, U.S., on Thursday, May 27, 2021.\n                \n                    Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images/Bloomberg\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images/Bloomberg\n    \n\n   \n   Cuomo's downfall and his bid for NYC mayor   But questions began to surface about his administration's management of elderly nursing home residents during the pandemic. Cuomo also faced a growing number of accusations of sexual misconduct involving women, including some who worked under his authority.     Cuomo has denied any wrongdoing, but in August 2021, he announced he would resign as governor: \"Given the circumstances, the best way I can help now is if I step aside and let government get back to governing,\" Cuomo said.   \n   It was a stunning downfall, and in the mayoral race, Mamdani has blasted Cuomo for that portion of his track record. \"What I don't have in experience, I make up for in integrity,\" Mamdani said during a mayoral debate.  \"And what you don't have in integrity, you could never make up for in experience.\"   \n   Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, has positioned himself as the progressive in this race, a symbol of change. He would be the city's first Muslim mayor, and he's promised many left-leaning policies — including a rent freeze and free bus service — aimed at improving affordability in the city.     But Cuomo himself has a long list of progressive accomplishments, including criminal justice reforms and victories for same-sex rights, which once earned him staunch support on the left. In 2011, he pushed a bill through New York's legislature legalizing same-sex marriage. In 2013, Cuomo championed the SAFE Act, which was then one of the strictest gun control laws in the U.S.     Cuomo also launched a statewide initiative to downsize New York's prison system, which now holds roughly half as many inmates. Cuomo later campaigned for \"cashless bail,\" a policy he signed into law in 2019.   \"Experience matters and Assemblyman Mamdani doesn't have the same experience compared with Cuomo,\" said J.C. Polanco, a political analyst and professor at the University of Mount Saint Vincent in the Bronx.      But Polanco said in modern populist politics, on the left and right, a deep resume doesn't hold as much sway with voters. \"Experience doesn't count as much,\" he said. \"A bunch of Democrats are saying it doesn't matter.\"    Cuomo himself has acknowledged that Mamdani's hopeful social media messages — which often go viral on platforms like TikTok and Instagram — appear to have captured the imagination of voters in a way his more old-school campaign has failed to do.     \n   Mamdani defeated Cuomo handily in the Democratic Party primary. Polls show Mamdani has led the general election by double-digit margins for weeks.     Now running as an independent, and with time running out, Cuomo has also struggled to talk about his accomplishments, in part because he has tacked aggressively to the right. On the campaign trail in the final days, Cuomo described himself not as a progressive, but as a pro-business, pro-law-and-order centrist Democrat.   \"He is a socialist,\" Cuomo said of Mamdani, during a stop at a shopping mall in Queens. \"Democrats don't believe in socialism, they're not anti-business, they're not anti-wealth, they're not anti-jobs. And they're not anti-public safety and they're not anti-NYPD. They want safe communities.\"\n",

The program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and is a major piece of the nation's social safety net — and it costs about $8 billion per month nationally.   The situation leaves millions with uncertainty about how they will feed themselves. Benefits will be delayed in November regardless of the outcome of the court cases because many beneficiaries have their cards recharged early in the month and the process of loading cards can take a week or more in many states.   \n   Democratic state attorneys general or governors from 25 states, as well as the District of Columbia, challenged the plan to pause the program, contending that the administration has a legal obligation to keep it running in their jurisdictions. Cities and nonprofits also filed a lawsuit.   On Friday, judges in Rhode Island and Massachusetts ruled separately that the administration must continue to pay for SNAP. They both gave the administration leeway on whether to fund the program partially or in full for November.   The USDA has a $5 billion contingency fund for the program, but the Trump administration reversed an earlier agency plan to use that money to keep SNAP running. Democratic officials argue that the administration could also use a separate fund of about $23 billion.   U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell in Providence, Rhode Island, said SNAP must be funded using at least contingency funds, and he asked for an update on progress by Monday.   \n   He said all previous work requirement waivers must continue to be honored. During the shutdown, the USDA has terminated existing waivers that exempted work requirements for older adults, veterans and others.   In Boston, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani ruled the suspension was unlawful and said USDA has to pay for SNAP. Talwani ordered the federal government to advise by Monday whether they will use emergency reserve funds to provide reduced SNAP benefits for November or fully fund the program using both contingency funds and additional available funds.   \n   Advocates and beneficiaries say halting the food aid would force people to choose between buying groceries and paying other bills. The majority of states have announced more or expedited funding for food banks or novel ways to load at least some benefits onto the SNAP debit cards.   To qualify for SNAP in 2025, a family of four's net income after certain expenses can't exceed the federal poverty line, which is about $32,000 per year. Last year, SNAP assisted nearly 42 million people, about two-thirds of whom were families with children.\n",

The courts are weighing in on their legality. But — if successful — they could also fulfill a long-running administration goal of employing America's military to aid in the mass deportation of immigrants without legal status, according to an NPR review of past comments from Trump and his allies. It's a move that would stray significantly from past federal use of the Guard, challenging laws that dictate how the U.S. military can be used domestically. And with the 2026 midterms looming, some experts worry Guard troops could even be used as a tool of systemic voter suppression and intimidation.   \n   Trump has sent troops into four Democratic-led cities and threatened to send them to several more, claiming they are needed to crack down on crime and protect federal immigration facilities and officers. Those deployments, and the White House's rhetoric around them, have regularly conflated violent crime and illegal immigration into a single crisis, blurring the lines around the role of the Guard and federal agents.   \n   Taken one at a time, the deployments can seem random or fickle — Trump will often muse about sending troops into a city, only to back track his comments and focus on a different city days later.   But the president and several others in his inner circle — most notably Stephen Miller, a senior aide to Trump in his first term, and now Trump's right hand man on immigration — have long talked about using the National Guard to help with mass deportations and immigration raids, despite U.S. laws broadly preventing the military from being used for domestic policing. To get around those laws, both Trump and Miller have talked about invoking the Insurrection Act, which allows the president to deploy the military within the U.S. in certain situations.   Legal experts, activists and watchdog groups worry the Trump administration could fundamentally change the way the military is used on U.S. soil, specifically raising concerns about the upcoming 2026 midterm elections and what armed troops on the streets could mean as voters cast ballots.   \n   Laying the groundwork   Much of Trump's campaign ahead of the 2024 election was focused on drumming up anti-immigrant sentiment and pushing his plan for mass deportations. He vowed several times on the campaign trail that he would launch the largest deportation operation in American history.   In his first term, Trump and his administration had similar ambitions, but struggled to scale up infrastructure and manpower needed to carry out the goal.   In a TIME Magazine interview in April of 2024, then-candidate Trump was asked specifically if his plan included the use of the U.S. military.   \"I can see myself using the National Guard and, if necessary, I'd have to go a step further. We have to do whatever we have to do to stop the problem we have,\" Trump responded.   Using the National Guard for immigration enforcement is an idea that Miller had talked about publicly in the years before.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                White House Deputy Chief of Staff for policy and U.S. Homeland Security Adviser Stephen Miller speaks after President Trump signed an order sending National Guard to Memphis, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on September 15, 2025.\n                \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   In 2023, Miller appeared on the late right-wing activist Charlie Kirk's podcast to talk about how mass deportations under Trump's hopeful second term could work.   \n   \"In terms of personnel, you go to the red state governors, and you say, give us your National Guard. We will deputize them as immigration enforcement officers,\" Miller explained. \"The Alabama National Guard is going to arrest illegal aliens in Alabama, and the Virginia National Guard in Virginia.\"   Miller doesn't specify how that would be legal — under U.S. law, the military can't be used for domestic policing unless authorized by the Constitution or Congress. For Democratic-run states that don't comply, Miller said, the federal government would simply send the National Guard from a nearby Republican-run state.   The deployments   In recent months, the Trump administration has deployed Guard troops to states against the wishes of their Democratic governors — including sending troops from Texas into Illinois. The administration said their purpose was to protect federal immigration facilities and officers.

It wasn't something that Trump just talked about. In 2017, The Associated Press reported on a memo it obtained from DHS, outlining a draft proposal to use the National Guard to round up unauthorized immigrants throughout the U.S. At the time, the White House denied it, saying there was no such plan.   Taylor says there very much was — but it was also more than that.   \"It was the invocation of the Insurrection Act to deputize the military to enforce domestic law to basically become a domestic police force,\" he says, noting that this particular idea was something that troubled him and several other staffers.   \n   \"It rocked us to our core,\" he says.   Trump invoking the Insurrection Act would legally allow for the military to act as police on U.S. soil — to carry out immigration enforcement, but possibly other enforcement too, according to legal experts.   NPR asked the White House about potential plans to deputize the Guard for law enforcement and to use the Insurrection Act, but it did not directly respond to those questions, instead criticizing Taylor and NPR. Spokeswoman Abigail Jackson also referenced Trump's \"highly successful operations to drive down violent crime in American cities.\"   \n   Project 2025   The broader themes of these National Guard deployments are also embedded in Project 2025, a conservative action plan written by the Heritage Foundation after Trump's first term that's more than 900 pages long.   Trump has incorporated many of its policies, and authors into his second administration. So much so that the report's architect, Russell Vought, is the head of the White House's Office of Management and Budget.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, in September.\n                \n                    Dominic Gwinn/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Dominic Gwinn/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty\n    \n\n   \n   Matt Dallek, a professor at The George Washington University who studies the American conservative movement, says that Project 2025 essentially opens the door for Trump's National Guard deployments — particularly to Democratic-led cities — without explicitly calling for them.   \"The subtext of Project 2025 is to take any and all steps at the executive level to go into cities and states to enact the priority — which is to root out illegal immigration,\" Dallek says.   The idea of bullying states and cities into following orders from the president is a key part of the text, says David Graham, a journalist for The Atlantic who also wrote a book on the project. So is the use of the military.   \"There is this idea in Project 2025, and among the authors, that the military is just an underused resource for policing immigration,\" Graham says, noting that often illegal immigration is presented as a national security problem. He says the report's authors believe that the U.S. has \"this huge, huge resource of armed people, and we're not doing anything with it, and we need to use it to secure the border.\"   Beyond mass deportation   In recent weeks, Trump has talked about invoking the Insurrection Act often, especially in regard to deploying the National Guard. Earlier this month, he said that he was \"allowed\" to invoke it if the courts deny his deployments in places like Portland, Ore., or Chicago, where prosecutors and federal judges have questioned the need for troops on the ground.   \n   Trump invoking the Insurrection Act to allow troops to help with immigration enforcement is also something that Stephen Miller has talked about.   He told the New York Times back in 2023: \"President Trump will do whatever it takes.\"   That possibility has both legal experts and immigration advocates worried, especially about the implications it could have for Americans at large.   Kica Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center, an immigration rights advocacy group, says it has her worried about the upcoming 2026 midterm elections and what the presence of troops might mean for voters as they cast ballots.   \n   \"What I have said repeatedly is that the path to authoritarianism in this country is being built on the backs of immigrants. They will begin with immigrants. They will not end with immigrants,\" she says.\n",

The commonwealth's gubernatorial race — one of just two held the year after presidential elections — is often seen as a temperature check on how voters feel about leaders in Washington.   Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee and former congresswoman, has maintained a lead in polls since very early in the race over Republican nominee Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.   But this year, while voters' top concerns are energy prices, housing affordability and jobs, the rest of the race has become a referendum on everything from political violence to redistricting.   \n   Here, public media journalists across Virginia take us into each issue.   DOGE and the federal government shutdown   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Former President Barack Obama joins former Congresswoman and Virginia Democratic candidate for governor Abigail Spanberger at a rally on Nov. 1 at Chartway Arena in Norfolk.\n                \n                    Shaban Athuman/VPM News\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Shaban Athuman/VPM News\n    \n\n   \n   The challenges facing Virginia's 320,000 federal workers and hundreds of thousands of federal contractors came long before the Oct. 1 government shutdown. Earlier this year, during Elon Musk's DOGE efforts, thousands of Virginians were laid off.   Democrats in the commonwealth hope that voter anger over the firings and furloughs will carry them to victory on Tuesday night. On the campaign trail, Spanberger talks about sticking up for federal workers in the face of the \"chaos from Washington.\" At a campaign event Thursday, Spanberger put it this way: \"The stakes of this election are serious.\"   As furloughs stretch into a second month, Virginia Republicans have also seen a political opening in the shutdown. \"My opponent, all summer long, has been playing political football with federal workers by trying to say that she loves them more than anyone else,\" Earle-Sears said on the debate stage, and then criticized Spanberger for encouraging Democrats in Congress to resist any funding deal that doesn't include continuing health care subsidies.   But Earle-Sears hasn't shied away from the Trump administration's cuts to the federal workforce. She has said she believes claims of \"waste, fraud, and abuse\" and argues that the impact of layoffs in Virginia will be minimal due to the economic strength she and Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin have stewarded over the previous four years.   \n   Political violence   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Former Del. Jay Jones, Democratic nominee for attorney general, is photographed on Sept. 12 at the Virginia Museum of History and Culture in Richmond.\n                \n                    Shaban Athuman/VPM News\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Shaban Athuman/VPM News\n    \n\n   \n   A scandal in the race for attorney general has reverberated up the ticket. Early last month, text messages from 2022 show Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general and a former member of the Virginia legislature, describing hypothetical violence against a political opponent.   Earle-Sears and other Republican candidates have tried to tie the text messages to the assassination of Charlie Kirk, painting Democrats as politically violent.   Spanberger condemned the messages and political violence generally, but didn't withdraw or double down on her endorsement of Jones. \"It is up to voters to make an individual choice based on this information,\" she said in the gubernatorial debate.   Jones' Republican opponent, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, is appealing to Spanberger voters to split their tickets.   Redistricting    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, Republican candidate for governor, chats with the clerks and minority and majority leadership as they attempt to override her ruling during a special session of the Virginia General Assembly on Wednesday, Oct. 29, at the Capitol in Richmond.\n                \n                    Shaban Athuman/VPM News\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Shaban Athuman/VPM News\n    \n\n   \n   Democrats in the Virginia legislature threw another wrench into the campaign last week by calling a surprise series of meetings after North Carolina became another state to redraw its congressional map to favor the GOP at the behest of President Trump.   On Friday, the Virginia legislature proposed a constitutional amendment that would allow redistricting ahead of the 2026 midterms. Because it needs to be approved by legislators again next year before voters can finalize the amendment next spring, its success depends on Spanberger winning her race and Democrats maintaining control of the House of Delegates.   How much the redistricting plan changes voters' minds is up for debate. Close to a million voters cast their ballots before the Democrats announced their plan, while the redistricting session took delegates off the trail during the final full week of campaigning.   Earle-Sears, who presides over the state Senate in her role as lieutenant governor, was also called back to Richmond. She still managed to hold events around the state, and a press conference on the steps of the Virginia Capitol, while a small crowd held \"Winsome For Governor\" signs.   \n   Spanberger has made few public comments about redistricting, beyond signalling her general support.   Transgender youth   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Republican Lt. Gov. candidate John Reid points to Republican gubernatorial candidate Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears during a press conference before a special session of the Virginia General Assembly on Oct. 27 at the Capitol in Richmond.\n                \n                    Shaban Athuman/VPM News\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Shaban Athuman/VPM News\n    \n\n   \n   Republicans up and down the ballot have made Virginia's transgender youth a major campaign issue.   The argument over transgender athletes and bathrooms in Virginia schools really took off when Republican Glenn Youngkin made it a focus of his 2021 campaign for governor. Arguably, it helped him become the first GOP governor elected in more than a decade.   But, despite Republicans spending millions on ads around transgender students in 2025, recent polling shows it's a top concern for 3 percent of voters. The economy and countering Trump's policies are at the forefront of most voters' minds.   Spanberger has said she likely leads on the subject because Republicans have been \"villainizing kids.\"   \"Particularly efforts to heavily politicize a group of kids who need a bit of grace, and the adults around them to show thoughtfulness,\" the former congresswoman said.   \"I'm not taking a stand because it's the easy thing to do. Of course, it's not easy. I'm being abused for it,\" Earle-Sears said, comparing her support for cisgender students to the civil rights movement.

Van Gessel and others who back Prop 50 told NPR the proposal provides the Democratic-leaning state a rare opportunity to directly counteract President Trump and Republican efforts to redraw political maps in their favor in other states.   \"What we're doing is gerrymandering to stop gerrymandering,\" she said. \"And that's not really the best solution, but it is something that we find ourselves in this kind of environment having to do.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Adelaide Stone Van Gessel stands with her dog, Guinness, outside the Oakwood Community Center and voting site in the Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles.\n                \n                    Gabriella Angotti-Jones for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Gabriella Angotti-Jones for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Voting for the one-issue special election concludes Tuesday, with polling showing that Prop 50 is likely to pass. If it does, California's Democratic state leaders can use a new congressional map that makes five U.S. House seats more favorable to the party, offsetting the five districts Republicans shifted their direction in Texas earlier this year.   \n   GOP lawmakers in Missouri and North Carolina have also enacted new maps, and a bipartisan deal reached last week in Ohio tilts that state's congressional map further to the right. Lawmakers in other states, including Virginia Democrats, could join the redistricting fight.   In Southern California, many left-leaning voters approving Prop 50 reported having mixed feelings about the measure, but ultimately felt that allowing a partisan gerrymander is one of the only options they have to stop Trump from shutting out a Democratic win in Congress next year.   \"We can't play the game like decent people anymore,\" said Stephanie Eberstein, who, like Van Gessel, lives in the liberal LA neighborhood of Venice. \"I mean, those rules are out the window. So, we have to do what we have to do.\"   In Orange County, Eva Hernandez agrees.   \n   \"We got to do something,\" Hernandez said. \"Can't just sit back and let things roll like they've been rolling. … California's got to do it. We're a blue state. We got to do what we got to do to counteract that.\"   Republican voters in California fear losing representation   With surveys showing Prop 50 likely to be approved, it appears none of the opposition's arguments against the measure is truly landing in a state that is strongly Democratic.   A number of voters told NPR they're focused on the current proposal, and could not recall how they voted about 15 years ago, when the state's citizen-led, nonpartisan redistricting commission was enacted.   \n   Kathy Brewer voted no on Prop 50. She lives in Rancho Santa Margarita, one of a few GOP-leaning enclaves in Southern California. She told NPR she thinks this special election and redraw are unnecessary.   \"It's a waste of money,\" she said. \"Of good California money that we need.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Betty Roth stands outside of the Rancho Santa Margarita Library in Orange County.\n                \n                    Gabriella Angotti-Jones for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Gabriella Angotti-Jones for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Betty Roth is another no vote. She says that as a Republican she already feels pretty powerless in the state.   Out of the 52 seats California has in the U.S. House, only nine are currently held by Republicans. Roth says she doesn't want the GOP to lose what little representation it has.   \"They're trying to take away the vote from a good portion of the American people by, you know, gerrymandering,\" she said.   But a lot of Democratic voters don't feel much sympathy for this argument.   Aaron Leal, who also lives in Rancho Santa Margarita, says Republicans are trying to rig the midterms in their favor because they aren't sure they can win on policy. He says the party is practically forcing Democrats to react.   \"If one side is going full force pushing their agenda, we cannot bring, as they say, like a knife to a gunfight,\" he said.   Leal says he also likes that the measure is temporary. After 2030, the state would go back to the independent redistricting commission.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Aaron (left), Maria, Evelyn, Isaac and David Leal stand outside the Rancho Santa Margarita Library. Aaron likes that the ballot measure is temporary and after 2030 the state would revert to the independent redistricting committee.\n                \n                    Gabriella Angotti-Jones for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Gabriella Angotti-Jones for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"Somebody has to do something\"   Polling shows the Democratic base has been largely frustrated with their leaders — mostly because they haven't been able to do much.   \"The Democrats haven't really fought back and done anything to combat what's going on with the Republican Party and Trump,\" said David Checel in Culver City. \"So, yeah. I don't know what you're supposed to do on this, and I'm glad I'm not a politician.\"   Checel wasn't thrilled about Prop 50 but voted in favor of it because it's better than doing nothing, he said.   \n   Other Democrats say they are really excited to see their leaders fight back, including Reina Santiago in Venice.   \"I'm glad that our state is taking the charge against this because somebody has to do something,\" she said. \"The GOP is totally complicit with Trump, and if we let them walk all over us, they'll do it. So that's what this vote is about.\"   And while Jim Lind, who lives in Irvine, agrees with this sentiment, he said he's also pretty sad that this is what politics has become.   \"It's unfortunate that any party, whatever it may be, has to stoop to a lower level to get things done,\" he said. \"You know, all my life I've probably been more idealistic as far as the honesty of people. And it's just not working out.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Reina Santiago stands outside of the Oakwood Community Center in Venice.\n                \n                    Gabriella Angotti-Jones for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Gabriella Angotti-Jones for NPR\n    \n\n   \n",

One of the issues that's electrified those contests is the soaring cost of electricity. Both states have seen double-digit power price increases in the last year, and voters are frustrated. NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now to tell us more.SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Ayesha.RASCOE: So how did electricity become such a hot-button issue on the campaign trail this year?HORSLEY: Well, around the country, we have seen power prices climbing faster than the overall cost of living, and that is a problem that politicians ignore at their peril. You know, I lived in California a quarter century ago when anger about both the cost and availability of electricity drove Governor Gray Davis out of office and opened the door for a governor named Arnold Schwarzenegger. So the price hikes in Virginia and especially New Jersey have been particularly large. You know, the cost of electricity for residential customers in New Jersey has jumped about 21% in the last year. Dan Cassino, who runs a political poll at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey, says that just adds to perennial concerns about the high cost of living in that state.DAN CASSINO: Sometimes, in affordability, we're talking about property taxes. Sometimes we're talking about housing prices. Sometimes we're talking about groceries. But we're always talking about affordability, and electricity is just now the new way to talk about affordability.HORSLEY: Now, electricity is still a relatively small part of a typical family's budget - about 2.5% on average. But when so many other things are also getting more expensive, a big power bill can really be a pain.RASCOE: What's driving these price increases?HORSLEY: Well, as usual, it's a mix of supply and demand. Both New Jersey and Virginia are part of a mid-Atlantic power grid that has retired some of its old fossil fuel power plants and has been slower than some other parts of the country to add new clean energy sources. At the same time, we have seen a burst of new demand for electricity in those states from all the new data centers that have sprung up as part of the artificial intelligence boom. So it's a complicated puzzle. Cassino says it can be kind of a Rorschach test for voters who are just angry about their rising power bills.CASSINO: The problem is voters don't understand why this is happening. They just blame whoever it is that they don't like. So Democrats say, oh, it's Donald Trump, or they blame greedy electric companies. Republicans say, well, it's the Democrats. So everyone's just blaming whoever they don't like for it.HORSLEY: In New Jersey, the incumbent governor is a Democrat. In Virginia, the incumbent is a Republican. Neither of them is on the ballot, but the candidates from both parties who hope to replace them are being asked how they plan to tackle this problem.RASCOE: These off-year governors' races are often seen as a dress rehearsal for issues that later go national. Are electricity prices going to be a factor in other parts of the country in next year's elections?HORSLEY: They could be. You know, other states are wrestling with some of these same challenges, although most parts of the country are not seeing double-digit price hikes like New Jersey and Virginia are. Nationally, demand for electricity is growing faster now than it did for most of the last two decades. At the same time, the Trump administration has taken steps to limit new solar and wind generation. And natural gas, which is the No. 1 source of electric power generation in the country, is getting more expensive, partly because we are exporting more of our natural gas. Now, Cassino says voters may or may not sift through all those details. But if they're unhappy about their electric bills and the overall cost of living, that could be a factor in the voting booth next year.CASSINO: People feel helpless. It almost doesn't matter if the helplessness comes from the electricity rates or from the rent going up or from inflation. When voters feel helpless, they're going to blame somebody. And if you are that somebody, it is a bad time to be an incumbent.HORSLEY: We saw that around the world last year when politicians on the left and the right were punished because people were unhappy with the high cost of living.RASCOE: That's NPR's Scott Horsley. Thank you so much for joining us.HORSLEY: Good to be with you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Voters in California are weighing whether to allow Democratic state leaders to redraw the state's Congressional map to offset Republicans' redraw in Texas.   \n\n    AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:  A big election concludes Tuesday in California. Voters there are weighing whether to allow Democratic state leaders to redraw congressional lines before next year's midterm elections. A new map would make five House seats more favorable to Democrats, offsetting new Republican districts in Texas. NPR's Ashley Lopez asked voters in Southern California what they make of the plan.ASHLEY LOPEZ, BYLINE: There is only one item on the ballot for this election - Proposition 50. The measure directly calls out Texas and asks voters to allow state leaders to temporarily bypass an independent redistricting commission that voters approved about 15 years ago. And while this puts voters in the weird position of undermining something they approved, many voters say they don't remember how they voted back then.ADELAIDE STONE VAN GESSEL: I do not really remember voting for it, but I - I'm pretty sure I did.KATHY BREWER: I don't remember. You know, we dive in when it's time to vote on something, and then other stuff comes up, right?JIM LIND: I have trouble with yesterday.LOPEZ: That was Adelaide Stone Van Gessel, Kathy Brewer and Jim Lind. Lind lives in Irvine and voted in favor of the new measure Prop 50, but he says he does have mixed feelings about allowing the state to gerrymander the congressional map to help one party.LIND: I wish we didn't have to get to this point, but we need to do something in this country to counteract some of the stuff that's being done in the White House.LOPEZ: A lot of yes-voters use this same language. They said their main objective is to counteract efforts in Republican states like Texas to redraw congressional districts. This is an effort, by the way, that was prompted by President Trump.About 30 minutes east of Irvine, surrounded by mountains is Santa Rancho Margarita. Though the city is one of Orange County's conservative strongholds, many Democrats showed up to the public library to vote yes for Prop 50. Eva Hernandez was one of those voters.EVA HERNANDEZ: I'm like, well, you know, we got to do something. You can't just sit back, let things roll like they've been rolling. So it's disturbing, you know? But California's got to do it. We're a blue state. We got to do what we got to do to counteract that.LOPEZ: Polling shows that Prop 50 is likely to pass in California. None of the opposition's arguments against it is truly landing in a state that is overwhelmingly Democratic. Kathy Brewer did, however, vote no. She lives in Rancho Santa Margarita and thinks this election and redraw are unnecessary.BREWER: Off the top of my head, I'm going to say it's a waste of money, of good California money that we need.LOPEZ: Betty Roth is another no vote. She says that as a Republican, she already feels pretty powerless in the state. Out of the 52 seats California has in the U.S. House, only nine are held by Republicans. Roth says she doesn't want the GOP to lose what little representation they have.BETTY ROTH: They're trying to take away the vote from a good portion of the American people by, you know, gerrymandering.LOPEZ: But a lot of Democratic voters don't feel much sympathy for this argument. Aaron Leal, who lives in this conservative enclave, says Republicans are trying to rig the midterms in their favor because they aren't sure they can win on policy. He says the party is practically forcing Democrats to react.AARON LEAL: If one side is going full force pushing their agenda, we cannot bring, as they say, like, a knife to a gun fight.LOPEZ: Leal says he also likes that the measure is temporary.LEAL: In 2030, it's going to go back to the original independent commission. If Texas had not passed their map, this would not have happened here.LOPEZ: Besides giving Democrats a better shot during the midterms, this special election in California has also provided the party an opportunity to assert the little power they have to directly combat President Trump. Polling shows the Democratic base has been frustrated with their leaders, mostly because they haven't been able to do much. David Checel is one of those voters. He lives in Culver City in the Los Angeles area.DAVID CHECEL: The Democrats haven't really fought back and done anything to combat what's going on with the Republican party and Trump. Yeah. I don't know what you're supposed to do in this, and I'm glad I'm not a politician.LOPEZ: Checel says he wasn't thrilled about Prop 50, but he voted in favor of it because it's better than doing nothing, he says. Back in Irvine, Jim Lind says he agrees with this sentiment, but he says he's also pretty sad that this is what politics has become.LIND: I guess it's unfortunate that any party, whatever it may be, has to stoop to a lower level to get things done. All my life, I've probably been more idealistic as far as the honesty of people, and it's just not working out.LOPEZ: And this is partly why over and over voters said what they actually want is for no state to be able to gerrymander districts to favor one party. Many said Congress should pass a ban on the practice altogether.Ashley Lopez, NPR News.(SOUNDBITE OF CHARLES ATLAS' \"THE SNOW BEFORE US\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

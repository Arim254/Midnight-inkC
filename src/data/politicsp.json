The Supreme Court is weighing the future of President Trump's tariffs on nearly all imports. Justices seemed skeptical about the tariffs' legality during last month's oral arguments. Lower courts had previously found that Trump had improperly used emergency economic powers to set most of the new levies.   \n   Dozens of companies across industries have filed lawsuits to seek refunds in the event that the Supreme Court finds Trump's tariffs illegal. The list includes makeup giant Revlon, canned-foods maker Bumble Bee and Kawasaki, which makes motorcycles and more. Now Costco has joined the queue.   \"This is the first time we're seeing big companies take their heads out of the sand publicly,\" said Marc Busch, a trade law expert at Georgetown University. For the most part, small companies have been leading the legal action against tariffs, he said, adding, \"It's nice to finally see some heavyweights joining in the fray.\"   In its suit filed with the U.S. Court of International Trade, Costco did not specify how much it has already paid in tariffs. But the retail giant worries that even if the Supreme Court eventually unravels Trump's tariff regime, it may not be able to recoup all that money.    Costco executives in May had said that about a third of what it sells in the U.S. comes from abroad, predominantly nonfood items.   NPR's Scott Horsley contributed to this report.\n",

The pause puts on hold a wide range of immigration-related decisions such as green card applications or naturalizations for immigrants from those 19 countries that the Trump administration has described as high-risk. It's up to the agency's director, Joseph Edlow, on when to lift the pause, the memo said.   \n   The administration in June banned travel to the U.S. by citizens of 12 countries and restricted access for those from seven others, citing national security concerns.   The ban applied to citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen while the restricted access applied to people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.   At the time, no action was taken against immigrants from those countries who were already in the U.S. before the travel ban went into effect.   \n   But now the news from USCIS means those people already in the U.S. — regardless of when they arrived — will come under extra scrutiny.   The agency said it would conduct a comprehensive review of all \"approved benefit requests\" for immigrants who entered the country during the Biden administration.   The agency cited the shooting of two National Guard troops by a suspect who is an Afghan national as a reason for the pause and heightened scrutiny for people from those countries. One National Guard soldier was killed and another wounded in the Thanksgiving week shooting near the White House.   \"In light of identified concerns and the threat to the American people, USCIS has determined that a comprehensive re-review, potential interview, and re-interview of all aliens from high-risk countries of concern who entered the United States on or after January 20, 2021 is necessary,\" the agency said.   \n   The agency said in the Tuesday memo that within 90 days it would create a prioritized list of immigrants for review and if necessary, referral to immigration enforcement or other law enforcement agencies.   Since the shooting, the administration has announced a flurry of decisions it was taking to scrutinize immigrants already in the country and those seeking to come to the U.S.   Last week, the director of USCIS said in a social media post that his agency would be reexamining green card applications for people from countries \"of concern.\" But the policy directive Tuesday goes further and lays out in more detail the scope of who will be affected.   USCIS also said last week that it was pausing all asylum decisions, and the State Department said it was halting visas for Afghans who assisted the U.S. war effort.   Days before the shooting, USCIS said in a separate memo that the administration would review the cases of all refugees who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration.   Critics have said that the Trump administration's actions have amounted to collective punishment for immigrants.\n",

A White House official not authorized to speak on the record confirmed the pardon was granted and the Federal Bureau of Prisons confirmed his release on Monday.   Hernández, who served two terms as the leader of the Central American nation, had been sentenced to 45 years for conspiring to import cocaine to the United States.   The pardon of such a high-profile convicted drug trafficker, however, has led to accusations of deceit and hypocrisy by the Trump administration as it comes while the president and his team continue to escalate his military campaign against drug trafficking out of Venezuela.   \n   Critics argue the pardon of Hernández undermines the administration's claims that they are focused on ending drug trafficking. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, called the decision \"shocking.\"   \"He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in U.S. courts, and less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narcotrafficking,\" Kaine said Sunday on CBS' 'Face the Nation.'   Hernández's time in office briefly overlapped with Trump's first term. In that time, Hernández fostered support from the Trump administration after joining a small group of nations and moved the Honduran embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.   Trump criticized Hernández's prosecution, telling reporters last week that people he respects told him Hernández was \"treated very harshly and unfairly.\"   One of those people is likely Roger Stone, his long time political adviser, who lobbied for Hernández release. Stone shared on his radio show that he delivered a four-page letter from Hernández claiming he was the victim of wrongful conviction and \"lawfare by the Biden-Harris administration.\"    \n   Trump teased the pardon in a social media post on last week: \"CONGRATULATIONS TO JUAN ORLANDO HERNANDEZ ON YOUR UPCOMING PARDON,\" he wrote…. \"MAKE HONDURAS GREAT AGAIN!\"   According to court documents, Hernández abused his position to facilitate importation of tons of cocaine into the United States. In exchange, he received millions of dollars in drug money from some of the largest and most violent drug-trafficking organizations in the hemisphere.   Judge P. Kevin Castel, who presided over the case, described Hernández as a \"two-faced politician hungry for power.\" Former Attorney General Merrick Garland stated that Hernández \"abused his presidency to operate the country as a narco-state where violent traffickers operated with near-total impunity.\"   Hernández has long maintained that he was innocent of the charges. He had been appealing his conviction while serving his sentence at the U.S. Penitentiary Hazelton in West Virginia.   It is far from the first time one of Trump's pardons has drawn scrutiny. He has pardoned a number of political and business allies since returning to office, prompting some accusations that Trump's operating a pay to play scheme.   They include MAGA loyalists, a cryptocurrency executive with ties to his family's crypto firm and dozens of allies who tried to overturn his 2020 election loss to former President Joe Biden.\n",

    "body": "\n      President Trump met with his advisors Monday to discuss next steps with Venezuela as lawmakers continue to raise concerns about the administration's military strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea.   \n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  President Trump and his advisers met yesterday evening to discuss next steps with Venezuela.LEILA FADEL, HOST:  The meeting comes amid growing tension between the two countries. For months, the Trump administration has conducted deadly strikes against what it claims are drug boats traveling from Venezuela to the U.S., and there's a military buildup off the coast of Venezuela. Coming up, we'll speak with Representative Adam Smith about questions he has over the legality of the attacks. Let's first get to the latest facts.MARTÍNEZ: NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben is here. So, Danielle, tell us about the meeting over Venezuela.DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Well, there's not much to tell right now. We do know the meeting had been set to be with Trump's national security team, so that would include people like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio. But Trump has said he spoke to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro last week, but Trump wouldn't say much more. All that said, it was likely not a friendly call. Trump has long railed against the authoritarian leader. And Maduro, for his part, thinks the U.S. is aiming for regime change in his country, and he's accused the U.S. of using this pretext of fighting drug traffickers to seize his country's oil reserves.MARTÍNEZ: Now, you mentioned Secretary Pete Hegseth in connection to that meeting about Venezuela. He's getting some heat for strikes on one of those boats. Take us through why.KURTZLEBEN: Sure. So on Friday, The Washington Post reported that on September 2, U.S. forces struck one of those boats, leaving survivors afterwards, and so Hegseth gave an order to kill those survivors. Now, NPR later confirmed that Hegseth had ordered both strikes. All of that matters because, as Congress members from both parties have said, that second strike may have constituted a war crime. Meanwhile, the Department of Defense in that Washington Post story said that, quote, \"this entire narrative is completely false.\"MARTÍNEZ: Now, what did we learn from the White House yesterday?KURTZLEBEN: Well, the administration then confirmed some parts of this story. At yesterday's press briefing, press secretary Karoline Leavitt acknowledged a second strike. But as for Hegseth ordering it, she didn't deny it but said Hegseth authorized U.S. Navy Admiral Frank M. Bradley to take these actions.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KAROLINE LEAVITT: Secretary Hegseth authorized Admiral Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes. Admiral Bradley worked well within his authority and the law, directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated.KURTZLEBEN: But our NPR colleague Tom Bowman has new reporting on this. Yesterday, a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly pushed back on the White House, saying Hegseth gave the command for two strikes to kill in addition to two strikes to sink the boat.MARTÍNEZ: OK. So we have all that. And just a few weeks ago, Democratic Congress members with military or intelligence backgrounds released a video telling service members to refuse illegal orders. Trump called that video seditious behavior punishable by death. Have they responded to the latest developments?KURTZLEBEN: Yes. Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly, a retired naval officer who was in that video, spoke about this yesterday. When a reporter asked him about the strikes, Kelly said, if the reporting is accurate, that second strike could have been illegal.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARK KELLY: I will say, though, you know, as somebody who has sunk two ships myself, folks in the military need to understand the law of the sea, the Geneva Conventions, what the law says.KURTZLEBEN: And leaders of the Senate and House Armed Services Committees have said they're going to be looking into these strikes, and Admiral Bradley is expected to give a classified briefing on Thursday. So we may know more about them in the weeks ahead.MARTÍNEZ: All right. That's NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. Thanks a lot.KURTZLEBEN: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Tennessee's 7th district elected Republican Matt Van Epps in a special election to fill a House of Representatives seat that garnered national attention and millions in spending.\n                \n                    Brett Carlsen/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brett Carlsen/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Republicans will hold on to a House seat in Tennessee after a special election Tuesday that saw millions of dollars in outside spending and national attention.   Matt Van Epps won the open U.S. House seat, according to a race call by the Associated Press.   Van Epps had a single-digit lead over Democratic State Rep. Aftyn Behn, with more than 90 percent of the vote counted so far, in a district that gave President Trump roughly 60% of the vote last November. Former Rep. Mark Green, who resigned in July, won by a similar margin.   \n   Van Epps' victory means Republicans will grow to a 220-213 advantage over Democrats until Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's planned resignation on Jan. 5, 2026.   \"Running from Trump is how you lose. Running with Trump is how you win,\" Van Epps said in a statement Tuesday night. \"Our victory was powered by a movement of Tennesseans that are ready for change. We are grateful to the President for his unwavering support that charted this movement and catapulted us to victory. President Trump was all-in with us. That made the difference. In Congress, I'll be all-in with him.\"   Trump posted a congratulatory message on his Truth Social website earlier in the evening.   \"Congratulations to Matt Van Epps on his BIG Congressional WIN in the Great State of Tennessee,\" Trump stated on Truth Social. \"The Radical Left Democrats threw everything at him, including Millions of Dollars. Another great night for the Republican Party!!!\"   But the closer-than-expected contest that also prompted heavy investment in money and manpower from Republicans has Democrats declaring their own sort of victory heading into the 2026 midterm cycle.   Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin said in a statement that Behn \"blew away expectations\" and touted the party's string of overperformances in 2025 after losing the White House and Senate last year.   \n   \"What happened tonight in Tennessee makes it clear: Democrats are on offense and Republicans are on the ropes,\" Martin said. \"Aftyn Behn's overperformance in this Trump +22 district is historic and a flashing warning sign for Republicans heading into the midterms.\"    In nearly 60 state legislative and Congressional special elections, Democrats have improved on their 2024 margins by an average of 13% and are coming off a string of high-profile victories in races up and down the ballot last month.    In Tennessee, Behn earning roughly 45% of the vote is a similar 13% shift in margins from how the district voted last November.   In final stretch, outside money floods race    According to the latest Federal Election Commission data, outside groups spent more than $6.5 million on the race, including more than $1.6 million from the pro-Trump MAGA Inc. super PAC. Two-thirds of the total super PAC spending came in the last two weeks of the race as early voting picked up in earnest.    Scant public polling of a typically lower-turnout special election coupled with a less reliable sense of who will make up the electorate has also added pressure on both parties to squeeze out every vote in what was considered a possibly tight race.   An Emerson College poll released last week found Van Epps slightly ahead of Behn but within the margin of error among voters surveyed. Surveys released in October from Democratic-aligned firms showed Van Epps with an 8-point advantage, roughly in line with the average Democratic special election overperformance this year.   \n   Campaigns focus on cost of living   The closing sprint of the race saw a slew of surrogates make campaign stops and virtual appearances to support the candidates. Former Vice President Kamala Harris and Martin the DNC chairman attended canvassing events for Behn last month, while former Vice President Al Gore and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez headlined a Zoom rally Monday evening.   House Speaker Mike Johnson held a get-out-the-vote rally Monday morning for Van Epps that featured Trump calling on speakerphone to proclaim that the \"whole world is watching Tennessee right now.\"    \n   Both parties made affordability a top issue in the race, especially on the airways. Van Epps embraced Trump's endorsement and also focused his closing message on the economy.    In one ad, Van Epps decried \"career politicians\" and promised to \"bring down prices, create good paying jobs, and lower health care costs for working families.\"   Behn's closing ad promised that she would \"shake up Washington\" by \"making health care more affordable, bringing down the cost of living, and protect workers and small businesses from job-killing tariffs.\"   During a Monday evening telephone rally for Van Epps, Trump dismissed affordability as something Democrats mentioned to distract from what he said are his administration's numerous accomplishments.    \"They like to talk about affordability,\" Trump said in the Monday evening tele-rally for Van Epps. \"To them it's just a con job, it's just a word.\"\n",

The details matter as some in Congress suggest the orders are illegal and could leave servicemembers facing eventual prosecution.   In response to reports that the first of these incidents included a second round of strikes that killed two survivors on a burning boat, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Tuesday that he authorized and watched the initial attacks but did not watch the second round.   \n   \"I watched that first strike live,\" Hegseth said at a Cabinet meeting at the White House. \"As you can imagine, the Department of War, we got a lot of things to do. So I moved on to my next meeting.\"   Hegseth said he did not see survivors of that Sept. 2 attack on the video and that the following strikes to sink the boat, which killed the survivors, were ordered by Adm. Frank M. Bradley.   \n   \"A couple of hours later, I learned that that commander had made the [decision], which he had the complete authority to do,\" Hegseth said. \"And by the way, Adm. Bradley made the correct decision to ultimately sink the boat and eliminate the threat.\"   Hegseth's parsing of responsibility for that order has drawn fire, including from Rep. Adam Smith, ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee.   \"Yeah. It was a CYA moment for Hegseth,\" Smith said, speaking on NPR's Morning Edition, \"He's the secretary of defense. You know, he's putting them in a terrible spot by giving them these highly questionable orders. And then after that, to come out and say, hey, it was that guy, not me. That's not leadership, and it's also not honest. It seems to me Secretary Hegseth is the one who's responsible for what happened here.\"   \n   Ever since the first strike by the U.S. military on a small boat in the Caribbean three months ago, a debate has stirred within the military because deadly force used on civilian crew and passengers appeared illegal. The Trump Justice Department provided Congress with a memo stating that the U.S. is in a non-international armed conflict with drug cartels, and the strikes are within the laws of war. But Smith says even that memo was ambiguous.   \"This memo that's out there explaining the legal justification for this is fascinating because half of it says, this is why this is an armed conflict, why these narcoterrorist groups are such a threat. They're doing all these awful things. And the other half says, no, it's not a war, so therefore, we don't have to get permission from Congress,\" said Smith. \"They say it's legal, and yet they went to great pains to make sure that Hegseth wasn't the one who gave the order. So obviously, they're a little nervous about that point.\"   Now the questions are getting sharper, after The Washington Post reported that the Sept. 2 incident included two sets of strikes on a boat, and that survivors of the initial attack were visible when they were struck again and killed. Hegseth initially denied the story and called it fake news, but on Tuesday he confirmed the basic facts.   If the United States is at war, then killing enemies who are surrendering or helpless would constitute a war crime according to military experts, including a group of former JAG officers who have been critical of the Trump administration. Questions along those lines are expected when Adm. Bradley appears before Congress on Thursday.   But talk of war crimes accepts the notion that the U.S. can even be at war with the entire criminal world of narcotrafficking in any legal sense, says Sarah Yager, Washington Director of Human Rights Watch. \"It's not a question of a war crime because there's no war, there's no armed conflict, so it can't be a war crime. It is literally murder,\" she said.   \n   \"It sets a dangerous template for a United States that believes it can strike anywhere on the planet without rules, limits, or consequences.\"    \n   She also noted that when a country acts as if it's at war when it's not, \"that collapses the rules that keep civilians safe and gives governments license to kill without the safeguards international law requires.\"   President Trump and Hegseth both justified the strikes again on Tuesday. Hegseth said evidence was solid that each of the strikes was on what he called a \"narcoterrorist\" but declined to show proof. Trump claimed his efforts had saved hundreds of thousands of lives – more than double the estimated yearly death toll for all drug overdoses in the U.S., most of which are actually caused by fentanyl which does not come into the country by boat.   Meanwhile Republican Sen. Rand Paul posted a letter he received after an information request showing that 21% of Coast Guard interdictions turn up no drugs, suggesting that at least one in five of the deadly strikes could be in error.   At the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Trump suggested, without showing evidence, that drug trafficking has dropped since the boat strikes began, but he also claimed to know nothing about the details.   \"As far as the attack is concerned, I did, you know, I still haven't gotten a lot of information, because I rely on Pete, but to me, it was an attack. It wasn't one strike, two strikes, three strikes,\" Trump said. \"Somebody asked me a question about the second strike. I didn't know about the second strike. I didn't know anything about people, I wasn't involved in it.\"   But speaking at the Pentagon earlier on Tuesday, press secretary Kingsley Wilson said, \"At the end of the day, the secretary and the president are the ones directing these strikes.\"\n",

Hegseth's social media post from Sunday shows the turtle, clad in tactical gear, standing on a helicopter and aiming a rocket-propelled grenade at one of several boats in the water below. It's designed to look like an edition of the children's book, but titled Franklin Targets Narco Terrorists.   \n   \"For your Christmas wish list …\" Hegseth wrote in the caption, as he faces growing scrutiny over the legality of a set of strikes on a suspected drug boat in the Caribbean in early September.   \n   On Monday, Toronto-based publishing house Kids Can Press released a statement defending Franklin as a \"beloved Canadian icon who has inspired generations of children and stands for kindness, empathy and inclusivity.\"   \"We strongly condemn any denigrating, violent or unauthorized use of Franklin's name or image, which directly contradicts these values,\" it added.   Franklin, who usually wears a red neckerchief and baseball cap (not a ballistic helmet), has delighted kids since the debut of his book series in 1986 — with dozens of titles including Franklin Goes to School and Franklin Wants a Pet — and an animated TV series a decade later.   \n   It is not clear why Hegseth — who is a father and stepfather of seven children — chose the turtle of all characters, though Franklin book covers have inspired some popular parodies in the past.   When asked for comment, chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell told NPR over email: \"We doubt Franklin the Turtle wants to be inclusive of drug cartels… or laud the kindness and empathy of narco-terrorists.\"   A number of Democrats were quick to condemn the post, as well as the larger controversy behind it.   \n   Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, who has openly sparred with the Pentagon in recent weeks, told reporters that the meme is just one reason why the defense secretary should be fired, calling him \"not a serious person.\"   \n   \"He is in the national command authority for nuclear weapons and he's putting out … turtles with rocket-propelled grenades,\" Kelly said.   Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, speaking on the floor Monday, called Hegseth a \"national embarrassment\" and described the Franklin meme as a \"sick parody.\"   \"Tweeting memes in the middle of a potential armed conflict is something no serious military leader would ever even think of doing,\" Schumer added. \"The only thing this tweet accomplishes is to remind the whole world that Pete Hegseth is not up to the job.\"   Questions mount over September incident   Hegseth was already in the hot seat, facing bipartisan scrutiny and questions from Congress about what happened — and whether any war crimes were committed — on Sept. 2, when the U.S. carried out the first of over 20 strikes on alleged drug vessels.   U.S. officials have described their targets as \"narcoterrorists\" from Latin America, though they have not released information about who was on board those boats or evidence that they were ferrying drugs.   Trump administration officials originally described the first attack as a single strike on a Venezuelan vessel that killed 11 alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang. But in the ensuing weeks, as the U.S. has shared grainy videos of the growing number of strikes on vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific, more questions and revelations emerged about the one that started it.   \n   Last week, the Washington Post reported — and a source confirmed to NPR — that Hegseth gave a spoken directive to kill the surviving occupants of the boat with a second strike. Attacking \"wounded, sick or shipwrecked\" combatants violates the law of war, according to a Pentagon manual.   Hegseth denied those reports as \"fabricated, inflammatory and derogatory,\" saying U.S. operations in the Caribbean are \"lawful under both U.S. and international law … and approved by the best military and civilian lawyers, up and down the chain of command.\"   \n   But that didn't satisfy lawmakers, several of whom — on both sides of the aisle — raised concerns about a potential war crime. Over the weekend, both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees opened investigations into the incident.   Then, on Monday, the White House confirmed that there had been a second strike, but attributed the directive to another military leader.   \n   White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Hegseth had authorized Adm. Mitch Bradley — who led Joint Special Operations Command at the time — to conduct the strikes, adding that Bradley \"worked well within his authority and the law.\" Later that day, Hegseth tweeted in \"100% support\" of Bradley and his combat decisions.   But a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly has since disputed the White House's account, telling NPR's Tom Bowman that Hegseth issued the command for \"two strikes to kill\" and two additional strikes to \"sink the boat.\"   For his part, President Trump has defended Hegseth but distanced himself from the incident. When asked by reporters on Sunday night whether he would be okay with Hegseth having ordered a second strike, Trump said, \"He said he didn't do it, so I don't have to make that decision.\"   Adm. Bradley, who was promoted to commander of U.S. Special Operations Command a month after the incident, is scheduled to provide a classified briefing to lawmakers on Thursday.\n",

Behind the scenes, Fox News' controlling owners, executives and biggest stars didn't believe the wild claims from President Trump and his allies. Nonetheless, the voting tech company's officials received death threats. Its reputation and financial prospects were badly damaged.   These claims stood at the heart of a hearing Tuesday afternoon before a New York judge over whether a multi-billion dollar defamation lawsuit against Fox News should be allowed to proceed to a full jury trial.   \n   The lawsuit is being brought by Smartmatic, a London-based voting technology firm that played a limited role in the 2020 race but was, nonetheless, accused on Fox shows of taking votes away from Trump and throwing them to Biden. Smartmatic is suing for $2.7 billion.   The reason these allegations are so familiar is that the company's claims closely echo those from a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems. Fox News stars and their on-air guests also blamed that company for Trump's loss, as they served up a stew of baseless conspiracy theories about the election.   \n   In both the Dominion and Smartmatic suits, Fox's top hosts and executives were revealed to have desperately sought to appease the network's pro-Trump viewers. Viewers peeled away from Fox in droves after it became the first major U.S network to project that Biden would prevail in the key state of Arizona on election night in 2020. Trump attacked Fox and encouraged his fans to tune into right-wing alternatives like Newsmax and OANN instead.   \n   In 2023, a Delaware judge found that Fox had defamed Dominion ahead of the trial. On the eve of the trial — and founder Rupert Murdoch's scheduled public testimony — Fox paid $787.5 million to resolve the case. The sum is considered to be a record in U.S. media litigation.   The network made no admission of error but released this statement: \"We acknowledge the Court's rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false.\"   \"Almost an unprecedented situation\"   At Tuesday's hearing, both Smartmatic and Fox argued to be given \"summary judgment\" — meaning, a swift victory — on key points and avert a trial.   \n   \"This is almost an unprecedented situation,\" Smartmatic's lead trial attorney, J. Erik Connolly, told New York State Supreme Court Justice David B. Cohen. \"There's really no fight that [Fox] acted with reckless disregard for the truth.... Twenty-eight of the fact witnesses admitted they have no evidence to support any of the allegations that were made about Smartmatic.\"    He argued there were obvious reasons to doubt them, including the fact that Fox journalists and executives expressed their distrust of the allegations and the people making them.    In its rebuttal, Fox's legal team contended that after the 2020 election, the network's stars genuinely believed Trump could have been cheated and simply wanted to report on his campaign's incendiary claims. As a result, Fox's attorney Winn Allen argued, the stars' statements could not meet the legal standard for defamation known as \"actual malice.\" Allen also argued that Smartmatic's gaudy $2.7 billion figure was built on a house of cards.     Smartmatic sued Fox News in February 2021, before Dominion did, but the Dominion case moved briskly through Delaware's streamlined trial system. Smartmatic named several co-defendants, including such stars as the late Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo and Jeanine Pirro, along with Trump's legal advisers Rudolph Giuliani and Sidney Powell, who were frequent guests.   \n   As in the Dominion case, Fox argued its hosts were engaging in legitimate coverage of newsworthy claims by newsworthy figures — the president and his legal advisers — and at the time, those claims had yet to work their way through various legal proceedings. Trump's campaign and his allies lost almost every legal and procedural challenge they filed to the election results.   Smartmatic faces financial and legal questions   Fox spent much of Tuesday's hearing disputing Smartmatic's claims about the voting technology company's financial health, prospects and damages. \"It's a Rube Goldberg-like theory that builds inference upon inference,\" Allen, the Fox trial attorney, told the judge. He presented charts reflecting that Smartmatic had not drawn significant profits in over a decade.    \n   The network's legal filings also questioned the firm's stated origins and its actions abroad.   In October, federal prosecutors charged Smartmatic in a scheme to pay more than $1 million in bribes to a Philippine government official for contracts related to the 2016 national elections there. Company officials denied the allegations, contending the charges were \"targeted, political and unjust.\"   Justice Cohen rejected Fox's request to put a hold on the litigation until after those criminal charges were fully tried.   Evidence shows stars had doubts   Smartmatic was operating in just one jurisdiction in the U.S. during the 2020 elections: Los Angeles County, which was all but guaranteed to swing toward Biden in a heavily Democratic state. The company says it was on the brink of making big gains in the U.S. and abroad after the elections — only to have those business aspirations dashed by the way in which Fox stars amplified wild and unfounded claims from Trump allies.   Fox never retracted the claims. After Smartmatic threatened to sue, Fox aired an unusual segment featuring Eddie Perez, an outside voting technology and integrity expert. Perez was questioned by an off-camera producer. Perez shot down one allegation after another about Smartmatic. Fox broadcast it on the shows hosted by Bartiromo, Dobbs, and Pirro.   Perez told NPR he did not consider the segment a correction: it did not refer to any past false claims on Fox. Yet he said he was glad to offer Fox viewers accurate information after it so frequently ran what he considered election disinformation.   Evidence submitted in court filings suggests that, inside Fox, few believed the wild claims made on the air. Senior Fox executives and even its stars made clear privately they knew that Trump had lost, according to testimony and exchanges presented in the public record. The filings also reflect the way in which Fox stars saw their interests aligning with the interests of the Republican Party under Trump, even when they did not always agree with what he was saying.   \n   Host Jesse Watters texted Fox News comic host Greg Gutfeld, \"Think about how incredible our ratings would be if Fox went ALL in on STOP THE STEAL,\" according to legal filings. Watters later testified under oath he never found such claims credible.   In court documents, Pirro was revealed to have lobbied then-Republican National Committee Chairperson Ronna McDaniel weeks ahead of the election to purchase copies of her book in bulk, as the RNC had done for Fox's Sean Hannity.   \"I'm the Number 1 watched show on all news cable all weekend,\" Pirro texted, according to court records. \"I work so hard for the President and party.\" McDaniel demurred. (The exchange was first reported by The Guardian.)   Once Trump refused to accept the results of the election, Pirro — a former prosecutor — was among those who repeatedly amplified the false claims of fraud. She later testified that she did not think Trump was cheated of victory. Pirro is now the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia.   \"Fox executives and its personalities have consistently lied to their viewers,\" a spokesperson for Smartmatic said in a statement to NPR earlier this fall. \"They knew what they were saying was untrue when they were willingly destroying Smartmatic's reputation, though when under oath they admitted they knew better the whole time.\"   Workplace survey reveals worries inside Fox   According to its court filings, Smartmatic's legal teams also unearthed a Fox News workplace survey from summer 2020 — as Trump ran for re-election — in which numerous staffers complained about the network's bias.   \"We need a recalibration of our standards of conduct for our on-air talent, as well as the truthfulness of our reporting,\" one Fox employee wrote. \"It often feels like our editorial view and specifically our on-air talent has changed to just working for the current administration and will say anything that will be flattering to them. It seems like there's a fear that we cannot anger the president or his most zealous supporters, and have abdicated all pretense of truthful reporting; often allowing guests to say lies unchallenged, or saying false information ourselves to the detriment of our reputation.\"   \n   Other colleagues complained about cheerleading by Fox personalities and objected to multiple on-air stars \"covertly advising\" the president.   In court documents, Fox's attorneys called the remarks incomplete and said they represented a cherrypicked handful of negative remarks. Fox noted it was designated a \"Great Place to Work\" by the organization conducting the workplace survey.   The day after Smartmatic sued Fox, the Fox Business Network canceled Dobbs' show. Dobbs was never seen on Fox airwaves again. He died in July 2024.   Fox has a record of playing hardball but ultimately settling cases close to trial, as it did — albeit very late in the game — in the Dominion case. (The Murdochs did much the same before settling with Prince Harry and a prominent British politician in January in a case involving their U.K. newspapers.) The company, so far, is maintaining a similar public stance in this case, gambling that Smartmatic's own shortcomings will help forestall the need for a similar outcome.\n",

    "body": "\n      President Trump has been bullish on stopping the flow of drugs from Latin America. What exactly is this administration's strategy for stopping drug trafficking?   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  How to square the following two facts? One, the Trump administration is escalating its campaign against drug cartels. It is blowing up boats in the Caribbean that it says are involved in narcotrafficking. Two, President Trump has just pardoned a former president of Honduras, a man convicted in the United States of drug-trafficking charges. The former Honduran president is Juan Orlando Hernandez. He was serving a 45-year sentence for conspiring to import cocaine to the U.S. Now he's been released from a West Virginia prison.So what is the Trump administration drug strategy and how does pardoning an ex-leader convicted of drug trafficking help to advance it? Questions we're going to put now to Todd Robinson. He was assistant secretary of state for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs in the Biden administration, also a former ambassador to Guatemala. Ambassador, welcome.TODD ROBINSON: Hi. Thank you for having me.KELLY: How are you making sense of this timing? As we noted, in one moment President Trump is authorizing strikes against boats he says are carrying drugs, and then the next minute he's pardoning a former head of state convicted in a U.S. court of drug trafficking.ROBINSON: Frankly, I'm finding it hard to understand what to make of this. It's clear that Juan Orlando Hernandez's party is a party that this administration feels comfortable with. But the idea that you're going to raise the stakes in the Caribbean and play Whac-A-Mole really against boats that are hardly a threat to the United States and then on the - at the same time, free a convicted felon who actually did traffic drugs to the United States, I find it confounding.KELLY: Is it clear to you what the motive here is, what President Trump gets out of pardoning Hernandez?ROBINSON: It's not clear to me, except for the fact that he probably thinks he's helping the party that he supports in Honduras' recent elections. But beyond that, I just don't  - I don't understand it. I don't see it.KELLY: So if we are searching for a coherent strategy to counter illegal drugs, where does the last week or two of these recent events - where does - where are we left?ROBINSON: Well, I think your question has the primary word in it - coherent. I don't see a coherent strategy. A coherent strategy would involve not blowing up boats, but actually boarding them, arresting those involved, collecting evidence and intelligence on the boat and working your way through the networks that are involved in narcotics trafficking. It would seem to me that you would look more closely at the trafficking that's going through Central America, up through Mexico, through our southern border, where we know this is happening. And at the same time, you're going after those networks in the Caribbean. What they're doing now, I - frankly, I don't understand.KELLY: So big picture, what is your understanding of why the U.S. has amassed an armada off the coast of Venezuela and is blowing up boats there that they say are involved in drug smuggling? What's the goal?ROBINSON: They're clearly trying to put more pressure on President Maduro. Well, I should say erstwhile President Maduro because he actually lost the last election.KELLY: Although he remains in power. Yep.ROBINSON: Although he remains in power. Exactly. But I think they're trying to put pressure on him to leave - to leave Venezuela. The problem, of course, is it's not just Maduro. If he leaves and he leaves behind his cronies to continue to rule in Venezuela, then you're just changing one problem for another.KELLY: Ambassador, to those who may be listening and thinking, hey, this guy served in the Biden administration, he's going to be critical of anything that President Trump and his allies do, you say what?ROBINSON: I say I spent almost 40 years working at the State Department on behalf of the American people and the United States. My first president was Ronald Reagan, my first secretary of state was George Shultz, and I've worked proudly for all of those administrations. And I worked proudly for the Trump administration in 2018, when he sent me to Venezuela.KELLY: Todd Robinson, former assistant secretary of state for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. Ambassador Robinson, thank you.ROBINSON: Thank you so much for having me.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

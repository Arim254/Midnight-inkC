In the statement, leaders of the eight countries underscored their commitment to shared NATO goals, saying that they stood in \"full solidarity\" with Denmark and Greenland. They also reaffirmed their willingness to \"engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity\" in response to President Trump's repeated threats to take control of Greenland, which is currently an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark.   \n   On Saturday night, President Trump had written on his Truth Social platform that he would impose tariffs on imports from the eight countries. Trump's words came after the countries, which are all in NATO, deployed military personnel to Greenland in recent days, to participate in a Danish-led Arctic exercise known as 'Arctic Endurance'.   Trump said America would levy a 10 percent tariff on goods from the eight countries starting on February 1. He claimed those tariffs would rise to 25 percent on June 1, and remain in place \"until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland\" by the United States.   In their joint response, the eight NATO countries said that Trump's proposed tariffs \"undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.\"   \n   \"As members of NATO, we are committed to strengthening Arctic security as a shared transatlantic interest,\" the leaders said. \"The pre-coordinated Danish exercise 'Arctic Endurance' conducted with Allies, responds to this necessity. It poses no threat to anyone.\"   The coordinated statement reflects an unusually explicit diplomatic pushback by key U.S. allies. In addition, some individual European leaders issued their own individual criticisms.   British Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the use of tariffs against allies, calling it \"completely wrong\". A spokesman for the UK Prime Minister later said Starmer had shared this view with President Trump in a phone call on Sunday. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said Sweden would not be \"blackmailed,\" while Norway's prime minister stressed that \"threats have no place among allies.\"   \n   Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen also made a statement, praising \"great support\" from European allies. \"I am pleased with the consistent messages from the rest of the continent: Europe will not be blackmailed,\" Frederiksen said.   European foreign policy leaders made clear that trade coercion would harm the broader transatlantic relationship and potentially derail other ongoing negotiations.   One unnamed French official close to Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot told NPR that Paris had mobilized its diplomatic apparatus \"to coordinate a European response to the new, unacceptable tariff threats issued by President Trump.\"   The official added that Barrot had been in talks with his British, German and EU counterparts and was in contact with all affected foreign ministers and European Parliament political groups.   Ordinary citizens have also registered their opposition to President Trump's recent threats, with large protests in Denmark and Greenland against American pressure alongside the broader NATO debates about Arctic security as well as the diplomatic scramble.   In his social media post on Saturday, Trump framed Europe's actions as part of \"a very dangerous situation\" and argued the tariffs were necessary to protect \"Global Peace and Security\" – language that has been widely challenged by European officials and analysts as exaggerated or unfounded given the context of NATO cooperation in the Arctic.   \n   This latest tariff standoff follows weeks of increasingly assertive U.S. rhetoric regarding Greenland and Arctic policy. Trump has repeatedly declared Greenland — a vast, sparsely populated territory — as strategically vital to U.S. national security, citing its location and untapped mineral resources.   Greenlandic and Danish leaders have consistently pushed back, insisting the territory is not for sale, most recently during discussions between the two countries' foreign ministers and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.   Domestically, the tariff decision has sparked pushback not only abroad but among U.S. lawmakers. Bi-partisan voices in Congress have criticized the approach as damaging to NATO cohesion, and warned that it could jeopardize U.S. credibility.   \n   Analysts have pointed out that the United States already maintains a military presence in Greenland, which has shrunk dramatically over the decades, and so question the necessity of coercive economic measures tied to territorial ambitions.\n",

The Democrats tried to turn the 900-page Heritage Foundation-led blueprint to remake the government into a political boogeyman, and succeeded to some degree, but it wasn't enough to win the election.   A year later, many of the policies have been implemented, from cracking down on immigration to dismantling the Department of Education.   \"A lot of the policies from Day 1 to the last day and in between that the administration has adopted are right out of Project 2025,\" said Rob Bonta, the attorney general of California, who has used Project 2025 to prepare legal papers against the administration.   \n   Concerns about the project started to bubble up over the spring of 2024, but really caught fire a few months later when actress Taraji P. Henson singled out Project 2025 while hosting the BET awards.   \"Pay attention. It's not a secret. Look it up!\" she said, speaking directly into the camera during the show. \"They are attacking our most vulnerable citizens. The Project 2025 plan is not a game.\"   \"Ridiculous\"   Then-candidate Trump tried to dismiss the hysteria, calling the ideas \"ridiculous\" — and claiming he did not know who was behind it — even though key people involved in developing the plans served in his first administration.   And when it was clear the firestorm would not go away, Trump went on the attack against those allies who wrote the playbook.   \"They're a pain in the a**,\" said Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, who tore into the organizers of Project 2025 at an event hosted by CNN and Politico during the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.   \"Look, I think that in the perfect world, from their perspective, they would love to drive the issue set, but they don't get to do that,\" he added.   Yet days after winning, Trump tapped Russell Vought, an architect of Project 2025, to lead the Office of Management and Budget — considered the nerve center of the White House. Other contributors followed.   \n   Trump soon unleashed a flurry of orders reshaping the government, many of which were outlined in Project 2025.   \"As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female,\" he said during his inaugural address.   Trump ended diversity, equity and inclusion programs. He launched massive immigration enforcement and took the first steps to overhaul the federal workforce.   Bonta, the attorney general of California, said Project 2025 defined Trump's first year back in office. The country's 23 Democratic attorneys general studied Project 2025, consulted with each other and, he said, prepared a response for every potential action should it be taken.   \"The existence of Project 2025 was the Trump administration telling us exactly what they were going to do and sending it to us in writing,\" Bonta said.   Bonta has filed or joined lawsuits that have successfully blocked Trump's policies requiring states like California to join his immigration crackdown, freeze of domestic federal funding and layoffs at agencies such as the U.S. Department of Education.   The White House dismissed concerns about Project 2025, calling them irrelevant theories from Beltway insiders.   \"President Trump is implementing the agenda he campaigned on and that the American people voted for,\" said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman.   Jackson said the president focused on implementing the agenda he campaigned on — lowering gas prices, accelerating economic growth and securing the border.   Fueling controversy   Trump may have actually fueled the controversy by rejecting Project 2025 during the campaign, said Tevi Troy, a presidential historian and former White House aide to George W. Bush.   \"I would say that Project 2025 was largely standard conservative fare, but with a bit more of a MAGA flavor than previously.\"   Troy sees little difference between what the Heritage Foundation did with Project 2025 and what think tanks on the left and right have been doing for years compiling policy proposals for incoming presidents.   \n   He pointed to the personnel and policy ideas of the Hoover Institution that helped shape the George W. Bush administration and the Center for American Progress' influence on the Obama administration.   \"If the Trump campaign had leaned into it and said, 'sure, this is an agenda that has been put out as a think tank. This happens all the time. We will look at them in due time when the election is over,' \" said Troy. \"By criticizing and disavowing Project 2025, it suddenly became more radioactive.\"   Trump did eventually embrace Project 2025 during the shutdown fight last fall.   He boasted of meeting with \"Russ Vought, he of PROJECT 2025 Fame,\" while threatening to dismantle federal agencies.   \"I can't believe the Radical Left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity,\" he said.\n",

Denmark and Greenland are stepping up lobbying of U.S. lawmakers in an effort to head off President Trump's push to take control of Greenland.\n                \n                    Nichlas Pollier/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Nichlas Pollier/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   President Trump escalated his crusade for the U.S. to acquire Greenland this weekend, just as a congressional delegation wrapped up a trip to Denmark to try to turn the temperature down.   On Saturday, Trump announced on social media that he intends to impose a 10% tariff on eight European nations, including Denmark, because of their opposition to his plan. He vowed to raise the tariff to 25% by June if a deal to acquire Greenland isn't reached.   The threat came on the heels of a bipartisan congressional visit to Denmark, where 11 lawmakers attempted to reassure Danish and Greenlandic politicians of U.S. support.   \n   North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, one of two Republicans on the delegation, blasted the president's announcement on social media.   \"The fact that a small handful of 'advisors' are actively pushing for coercive action to seize the territory of an ally is beyond stupid,\" he posted. \"It hurts the legacy of President Trump and undercuts all the work he has done to strengthen the NATO alliance over the years.\"   Over the course of the trip, the delegation met with top Danish and Greenlandic officials, including Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who has said U.S. taking over Greenland would spell the end of NATO.   \"Greenland is a part of Denmark. Denmark is our NATO ally. That should be the end of this discussion,\" Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., who led the delegation, said on Saturday.   \"This is a moment where our very positive relationships have dimmed a bit, and I hope that the people of the Kingdom of Denmark do not abandon their faith in the American people,\" he added.   \n   Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, stressed the importance of not letting this issue \"become a partisan matter.\"   She suggested there is broader Republican opposition to Trump's plans than was reflected in the makeup of the delegation.   \"I don't think that the absence of Republicans is because they don't care about this issue or they have already decided what side of the fence that they may be,\" she told reporters. \"So I would not take that as an indicator of support or lack of support.\"   \n   Pipaluk Lynge, a politician from Greenland who spoke with the delegation, said she's been wanting to meet with the Americans for over a year.   \"Dialogue through social media won't come to a better ending,\" she said. \"Dialogue face to face is really important, and also that they hear from the Greenlandic people themselves.\"   Lynge said fears in Greenland are high and diplomacy is crucial.   \"We are worried, the children of Greenland are worried. But we as politicians have to work on making collaboration,\" she said. \"I'm hoping that this also can be sent to the White House, that we're open for business and open for dialogue, to compromise.\"   Lawmakers as crisis diplomats    The delegation highlighted the role that lawmakers can play on the world stage, meeting not only with political figures but with the business community as well.   \"We continue to hear about the challenges that come with an unpredictable and unstable political environment in the United States and how that can stifle investment,\" said Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del.   McBride said the Greenlandic delegation told lawmakers how existential this threat feels.   \"I think it is easy for people back in the United States to see these headlines and to dismiss it as a show, as pure saber rattling,\" McBride told NPR. \"But I cannot stress for people enough how serious people in Greenland and Denmark are taking this.\"   The delegation also laid a wreath at a memorial acknowledging the sacrifice of Danes deployed in international missions, with inscriptions of the fallen.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Jeanne Shaheen attends a press conference with an American delegation, consisting of senators and members of the House of Representatives, in Copenhagen, Denmark, on Saturday.\n                \n                    Ida Marie Odgaard/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Ida Marie Odgaard/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"A black mark on America\"   Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., told NPR the visit to the memorial is a reminder of the deep sacrifices Denmark has made.   \"They have stood by us in two world wars — Afghanistan,\" she said. \"Danish soldiers stood side by side with Americans. And for America's president to show so little regard, appreciation and understanding for what Denmark has done is a black mark on America.\"   \n   Shaheen, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Trump's actions have \"real ramifications for people here who feel betrayed by America.\"   She added his quest to acquire Greenland threatens the NATO alliance.   \"One of the things that has made America so strong is our allies and partners, and anything that the president does to undermine those relationships, to undermine NATO, does nothing but give Vladimir Putin in Russia and President Xi in China reasons to celebrate,\" Shaheen said. \"And you can bet they're celebrating now.\"   Trump has said that China and Russia are encircling Greenland, but lawmakers have repeatedly said they haven't received any intelligence indicating that threat.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Protesters on City Square during a protest in support of Greenland on Saturday in Copenhagen, Denmark.\n                \n                    Martin Sylvest Andersen/Getty Images Europe\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Martin Sylvest Andersen/Getty Images Europe\n    \n\n   \n   \"Yankee go home\"   This weekend was also marked by a massive demonstration in Copenhagen, where thousands protested against Trump's comments, some waving signs that read, \"Yankee go home.\"   \"It's just absurd,\" said Christian Michaelson, who grew up in Denmark.   \"If you had wanted a higher presence in the Arctic region, you could have just asked,\" he said.   Charlotte Holm held a sign that read: \"Americans want Epstein files. Not Greenland. Greenland not for sale.\"   \"Leave them alone,\" said Holm, who was born and raised in Copenhagen and has family in Greenland. \"I hope [Trump] will get obsessed with something else all of a sudden.\"   She said she worries that NATO will \"implode\" if Trump moves against a NATO ally, echoing comments from the Danish prime minister.    \"If we go across that line, there's no going back,\" she said. \"You can't put the toothpaste back into the tube.\"\n",

Bishop Rob Hirschfeld was one of several community and faith leaders gathered in Concord, N.H., for a vigil for Renee Macklin Good just days after she was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis.    \n   Hirschfeld called out the \"cruelty, the injustice and the horror … unleashed in Minneapolis,\" and warned his clergy to prepare for \"a new era of martyrdom.\"   \"I've asked them to get their affairs in order to make sure they have their wills written,\" he said, \"because it may be that now is no longer the time for statements, but for us with our bodies to stand between the powers of this world and the most vulnerable.\"   Hirschfeld's comments quickly went viral.   \n   \"I was actually quite surprised to open up my phone and find my social media blowing up with my own bishop on it,\" said Reverend Jason Wells of St. Matthews Epsicopal Church in Goffstown, N.H.   Wells, a community organizer who regularly prays outside ICE offices, said he and many others took it as a great relief – and a validation of sorts – to hear the bishop speaking openly about the mounting anxiety felt by faith leaders around the nation who've been stepping up their public prayers and protests against ICE, and getting pelted with pepper rounds, roughed up and arrested.   \"People feel like he's giving voice to a feeling in the pit of their stomach about what is going on,\" said Wells. \"It's a relief to hear him naming a concern that I've had on my mind for a while.\"   \n   The Reverend Betsy Hess of St. Barnabas Episcopal Church in Berlin, N.H. added her voice to the chorus of \"amens\" and immediately emailed the bishop to thank him.   Hess believes clergy \"need to quit just being polite Episcopalians, and get out there and do stuff.\" But exactly what she would do, and what level of risk she's willing to take, is something she's still figuring out.   \"It used to be that … you might go to jail, and now you might get shot! So it makes us need to be a lot more brave,\" she said. \"I hope I would be brave, but I can't promise that I would be able to. But definitely, it's time to move beyond 'I won't do anything that has any risk whatsoever.'\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A priest claps as protesters conitnue anti-ICE demonstrations in Los Angeles, California, on June 9, 2025.\n                \n                    David Pashaee/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        David Pashaee/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty\n    \n\n   \n   Others, however, took issue with the bishop's words.   \n   \"My initial reaction is 'Oh boy, this isn't diffusing tension at all. This feels like a war cry,\" said the Reverend Tom Gartin of Faith Episcopal Church who heard about the bishop's comments from his parish in Cameron Park, California.   \"I didn't sign up to be a martyr,\" he said. \"I have a family and a congregation who rely on me. If I was gone tomorrow what would happen to them?\"   Gartin also bristled at the idea of a preacher making the case for physical resistance. Based on his assessment, mere statements have not \"moved the needle one bit.\" He sees the bishop's message as \"inflammatory,\" and at odds with one of Episcopalians' guiding tenets – Via Media – that calls for finding a middle path between extremes.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Demonstrators, including many clergy, protest near the immigration processing and detention facility on Oct. 10, 2025 in Broadview, Illinois.\n                \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Scott Olson/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Gartin said the focus of church leadership should be \"to do the work of peacemaking and to deescalate the tension we've seen all around us.\"   \"We're called to do the work of peacemaking and to deescalate the tension we see all around us because it doesn't serve anyone to become the next victim,\" he said, \"but it does serve everyone to build the next bridge.\"   Hirschfeld said he was surprised by the stir his comments created.   \"I don't feel like I said anything that was new,\" he said in an interview with NPR. \"In no way did I intend anything I said to be inciteful of violence or to invite it.\"   Hirschfeld said he understands how some may be hearing his words in ways he didn't intend, but he stands by his message.   \"What I said to the clergy (was) 'I'm just asking you to live your life without fear of death. Be prepared. I'm not asking you to go look for that bullet,'\" He said. \"I'm simply saying be ready, have your affairs in order, have your soul ready, in case you find yourself in trouble.\"   \n   That, Hirschfeld said, is the Episcopal tradition. At the vigil where he made his initial remarks, he listed several church activists who became martyrs, including Jonathan Daniels, a New Hampshire native and seminary student who travelled to Alabama in 1965 to help integrate public places and register Black voters. He took a bullet to protect a black teenager he accompanied.   \"Not everyone can be a Jonathan Daniels,\" Hirschfeld said, but \"we're increasingly called to go into places that feel dangerous.\"   That could be anything, he said, from his venture into the home of a neighbor whose political yard signs made him feel unsafe, to attending public demonstrations against ICE.   \"I increasingly wonder when I go to these rallies or even a peaceful vigil. There are people driving by, honking their horns,\" he said. \"I see people with guns in New Hampshire, this is an open-carry state, and it doesn't necessarily lend itself to a feeling of security and safety. But does that mean I shouldn't show up? I don't think so. I think it means I go and I should be prepared for whatever happens.\"   In a statement to NPR, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said interfering with federal law enforcement is a crime and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. The administration maintains the ICE agent who shot Renee Macklin Good was acting in self-defense.   DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called Hirschfeld's comments about martyrdom \"absurd,\" saying if he \"really wanted to take a stand for the vulnerable\" he would stand by the ICE agents who increasingly are under attack.   Hirschfeld said he does feel compassion for those agents.   \"It's definitely our Christian responsibility to extend love even to our enemies,\" he said, and to love all God's children, even those who may be \"swept up in a maelstrom of hatred and fear and power that is not godly.\"   \n   Hirschfeld added, \"I pray for everyone's conversion of heart.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      It's been a challenging year for the consumer watchdog agency, as the Trump administration has tried to deny it funding and lay off most of its staff.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  This first year of the second Trump administration has been especially tough for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The agency is supposed to investigate fraud, but instead, it's mostly been dealing with work stoppages, layoffs and funding threats. NPR's Stephan Bisaha reports on the yearlong attempt to dismantle the government watchdog.STEPHAN BISAHA, BYLINE: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is probably best known for going after banking giants, like accusing Wells Fargo of doing things like illegally seizing homes and cars and fining the bank billions of dollars. But really, the agency's watchdog duties cover a lot more.LISA ROSENTHAL: Everybody that affects your wallet and your bank account.BISAHA: Lisa Rosenthal's 12-year career as an investigator and manager at the CFPB gives a sense of that scope.ROSENTHAL: I focused on payday loan victims.BISAHA: The auto finance market.ROSENTHAL: The federal student loan market.BISAHA: And debt collectors. And since it's been created, the CFPB's returned nearly $20 billion to consumers.So it sounds like you take a lot of pride in the work you did.ROSENTHAL: I take a lot of pride in the work that we did as a - you know, as an institution.BISAHA: Congress created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2010 after the 2008 financial crisis. Basically, it took the consumer protection duties of other agencies and put them under one roof, along with new supervising and rule-making powers. But throughout the past year, the Trump administration has tried to dismantle the agency through layoffs and cutting off funds. To do that, Trump made one of the CFPB's biggest critics the agency's acting director, Russell Vought.(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE CHARLIE KIRK SHOW\")RUSSELL VOUGHT: All they want to do is weaponize the tools of financial laws against basically small mom-and-pop lenders and other small financial institutions.BISAHA: That was Vought on \"The Charlie Kirk Show\" last fall criticizing some of the agency's staff. We reached out for comment from Vought's office and the CFPB and have not heard back. One of Vought's first actions was emailing workers and telling them to stop working. Bank examinations had been paused, cases were dismissed, regulations withdrawn, all while over the past year, the number of complaints against companies sent to the CFPB to investigate have nearly doubled. Lisa Rosenthal made a decision.ROSENTHAL: This work that I had carried out for these decades and that I cared so deeply about, this was no longer that work.BISAHA: She resigned in February. As for the workers who tried to stay, in April, 84% of them got layoff notices.HELEN SHAW: Everyone was upset.BISAHA: Helen Shaw was one of them.SHAW: Colleagues were crying. It was very worrisome.BISAHA: Shaw regulates interstate land sales, basically making sure property developers are telling the truth to potential buyers. Now, a district court judge has blocked those layoffs while the legal fight continues, and Shaw says she will not be forced out.SHAW: I'm determined to stay because I really believe in the mission of helping individual consumers.BISAHA: The CFPB gets funded from the Federal Reserve, so Vought's recent plan to stop the agency was to refuse to ask for those funds. But in December, that same district judge ordered Vought to make the request, and he did. The judge also wrote in her decision, the agency is, quote, \"hanging by a thread.\" Some work like Shaw's has resumed, but she says bank inspections have essentially been paused, and the threats to the agency's future have not gone away.SHAW: We're still at risk of losing our existence, I think.BISAHA: Even some critics that were never in favor of the CFPB don't like how the Trump administration's doing this.NORBERT MICHEL: Well, I'm conflicted.BISAHA: Norbert Michel runs the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives. And, yeah, he thinks the CFPB should not exist, that it's redundant. But he also thinks Congress - not the administration - should be the one dismantling the CFPB, and he's concerned there isn't any legislation instructing other agencies to fill in the consumer protection gap.MICHEL: Now you have a lot of those things that are not being done, so that gets me a little bit nervous.BISAHA: He does say there are still state and local agencies enforcing consumer protection laws. But Helen Shaw says weakening CFPB goes against one of President Trump's priorities.SHAW: We're the agency to help consumers with the affordability crisis.BISAHA: One of Trump's affordability proposals is capping credit card interest rates. Shaw says enforcing that would naturally be the CFPB's job.SHAW: It's confusing, right? - because they're stating that they'll pursue ways to alleviate the affordability crisis for families, yet we're not fully functional right now.BISAHA: And those early court actions that protected the CFPB from things like layoffs, those were just temporary. The legal battle that could decide the fate of the agency is likely to be long and drawn out - a battle Shaw calls existential.Stephan Bisaha, NPR News.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

    "body": "\n      President Trump announced fresh tariffs on European countries to pressure them on his desire to acquire Greenland. He travels to the World Economic Forum in Davos this week where tensions may be high.   \n\n    AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:  President Trump is back to using one of his favorite tools in an attempt to get what he wants. Yesterday, ahead of his trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump announced additional tariffs on eight NATO members resisting his plans to acquire Greenland. Joining me now is NPR White House correspondent Deepa Shivaram. Good morning, Deepa.DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: Good morning, Ayesha.RASCOE: So tell us more about these new tariffs.SHIVARAM: Yeah. So this is something the president floated Friday for the first time. I was actually at the White House when he said it during this event on rural health care. It was not related to Greenland at all, but he was talking about how he's used tariffs in the past to pressure other countries to work with his agenda. And then he said this.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland 'cause we need Greenland for national security. So I may do that.SHIVARAM: It was the first time he had said that, and then less than 24 hours later, he elaborated. In a post to social media yesterday, Trump said that Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland - which are all NATO allies, I will add - they will face new tariffs on goods sent to the U.S. And Trump says it would start at 10% starting next month, and then increase to 25% in June unless a deal is reached for the U.S. to purchase Greenland.Now, Trump's rhetoric on Greenland was already complicating relationships with European allies, and his tariff announcement is, as you can imagine, causing more tension. And it's happening ahead of Davos, like you said, where Trump is probably going to see the leaders of some of these EU nations and European nations. So, you know, in response, the Danish foreign minister said the tariff announcement came as a surprise, and ambassadors from EU nations are convening today in Brussels for an emergency meeting to respond to this.RASCOE: Does this reach for tariffs mean that Trump is less inclined to use military force, like he's threatened?SHIVARAM: Yeah. I would say it's a little unclear at this point. And just for context, I mean, this conversation has been going on for months now. Like, early on last year is when the president, you know, started bringing this issue up. It's been ongoing. What the president keeps saying is that the U.S. needs Greenland for national security reasons. He says if the U.S. doesn't take this territory, then China or Russia might, and that would give them the advantage. But Denmark, which is a nation in NATO - again, a really critical alliance - has control of Greenland, and they say they have no intention of giving it up. Leaders in Greenland have said they have no interest in being controlled by the U.S.It just seems like at this point, no matter how much officials in these areas - Greenland, Denmark, other countries - emphasize that the U.S. taking Greenland, whether it's purchasing it or by military force - they say it's unacceptable, and Trump just doesn't seem to want to hear that. And in the meantime, you know, things are tense. European countries, including France and Germany and Sweden, have sent over military units to Greenland to help boost security there.RASCOE: What are we expecting to hear from the president at this economic forum?SHIVARAM: Well, Trump has said in the last few weeks that he intends to announce his plan for more affordable housing while he's at Davos. He says he wants to lower home prices by getting private equity groups out of the housing market, but the rest of the specifics around that plan have not yet been released. And that announcement comes, Ayesha, as Trump is trying to tackle other topics around affordability. Remember, it is an election year. Midterms are coming, and the economy remains very top of mind for voters. Last month, there was a lot - a number of polls showing that Trump's rating on his handling of the economy have been really low. So he's trying to talk about saving costs.And in addition to talking about housing this coming week, he's also recently announced other plans. Last week, his health care plan was released. It's more of a broad framework, but he says it will reform things like drug pricing. I will say, though, there are criticisms around that plan - like I said, that it's too broad and that it doesn't do anything to address higher health insurance premiums that a lot of people are paying after Congress denied to extend a provision that would have kept those costs lower. So still some issues to tackle there.RASCOE: OK. So finally, stateside, it looks like President Trump may be moving away from his threat to use the Insurrection Act against Minneapolis, where an immigration crackdown has been met with sustained protest. Is it that Trump is focused elsewhere, or are there worries within the administration around public blowback?SHIVARAM: Yeah. I mean, look. On Friday, the president said he didn't think he needed to use the Insurrection Act, but I will note that he also said, you know, if he needed it, he would use it. So it's sort of that space where it's possible he's backing down on it. At the same time, it's not clear that he's, you know, ruled it out. But it is interesting to keep in mind that it's something that Trump keeps talking about. The last time a president invoked the Insurrection Act was back in the LA riots in the '90s. I will note, though, several news organizations are reporting that about 1,500 U.S. active-duty troops have been ordered to prepare for a possible deployment to Minnesota. NPR, though, has not independently confirmed those reports.RASCOE: That's NPR's White House correspondent Deepa Shivaram. Thank you so much.SHIVARAM: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

    "body": "\n      A bipartisan group of Senators is in Denmark speaking to officials there as President Trump announces new tariffs and continues to talk about taking over Greenland.   \n\n    SARAH MCCAMMON, HOST:  President Trump is escalating his effort to acquire Greenland, which is part of the kingdom of Denmark. In a social media post earlier today, he said he will impose a new 10% tariff on several European countries that oppose the idea - including Germany, France and Denmark - that is, until they get on board. This came on the heels of a bipartisan congressional delegation that went to Denmark on Friday to try to turn down the temperature. NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt traveled there also, and she joins us from Copenhagen. Hi, Barbara.BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Hi, Sarah.MCCAMMON: So tell me more about this delegation. Who went, and what was their goal?SPRUNT: Well, this was a group of about a dozen lawmakers, mostly Democrats. There were two Republicans, both of whom have shown a willingness in the past to push back on the Trump administration. And this was, at its core, a reassurance tour. You know, they were coming to listen and hear the concerns of politicians of both Denmark and Greenland, as well as some Danish business leaders. Here's Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski speaking after an event at Parliament yesterday.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LISA MURKOWSKI: I think it is important to underscore that when you ask the American people whether or not they think it is a good idea for the United States to acquire Greenland, the vast majority - some 75% - will say, we do not think that that is a good idea.SPRUNT: You know what's interesting, Sarah - I follow these folks around on Capitol Hill all the time, and it was almost like seeing them in a completely different job. They were diplomats. They were talking to allies who are frankly in crisis mode.MCCAMMON: You know, that's a really interesting distinction - diplomats versus lawmakers. What did you see?SPRUNT: Well, on Capitol Hill, partisanship reigns. When there's an opportunity for Democrats to take a dig at President Trump over policy or politics, more often than not, it happens. But here in Copenhagen, that's not what I saw largely. I heard a lot of careful language, a lot about bringing the knowledge that they've gained here by listening to the concerns of people on the ground back with them to the U.S. Delaware Senator Chris Coons, who led the delegation, said he'd even welcome conversations with the White House about what they've learned.MCCAMMON: Needless to say, a very different tone from what we've heard from President Trump. What was the response from the politicians from Denmark and Greenland?SPRUNT: They said they were pleased that the delegation came, that they had constructive conversations and that it was important for lawmakers to hear directly from officials from Greenland. And although they're clear in their concern about the rhetoric around buying Greenland, I thought their tone was really notable. It was calm. They repeatedly said that they stand ready to work alongside the U.S. Here's Pipaluk Lynge, a Greenlandic politician. Reporters were asking her about Trump and his comments.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PIPALUK LYNGE: I think it's really important not to demonize anyone. It's really important to focus on what we're agreeing on and focus on dialogue.SPRUNT: And I think it's really significant there how measured she is, not at all inflaming what's already a volatile situation.MCCAMMON: Now, of course, President Trump says he wants to take over Greenland because he doesn't want China or Russia to take it over. What are officials there saying about that?SPRUNT: I heard repeatedly from lawmakers that they haven't received any intelligence that suggests that that is an imminent threat. That being said, Greenland and Danish officials did say that they're willing to work with the U.S. to address concerns around safeguarding the Arctic. And I should mention, the U.S. already has a military presence in Greenland.MCCAMMON: What else are you hearing from the people you're meeting there in Copenhagen, Barbara?SPRUNT: Well, I attended a demonstration earlier today, thousands of people marching to protest Trump. Lots of passion, tons of chanting of, Greenland is not for sale. I saw a lot of hats that looked almost like the signature red Make America Great Again hats, but they said, Make America Go Away. I went up to one gentleman who had a sign that showed a image of Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, and it said, Americans, we know there is good in you, come back to sanity. His name is Peder Dam, and he said he doesn't think that Trump's demands are necessarily representative of what all Americans want, but he does wonder why there isn't more outrage.PEDER DAM: I can't understand. If my government said that they would attack Sweden, then I would step up and protest that.

Ron, thanks for being with us.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.SIMON: I want to ask you - a new poll just out, about a year into Donald Trump's presidency, it finds that 58% of those polled think his first year of his second term has not been a success. Fifty-six percent find the fatal shooting of Renee Good an inappropriate use of force, and less than a third say that ICE operations have made America's cities safer. What do you see in these findings?ELVING: A lot of warning signs for a second-term president facing a fall that brings midterm elections for Congress. And it's not only CNN. The same message comes from other media polls and academic polls. The Associated Press works with people who compile a great deal of public opinion data. Their latest poll shows some erosion, even among Republicans, on some issues. Immigration was his best issue all last year, but even that's underwater for him now. Just 38% approve of his handling of immigration since the last ICE raids in that poll. Yet what is most striking is the disapproval on parts of Trump's foreign policy. It's rare to see any national polling question get a 60% negative response. But the idea of taking Greenland by force is opposed by nearly 70% of Americans.SIMON: And given these poll numbers, why do you think almost no change in course from the White House a year in?ELVING: There have been some efforts to vary the program, if not really change course. The president has changed tactics on household affordability as an issue, saying it's something to take seriously, proposing means of lowering home prices. In response to other controversies, the president has backed off on some of his threats. He hasn't struck Iran yet. He has not declared a state of emergency in Minnesota, as we just heard from Kat. But I'm reminded of two three-word phrases that we heard a lot in the first Trump term. One was flood the zone, and the other was audience of one. Flood the zone meant that if there was a bad story in the news, the best way to handle it was to blow it away with a flurry of actions or statements that were sure to grab attention.So whether the bad story is the Epstein files or the battles over ICE, we are suddenly seeing lots of unexpected stories. We mentioned Greenland and the tariffs, and now the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Jerome Powell, is being investigated. We mentioned the Minnesota governor and mayor of Minneapolis being investigated, possibly charged with obstructing, but no investigation yet for the ICE agent who shot an unarmed woman four times in that city. And as for the audience of one, it's clear that much is said and done in this White House and this administration with just one mind in mind.SIMON: What signals do you see about this administration's plans for Iran?ELVING: Those plans are not entirely clear at this point, but the president has sent an aircraft carrier battle group to the area and done a lot of saber-rattling, not unlike what he did before the incursion into Venezuela. Late in the week, the president backed off a bit on this one, too, after Iran withdrew its threatened mass executions of protesters. The death toll is already in the thousands there. But both the mullahs in Tehran and the president in Washington seem to have heard from allies and partners in the Arab world and elsewhere, all trying to lower the tension, prevent a U.S. strike, and one argument being that such a strike would worsen the situation without solving it. And those entreaties may have been heard and heeded, at least for the moment.SIMON: Finally, this week, Ron, what are your thoughts on the Nobel Peace Prize that President Trump seemed to acquire this week?ELVING: The Nobel Committee made it clear the prize was still María Corina Machado's to keep but not to give away. She did give the president the medal that went with the prize. That was surely a measure of how much she wanted to please and placate the president and a measure of her willingness to sacrifice for her cause and, we might add, a measure of her savvy in dealing with a certain audience of one.SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving. As always, a pleasure to talk to you, my friend. Talk to you later. Take care.ELVING: Thank you, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The crowd, waving Greenlandic flags, chanted \"Greenland is not for sale.\" Many demonstrators wore red hats in Trump's own \"Make America great again\" fashion that read, \"Make America go away.\"   Trump has continued to endorse the idea of acquiring Greenland, which he says the U.S. needs for national security purposes. The U.S. already has a military presence on the island.   \"One way or the other, we're going to have Greenland,\" Trump told reporters recently on Air Force One.   \n   Saturday's protest came on the heels of a bipartisan congressional delegation that travelled to Copenhagen. House and Senate lawmakers met with Danish and Greenlandic officials, as well as members of the Danish business community. The visit was meant to be a reassurance tour — affirming the longstanding relationship between the U.S. and the Kingdom of Denmark in the face of Trump's rhetoric.   \n   Peder Dam, who lives in Denmark, attended the demonstration with a sign that featured an image of Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker from Star Wars that read: \"Americans: I know there is good in you. Come back to sanity.\"   \"We know what is going on in the White House is not representative for all Americans,\" he told NPR.    But he said he wonders why there isn't more widespread outrage from the American public.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Peder Dam attended the protest alongside his son Gorm. They each carried signs: one with a cartoon of Trump stepping on leggos with a caption that read: \"Denmark is small, but we fight with what we have\"; and another with an image of Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker from Star Wars that read: \"Americans: I know there is good in you. Come back to sanity.\"\n                \n                    Barbara Sprunt/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Barbara Sprunt/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"I can't understand. If my government said they would attack Sweden, then Denmark would step up and protest that,\" he said. \"I like protests in the U.S. But why aren't there more normal, average Americans stepping up, trying to protest what is going on? It's crazy.\"   Another demonstrator, Thomas, whom NPR is identifying only by his first name because of concerns about retaliation at work, said the march represents \"an unseen level of resentment towards the U.S.\"    \"I cannot express how deeply disappointed I am — that we have sent our troops to die with you in Iraq, we were with you in Afghanistan,\" he said. \"How dare you turn your back on us in this way?\"   \n   He said while he thinks Americans might not believe that Trump will actually invade Greenland, that's a skepticism that people in the Kingdom of Denmark can't afford.   \"I don't think it's going to happen, but we don't know,\" he said. \"And that's creating an unprecedented level of emotional uncertainty and political uncertainty.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                One demonstrator held up a sign that read: \"Trump: Your need for megalomaniac legacy needs a psychiatrist — not Greenland.\" Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Copenhagen Saturday, protesting against Trump's rhetoric surrounding the proposed U.S. acquisition Greenland.\n                \n                    Barbara Sprunt/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Barbara Sprunt/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Naja Mathilde Rosing said the march felt intensely personal. She and her family are from Greenland.   \"We are here to show solidarity, that we do not wish to be a part of the United States,\" she told NPR. \"We are strong as we are, and we are not interested in having anything to do with America.\"   She pushed back on Trump's claims that Russia and China are encircling Greenland, claiming it's a red herring. The U.S. congressional delegation told reporters that there's no intelligence suggesting that, either.   Rosing said the idea itself of purchasing Greenland is offensive to indigenous communities, who she said respect the land and don't see it as something you can own.   \"America has a sense of feeling they can steal land from the Native Americans, steal land from the indigenous Hawaiian people, steal land from the indigenous Inuit from Alaska,\" she said. \"You cannot buy Greenland, you cannot buy a people. It is so wrong, disrespectful to think that you can purchase a country and a people.\"   Charlotte Holm lives in Copenhagen but has family in Greenland.   \"They're so scared,\" she said. \"They're afraid because they don't know what's going to happen to their society.\"   She said the message to the U.S. is simple: \"Leave them alone. Go focus on the Epstein files, go focus on the midterm elections.\"   She said she hopes Trump will \"get obsessed with something else\" but worries about the ripple effect of any possible U.S. encroachment into Greenland.   \n   \"It's going to reshape fundamentally the world order if he does. NATO's going to implode,\" she said, echoing similar comments from Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. \"We need American citizens to call their Republican representatives and tell them we need to take care of NATO, because if we go across that line, there's no going back. You can't put the toothpaste back into the tube.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      Stephen Fowler is NPR's go to reporter for document dumps. He explains how he approaches the day's biggest stories...and its most perplexing datasets.   \n\n    SARAH MCCAMMON, HOST:  If you've spent any time on the internet over the past few years, you've probably heard the name Jeffrey Epstein and the mystery surrounding the files tied to his case. Last month, just a few days before Christmas, some of those records were officially released. Not a handful of documents, but tens of thousands of pages - court filings, emails, photos, all landing at once and instantly lighting up social media, cable news and conspiracy theories.STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: When the first batch of files were released, well, the thing that I thought was something that I can't say on the radio.MCCAMMON: That's Stephen Fowler. He's a political reporter based in Atlanta. We worked together on NPR's Washington Desk.FOWLER: There are a few of us that had started combing through the documents as soon as they came out. We had to download them. We had to file, organize them and sort them and make sure we didn't miss anything, count the total number of pages and documents to see if there was anything missing or anything that needed to be formatted a different way.MCCAMMON: Sorting through that kind of data is exactly what Stephen does. He's become our go-to reporter for digging into large document dumps from government data to the Epstein files to figure out what they actually show and, just as importantly, what they don't show. And I'll admit, I picked up that beat for a day or two during the holidays when everybody was kind of jumping in on whatever needed to be done, and it is a lot of work. So for this week's Reporter's Notebook, I wanted to ask Stephen about his process. Where does he start when these files are released, and how does he go through them? It turns out the work starts long before those documents drop.FOWLER: We did have a story ready to go, saying, hey, the Justice Department has started releasing Epstein files, that we already had in advance of the backstory of how we got to this point, what the law said, directing the release, the political fallout for it. So we didn't really start from scratch.MCCAMMON: How do you go about going through these tens of thousands of pages and just figuring out what's there and what is important?FOWLER: So that prep work that I talked about was important because we didn't know what was going to be released, when it was going to be released, how it was going to be released - things like what file format it would be, if there were going to be pictures or PDFs or videos or anything like that. But we did know that there were tens of thousands of other files that had been made public already - court cases, Freedom of Information Act requests from other agencies. There were files on the FBI's vault and Epstein's private files that were turned over to Congress through a subpoena. So those of us that were looking methodically through these pages had a baseline to look at to understand what was already out there, what it looked like, and to be able to determine, is this new? Oh, this is redacted. Oh, that's a copy of the same email chain that we saw 10 pages ago, so move on to the next thing.There was a spreadsheet that we had and a Slack chat of notable pages and mentions and files that were being uncovered so that we could go back and track and document. And so everything that you saw online or heard people talk about on the air about the Epstein files, there was somebody that personally laid eyes on that document and what it said and made sure that it is, in fact, what it said, and here's where you could find it.MCCAMMON: Yeah, I mean, that was one of the challenges, at least that - during that brief time that I was working with some of these files. You know, a lot of it - I mean, this was taken - these were files that the Justice Department had received from all kinds of people in all kinds of places, right? And just even figuring out what's legitimate was tough.FOWLER: Yeah. I - this is where there were a lot of challenges because the files that were released were not in any sort of order, any sort of organization. There was no road map. There was no table of contents. There was no asterisk or disclaimer to say, hey, by the way, we have to release this by law, but it's actually something that's not true, which is actually something we ran into. There were files that were in there that were submitted tips from the public that contained conspiracy theories about Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein and other things that were completely unverifiable and unvetted, but they were part of the case file that were supposed to be released by law, so they were released. So it made it really, really hard to know what exactly we were looking at.Another thing that made it hard to look at, Sarah, was the sheer volume of things that were redacted. I mean, there were pages and pages where all you could see was black boxes. There was no hidden word there or, you know, this part here. There were just complete pages that were just completely blacked out and blank. So it was difficult to glean information from black rectangles.There was, however, an email sent by federal agents after Epstein was arrested in 2019 for allegedly sex trafficking minors. It mentioned 10 possible co-conspirators, including Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. Most of the other names on that list are redacted, and the law made it clear that information like that should be released if it was there. So really, the big story coming out of the Epstein files ended up being all of the information and files and possibilities that were not released.MCCAMMON: Now, it wasn't just the Epstein files. You also got to dig through some files from DOGE, which I think we all still remember was the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. You were really active in sorting through those during the first few months of Trump's second term. And you broke some news. I mean, tell me more about that. How did you go about looking through those DOGE files?FOWLER: Well, it's a lot different looking at federal government data than a bunch of disjointed documents and files from court cases and things. I mean, the federal government - I don't know if people realize this - has one of the richest and most thorough and easily accessible datasets for things you could imagine. Anything you think of that the government does or thinks about, there is probably a dataset probably sitting there waiting for you to download it. The trick is knowing what you're looking at and how it's used.So over the course of last year, I tracked the change in federal spending data, tens of thousands of alterations to federal contracts under DOGE. There was federal leasing statistics, other things like that that I looked at to understand how the government was working or wasn't working and if DOGE was actually doing the things it claimed it was doing. I mean, showing your work looks a lot different, too, because with the Epstein files, you can say, hey, on this page with this file number, this thing was said.With DOGE data, there were so many spreadsheets. I mean, my editors can tell you - spreadsheet on spreadsheet on spreadsheet that had meticulous calculations that came from on-record and background interviews with all these different experts in these areas to make sure that I understood what I was looking at. And did I mention there were spreadsheets? And so it took a lot of effort to be able to show the work and make sure that I knew what I was looking at so then I could tell the audience what we're looking at.I think the biggest example of that was DOGE's infamous wall of receipts. It was the website where DOGE still claims to track how much taxpayer money it saved through its changes. The data DOGE was putting out there didn't match the source data that the federal government put out. There were overstatements and errors and inaccuracies, and that took a lot of time and effort to kind of - to sort of compare these data sources to get to the truth behind things.MCCAMMON: What else has all of this data reporting during this first year of Trump's second term - what has it taught you about how to cover this moment in politics and what it might mean?FOWLER: I think it's even more important to show the work, to bring receipts and to give people those primary sources that I've been using to do this coverage. One, I want people to trust the reporting and trust what I have to say, and they can see for themselves how I got there and also kind of peel back the curtain for the public to learn how to look at this information on their own. And also, numbers are hard to bring to the radio. If you put too many of them out there, people's eyes start to gloss over. If you have too few, you risk kind of underselling your findings and leaving out important context.So spending the last year really grounding a lot of my reporting in this data - even if not every story starts out with a, here's this insert number fact here to use - I mean, it does help contextualize the scope or the scale or significance of what's going on in politics, whether it's the small fraction of Epstein files or the 58th lawmaker retiring or federal spending.MCCAMMON: That's Stephen Fowler, a political reporter with NPR's Washington Desk.

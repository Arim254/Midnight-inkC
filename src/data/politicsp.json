Her comments came in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's renewed call for the strategic, mineral-rich Arctic island to come under U.S. control in the aftermath of the weekend military operation in Venezuela.   \n   The dead-of-night operation by U.S. forces in Caracas to capture leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife early Saturday left the world stunned, and heightened concerns in Denmark and Greenland, which is a semiautonomous territory of the Danish kingdom and thus part of NATO.   Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart, Jens Frederik Nielsen, blasted the president's comments and warned of catastrophic consequences. Numerous European leaders expressed solidarity with them.   \n   \"If the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops,\" Frederiksen told Danish broadcaster TV2 on Monday. \"That is, including our NATO and thus the security that has been provided since the end of the Second World War.\"   20-day timeline deepens fears   Trump called repeatedly during his presidential transition and the early months of his second term for U.S. jurisdiction over Greenland, and has not ruled out military force to take control of the island. His comments Sunday, including telling reporters \"let's talk about Greenland in 20 days,\" further deepened fears that the U.S. was planning an intervention in Greenland in the near future.   Frederiksen also said Trump \"should be taken seriously\" when he says he wants Greenland. \"We will not accept a situation where we and Greenland are threatened in this way,\" she added.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                FILE - In this Aug. 16, 2019, photo, large Icebergs float away as the sun rises near Kulusuk, Greenland.\n                \n                    Felipe Dana/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Felipe Dana/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Nielsen, in a news conference Monday, said Greenland cannot be compared to Venezuela. He urged his constituents to stay calm and united.   \"We are not in a situation where we think that there might be a takeover of the country overnight and that is why we are insisting that we want good cooperation,\" he said.   Nielsen added: \"The situation is not such that the United States can simply conquer Greenland.\"   \n   Ask Rostrup, a TV2 political journalist, wrote on the station's live blog Monday that Mette previously would have flatly rejected the idea of an American takeover of Greenland. But now, Rostrup wrote, the rhetoric has escalated so much that she has to acknowledge the possibility.   Trump slams Denmark's security efforts in Greenland   Trump on Sunday also mocked Denmark's efforts at boosting Greenland's national security posture, saying the Danes have added \"one more dog sled\" to the Arctic territory's arsenal.   \"It's so strategic right now,\" Trump had told reporters Sunday as he flew back to Washington from his home in Florida. \"Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place.\"   \n   He added: \"We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.\"   But Ulrik Pram Gad, a global security expert from the Danish Institute for International Studies, wrote in a report last year that \"there are indeed Russian and Chinese ships in the Arctic, but these vessels are too far away to see from Greenland with or without binoculars.\"   U.S. space base in northwestern Greenland   Greenlanders and Danes were further rankled this weekend by a social media post following the raid by a former Trump administration official turned podcaster, Katie Miller. The post shows an illustrated map of Greenland in the colors of the Stars and Stripes accompanied by the caption: \"SOON.\"   \"And yes, we expect full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,\" Ambassador Jesper Møller Sørensen, Denmark's chief envoy to Washington, said in a post responding to Miller, who is married to Trump's influential deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller.   The U.S. Department of Defense operates the remote Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland. It was built following a 1951 defense agreement between Denmark and the United States. It supports missile warning, missile defense and space surveillance operations for the U.S. and NATO.   On Denmark's mainland, the partnership between the U.S. and Denmark has been long-lasting. The Danes buy American F-35 fighter jets and just last year, Denmark's parliament approved a bill to allow U.S. military bases on Danish soil.   Critics say the vote ceded Danish sovereignty to the U.S. The legislation widens a previous military agreement, made in 2023 with the Biden administration, where U.S. troops had broad access to Danish air bases in the Scandinavian country.\n",

Dan Caine.   In an interview with Morning Edition, Smith said Congressional leaders learned more about how the operation was carried out, but that the bulk of the briefing focused on the long-term strategy for Venezuela.   \"There was a lot of talk about avoiding chaos now that Maduro is gone, vague talk about how the administration is working with the now-president of Venezuela [Delcy] Rodriguez, but not any specifics,\" Smith said.   \n   He added that the economic chaos facing Venezuela \"runs the risk of it turning into armed gangs fighting with each other in a chaotic situation. It certainly doesn't improve the very problems that supposedly taking Maduro was supposed to fix.\"   Speaking to NPR's Leila Fadel, Smith discussed the legality of the operation to remove Maduro from Venezuela and concerns about ongoing U.S. involvement in the South American country.

The move comes less than a week after HHS confirmed it was freezing all federal funding through that same program.   The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) sends money to states, tribes and territories to help make child care more affordable for low-income families.   The Biden administration's rules encouraged states to base payments to child care providers on enrollment rather than verified attendance, pay providers in advance of services and favor guaranteed slots with providers over vouchers.   \n   Now, HHS says it plans to restore attendance-based billing, it will no longer require that providers be paid in advance and it will reprioritize vouchers.   \"When controls are not in place, bad actors can bill for children who aren't there,\" said Alex Adams, assistant secretary for family support at HHS's Administration for Children and Families. \"Families and taxpayers deserve proof that services are being delivered to children.\"   But child care advocates told NPR that states already have many controls in place to prevent fraud.   \"What we know to be true is that there are longstanding program integrity requirements that have been in place and are regularly updated, annually updated,\" said Susan Gale Perry, CEO of Child Care Aware of America, which helps families access affordable child care across the country.   Approximately 1.4 million children and 857,700 families per month received child care assistance through CCDF in 2019, according to the latest data posted on the HHS website.   Melissa Boteach, chief policy officer at Zero to Three, a nonprofit that advocates for infants, toddlers and families, said the proposed policy changes introduce \"chaos and confusion\" by rolling back provisions that aimed to make the child care industry more stable and affordable.   This follows a funding freeze announced over the holidays   Monday's announcement comes days after HHS said it was freezing the federal funding provided through CCDF.   \n   HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon told NPR on Wednesday that the agency was freezing CCDF funds effective immediately, and said the agency would unfreeze funding after individual states provided certain \"administrative data.\"   \"It's still unclear to many states who have to administer these programs what exactly this means.\" Boteach said. \"And that lack of clarity has real consequences for families and for early educators.\"   She also said there has \"not been clarity provided on whether or not funding is forthcoming, on what needs to be done for it to turn back on and what states are supposed to do in the meantime.\"   HHS has not yet responded to NPR's request for clarity on how Monday's announcement relates to the funding freeze.   \"What we do know is that child care providers operate on [a] very thin … margin of profit,\" said Perry of Child Care Aware of America.   She said going \"even a month\" without funding could result in child care centers closing – which would impact both children who benefit from CCDF funding and those who do not.   A focus on child care providers in Minnesota   The recent focus on federal child care funding comes in response to allegations of fraud by Minnesota day care providers.   \n   As NPR has reported, the day after Christmas, Nick Shirley, a right-wing social media influencer, posted a video in which he claimed to show Somali-American-run day care centers cheating the federal government out of millions of dollars. The video doesn't offer clear proof, but it went viral.   On Dec. 30, HHS Deputy Secretary Jim O'Neill posted on X about \"the serious allegations that the state of Minnesota has funneled millions of taxpayer dollars to fraudulent daycares across Minnesota over the past decade.\" He announced actions \"against the blatant fraud that appears to be rampant in Minnesota and across the country,\" including requiring \"a justification and a receipt or photo evidence before we send money to a state.\"   \n   In Monday's HHS announcement, O'Neill said, \"The reforms we are enacting will make fraud harder to perpetrate.\"   According to HHS, the rule changes are subject to a 30-day public comment period.\n",

Fallon/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The Pentagon is mounting a six-month review of women in ground combat jobs, to ensure what it calls the military \"effectiveness\" of having several thousand female soldiers and Marines in infantry, armor and artillery, according to a memo obtained by NPR.   Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel Anthony Tata wrote in a memo last month that the effort is to determine the \"operational effectiveness of ground combat units 10 years after the Department lifted all remaining restrictions on women serving in combat roles.\"   Tata requested Army and Marine leaders to provide data on the readiness, training, performance, casualties and command climate of ground combat units and personnel. The services are to provide points of contact no later than Jan. 15 to the Institute for Defense Analyses, a nonprofit corporation that assists the government on national security issues. The memo says the data should include \"all available metrics describing that individual's readiness and ability to deploy (including physical, medical, and other measures of ability to deploy.)\"   \n   Moreover, the seven-page memo calls for any internal research and studies — not publicly available — on \"the integration of women in combat.\"   \"We should not have women in combat roles\"   Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson wrote in an email to NPR that the study is to \"ensure standards are met and the United States maintains the most lethal military. Our standards for combat arms positions will be elite uniform, and sex neutral because the weight of a rucksack or a human being doesn't care if you're a man or a woman. Under (Defense) Secretary (Pete) Hegseth, the Department of War's [sic] will not compromise standards to satisfy quotas or an ideological agenda—this is common sense.\"   Hegseth, an Army National Guard veteran with tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, opposed women in ground combat units while he was a Fox News host and author. \"I'm straight up saying we should not have women in combat roles. It hasn't made us more effective. Hasn't made us more lethal. Has made fighting more complicated,\" he said in a November 2024 podcast hosted by Shawn Ryan. But during his confirmation hearing last year he softened his stance, saying women can serve in combat roles as long as they meet the same standards as men.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Pete Hegseth speaks to senior military leaders at Marine Corps Base Quantico on Sept. 30, 2025 in Quantico, Va. In his remarks, Hegseth told admirals and generals that women must meet the \"highest male standard.\"\n                \n                    Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   During a September address to admirals and generals at Marine Base Quantico in Virginia, Hegseth announced that women must meet the \"highest male standard.\"   \n   \"Any place where tried and true physical standards were altered, especially since 2015, when combat standards were changed to ensure females could qualify, must be returned to their original standard.\" But he did not say he was barring women from ground combat roles.   \"When it comes to any job that requires physical power to perform in combat, those physical standards must be high and gender neutral,\" Hegseth said. \"If women can make it, excellent. If not, it is what it is. If that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, so be it. That is not the intent, but it could be the result.\"   Women currently in ground combat units   Of all soldiers serving in combat units in the Army, women make up a small fraction: a total of some 3,800 women serve in infantry, armor and artillery. Among them are more than 150 women who completed the arduous Ranger training. A small number of women — around 10 or so — passed Green Beret training. The Marines have about 700 females in these ground combat jobs. And in all these jobs, women must meet the same standards as their male counterparts.   Ellen Haring, a senior research fellow at Women in International Security, is a West Point graduate and retired Army colonel with 30 years in uniform, dismissed the Pentagon review as a way to exclude women from ground combat.   \"It's exactly what [Hegseth] said all along,\" she said. \"He's against women in combat and he's going to get them out. It's going to be an effort to prove women don't belong.\"   Meanwhile, Khris Fuhr, also a West Point graduate who worked on gender integration for the Army Forces Command at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, said an Army study between 2018 to 2023 found that women performed well in ground combat units, and in some cases had higher scores than male soldiers. She called the upcoming Pentagon study, \"a solution for a problem that doesn't exist.\"   \n   Then Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced at a Pentagon press conference in 2015 that women would be admitted to all ground combat positions, saying it made no sense to exclude half the population from serving in those jobs.   \"As long as they qualify and meet the standards,\" Carter said, \"Women will now be able to contribute to our mission in ways they could not before.\"   But the decision was a controversial one, especially among the Marine Corps. Then Joint Chiefs Chairman, General Joe Dunford, didn't attend the press conference and instead put out a statement saying \"my responsibility is to ensure his decision is properly implemented.\"   Marines privately bristled at the announcement. They conducted a training exercise in the Mojave desert in 2015 that found gender-integrated units were slower, less lethal and more prone to injury than all-male units. Marine officers also said accepting women would lead to greater risk, meaning more Marine combat casualties. Carter said he saw it differently.   While the Marine exercise found that teams that included women were overall less effective, Defense Secretary Carter pointed out that the study failed to focus on individual achievement. Advocates of women in combat say the exercise failed to consider high-achieving women in those combat roles.\n",

Trump returned to Washington from his winter break at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., one day after U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife in a raid on his compound in Caracas.\n                \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   President Trump is set to meet with House Republicans at the Kennedy Center on Tuesday as lawmakers in both chambers are calling for more details on the weekend operation in Venezuela and the U.S. role there moving forward.   \n   The gathering in Washington, D.C., comes a day after top administration officials briefed Capitol Hill leaders for several hours behind closed doors, leaving a largely partisan divide on the military operation that led to the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.   The Monday briefing was the first opportunity for top party leaders, along with members from key committees in Congress, to question administration officials about a mission for which they were given no advance warning.   \n   Following the briefing, Republicans said the president was well within his powers to order the mission without congressional input.   \"We are not at war. We do not have U.S. armed forces in Venezuela, and we are not occupying that country,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said after the briefing. \"The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war — that is true — but it also vests the president of the United States with vast authorities as commander in chief.\"   \n   The Monday briefing was led by key members of the president's foreign policy team, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine.   It was attended by the Gang of Eight, made up of the House and Senate leaders from both parties and the top Republican and top Democrat serving on each chamber's intelligence committees. Joining them were bipartisan leaders from the foreign affairs, foreign relations and armed services committees.   The Tuesday gathering at the Kennedy Center will be an opportunity for Trump to address members of his party as they are gearing up for a fight to maintain control over the House in the midterm elections. In the past, his addresses to these gatherings have focused on broader topics and rallying together as a party.   \n   Speaker Johnson said the administration scheduled a separate briefing on Venezuela for all members of Congress on Wednesday, where it is expected that more details will be shared about next steps in the region.   A partisan divide persists over Trump's handling of Venezuela   Following the meeting, Johnson told reporters that the operation in Venezuela was not \"a regime change,\" but rather \"a demand for change in behavior by a regime.\" And while  Trump said over the weekend that the U.S. will run Venezuela until a \"proper transition can take place,\" Johnson told reporters, \"we don't expect troops on the ground\" or direct involvement in Venezuela \"in any other way\" beyond coercing reforms from the interim government now in place.   Other lawmakers leaving the briefing said they did not yet have clarity on whether there would be more U.S. involvement in Venezuela.   \n   Republicans' solidarity with the president and his top officials signaled that Trump continues to draw fierce loyalty from the vast majority of his party in Congress. However, Democrats said the operation illustrated a dangerous expansion of Trump's executive powers and risked plunging the U.S. into the very same kind of ongoing conflict that Trump campaigned on avoiding.   \"It seems at every turn, Donald Trump is trying to figure out how he avoids Congress,\" said Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y. \"And unfortunately, Congress allows him to do it.\"   Meeks, the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, voiced a concern that Democrats have raised throughout the last year — that Congress is abdicating its constitutional authority in deference to the White House.   Johnson addressed that criticism.   \"Look, I can tell you, as speaker of the House, as the person who's in charge of defending Article I powers, I'm just going to insist to you that those have not been traversed in any way by what happened here,\" he told reporters.   \n   Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., warned of troubles that could lie ahead, arguing the briefing left more questions than answers.   \"Their plan for the U.S. running Venezuela is vague, based on wishful thinking and unsatisfying,\" Schumer said. \"I did not receive any assurances that we would not try to do the same thing in other countries.\"   This marked the first of what will likely be several more briefings for lawmakers about the events that unfolded in Venezuela and next steps.\n",

It's not on display at the Capitol, as is required by law. Its whereabouts aren't publicly known, though it's believed to be in storage.   \n   House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has yet to formally unveil the plaque. And the Trump administration's Department of Justice is seeking to dismiss a police officers' lawsuit asking that it be displayed as intended. The Architect of the Capitol, which was responsible for obtaining and displaying the plaque, said in light of the federal litigation, it cannot comment.   Determined to preserve the nation's history, some 100 members of Congress, mostly Democrats, have taken it upon themselves to memorialize the moment. For months, they've mounted poster board-style replicas of the Jan. 6 plaque outside their office doors, resulting in a Capitol complex awash with makeshift remembrances.   \n   \"On behalf of a grateful Congress, this plaque honors the extraordinary individuals who bravely protected and defended this symbol of democracy on Jan. 6, 2021,\" reads the faux bronze stand-in for the real thing. \"Their heroism will never be forgotten.\"   Jan. 6 void in the Capitol   In Washington, a capital city lined with monuments to the nation's history, the plaque was intended to become a simple but permanent marker, situated near the Capitol's west front, where some of the most violent fighting took place as rioters breached the building.   But in its absence, the missing plaque makes way for something else entirely — a culture of forgetting.   Visitors can pass through the Capitol without any formal reminder of what happened that day, when a mob of President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the building trying to overturn the Republican's 2020 reelection defeat to Democrat Joe Biden. With memory left unchecked, it allows new narratives to swirl and revised histories to take hold.   Five years ago, the jarring scene watched the world over was declared an \"insurrection\" by the then-GOP leader of the Senate, while the House GOP leader at the time called it his \"saddest day\" in Congress. But those condemnations have faded.   Trump calls it a \"day of love.\" And Johnson, who was among those lawmakers challenging the 2020 election results, is now the House speaker.   \n   \"The question of January 6 remains – democracy was on the guillotine — how important is that event in the overall sweep of 21st century U.S. history,\" said Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University and noted scholar.   \"Will January 6 be seen as the seminal moment when democracy was in peril?\" he asked. Or will it be remembered as \"kind of a weird one-off?\"   \"There's not as much consensus on that as one would have thought on the fifth anniversary,\" he said.   Memories shift, but violent legacy lingers   At least five people died in the riot and its aftermath, including Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot by police while trying to climb through a window toward the House chamber. More than 140 law enforcement officers were wounded, some gravely, and several died later, some by suicide.   All told, some 1,500 people were charged in the Capitol attack, among the largest federal prosecutions in the nation's history. When Trump returned to power in January 2025, he pardoned all of them within hours of taking office.   Unlike the twin light beams that commemorated the Sept. 11, 2001, attack or the stand-alone chairs at the Oklahoma City bombing site memorial, the failure to recognize Jan. 6 has left a gap not only in memory but in helping to stitch the country back together.   \"That's why you put up a plaque,\" said Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Pa. \"You respect the memory and the service of the people involved.\"   Police sue over Jan. 6 plaque, DOJ seeks to dismiss   The speaker's office said in a statement late Monday the statute authorizing the plaque is \"not implementable\" and proposed alternatives also \"do not comply.\" Johnson's spokesman said if Democrats are serious about commemorating the police, they're free to work with the appropriate committees to develop a framework for proper vetting and consideration.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A replica plaque commemorating the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot hangs outside the office of Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Tuesday, Dec. 30, 2025, at the Longworth House Office Building on Capitol Hill in Washington.\n                \n                    Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Lawmakers approved the plaque in March 2022 as part of a broader government funding package. The resolution said the U.S. \"owes its deepest gratitude to those officers,\" and it set out instructions for an honorific plaque listing the names of officers \"who responded to the violence that occurred.\" It gave a one-year deadline for installation at the Capitol.   \n   This summer, two officers who fought the mob that day sued over the delay.   \"By refusing to follow the law and honor officers as it is required to do, Congress encourages this rewriting of history,\" said the claim by officers Harry Dunn and Daniel Hodges. \"It suggests that the officers are not worthy of being recognized, because Congress refuses to recognize them.\"   The Justice Department is seeking to have the case dismissed. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro and others argued Congress \"already has publicly recognized the service of law enforcement personnel\" by approving the plaque and displaying it wouldn't alleviate the problems they claim to face from their work.   \"It is implausible,\" the Justice Department attorneys wrote, to suggest installation of the plaque \"would stop the alleged death threats they claim to have been receiving.\"   The department also said the plaque is required to include the names of \"all law enforcement officers\" involved in the response that day — some 3,600 people.   Makeshift memorials emerge   Lawmakers who've installed replicas of the plaque outside their offices said it's important for the public to know what happened.   \"There are new generations of people who are just growing up now who don't understand how close we came to losing our democracy on Jan 6, 2021,\" said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a member of the Jan. 6 committee, which was opposed by GOP leadership but nevertheless issued a nearly 1,000-page report investigating the run-up to the attack and the attempt to overturn the 2020 election.   Raskin envisions the Capitol one day holding tours around what happened. \"People need to study that as an essential part of American history,\" he said.   \"Think about the dates in American history that we know only by the dates: There's the 4th of July. There's December 7th. There's 9/11. And there's January 6th,\" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-calif., who also served on the committee and has a plaque outside her office.   \n   \"They really saved my life, and they saved the democracy and they deserve to be thanked for it,\" she said.   But as time passes, there are no longer bipartisan memorial services for Jan. 6. On Tuesday, the Democrats will reconvene members from the Jan. 6 committee for a hearing to \"examine ongoing threats to free and fair elections,\" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York announced. It's unlikely Republicans will participate.   The Republicans under Johnson have tapped Rep. Barry Loudermilk of Georgia to stand up their own special committee to uncover what the speaker calls the \"full truth\" of what happened. They're planning a hearing this month.   \"We should stop this silliness of trying to whitewash history -- it's not going to happen,\" said Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., who helped lead the effort to display the replica plaques.   \"I was here that day so I'll never forget,\" he said. \"I think that Americans will not forget what happened.\"   The number of makeshift plaques that fill the halls is a testimony to that remembrance, he said.   Instead of one plaque, he said, they've \"now got 100.\"\n",

The U.S. has built up the largest military presence in the region in decades and launched a series of deadly strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean. The campaign is facing growing scrutiny from Congress.   \"We've just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela, a large tanker, very large, largest one ever seized, actually,\" Trump told reporters at the White House, later adding that \"it was seized for a very good reason.\"   \n   Trump did not offer additional details. When asked what would happen to the oil aboard the tanker, Trump said, \"Well, we keep it, I guess.\"   The seizure was led by the U.S. Coast Guard and supported by the Navy, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official added that it was conducted under U.S. law enforcement authority.   Storming the oil tanker   The Coast Guard members were taken to the oil tanker by helicopter from the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, the official said. The Ford is in the Caribbean Sea after arriving last month in a major show of force, joining a fleet of other warships.   \n   Video posted to social media by Attorney General Pam Bondi shows people fast-roping from one of the helicopters involved in the operation as it hovers just feet from the deck.   The Coast Guard members can be seen later in the video moving throughout the superstructure of the ship with their weapons drawn.   Bondi wrote that \"for multiple years, the oil tanker has been sanctioned by the United States due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations.\"   \n   Venezuela's government said in a statement that the seizure \"constitutes a blatant theft and an act of international piracy.\"   \"Under these circumstances, the true reasons for the prolonged aggression against Venezuela have finally been revealed. … It has always been about our natural resources, our oil, our energy, the resources that belong exclusively to the Venezuelan people,\" the statement said.   Half of ship's oil is tied to Cuban importer   The U.S. official identified the seized tanker as the Skipper.   The ship departed Venezuela around Dec. 2 with about 2 million barrels of heavy crude, roughly half of it belonging to a Cuban state-run oil importer, according to documents from the state-owned company Petróleos de Venezuela S.A., commonly known as PDVSA, that were provided on the condition of anonymity because the person did not have permission to share them.   The Skipper was previously known as the M/T Adisa, according to ship tracking data. The Adisa was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2022 over accusations of belonging to a sophisticated network of shadow tankers that smuggled crude oil on behalf of Iran's Revolutionary Guard and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.   The network was reportedly run by a Switzerland-based Ukrainian oil trader, the U.S. Treasury Department said at the time.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                This image from video posted on Attorney General Pam Bondi's X account, and partially redacted by the source, shows an oil tanker being seized by U.S. forces off the coast of Venezuela, Wednesday, Dec. 10, 2025.\n                \n                    AP/Pentagon\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        AP/Pentagon\n    \n\n   \n   Hitting Venezuela's sanctioned oil business   Venezuela has the world's largest proven oil reserves and produces about 1 million barrels a day.   PDVSA is the backbone of the country's economy. Its reliance on intermediaries increased in 2020, when the first Trump administration expanded its maximum-pressure campaign on Venezuela with sanctions that threaten to lock out of the U.S. economy any individual or company that does business with Maduro's government. Longtime allies Russia and Iran, both also sanctioned, have helped Venezuela skirt restrictions.   The transactions usually involve a complex network of shadowy intermediaries. Many are shell companies, registered in jurisdictions known for secrecy. The buyers deploy so-called ghost tankers that hide their location and hand off their valuable cargoes in the middle of the ocean before they reach their final destination.   \n   Maduro did not address the seizure during a speech before a ruling-party organized demonstration in Caracas, Venezuela's capital. But he told supporters that the country is \"prepared to break the teeth of the North American empire if necessary.\"   Maduro has insisted the real purpose of the U.S. military operations is to force him from office.   Democrat says the move is about 'regime change'   Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the U.S. seizing the oil tanker cast doubt on the administration's stated reasons for the military buildup and boat strikes.   \"This shows that their whole cover story — that this is about interdicting drugs — is a big lie,\" the senator said. \"This is just one more piece of evidence that this is really about regime change — by force.\"   Vincent P. O'Hara, a naval historian and author of \"The Greatest Naval War Ever Fought,\" called the seizure \"very unusual\" and \"provocative.\" Noting that the action will probably deter other ships from the Venezuela coastline, he said, \"If you have no maritime traffic or access to that, then you have no economy.\"   \n   The seizure comes a day after the U.S. military flew a pair of fighter jets over the Gulf of Venezuela in what appeared to be the closest that warplanes had come to the South American country's airspace. Trump has said land attacks are coming soon but has not offered more details.   The Trump administration is facing increasing scrutiny from lawmakers over the boat strike campaign, which has killed at least 87 people in 22 known strikes since early September, including a follow-up strike that killed two survivors clinging to the wreckage of a boat after the first hit.   Some legal experts and Democrats say that action may have violated the laws governing the use of deadly military force.   \n   Lawmakers are demanding to get unedited video from the strikes, but Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told congressional leaders at a classified briefing Tuesday that he was still weighing whether to release it.   The Coast Guard referred a request for comment about the tanker seizure to the White House.\n",

In an interview with Morning Edition, Warren said the deals raise serious concerns about antitrust and would reduce competition for viewers and workers.   Warner Brothers agreed to an $83 billion sale to Netflix, but that deal is not finalized. And now Paramount Skydance — owned by Larry Ellison, one of the world's richest people, and his son David Ellison, founder of Skydance Media — is pursuing the company through a hostile takeover.   Warren said Paramount Skydance's effort raises added concerns, given the Ellisons' ties to President Trump and foreign investors.   She warned the deal could leave \"one person who basically decides what movies are going to be made, what you're going to get to see on your streaming service, and how much you're going to have to pay for it.\" Warren also raised questions about whether news could be \"controlled by a political ally of the President.\"   \n   Listen to the full interview by clicking play on the blue box above.

In a trade-off to reopen the government following the longest shutdown in U.S. history, Senate Republicans promised Democrats a vote on a bill of their choosing to extend the subsidies. Democrats are seeking a three-year extension of the subsidies, warning that without one health care premiums are predicted to skyrocket at the start of the 2026.   While both parties agree on the need to address healthcare costs, the Democratic proposal doesn't have enough GOP support to pass. Republicans have argued that extending the subsidies would allow what they describe as Obamacare \"waste, fraud and abuse\" to continue, while lining the pockets of insurance companies.   \n   \"There is nothing in their [Democrats] bill that stops billions of dollars in fraudulent spending,\" Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said on the Senate floor Wednesday.   Republicans are countering with a plan by Cassidy and Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, that would provide up to $1,500 a year in payments for health savings accounts for Americans earning less than 700 percent of the federal poverty level.   However the bill does not extend the ACA tax credits and the money could not be used to pay for health care premiums. Deductibles for those plans average around $7,000, according to data from the health policy organization KFF.   \"It delivers the benefit directly to the patient, not to the insurance company, and it does it in a way that actually saves money to the taxpayer,\" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.   Democrats rejected the GOP proposal on Wednesday and called it dead on arrival. They criticized the plan for limiting coverage to plans on the ACA marketplace that provide less coverage. Funds could also not be put towards abortion services or gender reassignment.   \"The Crapo-Cassidy bill would not extend the ACA tax credits for a single day. That's what's driving the price up, and they're doing nothing about it,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, said during a press conference Tuesday.   \n   Democrats also pushed back on the GOP timeline, as Republicans have spent weeks debating an alternative health care bill and only unveiled their proposal on Tuesday.   Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., criticized the GOP for waiting to unveil a health care plan. Speaking from the Senate floor on Wednesday, Reed said time was of the essence as 24 million Americans face losing their subsidies at year's end. He argued that instead of waiting until the eleventh hour to unveil a health care plan, the GOP can approve an extension now and deal with changes to the substitutes later.   \"There is no time to implement it,\" Reed said of the Republican plan. \"The solution is simple: extend the Affordable Healthcare tax credits.\"   While Schumer said all Senate Democrats are unified behind their vote to prolong the ACA subsidies, Thune was unsure if every Republican would back  the measure from Cassidy and Crapo.\n",

Then-candidate Donald Trump seized on the moment and vowed to lower prices for American consumers, beating his eventual Democratic rival Kamala Harris in part with a winning economic message.   Now it's President Trump who's trying to persuade the public that the state of the economy is sound, after prices rose 3% in the 12 months ending in September and with consumers spending less on big-ticket items.    Betsey Stevenson, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan, says making that argument could be a tall order in the face of rising costs for a number of goods and services.   \n   \"My personal takeaway from the experience we had [in 2024] was that you can't tell people that prices aren't up when they're up,\" she said.   \n   While the prices of some items such as gasoline have fallen on Trump's watch, the overall cost of living has continued to climb. For example, grocery costs are up 2.7% for the year ending in September and electricity costs have jumped more than 5%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.   \"Trump's claims about inflation are false,\" Stevenson said, \"and you can go to the grocery store and see it yourself.\"   But, in a wide-ranging speech to supporters on Tuesday, Trump both defended his administration's track record on the economy and said that talk of affordability was overblown. Trump told the crowd in Mount Pocono, Pa., that he believed the term \"affordability\" was a \"hoax\" perpetrated by Democrats. Trump's recent assertions dismissing inflation are not backed by official government economic data.   Consumers are feeling high prices firsthand   While it's true that inflation hit a 9% high during the summer of 2022 under the Biden administration, that was during the pandemic and it dropped significantly after that. Inflation dipped to an annual rate of 3% in January during Biden's final month in office, the same rate it was in September under Trump.   \n   Now many voters are questioning how well Trump is tackling the stubbornly high costs of everyday items. Some 57% of voters said in a Harvard CAPS/Harris poll released this week that Trump was \"losing the battle against inflation,\" while 68% of respondents to a AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll from October said the economy was poor or very poor.   Voters' souring attitudes on the Trump administration's handling of the economy come less than a year before the U.S. midterm elections, in which Republicans will aim to maintain their majorities in both houses of Congress. But in a warning sign for the GOP, November's odd-year races saw Democrats who campaigned on affordability win major contests in New York City, Virginia and New Jersey.   Political consultant and pollster Frank Luntz says Trump risks appearing out of touch if he continues to claim that affordability is a \"hoax\" when Americans feel like they're paying more — and actually do pay more.   \"When you talk about affordability, it is all perception,\" Luntz told NPR's Morning Edition. \"The greatest danger is if you tell people happy days are here again, and it's 1929,\" he added, referencing the beginning of the Great Depression.   \n   Luntz added that Trump blaming Biden for the failures of the economy may have worked during the campaign season and even for some time after.   \"That said, it's now a year since the election, and the public does expect this administration to take charge. At a certain point, they will not accept the blame game,\" he said.   Trump's tariffs are contributing to inflation   But getting inflation to slow down or prices to drop will be easier said than done for the Trump administration, which has embraced economic policies such as tariffs that force prices upward, according to Stevenson. Trump and other administration officials have argued that tariffs are necessary to correct past global trade policies that have been unfair to the U.S. and to bring back domestic manufacturing.   \n   Although tariffs are raising about $30 billion per month in revenue for U.S. coffers, the new import taxes levied by the Trump administration have increased prices on a number of items, from food to clothing to furniture.   \n   \"What I find surprising is that he's out there telling people: 'This isn't happening. This is a con job. There's no affordability problem,'\" Stevenson said. \"At the same time, he's pursuing policies that are purposefully restricting supply, which every person who has taken even an introductory economics course knows will push up prices.\"   Still, the administration has taken several steps recently to ease the negative effects of tariffs on U.S. consumers and producers. Last month, Trump scrapped the tariffs on certain products that aren't widely produced in the U.S., such as bananas and coffee. And on Monday the administration announced that it was making $12 billion in one-time payments to U.S. farmers to offset their rising business costs.\n",

Gen Z and millennial Americans are a growing portion of the electorate, estimated to make up roughly half of all eligible voters by 2026. However, these same voters are also feeling increasingly unhappy with the political system that they're poised to dominate in the coming years, notably as they struggle with the high cost of living.   That's reflected in a new poll from the University of Chicago, which shows that nearly 60% disapprove of President Trump's job in office, while just 30% approve, a six-point drop compared to his favorability rating in the survey last year.   \n   The University of Chicago's GenForward survey, first obtained by NPR, also paints a sobering picture for both parties ahead of the midterms. Support for Democrats has dropped substantially since last year, with the latest survey finding that roughly six in 10 young people now have unfavorable impressions of both parties.   \n   University of Chicago professor Cathy Cohen is the founder and director of the GenForward Survey. She argues that the political dissatisfaction young people are feeling is directly tied to their deeply rooted concerns about the economy.   \"There is a real sense that these individuals and these parts of the administration are not delivering,\" explained Cohen. \"Young people are feeling like the state or the government is not, in fact, providing the opportunities that they're seeking to advance their lives.\"   The latest GenForward survey — conducted Oct. 24 through Nov. 10 — draws on 5,390 interviews with white, Black, Latino, and Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Americans between the ages of 18 and 42.   \n   Respondents were most likely to prioritize issues concerning affordability as the most important challenges facing the country today. Nearly nine in 10 were concerned about the price of food and the cost of healthcare. Roughly a quarter reported feeling extremely or very worried about being able to pay their mortgage or rent, while about a third believe they will be worse off financially than their parents.   That collective financial worry isn't new — especially as home and rental prices have climbed at a faster pace than wages for roughly 20 years, and Gen Z and millennials report higher rates of student loan debt and more mortgage debt.   \n   The economy has long defined elections, and 2024 was no exception. Many young Americans cast their ballots in the presidential race for Trump on account of his pledge to address inflation, helping him narrow Democrats' typical advantage among millennial and Gen Z voters.   The early outlook for 2026   Heading into 2026, the GenForward survey gives Democrats an early leg up. When respondents were asked who they would choose on a generic congressional ballot between Democrats and Republicans, Democrats lead by 15 points. However, roughly 3 in 10 either rejected both options or vowed to choose a third-party instead.   That call for political variety is loud — more than 80% of young Americans said they agreed with the statement that Democrats and Republicans \"do such a poor job representing the American people that voters need more political party choices.\"   \n   The findings comes at a time when many Gen Z and millennial Americans already distrust American institutions and their ability to make change — a point reflected in the poll, as nearly 70% say they have little to no trust in the Trump administration or Congress.   However, to Cohen, that distrust connects back to how young Americans are feeling about their economic opportunities. She points out that when asked about factors needed to make democracy work well in the U.S., 33% chose housing and food affordability, the top selection after the need for free and fair elections at 41%.   \"These young people are saying that without the ability to have full lives, they can't be full citizens,\" she said. \"They're rejecting this idea that we should kind of separate or bifurcate discussions of democracy from discussions of affordability.\"\n",

This is shameful.\"   Homendy said the NTSB \"vehemently\" opposes a section in the massive National Defense Authorization Act that would roll back safety improvements that were recommended by the agency after the collision of a military Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines regional jet near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, killing 67 people.   After the crash, the Defense Department agreed to require military aircraft to broadcast their position using a technology known as ADS-B. But the NTSB warns the bill's language would create exemptions to the policy — in effect, recreating conditions that were in place at the time of the DCA collision, which was the nation's deadliest aviation disaster in more than 20 years.   \n   \"We should be working together in partnership to prevent the next accident, not inviting history to repeat itself by recreating the same conditions that were in place on January 29th,\" Homendy said.   Homendy laid out the NTSB's concerns in a letter to the chairman and ranking member of both the House Armed Services Committees and the Senate Committee on Armed Services. She said no legislators had approached her during the drafting of the NDAA, and she did not know who added the provision in question.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A crane removes airplane wreckage from the Potomac River, where American Airlines flight 5342 collided with a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter, near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Va., on February 3, 2025. All 67 people on both aircraft died.\n                \n                    Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   In a statement, the committee leaders defended the language in the bill.    \"We all care deeply about and are fully committed to ensuring aviation safety,\" said U.S. Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Ranking Member Jack Reed (D-RI), House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-AL) and Ranking Member Adam Smith (D-Wash.) in the statement.    \n   They say the bill would require any helicopter conducting training missions around Washington, D.C. would have to provide warning of its position to aircraft in the area (though it does not specifically require the use of ADS-B), and that the Secretary of a military department would need to receive concurrence from the Secretary of Transportation prior to waiving this requirement.   Still, some lawmakers on Capitol Hill share the NTSB's concerns.   \"As drafted, the NDAA protects the status quo, allowing military aircraft to keep flying in DC airspace under different rules and with outdated transmission requirements,\" said a joint statement from Senators Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), the leaders of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. \"This comes as Pentagon data shows a spike in military aircraft accidents since 2020. The families of the victims deserve accountability.\"   \n   The senators urged their colleagues in Congress to instead adopt the bipartisan ROTOR Act, which would require aircraft operators to equip their fleets with ADS-B technology and limit exemptions for military helicopters.   Family members of the victims of American Airlines Flight 5342 also expressed concern about the language in the NDAA.   \"The flying public and all those that utilize our airspace deserve better than what this bill provides,\" said Tim and Sheri Lilley, whose son, Sam, was the first officer of Flight 5342, in a statement. \"Congress now has a choice: strengthen this provision and protect the traveling public or leave in place the same vulnerabilities that have already cost too many people their lives.\"\n",

Today's top stories   The Senate is set to vote today on two health policy plans — one from Democrats and one from Republicans — aimed at reducing costs for individuals purchasing health insurance on Healthcare.gov. Meanwhile, some House Republicans want to force a vote to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act, which are set to expire in less than three weeks. They warn that Republican leaders risk losing voters and the majority if they let the subsidies expire without a replacement.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The dome of the U.S. Capitol Building is visible on the Hill in Washington, DC.\n                \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Win McNamee/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Republicans hold a small Senate majority, and because the bills need 60 votes to pass, NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin tells Up First that neither option will likely move forward. This is unwelcome news for people who are currently navigating open enrollment and are hoping for some relief. Simmons-Duffin spoke with Ellen Allen of Charleston, W.Va., yesterday, who said she enrolled in a bronze plan without vision and dental coverage. This plan costs Allen a monthly premium of $1,967.50, which is four times this year's cost for a plan that covers less. Polling suggests that the enhanced subsidies are quite popular across party lines, according to Simmons-Duffin. She predicts it's unlikely the votes will be the end of the story, and that Congress may continue to work toward a solution.   \n   The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point yesterday in a 9-3 vote. The Fed made its decision in an effort to support the weakening job market. Stubborn inflation and delayed economic data complicated the decision-making process. The rate cut came as a relief to investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped nearly 500 points.    🎧 Fed policymakers say in updated forecasts that they expect to cut interest rates just once more in 2026. Inflation has come down significantly, but it still remains above the Fed's 2% target, according to NPR's Scott Horsley. The president's tariffs have pushed up the price of imported goods. Although Fed officials don't believe tariffs will have a long-lasting effect on inflation, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell says they are not taking any chances. Powell says the best way to help with affordability is not only to get inflation down but also to ensure a robust job market.   President Trump said yesterday that U.S. forces seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela. Attorney General Pam Bondi released a video showing what appear to be U.S. forces and the Coast Guard rappelling from a helicopter onto the tanker. Congress is demanding answers about U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats, particularly in regards to a Sept. 2 incident where the military killed two men who survived initial strikes. Adm. Alvin Holsey, who oversaw the strikes, is stepping down this week.    \n   🎧 Officials have not provided many details publicly about Holsey's departure, but it is unusual for a top commander to leave one year into a typical three-year assignment, Steve Walsh of NPR network station WHRO says. Holsey appeared in a closed-door meeting before lawmakers this week to address concerns about the ongoing boat strikes. Reports hint that he was diplomatic in his messaging, Walsh says. Meanwhile, lawmakers' concerns remain as they continue to demand video of the Sept. 2 strike and the administration's legal rationale for carrying out around 22 strikes on alleged drug boats, which have killed 87 people.

But overhunting and habitat loss have led to their decline over the decades. Now, black bear sightings have increased in the state, and researchers believe their populations are growing elsewhere as well. While West Texas is celebrating the bears' return, their presence has posed challenges and concerns as they venture into neighborhoods, enter yards and threaten livestock and pets. Here's how some states are coping:    🐻 In states like Montana and Colorado, residents install bear-resistant dumpsters and trash bins. In some cases, they may use alarm systems or sprinklers to try to startle bears.🐻 Wildlife biologists stress that residents should remove food and anything that could attract hungry bears to their area.🐻 Biologists are also working to prepare people to live with black bears and educate them in the hope of reducing bear-human conflicts.   \n   3 things to know before you go   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Involution, an obscure term used in agricultural economics, leapt from the pages of academia into the Chinese meme world, then became part of Chinese government policymaking.\n                \n                    Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"Involution,\" an obscure term used in agricultural economics, is NPR's \"Word of the Week.\" Here's how it leaped from academia into Chinese meme culture — and how it ultimately influenced government policymaking.This week's Far-Flung Postcard series takes you to a food stand in the one-horse town of Marikavalasa in India, where working women go to enjoy a treat and unwind in the evening before returning to the grind.Sophie Kinsella, the author of the massively popular Shopaholic book series, has died at the age of 55.

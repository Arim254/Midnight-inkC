The newfound focus on the South American country and future uncertainty has raised questions about whether Rubio, a Venezuela hawk who also serves as the national security adviser, has too much influence.   Rubio is the first person to hold both roles at the same time since Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in the 1970s.   But the White House says the old National Security Council structures were too bloated and are ultimately unsuited for how this administration does business.   \n   \"This is a top-down, not a bottom-up process. The president was elected by the American people to carry out his foreign policy agenda, and he ultimately decides, based on what he feels, is the best choice for the American people,\" said a White House official not authorized to speak on the record.    John Bolton, who served as Trump's national security adviser in the first administration, says it's no knock on Rubio, but \"I'm not sure anybody, including Henry Kissinger, really has the bandwidth to do it.\"   The national security adviser is supposed to help make sense of the different complexities facing the U.S. and guide the president toward more measured choices.   Trump asked Rubio to take on yet another full-time role managing the sprawling national security apparatus last year, replacing Michael Waltz, who had come under scrutiny for adding a reporter to an online chat discussing the U.S. military strike in Yemen.   According to Bolton, Trump and Rubio have made it harder by slashing the NSC and upending the process that's traditionally served as the hub for all the different agencies, like the departments of State and Defense and Treasury.   \"There's no guarantee that following the process will result in a successful policy,\" Bolton said. \"But the odds are you're going to have more success. If you think about the pluses and minuses of the different options, weigh the considerations and try to have some coherent plan you're following.\"   \n   Bolton became a fierce critic after he was fired from the administration. Since then, Trump's Justice Department launched a prosecution into Bolton for allegedly mishandling classified information, which he denies.    It's not only Venezuela that Rubio must deal with. It's also Ukraine, Gaza, Iran and Greenland.   Emily Horne, who served as NSC spokesperson in the Biden administration, questioned how much advanced analysis was conducted on the geopolitical implications of the Venezuela operation. She says it's unclear how extensively they gamed out how the operation plays with adversaries and allies, despite the obvious, careful military planning.   \"However, that's a different thing than saying that we were bringing everything we could to both executing this operation and ensuring that we know what the day after or the week after and beyond look like,\" said Horne, who now writes an online newsletter on politics and policy.   The White House official pushed back on such characterizations, describing them as \"inside baseball\" complaints that did not resonate considering the success seen so far.   \"I feel like that's totally negated by the fact that things are stable and going well and there is a cooperative economic relationship in place, and we have maximum leverage over the regime,\" the White House official said.   The White House official says the fact Rubio is handling both roles and the streamlining process of NSC operations allows for Rubio to be more effective at carrying out Trump's directives. Rubio is at the White House almost daily, the official said.   A senior administration official, not authorized to speak on the record, pointed to Rubio's three-phase plan, which he is expected to go into further detail with to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   Step one is stabilization and not allowing the country to devolve into chaos. The second phase is moving to recovery, while ensuring American companies have access to the Venezuelan market. The third phase is transition.   \n   The senior administration official said many critics want to jump to the last phase and elections, but they're forgetting about the lessons of Iraq.   \"That wasn't exactly ideal, right!\" the official said. \"When you sort of decapitate all the instruments of government, you create an insurgency that takes 20 years to quell.\"   The official pointed to a more streamlined NSC that is focused on executing the president's priorities, instead of serving as a policy-making apparatus competing with other agencies.   Alexander Gray, who was chief of staff for the White House National Security Council in Trump's first term, told NPR's Tamara Keith that an \"honest broker\" is less necessary when you have a general meeting of the minds on the big issues.   \"The benefit, so to speak, of a national security adviser who's also secretary of state in terms of shaping the process is less significant when people are generally aligned,\" said Gray, who now serves as a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, which promotes geopolitical cooperation between the U.S. and allies.   Rubio is at the center of it all. And he's taken aim at the foreign policy apparatus, describing institutions like the NSC and State Department as having been ossified and out of touch.   Following Maduro's capture, Rubio said the message to the world is that this administration isn't going to let any kind of internal hemming and hawing stop the U.S.   \"I can tell you, I've watched this process now for 14, 15 years,\" Rubio said. \"I've been around it. Everybody talks. 'I'm going to do this. I'm going to do that. When I get there, we're going to do this.' This is a president of action. I don't understand how they haven't figured this out.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      Data centers used to fuel artificial intelligence are popping up all over the country, and they're  becoming a midterm issue for voters that's now drawing White House attention.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Voters around the country are pushing back against the building of data centers for artificial intelligence. The large-scale facilities are necessary to match the demand for AI, but there are high energy costs that come with them. It's an issue that was critical in key state elections last year. Now it's becoming a midterm issue and is drawing White House attention. NPR White House correspondent Deepa Shivaram traveled to Hanover, Virginia, and brings us this report.DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: The most popular sign for anti-data-center protesters in Hanover County reads, grow tomatoes, not data centers. They're everywhere, says Jennifer Corpus, a Hanover resident.JENNIFER CORPUS: And I think it's, like, that emotional tie to being, like, this is our county, and this is something that our county's known for. Like, why do we want to be known for data centers? We don't.SHIVARAM: Corpus has been leading protests to convince local leaders to vote against plans for four new data centers in the area.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) The data center's bound to fail.UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: Hanover is not for sale.SHIVARAM: She's concerned about everything from how data centers will impact rural land to higher energy costs.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CORPUS: Hanover residents do not want data centers.(CHEERING)SHIVARAM: The rise of data centers has become a particular issue in Virginia, which has the highest number of data centers than anywhere in the world. An independent review commissioned by the state government showed that by 2040, Virginians could be paying up to $37 more per month in energy costs. In other states, like Wisconsin, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, similar fights are popping up. Brendan Steinhauser leads The Alliance for Secure AI, a group pushing for more AI safeguards. He says the pushback against data centres reflects people's larger fears.BRENDAN STEINHAUSER: There's a fear that's out there that is real and that is palpable that is informing the way they think about these huge facilities that they see in their neighborhood. And they're like, what is happening? Why is this happening so fast? Why didn't I get a say in this?SHIVARAM: Proponents say they're crucial for everyday technology use and bring jobs to the area. But the debate has started to become seeped in politics, and it's not exactly divided by party. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucuses with Democrats, has pushed for a nationwide moratorium. Republicans like Missouri Senator Josh Hawley and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis are both pushing for more regulations. Here's the governor last month.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RON DESANTIS: There are some people that say, you know, the right policy is to just give Big Tech whatever they want, subsidize it and all this stuff, and somehow that's going to lead us to some happy place. You know, I reject that.SHIVARAM: And while President Trump and his AI czar, David Sacks, have been advocating for more data centers and working closely with tech companies, the White House is starting to respond to voters' cost concerns, though they have no authority over how private companies can operate. Tech companies, though, are starting to act amid the public backlash. OpenAI and Microsoft both announced initiatives to lower energy and water usage around their data centers. Here's Dan Diorio from the Data Center Coalition, a group that represents companies like Meta and Amazon.DAN DIORIO: The industry is committed to being a responsible partner in the communities and where they locate, but also a responsive partner.SHIVARAM: As both parties gear up for elections later this year, how they talk about data centers could be critical, especially because it hasn't been defined by party lines, says Steinhauser.STEINHAUSER: On this issue, for whatever reason, people are just so concerned about it. And they're so worried about it that I think they're just cheering anyone who is saying the right things or is expressing skepticism.SHIVARAM: That's certainly true for Hanover residents, including Corpus. She says the issue will be a big part of how she votes in local elections.CORPUS: If someone told me they were anti-data center, they'd have my vote.SHIVARAM: All the other disagreements, Corpus says, can wait.Deepa Shivaram, NPR News, Hanover, Virginia.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

Mayor Muriel Bowser congratulated Norton on her retirement.   \"For 35 years, Congresswoman Norton has been our Warrior on the Hill,\" Bowser wrote on social media. \"Her work embodies the unwavering resolve of a city that refuses to yield in its fight for equal representation.\"   \n   Norton's campaign filed a termination report with the Federal Election Commission on Sunday. Her office has not released an official statement about the delegate's intentions.   The filing was first reported by NOTUS.   Her retirement opens up a likely competitive primary to succeed her in an overwhelmingly Democratic city. Several local lawmakers had already announced their intentions to run in the Democratic primary.   An institution in Washington politics for decades, Norton is the oldest member in the House. She was a personal friend to civil rights icons such as Medgar Evers and a contemporary of other activists turned congressional stalwarts, including Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C, and the late Reps. John Conyers, D-Mich., and John Lewis, D-Ga.   But Norton has faced calls to step aside in recent months as residents and local lawmakers questioned her ability to effectively advocate for the city in Congress amid the Republican administration's aggressive moves toward the city.   The White House federalized Washington police force, deployed National Guard troops from six states and the federal district across the capital's streets and surged federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security into neighborhoods. The moves prompted outcry and protests from residents and a lawsuit from the district's attorney general.   \n   Norton's retirement comes as a historically high number of lawmakers announce they will either seek another public office or retire from official duties altogether. More than 1 in 10 members of the House are not seeking reelection this year.   Norton's staunch advocacy for her city   As the district's delegate, Norton does not have a formal vote in the House. But she has found other ways to advocate for the city's interests. Called the \"Warrior on the Hill\" by her supporters, Norton was a staunch advocate for D.C. statehood and for the labor rights of the federal workers who called Washington and its surrounding region home.   She also secured bipartisan wins for district residents. Norton was the driving force behind the passage of a law that allows them to attend any public college or university in the country at in-state tuition rates or be eligible to attend any private university with up to a $2,500 annual grant.   In the 1990s, Norton played a key role in ending the city's financial crisis by brokering a deal to transfer billions of dollars in unfunded pension liabilities to the federal government in exchange for changes to the district's budget. She twice played a leading role in House passage of a D.C. statehood bill.   Steeped in the civil rights movement   Norton was born and raised in Washington, and her life spans the arc of the district's trials and triumphs. She was educated at Dunbar High School as part of the school's last segregated class.   \"Growing up black in Washington gave a special advantage. This whole community of blacks was very race conscious, very civil rights conscious,\" she said in her 2003 biography, \"Fire in My Soul.\"   She attended Antioch College in Ohio and in 1963 split her time between Yale Law School and Mississippi, where she worked as an organizer during the Freedom Summer of the Civil Rights Movement.   \n   One day that summer, Evers picked her up at the airport. He was assassinated that night.   Norton also helped organize and attended the 1963 March on Washington.   In an interview with The Associated Press in 2023, Norton said the march was still \"the single most extraordinary experience of my lifetime.\"   She went on to become the first woman to lead the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which helps enforce anti-discrimination laws in the workplace. She ran for office when her predecessor retired to run for Washington mayor.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., about why he plans to vote against a Department of Homeland Security funding bill.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Now, we hear from Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut for his take on the DHS funding question. He is a Democrat, and he's on the line with us now. Good morning, Senator. Thanks for joining us.CHRIS MURPHY: Good morning.MARTIN: I understand that most of the caucus is planning to vote against this DHS funding bill. Just what went into your decision?MURPHY: Well, DHS is an out-of-control agency. It is not complying with the law. And it's not just Minneapolis. I was in Texas last week, trying to get access to some of these detention centers where people are dying, and DHS wouldn't let me in. That's in direct contravention of the law. I went into one of these immigration courtrooms and saw them violating the law every day, disappearing immigrants who are here legally. This is an agency that's jeopardizing the safety of the people of Minneapolis, is violating the law left and right. And we're just not doing our job - we're not upholding our oath - if we're funding an agency that's out of control.So that's what went into my decision. I only want to fund a federal government that's involved in complying with the law and is not running an agency that is ending up routinely with Americans and residents of this country being killed. And I think that's what people want. People want us to fund DHS, but they want us to fund only a department that is making our communities safer, not making them less safe.MARTIN: Is the administration making any effort to change your mind and the minds of other Democrats? Are they offering, for example, any specific reforms that they could make to their immigration enforcement campaign that would make you and other Democrats comfortable with voting to fund DHS?MURPHY: No. In fact, they're doing the opposite. When things started to get very dangerous in Minneapolis after the first shooting, they surged more untrained ICE and CBP officers into the city. After the shooting yesterday, they went on television and lied through their teeth to the American people about what happened, calling this young man, an ICU nurse who works with veterans, an assassin. So they are inflaming the situation. They are doubling down on their illegality. It's why the American people are turning against them in this operation and why they're demanding that Congress, you know, demand reforms, which is what we're going to do this week.MARTIN: Just a point of clarification. The shooting was Saturday. The latest shooting was Saturday. So two arguments that we're hearing on the Democratic side against this - one is substantive, and one is political. Let's just take them separately. The first is that blocking this funding would be a mistake because it'll delay funds for things like disaster relief and the Coast Guard, and that ICE is going to be able to operate anyway due to the funding it got from last year's Republican tax and spending bill. What do you say to that?MURPHY: Well, there's nothing that would stop us from constraining the use of dollars that are both in the annual budget, but also the Big Beautiful Bill. And the fact of the matter is, we aren't going to ask for the entirety of the Department of Homeland Security to be reformed. We're going to ask for targeted reforms that will make our communities safer. We're going to ask - you know, the things that we certainly could demand and talk about are ending these roving patrols of officers who are not trained to do that kind of door-to-door operation, requiring warrants for arrests, requiring identification and body cameras. You know, these are things that would make these operations safer, would result in fewer people being hurt. I think these are going to be commonsense reforms that we'll likely talk about, things that the Republicans really have no reason to be against because I think the American people will support them.MARTIN: Well, the second argument against is political. I mean, this is an argument being advanced by, say, a Democratic think tank - that the administration is going to spin this as defunding law enforcement and that that tends not to go over well.MURPHY: Well, listen. The - I think the American people are pretty clear about this. You see, you know, 60%, 70% of Americans in polls saying that ICE is out of control right now. They see an administration that is acting lawlessly. So as I mentioned, we're not going to be talking about, you know, doing away with internal law enforcement. We're going to be talking about reforming the way that ICE is operating so they're paying attention to the law again. They are not making these communities any safer.And of course, we're starting to also learn that there may be a much more insidious motive here. Over the weekend, Pam Bondi sent a memo to the state of Minnesota and said, we'll leave Minnesota if you turn over your voting rolls to us. That sounds like they are using ICE as leverage to try to take control of elections. Donald Trump has made it pretty clear that he wants to rig the next election, and ICE seems to be potentially a pretext for that. So every day, this grows more serious. And every day, the - I think the public is making it 100% clear that they want us to only fund ICE, to only fund DHS, if this agency is acting lawfully. And that's the bottom line of what we are going to be talking about this week.MARTIN: We have to leave it there for now. That's Senator Chris Murphy. He's a Democrat from Connecticut. Senator, thank you.MURPHY: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., accused the administration of a \"cover-up\" Sunday and said the federal government is ignoring a court order that allows state investigators to access evidence in Pretti's killing.    \"Our state investigators had to get a warrant to have access to the evidence of the shooting of Alex Pretti,\" Smith said. \"And even then, the federal agents refused to give them access to the evidence. So this looks very much like another cover-up.\"   \n   Pretti's killing has prompted strong bipartisan condemnation, a forceful defense from the Trump administration and the prospect of another government shutdown, this one over funding for the Department of Homeland Security. ICE is part of DHS.   DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a reported statement Saturday that her department will lead the investigation into the killing. Meanwhile, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told CBS News Sunday that his department hasn't received any cooperation or information from the federal government.    \n   Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., warned the Trump administration against any attempt to shut out local and state law enforcement from the investigation.   \"There must be a thorough and impartial investigation into yesterday's Minneapolis shooting,\" Tillis said in a post Sunday morning. \"Any administration official who rushes to judgment and tries to shut down an investigation before it begins are doing an incredible disservice to the nation and to President Trump's legacy.\"   Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., also called for a \"full joint federal and state investigation\" and said the \"credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake\" in a statement.   On Sunday, Trump administration officials continued to defend the federal agents who killed Pretti. The head of Trump's immigration operation, Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino, told CNN that the federal agents are \"the victims\" and said Pretti \"perpetrated violence\" during an active immigration enforcement operation.   \n   \"That suspect injected himself into that law enforcement situation with a weapon,\" Bovino said.    The video evidence and eyewitness accounts that have surfaced so far refute that assertion. There has been no evidence that NPR has verified of Pretti brandishing his handgun at any time during the encounter with federal agents.   On Saturday, Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said if a U.S. citizen approaches law enforcement with a gun, federal officers \"will be legally justified in shooting you.\"    The powerful National Rifle Association and Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., criticized Essayli.    \"Carrying a firearm is not a death sentence, it's a Constitutionally protected God-given right, and if you don't understand this you have no business in law enforcement or government,\" Massie said on X.   Chair of the House Oversight Committee James Comer, R-Ky., suggested Sunday that Trump remove ICE from Minneapolis because local law enforcement aren't cooperating .    \"If the mayor and the governor are going to put our ICE officials in harm's way, and there's a chance of losing more innocent lives or whatever, then maybe go to another city and let the people of Minneapolis decide do we want to continue to have all of these illegals,\" Comer said on Fox News.    Congressional criticism of the White House from even a small number of House and Senate Republicans has been rare in Trump's second presidency. But it remains unclear what if anything the GOP-led Congress will do to force a local and federal investigation.   Meanwhile, Senate Democrats are poised to block government funding in response to the Minnesota killings by DHS officers.   Both the House and Senate have passed full-year funding for only some parts of the federal government — such as the Commerce, Justice and Interior departments. But funding for some of the country's largest departments, like the Pentagon or DHS, have yet to pass the Senate.   \n   Last week, the House passed measure to fund these remaining departments. In the Senate, Republicans will need Democrats to pass the funding package — which requires at least 60 votes to advance.    \"When they're killing two constituents in my state, and they're taking 2-year-olds out of the arms of their moms, and they are taking an elder Hmong man out of his house and putting him out there in his underwear and then figuring out they have the wrong man,\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said on NBC News Sunday. \"No, I am not voting for this funding.\"   On Saturday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats would not vote to advance the spending package if it includes DHS funding.    Senate Democrats held a conference call Sunday evening to discuss their legislative strategy. If any changes are made to the spending package, the House would have to return to Capitol Hill and approve the Senate changes.    The funding deadline is Friday. \n",

In a letter to Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Bondi wrote: \"You and your office must restore the rule of law, support ICE officers, and bring an end to the chaos in Minnesota.\"   The letter — which NPR has not obtained but which has been published by other media outlets — was dated Saturday. That's the same day Alex Pretti, a nurse and U.S. citizen, was shot and killed by immigration officers — the second fatal shooting by federal agents this month.   \n   Bondi urged Walz to embrace what she called \"common sense solutions,\" including repealing what the Trump administration terms \"sanctuary policies\" and cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Minnesota state officials say the Trump administration is making false claims about its cooperation with ICE.   Walz, who's called on the Trump administration to end its operation in Minnesota, dismissed the letter in a news conference Sunday.   The letter also calls on the state to \"share all of Minnesota's records\" relating to Medicaid and food assistance programs, including SNAP, with the federal government.   The Trump administration has cited allegations of fraud, especially relating to immigrants of Somali descent, in its immigration crackdown.   Minnesota is one of more than 20 states that has so far refused to comply with a demand from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to turn over personal information about people who have applied for or received SNAP benefits over the last six years. The states have argued the demand is unlawful and a federal judge in California issued a preliminary ruling indicating they were likely to prevail in that claim.   Minnesota was also one of 22 states that sued to block the Department of Health and Human Services from sharing sensitive Medicaid data with the Department of Homeland Security to aid in immigration enforcement efforts. In December, a different federal judge in California ruled that limited data sharing, including addresses and immigration status, could go forward.   \n   Bondi makes new demand for voter data   Bondi also made a seemingly unrelated request: for Minnesota's voter data.   It's not the first time the Department of Justice has sought the state's voter information — and it's an ask that's not isolated to Minnesota.   Instead, it's the latest escalation in the Trump administration's nationwide attempt to consolidate data and execute unprecedented oversight into the country's voting systems.   The DOJ is currently suing Minnesota and roughly two dozen other states — all states Trump lost in the 2020 election — trying to compel them to share unredacted versions of their voter lists with the federal government. The DOJ has claimed it needs the data to enforce federal election law.   Those suits have yet to be successful anywhere, though.   A federal judge in California recently dismissed a suit there, writing that the request was \"unprecedented and illegal,\" and another judge in Oregon signaled that he planned to do the same. A third judge in Georgia dismissed the suit in that state based on a jurisdictional issue.   Minnesota's chief voting official, Democrat Steve Simon, alluded to those outcomes in a statement declining Bondi's request.   \"The law does not give the federal government the authority to obtain this private data,\" Simon said. \"It is deeply disturbing that the U.S. Attorney General would make this unlawful request a part of an apparent ransom to pay for our state's peace and security.\"   Election law expert Rick Hasen, of UCLA School of Law, echoed those concerns in a strongly worded blog post over the weekend.   \"This is outrageous and reprehensible,\" Hasen wrote. \"It shows ICE is not in Minneapolis for law enforcement or immigration purposes. They are there to stir up s*** in blue states and try to extort them …\"   The federal government has not been clear on exactly how it plans to use or securely store the data, but it's become clear that part of their plans include running voting lists through a revamped system at the Department of Homeland Security meant to search for noncitizens.   \n   NPR was the first news outlet to report on the details of the system, known as SAVE, but tens of millions of records have now been run through it, and no evidence of the sort of widespread voter fraud Trump has long talked about has come to light.   It's also unclear how accurate the system is. In one county in Texas, a state that voluntarily agreed to run its list through the system, at least 15 of the 84 voters the system flagged as noncitizens there were false positives.   NPR's Jude Joffe-Block contributed reporting.\n",

Here is what to know.   The victim was an ICU nurse who loved the outdoors   Pretti, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident and an ICU nurse, has been identified by officials as the shooting victim.   The victim's father Michael Pretti told the Associated Press his son had participated in the protests because he \"cared about people deeply and he was very upset with what was happening in Minneapolis and throughout the United States with ICE, as millions of other people are upset.\"   \n   His mother, Susan Pretti, told the AP her son was passionate about the environment and \"took his dog everywhere he went.\"   Neighbors were also shocked by his death. Jeanne Wiener, who lived next door to Pretti, told MPR News that she would chat with him when he was walking his dog around their Lyndale neighborhood.   \"He was a calm person; he's a nurse,\" Wiener said Saturday. \"I'm mad. I'm angry. This was a good person. This is not a violent person.\"   Dr. Dimitri Drekonja, who worked at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center with Pretti, remembered him as an \"incredibly competent person\" who was good at his job.   \"There is no reason for a guy like that to be dead, let alone to be killed by the agents of a government that employed him,\" Drekonja also told MPR News, adding that Pretti was a sweet, kind man who loved the outdoors and mountain biking.   Pretti's parents said they were \"sickened\" by Trump administration officials suggesting their son was a \"domestic terrorist.\"   Federal officials defended Border Patrol Agents   Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem defended the officers' actions on Saturday and said they \"acted according to their training.\" Noem also accused Pretti of \"brandishing\" his weapon and that he \"attacked\" officers.   \n   \"This looks like a situation where an individual arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement,\" Noem told reporters during a press conference.   Officials said Pretti had a 9mm semiautomatic handgun with him.   Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol commander, said the officer who fired shots was \"highly trained\" and has worked as a Border Patrol agent for the last eight years. Bovino said the shooting remains under investigation.   Bystander videos don't support key details from government   Bystander videos posted on social media appear to contradict DHS' account of the shooting.   Footage appears to show Pretti being surrounded by multiple federal agents, with several restraining him and punching him while he is on the ground before he is shot. Multiple rounds of gunfire can be heard as Pretti lies on the ground.   So far, there has been no video showing that Pretti brandished or tried to use the firearm that federal officials said he had in his possession.   Minneapolis officials are questioning the DHS account   Pretti had no criminal record and his only known interaction with police involved traffic tickets, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara. He also was a lawful gun owner with a permit to legally carry a gun, O'Hara also said on Saturday.   Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said during a press conference he plans to seek a temporary restraining order from a judge on Monday that would grant \"immediate relief\" to stop the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.   Frey also said he sent a request to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for assistance from the National Guard to support \"the limited number of officers that we have in the Minneapolis Police Department.\"   Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar condemned the shooting and called for immigration officers to leave the state.   \"Our message is really clear and straightforward. We need ICE out of Minnesota,\" Klobuchar said during a press conference. \"They are not making us more safe, as the tragic, tragic killing this morning, as people saw it viscerally on that video shows us, they are making us less safe.\"   \n   Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called the shooting \"sickening\" and said the state \"has had it\" in a social media post on Saturday. Walz said he spoke with the White House about the shooting and said \"the President must end this operation.\"   Walz also said he was glad there was footage of the incident, saying: \"Thank God, thank God, we have video because, according to DHS, these seven heroic guys took an onslaught of a battalion against them or something. It's nonsense, people. It is nonsense, and it's lies.\"   This is the third ICE-related shooting in Minneapolis    It is the second killing involving federal immigration officers in Minneapolis this month after ICE officers shot Renee Macklin Good on Jan. 7 in her SUV as she drove away after partially blocking a Minneapolis street.    In another incident, Julio Cesar Sosa-Celia, a Venezuelan national, was shot in the leg by immigration officers during an altercation with those agents.   NPR's Cheryl W.

    "body": "\n      The popularity of Trump's immigration crackdown, and approval of ICE's tactics have dropped. Also, there's fallout from the World Economic Forum, including Trump's new tariff threat against Canada.   \n\n    AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:  Joining us now is NPR senior political correspondent Mara Liasson. Welcome.MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi there.RASCOE: So, you know, as you just heard, there's a lot we don't know about the shooting yesterday in Minneapolis. But what strikes you politically about this?LIASSON: One thing that strikes me is how the Trump administration tries to get out immediately after these incidents with a narrative that may or may not be true. This happened with the shooting of Renee Macklin Good just a few weeks ago, when the administration said she carried out an act of domestic terrorism. Trump called her a professional agitator, accused Good of trying to run over the ICE agent who shot her, before there was an investigation or much evidence of this.We're also seeing some pushback from Congress. Senate Democrats say they will not vote for the Department of Homeland Security's funding bill. And all this occurs at a time when Trump's approval ratings are dropping. Immigration has been the aspect of Trump's policies that was the most popular. Voters in general approve of his efforts to secure the Southern border and to deport undocumented immigrants with criminal records.But new polls show that a majority of voters disapprove of ICE's tactics. Now, a New York Times poll taken right before the second fatal shooting shows that majorities of voters disapprove of the way ICE is doing its job. Only 36% of voters approve, and 61% said ICE had, quote, \"gone too far.\" Now, this could have an impact on the midterm elections, even though Trump himself is not on the ballot.RASCOE: I want to - you know, moving on another topic. I want to ask you about yet another tariff threat from President Trump. He's now saying he'll impose a hundred-percent tariff if Canada moves ahead with the trade deal with China. Is this fallout over Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's remarks at Davos last week?LIASSON: It seems like it. Carney gave a very candid speech, laying out what he called a rupture in the world order. He encouraged middle countries like his and other NATO allies to work more independently, saying they can't rely on the U.S. anymore as a stabilizing force. That speech got a standing ovation. Donald Trump didn't like it at all, and then he threatened the 100% tariffs on Canada.And the trade deal that Canada made with China - where they agreed to lower tariffs on some Chinese electric vehicles, China agreed to lower tariffs on some Canadian agriculture products - interestingly enough, Trump was for it. He seems to have reversed himself. When the deal was announced last week, he said it was a good thing. He said, it's what you should be doing. He said, quote, \"if you can get a deal with China, you should do that.\" But then he changed his mind. He now is attacking Carney for being ungrateful. And the bottom line here is that Donald Trump is very unpredictable.RASCOE: Well, and given that he reverses himself so much over tariffs, are these threats kind of losing their punch?LIASSON: Well, they could be. He does have a pattern of blustering then backing down. This is something termed the TACO theory for Trump always chickens out. And some of these threats seem to be performative for Trump. At times, he sounds like he's in a \"Godfather\" movie. Take a listen to what he said during his speech at Davos where he tried to coerce Denmark and other U.S. allies to give the United States control of Greenland.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They have a choice. You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no, and we will remember.LIASSON: And I think it's apt that the term TACO came originated with Wall Street traders because the markets seem to be the last guardrails on Trump's behavior. When he threatened force to take Greenland, when he threatened to put tariffs on U.S. allies, the markets tumbled. Then when he backed off, the markets bounced back. But the bottom line again is, the whole - his behavior is so unpredictable, and it makes some sort of sense that other countries - even long-term US allies - are now looking to find their own path and make deals with other superpowers like China.RASCOE: Well, what are some of the long-term implications of Trump's aggressive posture toward U.S. allies?LIASSON: They could be profound. If the Western alliance permanently ruptures, the implications could be very big. Article 5 of NATO says, an attack on one member is an attack on all. All protect each other. But Donald Trump has called that into question, raising doubts about whether he would come to Europe's aid if it was invaded by Russia.And the question hanging over Europe right now is, if the alliance does rupture, is it possible for Europe to rearm itself to make up for losing the U.S. as an ally? Does Europe have the means or the will to do this, to make up for the intelligence and the weapon systems and the nuclear umbrella that they get from the United States? Estimates are that it would cost hundreds of billions of dollars and take decades.So this is a big question. There really isn't an alternative to the Western alliance for European countries. And in the meantime, Russia is happy to see these divisions. Vladimir Putin has been trying to break the Western alliance for his entire life, and right now, he's watching it break apart possibly from the inside, so this is a big gift to Putin and a lot of uncertainty for European countries going forward.RASCOE: That's NPR senior national political correspondent Mara Liasson.

A fight in the Senate over DHS funding following the death of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis has the government on track for a partial shutdown at the end of this week.\n                \n                    Heather Diehl/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Heather Diehl/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The second deadly shooting of a U.S. citizen by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis is raising the prospect of a partial government shutdown at the end of the week.   Senate Democrats say they will not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security without new guardrails for immigration enforcement.   But that opposition may also torpedo the larger $1.3 trillion dollar spending package needed to keep large swaths of the federal government operational past Friday night.   \n   \"The appalling murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis must lead Republicans to join Democrats in overhauling ICE and CBP to protect the public,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote on Sunday. \"People should be safe from abuse by their own government.\"   Democrats were already raising alarms about the conduct of immigration officers before the latest killing in Minneapolis on Saturday.   Last week, all but seven House Democrats voted against the funding bill covering homeland security, which includes money for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.   At the time, a few Senate Democrats also pledged to vote against the funding when it reached them this week, though the response across the Capitol was far from the near-unified opposition in the House.   That is because the House sent the DHS funding over to the Senate tied together with billions in spending for defense, health, transportation and other federal agencies, in part to expedite the process as Congress races to meet a Friday deadline to keep the government fully open.   \"The hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need,\" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Senate appropriations committee, wrote in a statement last week saying she would vote for the total package.   \n   After Pretti's shooting on Saturday by a Border Patrol agent, Murray said she would join her Democratic colleagues in opposing the funding.   Congress faces Friday deadline to avert a partial shutdown   The timeline was already tight once a winter storm delayed the first Senate votes of the week until Tuesday night. But the renewed debate over immigration enforcement is complicating the task more.   Schumer wants to cleave the DHS measure from everything else. The other remaining spending measures have overwhelming bipartisan support. Democrats want to continue negotiating the DHS funding bill without shutting down large parts of the government.   The funding measure needs to reach a 60-vote threshold to pass, meaning some Democratic support is needed for it to clear the Senate. But disentangling different parts of the legislation requires buy-in from Republicans, and so far, GOP leadership has not indicated that they are willing to separate the funding bills.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Flowers, signs and mementos are seen Monday at a makeshift memorial in the area where Alex Pretti was shot dead by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis. On January 24, federal agents shot and killed Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, while scuffling with him on an icy roadway.\n                \n                    Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the appropriations committee chair, told The New York Times over the weekend, \"I'm exploring all options. We have five other bills that are really vital, and I'm relatively confident they would pass.\"   Collins, who is up for reelection and whose state is also a target of immigration raids by the Trump administration, is among the Republicans who have expressed fresh concerns about the tactics, calling for an investigation.   A handful of Republicans have called for congressional hearings or offered sharper criticism.   \"My support for funding ICE remains the same,\" Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., wrote in a statement. \"But we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble.\"   Even if Democrats could convince Republicans to agree to separate DHS funding from the rest, that would mean the legislation needs approval again in the House, which is on recess until Feb. 2. It is unlikely that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., would call members back to Washington early, increasing the risk of a partial shutdown.   \n   Why Democrats are willing to risk another shutdown   Before this weekend, few lawmakers expressed appetite for another shutdown after a record 43-day one this fall. For weeks, Democrats withheld their votes from a short-term funding measure to reopen the government without a deal to extend expiring health insurance subsidies.   Eventually, a handful of Democrats joined with Republicans to reopen the government, with the promise of a vote on the subsidies. That vote failed in December. The deal included the passage of three bipartisan spending packages for veterans, agriculture and other areas through the end of September 2026 and a short-term extension for everything else through Jan. 30.   Congress has already passed several more full-year funding bills through September, but the measures still awaiting final passage in the Senate account for 75% of annual federal discretionary spending.   But even Democrats who ultimately voted with Republicans to end the last funding stalemate now say they will vote against the DHS funding despite the risk of another shutdown.   \"We have bipartisan agreement on 96% of the budget,\" Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto, D-Nev., wrote in a statement. \"We've already passed six funding bills. Let's pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans' constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement's essential role to keep us safe.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Federal agents look on as demonstrators gather near the site of where Alex Pretti was fatally shot by.\n                \n                    Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Holding up the DHS funding bill would not halt the administration's immigration crackdown. Last summer, Congressional Republicans allocated $75 billion for ICE over four years in President Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill.\"   Democrats say they do not want to give ICE the roughly $10 billion base funding that is on the line now. But more so, Democrats see this as rare leverage in the minority to extract policy changes.   Democrats already negotiated to include $20 billion in funding for officer-worn body cameras, plus more funding for oversight and a reduction in funding for enforcement and removal operations and detention bed capacity. But most Democrats said this did not go far enough.   \n   Democrats want more sweeping reforms to reign in the tactics, such as prohibiting ICE from deploying excessive force and explicitly preventing them from raiding places of worship, hospitals and schools. Republicans previously rejected these demands.   The DHS funding bill also includes funding for the Transportation Security Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.   But Democrats are betting that the American public is on their side. A recent New York Times poll found that a majority of respondents said the federal immigration tactics have gone too far.   Nearly $1.3 trillion in federal funding is at stake   The funding fight over DHS is the latest dispute over funding in Congress. Last year, the Trump administration moved to rescind billions in federal funding appropriated by Congress for foreign aid and public broadcasting — and proposed a budget slashing nondiscretionary funding by some 20%.   Instead, the final legislation keeps federal nondiscretionary spending essentially flat. For example, the administration called for cutting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by 50%. Under the bipartisan health spending bill, the agency's funding would remain roughly unchanged.   Bill Hoagland, senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former longtime appropriations committee staffer, said this is striking considering Congress has mostly followed Trump's lead.   \"Congress is starting to show a little bit of backbone,\" Hoagland said. \"I think there is increasing recognition of the need to have Congress exert its power of the purse.\"   Hoagland also notes that Congress is nearly a quarter of the way into the fiscal year, so once lawmakers greenlight the remaining funding, it will not be too long before the appropriations process begins again.\n",

After a late night court filing a federal judge granted them a temporary restraining order, ruling that no Homeland Security officer can destroy or alter evidence related to the death Saturday morning. Federal investigators have refused to allow access to the scene, despite the state obtaining a search warrant for public areas.   \n   It's the second fatal shooting in Minneapolis by immigration agents this month, and once again Trump administration officials immediately defended the action as self-defense while blaming the victim — in this case claiming he was a \"domestic terrorist\" intending to \"massacre\" officers.   Multiple bystander videos and witness testimony contradict that. Pretti can be seen holding only a phone in his hand before at least six officers tackle him, pinning him face down on the ground and shooting him in the back, firing what sounds like 10 shots. One eyewitness said in a court document that Pretti was not even facing agents when they grabbed him. \"It didn't look like he was trying to resist, just trying to help [a] woman up,\" they wrote.   \n   Pretti was a U.S. citizen with no known criminal record. DHS says he was armed, and the city's police chief confirmed he had a lawful permit to carry. There has been no evidence that NPR has verified of Pretti brandishing his handgun at any time during the encounter with federal agents. One video appears to show an officer take away his gun just before another shoots him.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The area where a federal agent killed a man in Minneapolis on Saturday was taped off.\n                \n                    ZAYDEE SANCHEZ\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        ZAYDEE SANCHEZ\n    \n\n   \n   Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche stood by the agents in an interview on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday. \"This was an incredibly split-second decision that had to be made by ICE officers confronting a very complicated, violent situation,\" he said, adding that Pretti was \"interrupting an ICE operation.\"   Gregory Bovino, the immigration official commanding the operation in Minneapolis told CNN on Sunday that \"the victims are the Border Patrol agents. The suspect put himself in that situation.\"   \"Once again DHS has come out with a predetermined narrative that contradicts everything we saw with our own eyes,\" said Minn. U.S. Representative Kelly Morrison, a Democrat. \"Two 37-year-old Minnesotans are now dead, a poet and a nurse, for what?\"   There are concerns over the integrity of the shooting investigation   Gov. Tim Walz told reporters Saturday that the federal government cannot be trusted with this investigation.   \n   \"We continue to hear, and we heard it from the vice president, that these folks can do whatever they want. They can have full immunity. And what I'm telling you is they will not. There will be justice to Minnesotans,\" he said.   The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said DHS has blocked its investigators from the scene. Earlier this month, the Trump administration also said it will not investigate the agent who shot and killed Renee Macklin Good as she was turning her car to drive away. Walz said the state is creating a log of evidence for possible future prosecution of immigration agents. In an extraordinary move the Minnesota Department of Corrections has also created a website to combat what it says are repeated false claims by DHS that it does not cooperate on federal immigration enforcement.   \n   In a rare break with Trump by a Republican, U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana called for a joint federal and state investigation. \"The events in Minneapolis are incredibly disturbing. The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake,\" he wrote in a post on X.\"   The Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus, a pro-Second Amendment group, also called for a \"full and transparent\" investigation.   Loading...\n   \"Your children will ask you what side you were on\"   In Minneapolis on Saturday night, on street corners all over the city, neighbors came outside in the subzero temperatures to mourn and try to process this latest killing of a bystander. Small groups gathered on snowbanks, holding candles, singing, and worriedly talking with neighbors.   \"It can be you! It can be anyone walking past this street right now, and that's what's so sickening and so powerful that people are out here,\" said Tourmu Diggs, a Minneapolis resident who attended a large vigil in Whittier Park, a few blocks from where Pretti was shot dead a few hours earlier.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                People gather Saturday during a vigil for 37-year-old Alex Pretti, who was fatally shot by a federal Border Patrol agent earlier in the day during an immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis.\n                \n                    Zaydee Sanchez for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Zaydee Sanchez for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Minneapolis residents and protesters march through the streets during a vigil for Alex Pretti, who was fatally shot by a federal agent during an immigration enforcement operation.\n                \n                    Zaydee Sanchez\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Zaydee Sanchez\n    \n\n   \n   Many of the vigil attendees told NPR that they want peace but fear that they may be running out of political, legal and peaceful means to remove federal immigration agents from the city.   \"We just had one of the biggest protests ever yesterday, and here they are killing another person,\" said Minneapolis resident Nick, referring to a massive demonstration in downtown Minneapolis on Friday. Like many NPR spoke with, he declined to give his full name out of fear of doxxing and retaliation from the federal government.   \n   Amid mounting anger and more protests expected, Minnesota activated the National Guard to help overstretched local police maintain public safety. It says members will wear neon reflective vests to distinguish them from other agencies in similar uniforms.   Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said the weeks-long surge of federal officers amounts to an invasion of the city. \"The masked militarized force and unidentified agents patrolling our streets, that is what erodes trust in both law enforcement and in democracy itself,\" he said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Thousands gathered downtown in subzero temperatures Friday as hundreds of Minnesota businesses closed in a statewide \"ICE Out\" protest and strike against federal immigration enforcement and the expanded ICE operations in Minneapolis.\n                \n                    Erin Trieb for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Erin Trieb for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   He urged residents to stay calm but continue speaking out. \"Stand up for America. Recognize that your children will ask you what side you were on. Your grandchildren will ask you what you did to act to prevent this from happening again,\" Frey said.   A former Trump administration DHS general counsel called for the president's impeachment. \"I am enraged and embarrassed by DHS's lawlessness, fascism, and cruelty,\" John Mitnick wrote in a post on X.   Anger was already growing over federal agents' aggressive approach   The Trump administration has portrayed its mission in Minnesota as a crackdown on criminal, undocumented immigrants, and has sent a force of some 3,000 agents — five times larger than the Minneapolis police force. Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs for Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin has told NPR that the agency is \"delivering on the American people's mandate to deport illegal aliens.\"   \n   But residents say federal agents are sweeping up legal residents and even U.S. citizens in an arrest-first, ask-questions-later approach And policing and immigration experts say DHS agents are pushing the limits of their power, causing confusion for people who want to safely express their opposition.   Before the latest fatal shooting, NPR reporters on the ground in Minneapolis have witnessed federal agents pulling people off the streets and out of their cars or questioning people of color on their immigration status. Those arrested include a 5-year-old boy now in detention with his father in Texas. Agents also dragged an older Hmong man into his front yard, wearing only his underwear in subzero cold, even though he's been a U.S. citizen for decades. The family told The Associated Press that agents barged into the home and arrested the man with guns drawn despite not having a warrant.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                ICE and federal agents face off with Minneapolis residents and protesters following the fatal shooting of a local resident earlier in the day near Nicollet Avenue and West 26th Street in south Minneapolis.

The health care worker joined the crowd of protesters at the site of the latest shooting, standing feet from a row of local police in full face masks and riot gear.   \n   \"They're trying to have the narrative be that the people are the aggressors,\" she told NPR. \"But we have seen on video and we've heard people testify to the fact that, no, they are being illegally detained and assaulted and sustaining injuries. And this is absolutely counter to everything our country stands for.\"   Asked about such concerns, Deputy Attorney General Blanche Sunday told CNN it's not fair to point to a few incidents out of thousands of arrests. \"Our agents are acting humanely,\" he said. \"Their jobs are very, very difficult.\"\n",

The bipartisan effort, which has been led by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., was long fought by Trump and Republican leadership from reaching the House floor. As recently as last week, White House officials met with Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., about her support for releasing the files, but her position was unchanged after the meeting.   \n   Trump has also attacked Republicans for pushing the measure, including Massie and most recently Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.   However, Trump did an about face over the weekend as it became clear a vote in the House was likely to succeed, and said Republicans should approve the bill.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., speaks at a press conference alongside alleged victims of Jeffrey Epstein at the U.S. Capitol on September 3, 2025.\n                \n                    Bryan Dozier/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Bryan Dozier/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   On Monday, Trump told reporters at the White House that the Senate can take up the bill as well, and that he would sign it if it passes. The measure, if passed, would compel the Justice Department to release all of its files on the convicted sex offender within 30 days.   \n   \"I'm all for it,\" Trump said from the Oval Office, but maintained it was a \"hoax\" that he didn't want to \"detract\" from his party's success.    Trump does not need legislation in order to approve the files for release, but he told reporters that Congress \"can do whatever they want\" on the vote.    His remarks came after a simple majority of House members signed onto what is known as a discharge petition – a workaround that forces votes without leadership or committee approval. Last week, the chamber's newest member, Rep. Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., became the decisive 218th signature on the petition.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump speaks with reporters from the Oval Office on Monday. Trump said he would sign a bill to release the Epstein files if it passes through Congress.\n                \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Grijalva's swearing in was delayed for seven weeks after her election, galvanizing Democrats who accused House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., of stalling in order to put off the vote. Johnson rejected that claim, saying her oath of office would not be taken until the government shutdown fight was resolved. He also committed to not block the vote on the House floor.   \n   Tuesday's expected vote also comes after a wave of Epstein files were released last week by members on the Republican-led House Oversight Committee. Democrats first released a set of three emails, followed by thousands of pages of new files released by the panel's chairman, James Comer, R-Ky. The documents triggered new questions about the extent of Trump's relationship with the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender before his death in 2019.   Ahead of the vote, Massie and Khanna plan to gather with survivors and their families and friends. They last appeared together in September on Capitol Hill to lobby for the release of the Epstein files, saying transparency was the path to holding those involved fully accountable.   \n   Survivors reiterated that position in a Friday letter to Congress in which they urged the release of files relating to Epstein and his longtime confidante Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving time at a Texas facility after her conviction on trafficking charges.   \"Epstein and Maxwell's crimes exposed a double standard of justice, where rich and powerful men and women evade repercussions,\" they wrote.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Scott Detrow speaks with Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., after President Trump's recent comments about the potential release of files from the Justice Department's investigation of Jeffrey Epstein.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  The story of President Trump and the Epstein files has taken over American politics, but it's also been a lot to follow. So here's a short summary.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, yeah, I would.UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: All right.TRUMP: I guess I would.DETROW: Campaigning to return to the White House, Trump was asked whether he'd declassify the information gained from the federal investigation into accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. He said yes, though he tempered that by saying he did not want to affect people's lives if those files contained, quote, \"phony stuff.\" Once in office, Trump changed his message.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: I don't understand why the Jeffrey Epstein case would be of interest to anybody. It's pretty boring stuff.DETROW: That stance only led to even more documentation of the relationship between Epstein and his one-time friend, Trump, through media reports and through bipartisan efforts in the House Oversight Committee. A handful of Republicans joined Democrats in pushing for legislation to compel the Department of Justice to release its Epstein files. And despite intense lobbying from the White House to get those Republicans to back off, they forced the House of Representatives to vote on it this week.And then, last night, Trump changed his message again. He posted on Truth Social, saying, quote, \"House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files because we have nothing to hide, and it's time to move on from this Democrat hoax,\" end quote. Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie and California Democrat Ro Khanna jointly led the effort to force the floor vote, and Congressman Ro Khanna joins us now. Welcome to the show.RO KHANNA: Good afternoon.DETROW: What was your response to that latest post from President Trump? Did it surprise you that he's now calling for the House to approve this legislation?KHANNA: It did surprise me, but he saw the math. He caved to the coalition that Massie and I have built over the past five months. Look, this is one of the most horrific crimes in American history. You had Jeffrey Epstein who had a rape island. You had rich and powerful men who basically abused underage girls or knew about that abuse and said nothing. And we were able to build such a strong coalition that there were probably nearly a hundred Republicans who would have voted for my bill, my underlying bill, despite the president's bullying them to get off, and the president saw the reality.DETROW: Trump, of course, doesn't need the House vote to release the files, right? So what is the goal here at this point in time?KHANNA: Well, the goal is to show that there is an enormous coalition in this country that wants the Epstein class removed, that we stand with forgotten Americans and not the Epstein class, and that a overwhelming vote in the House and the Senate is going to put enormous pressure to release these files. We're having survivors at the Capitol tomorrow, and this is something they've been wanting for decades. They deserve justice.DETROW: What do you mean by the Epstein class?KHANNA: I define the Epstein class narrowly as the people who either abused underage girls or who knew about Epstein's abuse and covered it up. But more generally, the Epstein class is a group of people with extreme wealth who have donated to politicians and been part of a system where they think the rules don't apply to them, and they have created a system that has shafted a lot of forgotten Americans. That's why Donald Trump ran and was central to his campaign. And many people, like Marjorie Taylor Greene and others, believe he's become part of the swamp that he said he would drain. He's forgotten the forgotten Americans he said he would stand up for.DETROW: I want to ask you to respond to - I'm sure you've heard this criticism many times. So there are a lot of supporters of President Trump who say that Democrats only got interested in this ongoing story when it became clear that it could politically damage President Trump. What's your response to that claim?KHANNA: Well, first of all, I spoke out about this in 2019 with Elijah Cummings, and people can look at my social media about it. And then during President Biden, there was a judge-ordered process of releasing files. But what Donald Trump then said is he wants to expedite that and release all of them. JD Vance said this multiple times. I did not criticize him once in the first six, seven months. The only time I spoke out with Thomas Massie is when Pam Bondi went on television and said, well, we've released everything. It's time to move on. There's nothing more to see. And that's when we mobilized.And our hope was that we would get President Trump, back then, to see that he needed to fulfill his commitment to release the files. We never made this about Donald Trump. The survivors have not made this about Donald Trump. This is about justice for the survivor, protecting our kids and exposing one of the most horrific, disgusting scandals in our country's history.DETROW: There were 20,000 pages of documents that were released last week, but that was not the DOJ files. That included everything from the emails where Epstein said that Trump, quote, \"knew about the girls\" to, you know, lots of exchanges between prominent Democrats, among others, with Jeffrey Epstein. Do you have any idea what is in the DOJ files themselves? Like, what do you expect if you do get your wish?KHANNA: Well, what I know is from what the Epstein survivors' lawyers say, because they've seen the files. There are photographs of lewd acts that took place. There are interview memorandum with rich and powerful men who either engaged in sex trafficking or actually showed up to Epstein's island. There is numerous emails and records from Epstein's own computers that would show who was friends with him and taking money from him despite knowing that he abused underage girls.DETROW: I think that President Trump's insistence that the DOJ investigate Democrats mentioned in last week's files is the latest example of the political interference that's taking place at DOJ. Given that, how would you approach verifying whatever the Department of Justice eventually turns over? Would you have concerns about what DOJ turns over?KHANNA: I do have concerns. I've said that the process should be non-politicized nonpartisans. If Democrats are implicated, so be it.DETROW: I'm just talking about the factual information, though. How would you make sure that these are, in fact, the full files? Is there conversation about that?KHANNA: There is. And the way to make sure is that we have lawyers who've seen the files - the victims' lawyers. They should be involved. There are people from Biden's Justice Department who've seen the files. There are career officials who've seen the files. And by the way, we're getting documents from Epstein's estate, which are independent. And so if the Trump administration tries to tamper with the documents, there are a lot of external validators who've seen the files who'd be able to call that out.DETROW: Very, very quick question - do you feel confident this would pass the Senate if it clears the House?KHANNA: I do. We just heard from Senator Merkley that he's going to bring this up.DETROW: OK.KHANNA: And we have bipartisan support there.DETROW: That is Congressman Ro Khanna of California. Thank you so much.KHANNA: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

During the rare rehearing of a Louisiana redistricting case in October, the court's conservative majority appeared inclined to weaken the Voting Rights Act's Section 2 protections against racial discrimination in the political mapmaking process.   Such a ruling could spark a new wave of congressional redistricting, especially in the South, where voting is often racially polarized and Section 2 has long prevented the dilution of Black minority voters' collective power. Without the current Section 2 protections, Republican-led southern states may undo districts where Black voters have a realistic opportunity of electing their preferred candidates, who are usually Democrats.   \n   This redrawing could give the GOP a sizable boost, as the party seeks to keep control of the House of Representatives.   \n   When the Supreme Court would release its decision is crucial. Time is running out to redo maps, which have to be finalized ahead of a state's filing deadline for candidates seeking to run in a primary election for the midterms.   \"The earlier the decision comes, the more likely the decision is before the date for candidates to declare that they're going to be running, and the more time there is for legislatures to meet and consider maps and redraw their maps,\" says Nick Stephanopoulos, a professor specializing in election law at Harvard Law School.   The next batch of filing deadlines arrives in December. Still, Stephanopoulos notes these cut-off dates are \"just products of state law.\"   \"If a state legislature that's hellbent on gerrymandering wants to do so, it wouldn't be especially surprising if that same legislature delayed the filing deadline, potentially even change the date of the primary election, in order to give themselves enough time to gerrymander,\" Stephanopoulos says.      \n      Last month, Louisiana's Republican-controlled legislature shifted the state's election calendar, pushing its cutoff date for candidate declarations from January to February, and the spring primary from April to May.   The change could take advantage of a possible earlier-than-usual decision from the Supreme Court, which typically releases major rulings in June. Louisiana had asked the justices for a decision in the state's redistricting case early next year, given the calendar crunch.   In Alabama, which has a January deadline ahead of a May primary election, a Republican state lawmaker is proposing to allow a special primary to be held by August if a change to a voting map is \"made at a time too late to be accommodated during the normal primary election schedule.\"   There's no definitive list of districts protected by Section 2   Which other states may rush to respond to a weakening of redistricting requirements under the Voting Rights Act's Section 2 is hard to predict, says Michael Li, a redistricting expert at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's law school.   \n   To begin with, Li explains, there is no definitive list of Section 2 districts that could be affected by the Supreme Court's ruling because states usually don't explain their reasoning for drawing the boundaries of a voting district the way they do. To come up with a list, \"you'd have to go district by district and do a case-by-case assessment of whether there actually is Section 2 liability or not,\" Li says.   And some states may start claiming a district was drawn to get in line with Section 2 even if the law would not have required an opportunity district for racial minority voters.   \"It may just be an excuse to get rid of heavily minority districts even if there's not a legal obligation to do so,\" Li adds.   \n   On the other hand, some Republican-led states may want to try to keep Section 2 districts that are Democratic-leaning in place.   \"There are many places in the country where getting rid of Section 2 districts would make neighboring Republican districts much more competitive. And that may not be what Republicans want,\" Li says. \"It's more efficient for Republicans to have a heavily Black, and thus heavily Democratic, district to sop up as many of these high-turnout Black voters as possible.\"   Another wild card amid the ongoing mid-decade gerrymandering fight is how Democratic-led states would react in a redistricting world without Section 2's current requirements.   \"If blue states elsewhere observe Republicans massively gerrymandering, flipping 10 to 15 minority-opportunity districts and giving Republicans a big structural advantage in the battle for the U.S. House, I think there's going to be enormous pressure to respond to offset those gerrymanders in blue states,\" says Stephanopoulos at Harvard Law School. \"At this point, the only remaining way to do that is by weakening some of the districts that are now held by minority-preferred candidates in blue states.\"   \n   Edited by Benjamin Swasey\n",

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R) speaks alongside President Trump at a campaign event  when he was a presidential candidate, in Rome, Georgia, on March 9, 2024.\n                \n                    Elijah Nouvelage/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Elijah Nouvelage/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   To the casual observer, President Trump's withdrawal of his political endorsement of Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, calling her a \"traitor\" after she questioned his opposition to releasing Justice Department files on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, may have come as a surprise.   He did reverse course Sunday night, calling on the House to pass a measure to release the files \"because we have nothing to hide.\"   \n   After joining the House in 2021, she has also recently apologized for \"toxic politics,\" warned Trump's attacks have jeopardized her family's safety and reiterated her support for Trump's presidency.   Still, the public fight over the Epstein files is the culmination of months of criticism from some conservatives toward Trump's policy agenda, as cracks in the MAGA coalition begin to show.   Other splits with Trump   Since Trump returned to office in January, there have been several moments in the background – and sometimes foreground – where some on the right say the president hasn't delivered on domestic priorities that \"Make America Great Again\" like he promised on the campaign trail.   \n   For almost every instance, Greene has been there to articulate the disconnect.   \n   When the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear sites in June, Greene was among those who questioned how that fit with Trump's promise to end wars.   \"Six months in Steve, and here we are turning back on the campaign promises and we bombed Iran on behalf of Israel,\" Greene said on Steve Bannon's War Room show.   As some Republicans expressed concern over humanitarian conditions caused by Israel's war in Gaza, Greene called Israel's actions \"genocide\" on social media.   In October, the Trump White House authorized a $20 billion currency swap with Argentina in an effort to stabilize the South American country's economy and suggested plans to increase Argentine beef imports.   U.S. cattle ranchers and a slew of Republican lawmakers pushed back to little avail.   Speaking to Tucker Carlson last month, Greene said the money the administration is shepherding to Argentina is \"one of the grossest things\" she has ever seen and \"doesn't understand how that is America First.\"   \"It's honestly a punch in the gut to all of our American cattle ranchers and they are furious and rightfully so,\" Greene said.   Then there's Republican unease with things like mass deportations and tariffs, restricting tech visas and redistricting, as different pockets of the party's big tent object to key pieces of Trump's second-term agenda.   \n   Marjorie Taylor Greene hasn't changed   Unlike others who have criticized Trump and moved away from the Republican Party, Greene is still one of the most conservative members of Congress and her clash with Trump does not change her ideological consistency.   Although her apology for prior toxicity, conflict with the president and appearances on forums like The View and CNN might seem to some like a pivot, Greene isn't actually changing anything about her conservative populist message – just noting ways that Republicans haven't lived up to her views.   \n   Over the last few weeks there were also signs that Trump would eventually lash out online and disown Greene politically.   \"I don't know what happened to Marjorie,\" Trump said. \"She's a nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think.\"   Some Republicans – including Greene – would argue that it's Trump who's lost his way.   \"I think that the American people deserve to be put first,\" she said on CNN Sunday. \"That's what 'Make America Great Again,' meant to me and I think that President Trump can do that if he refocuses his effort.\"   At last year's Republican National Convention, Greene called Trump the \"founding father\" of the \"America First\" movement. Now she's asserting that \"founding father\" does not equal sole arbiter of what the movement looks like moving forward.   The president's changing hold over the GOP    Trump has dominated the Republican Party for a decade by creating a big tent of many different – and sometimes conflicting – ideological groups and getting them to agree to his views and priorities. That's starting to change, especially as he faces record unpopularity and continues to break with his base's ideas of conservatism.   Trump will not be on the ballot in next year's midterms, and it's not clear how much influence he will wield over who Republican primary voters pick in the 2028 presidential contest.   \n   In what would always have been a question of what a post-Trump GOP looks like, Greene's criticism is forcing Republicans to confront that question much earlier than they had planned – and with much less certainty about the possible directions the party might go.\n",

The arrangement resolves litigation filed by NPR accusing the corporation of illegally yielding to Trump's demands that the network be financially punished for its news coverage. The argument, part of a broader lawsuit by NPR and several stations against the Trump administration, focused on CPB funding for NPR's operation of a satellite distribution system for local public radio stations. NPR announced Monday it would waive all fees for the stations associated with the satellite service.    \n   The judge in the case had explicitly told CPB's legal team he did not find its defense credible. CPB lawyers had argued that the decision to award a contract instead to Public Media Infrastructure, a new consortium of public media institutions, was driven by a desire to foster digital innovations more swiftly.    \"The settlement is a victory for editorial independence and a step toward upholding the First Amendment rights of NPR and the public media system in our legal challenge to [Trump's] Executive Order,\" Katherine Maher, President and CEO of NPR, said in a statement. \"While we entered into this dispute with CPB reluctantly, we're glad to resolve it in a way that enables us to continue to provide for the stability of the Public Radio Satellite System, offer immediate and direct support to public radio stations across the country, and proceed with our strong and substantive claims against this illegal and unconstitutional Executive Order. We look forward to our day in court in December.\"   In its submission Monday evening to the court, CPB did not concede that it had acted wrongfully — nor that it had yielded to political pressure from the administration.   Instead, in a statement posted on its website, CPB asserted its side \"prevails\" as a result of the settlement.    \n   \"This is an important moment for public media,\" said Patricia Harrison, president and CEO of CPB. \"We are very pleased that this costly and unnecessary litigation is over, and that our investment in the future through [Public Media Infrastructure] marks an exciting new era for public media.\" The contract with PMI will continue, CPB said.   Federal subsidies for public broadcasting stopped on Oct. 1 as a result of a party-line vote over the summer by Congress, called a rescission. Only a skeleton crew remains at CPB, which was created as a nonprofit corporation more than a half-century ago to funnel federal subsidies to public media. While PBS has had layoffs and NPR is monitoring its own finances, many local stations across the country have been hit hard.   Over the course of the litigation this fall, mounting evidence appeared to demonstrate that CPB's board chair and executives had acted against NPR in what turned out to be a futile attempt to salvage the corporation's own future.   \n   In hearings last month in Washington, D.C., U.S. District Court Judge Randolph Moss told CPB's legal team they had not made a credible case for why the corporation reneged on the contract just a day after a top White House official warned senior CPB leaders against doing business with NPR. A trial had been set to start on Dec. 1.   CPB's change of mind — and NPR's ensuing lawsuit — sparked consternation and unease within the larger public media ecosystem. The two organizations had served as partners for decades. But that relationship frayed earlier this year, as the system came under attack from the Trump administration.   \n   Trump's public campaign against NPR and PBS started in earnest soon after he returned to the White House. Trump kicked it into high gear in late March with a series of social media posts.   In early April, CPB leaders sought to get money out the door before Trump took action against public media. On April 2, CPB's board approved the extension of a contract with NPR to distribute public radio programs, including those not produced by NPR. The arrangement stretched back four decades. The amount included millions still due on the then-current contract.   \n   The next day, CPB's board chair and two senior executives met with a top White House budget official who attested to her \"intense dislike for NPR.\" The budget official told them CPB didn't have to \"throw the baby out with the bathwater,\" according to a deposition from CPB executive Clayton Barsoum submitted as part of NPR's legal filings.   \n   And the day after that — just 48 hours after that board vote — CPB reversed itself. CPB executive Kathy Merritt informed NPR's top official over the satellite and distribution service that it had to be spun off: it could not be part of NPR. NPR refused to do so. CPB revised the scope of the contract and solicited new bids. NPR's submission proved unsuccessful.   Meanwhile, the White House was ramping up the pressure. It accused NPR and PBS of bias. On April 14, for example, it issued a formal statement that called their offerings \"radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news'.\" NPR and PBS's chief executives have rejected the accusations of bias.   On May 1, Trump issued an executive order that no federal money should go to the two public broadcasting networks. NPR and three Colorado public radio stations then filed suit against the White House, saying they were being unlawfully punished because the president did not like their news coverage. They contended the executive order represented a violation of First Amendment protections. Their suit names CPB as a defendant as well for, in their characterization, bending to the president's will. In Monday's legal filing, CPB agreed that the executive order was precisely the sort of government interference that Congress sought to prevent in establishing CPB as it did.     In the summer, Republican leaders in Congress, urged on by Trump, pulled back all $1.1 billion for future public broadcasting that had already been approved and signed into law by the president.   \n   Throughout the legal battle, NPR has said, regardless of the outcome of the case, it would work with Public Media Infrastructure.     NPR's broader constitutional case against Trump's executive order continues. A hearing on its merits is scheduled for next month.

He replaced previous acting head Cameron Hamilton in May.   DHS did not comment on the details of Richardson's departure, but a FEMA employee familiar with the matter told The Associated Press that Richardson resigned. The employee spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the changes with the media.   \n   \"The Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security extend their sincere appreciation to the Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Administrator, David Richardson, for his dedicated service and wish him continued success in his return to the private sector,\" a DHS spokesperson told The Associated Press.   The Washington Post first reported the news about Richardson's resignation.   \n   A former Marine Corps officer who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and also led the DHS Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction office, Richardson had no previous emergency management experience when he assumed the role of \"senior official performing the duties of administrator\" in May.   After replacing Hamilton, who was fired one day after telling a House appropriations committee that he did not think FEMA should be eliminated, Richardson vowed to help fulfill President Donald Trump's goal to push more disaster recovery responsibilities to the states and told FEMA employees he would \" run right over \" anyone who tried to obstruct that mission.   But Richardson's leadership was questioned by members of Congress and FEMA employees, particularly after remaining largely out of sight after the deadly Texas floods last July that killed at least 136 people.   \n   When asked by a House committee in July why he did not arrive on the ground until one week after the disaster, Richardson said he stayed in Washington, D.C., to \"kick down the doors of bureaucracy,\" but also said he was camping with his sons for the July 4 weekend when the floods first hit and initially helped manage the response from inside his truck.   Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has also kept a tight grip on FEMA programs and spending, requiring that she personally approve any agency expenditure over $100,000. Richardson had denied reports that the approval policy slowed down FEMA's response in Texas.   \n   FEMA Chief of Staff and former cybersecurity official Karen Evans will assume the role on Dec. 1, according to DHS. The FEMA administrator is required by law to have emergency management experience, but the Trump administration has circumvented those requirements up to now by appointing temporary leaders.   The agency has undergone major upheaval since Trump returned to office in January promising to vastly overhaul if not eliminate the agency. About 18% of the agency's permanent full-time employees had departed as of June, including 24 senior-level staffers, according to the Government Accountability Office.   \n   The Trump administration also has slashed mitigation funding, placed requirements on preparedness grants that compel recipients to comply with Trump's immigration agenda, and denied several states' requests for major disaster declaration requests.   DHS did not respond to questions about whether Richardson will still lead the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office.   Trump appointed a 12-member review council led by Noem and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to deliver recommendations on how to reform FEMA and push more responsibility to the states for disaster preparedness, response and recovery. The council is expected to deliver its recommendations in December.\n",

Many commenters, including some of Trump's own supporters, hated the idea. They complained that it would result in Americans being in debt for their entire adult lives, essentially renting from a bank. They complained that this type of mortgage would explode the amount of interest homeowners would have to pay over the lifetime of their loans. They complained that borrowers would be stuck paying interest-only payments for many years and be prevented from actually paying down their principal and building equity in their homes.   \n   \"It will ultimately reward the banks, mortgage lenders, and home builders while people pay far more in interest over time and die before they ever pay off their home,\" posted Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green (R-Ga.). \"In debt forever, in debt for life!\"   President Trump \"is creating generational debt,\" said Josh Johnson on The Daily Show. \"They're going to be fighting to get out of grandma's will. Grandkids will be like, 'I barely knew her!'\" (Side note: Josh Johnson is very funny. I'm a fan.)   The uproar over the 50-year mortgage idea reached such a high pitch that apparently the White House was furious with the administration official who pitched President Trump the idea, according to reporting from Politico.   Sure, it won't solve our housing affordability problem. But is a 50-year mortgage really such a crazy idea?   \"It's not quite as outlandish as it sounds,\" says John Campbell, an economist at Harvard University.   \"Honestly, I kind of think it's a fine idea,\" says Eric Zwick, an economist at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business. \"It's not obviously so different from a 30-year fixed mortgage.\"   The 50 vs The 30   First of all, the reality is most homeowners ditch their mortgage well before its end date. Some refinance. Others move.   \n   In America, unlike some other countries, including the UK, you can't take your mortgage with you if you sell your house. So when people sell their house and move, they end their mortgages.   The typical American homeowner spends less than 12 years in their home, according to a Redfin analysis of the U.S. Census data. That's actually high compared to recent history. Back in the early 2000s, Americans typically spent only about seven years in their houses.   \" Most people will not have that 50-year mortgage product for that length of time,\" says Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist of Redfin. \"I think in a world where this product exists, a lot of people might sign up for it initially and then try to refinance later.\"   In other words, the 50-year mortgage would not be a 50-year trap. It would basically serve as another option on the menu for homebuyers looking to finance their homes. And, because you have longer to pay off the loan, it comes with the benefit of having somewhat lower monthly payments. Maybe that could help some secure their dream house or reap the benefits of investing in the housing market.    \"I think affordability is a concern in the housing market,\" Zwick says. \"And one element is the down payment, but another element is the monthly payment. And a longer duration mortgage is gonna lower the monthly payment.\"   And, sure, there are real drawbacks to this sort of financing, including especially a much higher interest bill over the life of the loan and an extended period where homeowners aren't paying down their principal and building equity. But those same issues also arise with the 30-year fixed mortgage, albeit to a lesser degree.   And Americans apparently love the 30-year mortgage. More than 90% of American mortgage holders have one!   The American mortgage market is weird   The fact that so many American homeowners have long-term, fixed rate mortgages, and they're able to basically refinance pretty easily whenever they want, makes the U.S. mortgage market pretty weird compared to most other countries.   \n   We won't get into the complicated history here (we might actually do a Planet Money episode on this history in the future). But, for now, we'll say the 30-year mortgages date back to the Depression era. And they're fundamentally a creature of government intervention. The government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy mortgages from private lenders, allowing them to offload (and socialize) the risks associated with lending large sums of money for decades at fixed interest rates.   Without this intervention, the 30-year mortgage would probably not be so ubiquitous. I mean, think about it. Would you want to lend someone hundreds of thousands of dollars for decades and freeze the amount they will pay you for providing them with that money? What if they lose their jobs or die? What if interest rates skyrocket and you can find much more favorable terms for lending out that money? And then, to boot, if interest rates fall, the borrower can just walk away from that loan and get a new mortgage at any time when economic conditions are more favorable to them? I mean, yikes. No thanks.   A long time ago, Planet Money interviewed financial journalist Bethany McLean about 30-year fixed mortgages, and she described them as \"a financial Frankenstein's monster\" from the perspective of lenders.   Without an important role for the government in backing these loans, \"I don't think any rational bank would offer this product,\" says David Berger, an economist at Duke University.   \" You need the public sector to play an important role for really long duration mortgages to be viable in the financial system,\" says Joseph Gyourko, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.   It helps explain why this sort of mortgage system is so rare in the world.   The Pros of long-term, fixed-rate mortgages    There are some clear benefits of the weird mortgage system we have in the United States. One is lower monthly payments because homebuyers can pay off their loans over 30 years. Another is homebuyers are given an incredible ability to freeze their housing costs in stone and then refinance when it suits them.   \n   Several of the economists we spoke to had 30-year mortgages themselves, and they had refinanced when rates sank below 3 percent a few years ago. They were very nice people, but I hate them now. (I bought a house more recently and the mortgage rate is close to 7 percent).   Anyways, the ability to freeze rates and then refinance later if the opportunity arises is clearly a huge benefit to homebuyers. It offers predictability on your housing costs. And, especially nice, a fixed-rate mortgage basically shields you from inflation and its accompanying higher interest rates. Everything else may get more expensive, but your housing payment actually falls in real terms when there's inflation!   The Cons of long-term, fixed-rate mortgages   That said, as we already alluded to, both 30-year and hypothetical 50-year mortgages come with costs: they tend to have higher interest rates than adjustable rate mortgages and you have a longer period upfront paying interest and not actually paying down your loan much.   But there's more.   If the housing market gets dicey and prices start plummeting, having a large outstanding loan at a fixed interest rate can create serious problems. Gyourko, the economist at Wharton, says long-term, fixed-rate mortgages increase the probability that you can go underwater on your home, a situation where you owe more on your house than it's worth.   \" The borrower on a really long duration loan — 30 or 50 — does not build equity very quickly at all,\" Gyourko says. \" There's a risk that if there's a severe drop in house prices, you go underwater.\"   Going underwater is a nightmare. If you sell, it means the money you get won't cover your debt. It gets much harder to refinance, meaning you're stuck with a higher interest rate than you could otherwise get in a situation where the housing market tanks.   If you have a fixed-interest rate and the housing market tanks, \"your house price goes down and you're kind of stuck,\" says Berger, the economist at Duke. \"No one is gonna lend to you when you're underwater. If you had an adjustable rate, your rate would've just dropped automatically,\" and maybe that would help you make your housing payments and not lose your house.   \n   \"And are you more likely or less likely to be laid off if house prices drop a lot? Answer: more likely,\" Gyourko says. \"So you run that risk of those two events coinciding, and then you've lost a huge amount of your personal wealth.\"   Depending on the state of the economy, the direction of interest rates, and your financial circumstances, it might not make sense to fix your interest rate. Actually, that may be the case right now. Interest rates spiked in 2022 and 2023 and have already started to come down, and many expect them to go down further, especially if the economy enters a recession.   \" Right now, I think it does make more sense for people to get an adjustable rate mortgage,\" Fairweather, the chief economist at Redfin, says.   Adjustable-rate mortgages typically start with lower interest rates than fixed rate mortgages. Fairweather says you can think about the choice to buy a long-term, fixed-rate mortgage instead of an adjustable rate mortgage as effectively paying extra for insurance against future interest rate hikes. And, just like the standard advice for buying any other kind of insurance, \"you don't really want to get insurance if you can afford to self-insure,\" she says. In other words, if you think you could afford the possibility that interest rates spike in the near future, it probably makes sense to get an adjustable rate mortgage.   \" So if you get the adjustable rate mortgage, what I would advise is to make sure you have some room in your budget left over for when the mortgage rate resets potentially at a higher level so that you're not hit with costs that you aren't able to pay,\" Fairweather says. \"But if you could take that savings and you know, put it in your savings account, then you'll probably end up a-okay with an adjustable rate mortgage and actually save money compared to the fixed rate.\"   \n   Fixed-rate mortgages may distort our economy   But there are other, economy-wide issues with having so many mortgage-holders with long-term fixed rates.   One is that the government involvement in the housing market that makes our system of widespread 30-year mortgages possible can occasionally result in big problems for taxpayers, especially if regulators aren't vigilant in preventing shady loan practices. Just see what happened during the global financial crisis back in the late 2000s.   \"The worst possible situation is what happened in the global financial crisis when Fannie and Freddie were basically insolvent, were put on the treasury's balance sheet and to this day remain there,\" Gyourko says.   Another problem with America's weird system of ubiquitous fixed-rate mortgages is that it may weaken the Fed's ability to juice the economy or lower inflation when needed (aka conduct monetary policy).   That's because fixed-rate mortgage holders are shielded from interest rate changes. If everyone had an adjustable rate mortgage, the Fed could maybe more easily juice the economy by lowering people's monthly payments, nudging them to spend more in the economy. That said, if interest rates go low enough, it will induce many American homeowners to refinance, lower their payments, and potentially goad them to increase their spending and boost the economy.   In inflationary times though, when the Fed needs to bring down spending in the economy, the Fed's job may be tougher and more distortionary to the economy. If everyone were on adjustable rates, the Fed could just raise rates and, boom, homeowners would probably start spending less and inflation would come down. But most American homeowners are shielded from rate increases, so it's new homebuyers — often younger people — who feel more of the pain. Some argue that's unfair.   Speaking of unfairness, Harvard's John Campbell points out that maximizing your personal wealth in our weird mortgage system relies on considerable financial literacy, and populations that are poorer and less educated tend to be less financially literate. So this system results in greater inequality.   \n   \"A lot of people don't know when to refinance and they just don't do it,\" Campbell says. \"And there's some very troubling evidence that, in this country, black and Hispanic borrowers are much slower to refinance than white borrowers.\" The result, he says, is they tend to pay higher interest rates.   There's another problem with our system: lock in. This has been talked about in recent years. There are tons of homeowners out there who now have rock-bottom interest rates on their mortgages — like, ahem, many of the very financially literate economists I spoke to — and they're reluctant to move.   Lock-in may be one reason why American home prices have been stubbornly high over the past few years, even as interest rates have spiked. Other countries, where adjustable rate mortgages are more the norm, have seen their housing prices dip a lot more in recent years.   \" I think that their housing markets are more reactive to their overall economies,\" Fairweather says. \"So in other places where there's more adjustable rate mortgages, when interest rates go up, that means that homeowners have a reason to sell because their payments are going up. And if they can't afford them or they don't want to pay them, then they'll put their homes on the market.  In our housing market, that doesn't happen. There is this unequal treatment between first time home buyers and existing homeowners. And it really benefits long-term homeowners.\"   Even more, economists believe that the lock-in that fixed mortgages create is bad for the economy. Many people may be refusing jobs where they could be more productive because they don't want to move.   The real fix for housing affordability   So, yeah, many of the problems identified with the 50-year mortgage idea are also present with the 30-year mortgage.   The real motivation for this idea is to enable more Americans to buy houses. With high prices and higher interest rates than a few years ago, many Americans are priced out.   \n   The economists we spoke to all stressed that this new financial product will not solve the fundamental problem of housing affordability. To do that, we need to start building a lot more homes. Some even said that by juicing demand with this new financial product and not increasing supply, this proposal could actually make housing prices go higher, contributing to the problem.   \"Proposals to help home buyers — whether it's this 50-year mortgage or whether it's Kamala Harris's proposal in her presidential campaign to give money to first time homebuyers — the main beneficiaries are actually the people selling houses,\" Campbell says. \"Because given the supply, if you make it easier for buyers, they're bidding against each other for the same supply. The price is gonna go up. The winner is gonna be the person selling.\"   So, yeah, we need to build more homes. But, in that world, maybe a 50-year mortgage would have some benefits for some people. Of course, they will need to know the facts about this financial product and make sure it's the right product for them.   Berger, the economist at Duke, recommends that the government invest more in helping Americans become more financially literate about mortgages and provide better information about alternative financial options to the 30-year mortgage. This stuff is complicated!\n",

She told lawmakers that she was there in support of Maine Family Planning, a 50-year-old network of reproductive health clinics where Smith is a patient.   State lawmakers were considering how to make up a funding shortfall from Washington, D.C. where Republicans in Congress aimed to cut off federal funding to clinics that provide abortion.   Smith told the committee that she doesn't have health insurance and that Maine Family Planning's nonprofit clinics were her only source of health care.   \n   \"In the last four years I've received care there, not once did I have an abortion,\" Smith testified. \"I did, however, have access to STD and STI (sexually transmitted disease and infection) testing, referrals for thyroid testing and blood panels, pap smears, breast examinations, referrals for mammograms, and a premenstrual dysphoric disorder diagnosis. The last two I listed saved my life,\" she said.   Smith, who's 36, says she was inspired to testify and write an op-ed, because she's worried about what would happen if Maine Family Planning had to close in the face of deep federal funding cuts. \"I can't imagine what would happen to our communities if we lost such a keystone — that's what really fueled my fire,\" she says.   Maine Family Planning did get a year of additional funding from the state, but it also lost Medicaid revenue for one year with the passage of President Trump's tax and spending bill — a 20% hit to the organization's funding.   \n   The \"defund\" effort beyond Planned Parenthood   In Maine, abortion is legal and widely supported by the electorate. In a poll released by the Pew Research Center this summer, 72% of Mainers say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. The state legislature has moved to expand access to abortion care since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade three years ago.   Now, the Trump administration and congressional Republicans are using federal funding as a lever to restrict abortion access in states, like Maine, where it is legal and protected by state law.   \n   Republicans and anti-abortion rights activists have long sought to end Medicaid dollars flowing to Planned Parenthood for any reason, arguing that federal reimbursement even for unrelated services indirectly supports abortion in clinics that specialize in reproductive health. In July, they were finally able to accomplish that goal.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Maine Family Planning operates 18 clinics around the state, including this one in Augusta, Maine. It provides primary care in addition to a full range of reproductive health care.\n                \n                    Greta Rybus for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Greta Rybus for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   The provision in the law blocks federal Medicaid funds from being paid to reproductive health nonprofits that receive more than $800,000 in Medicaid payments in a year. It took effect when the bill was signed by President Trump on July 4. (Republican senators changed the timeline from a decade to a single year of defunding to comply with Senate rules.)   Very few organizations fit the $800,000+ description. Planned Parenthood is one of them, another is Health Imperatives in Massachusetts, and so is Maine Family Planning.   \"Where am I going to go?\"   About half of Maine Family Planning's patients are on Medicaid. The organization is no longer reimbursed for their visits.   That's about $2 million gone, says George Hill, Maine Family Planning's president and CEO.   \"That's difficult. You have to make some difficult decisions,\" he says. \"Either you generate more revenue, or you cut costs.\"   \n   On Oct. 1, the organization let patients know they would be ending primary care services at the end of the month at three clinics in the far reaches of the state: Houlton, Presque Isle and Ellsworth. That change affected nearly 1,000 patients, including patients on Medicaid and those with private insurance.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                George Hill, Maine Family Planning's president and CEO has worked in health care for almost 40 years. \"We have a mission,\" explains Hill, \"to make sure that the full range of sexual and reproductive health care is available to as many patients as possible.\"\n                \n                    Selena Simmons-Duffin/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Selena Simmons-Duffin/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"The day that our portal message went out [to patients], the phones just started ringing off the hook,\" says clinical services director Melissa Gray. \"It was the same message over and over again: 'Where am I going to go? You folks have helped me with things that nobody else had helped me with, I never felt like you were judging me. I don't want a different provider, I want to keep seeing you.'   \n   \"It was really heartbreaking and a hard couple of days for staff,\" she says.   Gray and her team spent all of October trying to connect those patients to new doctors, and making sure they were set up with enough refills of medications to last them when there were long waits before they could be seen by the new practice. Maine has a health care provider shortage, which made that task harder, she says. \"There already weren't enough providers — we were getting new patient requests all the time,\" she says. \"Now there's less.\"   The goal of scaling back primary care was to try to preserve family planning for longer. All 18 of their family planning clinics around the state are still open. \"We have a mission,\" explains Hill. \"And our mission is to make sure that the full range of sexual and reproductive health care is available to as many patients as possible.\"   They're still seeing Medicaid patients for sexual and reproductive health without getting paid for it.   A stack of billing sheets, just in case   One of their clinics is in Thomaston, Maine, a small town along the coast. Vanessa Shields-Haas is the nurse practitioner there. The clinic is bright and friendly, with colorful \"condom art\" on a bulletin board in the waiting room.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The rotating seasonal scenes in the waiting room at the Maine Family Planning clinic in Thomaston are crafted from colored condoms.  \"I think they're fun,\" nurse practitioner Vanessa Shields-Haas says. \"Patients love them.\"\n                \n                    Selena Simmons-Duffin/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Selena Simmons-Duffin/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Shields-Haas is infuriated by the funding cuts to Maine Family Planning and what they mean for her patients.   \"A lot of my patients — maybe they're working at a hotel or they're waiting tables, they're serving lobster rolls to hungry tourists, starting oyster farms,\" she says. \"These are people that are working really hard.\"   She does a lot for them: fertility treatments, biopsies, prescription refills, even vasectomies. And she's continued to do all those things for her patients covered by Medicaid without getting reimbursed.   \"We haven't been turning them away,\" she says. \"I fill out the billing sheets and we stack them up in the event that we could be reimbursed possibly in the future.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Vanessa Shields-Haas has been providing medical care for patients covered by Medicaid without getting reimbursed. \"We haven't been turning them away,\" she says.\n                \n                    Selena Simmons-Duffin/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Selena Simmons-Duffin/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   She says patients are confused by what's happening, and many have sent her messages asking if they can still go to her for care. She assures them that they can, although she worries about the future.   \n   \"Unfortunately, decision-makers in Washington are having such a profound impact on what we can and can't do,\" she says. \"Not being able to be reimbursed for the visits is really crippling, financially.\"   A legal challenge   For George Hill, political interference in sexual and reproductive health care is nothing new. \"I've been in the field since 1987, so close to 40 years, [through] several different presidential administrations that have been hostile to the care that we now provide,\" he says. \"This is — by volume and velocity — probably the worst that we have seen.\"   Just weeks after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into law, Maine Family Planning filed a lawsuit to challenge the provision that blocks them from getting Medicaid funding.   \"The lawsuit was filed essentially because Maine Family Planning says this is unfair and it's wrong and it's unconstitutional to be singling out and targeting certain providers based on this animus against abortion,\" says Autumn Katz, interim director of litigation at the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represents the organization in its lawsuit.   \n   The federal government defended the provision in a court filing, arguing that it promotes Congress' \"goal of reducing abortion\" and suggesting Maine Family Planning could get its funding back if it stopped providing abortion.   (Planned Parenthood filed a separate lawsuit and was able to secure an injunction. In Maine, the injunction request was denied and so the provision is in effect while the lawsuit works its way through the courts.)   Another threat looms   Anti-abortion efforts at the federal level may not stop with the Medicaid law.   Another 20% of Maine Family Planning's budget comes from the federal government through Title X — a decades-old grant program that enables the clinics to see uninsured patients. In October, the Trump administration fired the whole team that works on that program. Those firings were reversed in mid-November as part of the deal to end the shutdown, but the administration could try to end the program in another way.   \n   Hill says he isn't sure what's going to happen next with the lawsuit and Medicaid, or Title X, but he says they're not giving up. The state law that patient Ashley Smith advocated for provides short term funding from the state to help fill the budget gap. Hill says they're exploring new potential partnerships and new ways to raise revenue they haven't tried before.   He quotes Rep. Pat Schroeder, the late Democratic lawmaker from Colorado: \"You can't roll up your sleeves and get to work if you're wringing your hands,\" he says. \"We're going to continue to do the work. We're not going to stop.\"\n",

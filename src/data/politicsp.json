    "body": "\n      Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is under scrutiny over strikes in the Caribbean and Yemen, and the Supreme Court sided with Republicans in a case over gerrymandering in Texas.   \n\n    EYDER PERALTA, HOST:  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is under scrutiny this week over two different strikes, one against alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean, the other against Houthi militants in Yemen - what's become known as Signalgate. NPR's senior contributor Ron Elving joins us now. Hey, Ron.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Hey. Good to be with you, Eyder.PERALTA: So, Ron, on the alleged drug boats, members of Congress saw video of the September 2 strike, and Republicans and Democrats came away with very different versions of what they saw when two survivors were killed. How do you make sense of that?ELVING: It takes some effort to make any sense of it at all. There's a lot we don't know about these boats, but let's just say it was hit as part of the U.S. war on drugs. If so, then these men in question, back on September 2, might qualify as enemy combatants left wounded on the battlefield, which puts us in war crime territory. Yet, the first Republican senator emerging from that closed-door hearing on Thursday, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, himself a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said, quote, \"we killed them, and we were right to kill them.\" He said both strikes on the boat were \"righteous,\" unquote, and reports in the media were a lie and defamatory.So there is broad disagreement about the facts that goes well beyond grudging loyalty to Hegseth. It may even go beyond loyalty to Trump himself. And we see something similar in regard to so-called Signalgate. That was where the Defense Department's only - own, rather, inspector general this week released a report saying that by discussing the mission details of that strike over an insecure chat app. Hegseth endangered the mission and the lives of American service members. The White House called the same inspector general report, quote, \"a total exoneration.\" So here again we see an us-versus-them mentality that overrides all other considerations.PERALTA: Yeah. And speaking of Signal, we should mention NPR's CEO, Katherine Maher, also chairs the board of the Signal Foundation. Its subsidiary makes the messaging app. But let's talk about the Supreme Court. This week, justices weighed in on the gerrymandered voting maps in Texas. They sided with Republicans. This could mean five more GOP seats in Congress next year. Where do things stand nationally in this redistricting arms race?ELVING: Well, there are still some states fighting the map wars, including Missouri and Indiana, and more states may get drawn into the fray by court rulings, so the national outcome is unclear. The Texas Map could add five Republican seats, but that's not guaranteed - might be only three. And meanwhile, the gerrymanders adopted in retaliation to Texas by Democrats in California and Virginia could yield more. In the long run, it could be a wash or a marginal gain for the GOP, and two or three seats may not matter much come next November. Right now, polls are indicating Democrats are in for a strong showing in those midterm elections in November coming. History tells us presidents have lost seats in the midterms nine times out of 10 since World War II. And the lower a president's public approval, the more seats are lost. And right now, Trump's at 36% in the Gallup poll, lower than any president they've been measured - that they have measured at Gallup, other than Richard Nixon.PERALTA: So, Ron, the Supreme Court also announced yesterday it will hear another case over President Trump's effort to end birthright citizenship. It seems the court has shown a lot of deference to the president so far this term. Do you think that's going to hold true here?ELVING: Birthright citizenship goes back to the 14th Amendment in the aftermath of the Civil War. There's always been some debate over whether it applied only to the formerly enslaved or to new arrivals in the country who have babies here. Should those babies automatically become citizens, even if their parents aren't? The longstanding answer has been yes, but there has also been a body of opinion opposed to that. We had anti-immigration surges in the mid-1800s and in the 1920s, and Trump's broad-scale assault on immigration has, in effect, closed the southern border and unleashed aggressive deportation efforts. But this birthright citizenship case, seeking to change the way we have long understood the Constitution, would be his biggest trophy yet.PERALTA: That's NPR's Ron Elving. Ron, thank you.ELVING: Thank you, Eyder.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

A panel of judges at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals says the firings were lawful.\n                \n                    Mike Scarcella/Reuters; FM Archive / Alamy Stock Photo\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mike Scarcella/Reuters; FM Archive / Alamy Stock Photo\n    \n\n   \n   The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals said in a 2-to-1 ruling that President Trump acted lawfully in firing two members of independent agencies, despite federal laws that hold they can only be fired for cause, because they wield significant executive power.   The ruling comes as the Supreme Court prepares to hear arguments in a similar case on Monday.   The case decided by the appeals court was brought by Cathy Harris, a Democratic member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, and Gwynne Wilcox, a Democratic member of the National Labor Relations Board. Trump fired both within weeks of taking office but did not cite any permissible reason, such as neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.   \n   The MSPB hears federal employees' appeals of personnel actions taken by the government. The NLRB hears appeals of cases involving unfair labor practices and oversees union elections, among other duties. Both have multiple members appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, who serve staggered terms.   \n   Initially, lower courts ordered the two officials reinstated, citing a 1935 Supreme Court decision known as Humphrey's Executor. In that unanimous decision, the court held that while the president has the power to remove purely executive officers for any reason, that unlimited power does not extend to agencies whose duties \"are neither political nor executive, but predominantly quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative.\"   The Trump administration appealed, and in May, the Supreme Court weighed in with an emergency order allowing the firings of Harris and Wilcox to stand pending a merits hearing in their combined case.   \"The stay reflects our judgment that the Government is likely to show that both the NLRB and MSPB exercise considerable executive power,\" the Supreme Court majority wrote in the unsigned order.   On Friday, the D.C. Circuit fulfilled that prediction. In the majority opinion, U.S. Circuit Court Judge Gregory Katsas, a Trump appointee, cited the substantive rulemaking powers of the MSPB and the NLRB, as well the agencies' broad powers to order things like reinstatement and back pay.   \n   Katsas declined to address whether the president can still fire officers at agencies that are \"purely adjudicatory\" in nature, nor did he wade into the thorny question of whether members of the Federal Reserve should remain insulated from the president's reach.   The dissent came from U.S. Circuit Court Judge Florence Pan, a Biden appointee. She argued that the MSPB and the NLRB do not in fact wield substantial executive power, and she warned of the consequences of granting the president control over such bodies.   \"We may soon be living in a world in which every hiring decision and action by any government agency will be influenced by politics, with little regard for subject-matter expertise, the public good, and merit-based decision-making,\" she wrote.\n",

In addition to Trump's birthday — which coincides with Flag Day (June 14) — the updated calendar of fee-free dates includes the 110th anniversary of the NPS (August 25), Constitution Day (September 17) and President Teddy Roosevelt's birthday (October 27). The changes will take effect starting January 1.   \n   Non-U.S. residents will still be required to pay entrance fees on those dates under the new \"America-first pricing\" policy. At 11 of some of the country's most popular national parks, international visitors will be charged an extra $100, on top of the standard entrance fee, and the annual pass for non-residents will go up to $250. The annual pass for residents will be $80.   The move follows a July executive order from the White House that called to increase fees applied to non-American visitors to national parks and grant citizens and residents \"preferential treatment with respect to any remaining recreational access rules, including permitting or lottery rules.\"   The Department of the Interior, which oversees NPS, called the new fee-exempted dates \"patriotic fee-free days,\" in an announcement that lauded the changes as \"Trump's commitment to making national parks more accessible, more affordable and more efficient for the American people.\"   The Interior Department did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment.   Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a statement: \"These policies ensure that U.S. taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations.\"   \n   The new calendar follows the Trump administration's previous moves to reshape U.S. history by asking patrons of national parks to flag any signs at sites deemed to cast a negative light on past or living Americans.\n",

    "body": "\n      It was a busy week in Washington, from foreign policy to Congressional redistricting and another special election. NPR's Domenico Montanaro and Tamara Keith break down the big news of the week.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  It was another busy week in politics. The Supreme Court approved controversial redistricting plans in Texas. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth was in hot water in part because of strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug boats in the Caribbean. Oh, and also, there was another special election. So we've asked senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith and senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro to join us today to take a step back and put all of this into context. Hi to both of you.TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hello.DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey.SUMMERS: Tam, I want to start with you and Secretary Hegseth, who was at the center of some really big scrutiny this week. Tell us what happened.KEITH: It all comes back to Hegseth's leadership and judgment as secretary of defense. He was clearly in the hot seat all week. There was concern about the boat strike on September 2, where there were survivors who were then hit a second time and killed. Top lawmakers on key committees went into a closed-door hearing this week with bipartisan concerns. During that meeting, they saw a full video of the strikes, and they came out divided over how alarmed people should be about what happened. And they were divided on partisan political lines.And that briefing up on the hill happened on the same day that an independent inspector general at the Department of Defense released a report that found, back in March, Hegseth had violated policy and risked the safety of U.S. service members by sharing sensitive military information in a group chat.MONTANARO: Yeah. And politically, I mean, we've seen Republicans come to Hegseth's defense clearly here. You know, they're pointing to former President Barack Obama for these double-tap drone missile firings in the war on terrorism that were really controversial. They're saying that he wrote the playbook on this. The Pentagon spokesman called the inspector general's report a, quote, \"total exoneration,\" but that's not quite true. And, you know, it's just another example in the Trump era of just saying something is true and then hoping the base will echo those talking points.And that's also been the case with Trump's recent racist comments about Somalis and Afghan refugees. You know, it's part of the Trump playbook to distract from worse news, like negative views of his handling of the economy, frankly, and go to xenophobia, immigration and other culture war issues. And his base has generally gone right along with that.SUMMERS: And Hegseth is one part of all of this. But what are we learning this week about the way that the Trump administration is approaching foreign policy and national defense?MONTANARO: Well, the White House put out a 33-page national security strategy document for the country. It's pretty notable for how Trump and his administration see the United States' role in the world. A few things really jumped out to me. One, there's real isolationist tendencies in it, noting, for example, quote, \"the affairs of other countries are our concern only if their activities directly threaten our interests.\" Second, there's a clear retrenchment and focus on the Western hemisphere, which we've seen already here. And thirdly, there's this very harsh, negative view of Europe. The document describes Europe as undergoing economic decline and, quote, \"civilizational erasure\" tied to migration.SUMMERS: But I have to say, this is not entirely surprising given what we've already seen and know about President Trump.KEITH: Yeah. It's in line with how he has governed. But the document does lay this out explicitly, and it is quite the crack up of the post World War II order of alliances that largely kept peace and security for the West for well more than half a century at this point. And the question I have with this document is, will this be an enduring position or will it shift depending on who the president's talking to, as policies often do under this president?SUMMERS: But at the same time, Republicans are grappling with a whole lot of data that suggests that voters are souring on Trump. Tell us what we're seeing.MONTANARO: Well, Trump is really at his lowest point in his presidency politically. His approval ratings are the lowest. He's seen averaging now in the high 30s. He's in the 20s in our polling with independents. And so much of that is about the economy. His handling of it is low, as the cost of living has really been the dominant issue on people's minds. And yet Trump again this week was dismissing affordability as something important.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know, there's this fake narrative that the Democrats talk about - affordability. They just say the word. It doesn't mean anything to anybody. They just say it - affordability. I inherited the worst inflation in history. There was no affordability. Nobody could afford anything.MONTANARO: You know, it certainly was the key issue in the special election we just saw this week in Tennessee, where Democrats again overperformed. The Republican won there, but Democrats did better. So clearly, the cost of living does really matter to people.SUMMERS: What has the White House been saying about all of this?KEITH: Well, first, they insist that they do not have their hair on fire about what happened in Tennessee. I did go in and speak with a senior White House official earlier this week who said that the president's travel is really going to ramp up at the end of this year. The first stop, the only one that's been announced so far, is next Tuesday in Pennsylvania. The focus will be affordability. But I have to say, this same senior White House official told me almost exactly the same thing almost a month ago. That time, I was told that the message would about empathy on prices, saying, you know, I feel your pain. We've done a lot, but there's a lot more we need to do.But as we've seen, the president keeps steering back to the idea of affordability as a word that Democrats made up as some kind of con job against him. That lack of message discipline has been hard to break. And the problem with the cost of living is people go to the grocery store all the time. They are out Christmas shopping, holiday shopping right now, and they can see for themselves what things cost.SUMMERS: Right. And we've also talked a whole lot about the structural advantages that Republicans have when it comes to the midterms next year. Where do things stand now?KEITH: Well, the Supreme Court last night delivered a big victory to Republicans, saying that the maps drawn in Texas can stand. That mid-decade redrawing of lines was designed to give Republicans up to five more seats in an already heavily Republican state. President Trump has been a driving force behind that because he is very openly concerned about what happens if Republicans lose control of the House.MONTANARO: And still, though, for Republicans, you know, they're trying to gain more seats, and they very well may create more in someplace like Texas, but they may not get as many as they would have hoped for. And they're being offset by places like California and elsewhere. And in a wave year, redrawing those seats and making some of them less Republican could backfire. And it's part of a reason, that and affordability, why we've seen potentially so many Republicans retiring from Congress, a real sign that Republicans are taking it very seriously that this could be a wave year coming up for Democrats next year.KEITH: Because nobody likes to be in the minority.SUMMERS: NPR's Tamara Keith and Domenico Montanaro, thanks to both of you.KEITH: You're welcome.MONTANARO: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

Republicans won a special congressional election in Tennessee, but only by 9 points in a district the Republican candidate last year won by 22 points.   That's in line with the double-digit overperformances by Democrats in elections this year.   On average, Democrats have done 14 points better than candidates in 2024 (including comparing the presidential results in 2024 to the governors' races in New Jersey and Virginia last month).   Here's how that breaks down:   FL-1 — 2024: R+32, 2025: R+15; Difference: D+17FL-6 — 2024: R+33, 2025: R+14; Difference: D+19VA-11 — 2024: D+34, 2025: D+50; Difference: D+16AZ-7 — 2024: D+27, 2025: D+39; Difference: D+12VA-GOV — 2024: D+6, 2025: D+16; Difference: D+10NJ-GOV — 2024: D+6, 2025: D+14; Difference: D+8TN-7 — 2024: R+22, 2025: R+9; Difference: D+13Supreme Court gives GOP a redistricting boost   \n   Republicans hope unprecedented mid-decade redistricting will help them keep control of the House. And this week, the Supreme Court gave them a boost this week with a 6-3 decision, divided along partisan ideological lines with conservatives in the majority.   \n   It allowed a new congressional map to move forward in Texas despite a lower-court ruling that Republicans' redistricting efforts in the state were an illegal racial gerrymander. The high court's conservative majority instead indicated the new map appears to be a legal, partisan gerrymander.   President Trump hopes the redrawn map nets Republicans five seats and solidifies the GOP's very narrow majority in the House. It's just a three-seat margin, meaning a light electoral breeze in one direction or the other can change or strengthen control.   But Republicans might not net as many seats as they hope.   Democrats are trying to offset GOP gains by redrawing maps in California and possibly in Virginia. They are also likely to get an extra seat from Utah after a judge approved a map that created a new House seat in an area that leans Democratic.    Plus, weakening a small number of Republican strongholds in favor of a greater number of Republican-leaning districts could backfire if next year's elections are a wave in Democrats' favor.   \n   Watch places like South Texas, where Republicans were hoping Trump's gains with Latinos would stick. It's not at all clear that will be the case anymore after polls have found Latino voters have soured on Trump because of his handling of the economy and how his administration is conducting deportations.   That's born out in election results this year, too. In those New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races, Latinos voted 2-to-1 in favor of Democratic candidates. The latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll found 54% of Latinos disapproved of the job Trump was doing.   An even larger study by the Pew Research Center found 70% disapproving of Trump's job with those who voted for Trump sliding 12 points since his swearing in for this second term.   Views of the economy imperiling Republicans right now   Republicans' best chance at retaining the House would be if views of the economy improve.   But, so far, surveys are finding people have a grim view. Gallup found, for example, that economic confidence has dropped to a 17-month low. Only 27% of respondents in the Gallup poll said the economy was getting better, four points lower than the previous month. Two-thirds (68%) said it was getting worse.   Trump isn't helping   Trump is viewed negatively when it comes to his handling of the economy. A Politico/Public First poll found that many Americans, including almost 4-in-10 Trump voters, are saying the cost of living is the worst they can remember it being, that the president owns the economy and that he's not doing enough to fix it.   Trump also isn't helping Republicans' cause when he continues to downplay affordability as a problem, as he did this week. He dismissed it as a \"con job\" invented by Democrats.   \"This fake narrative that the Democrats talk about -- affordability,\" Trump said during a Cabinet meeting Tuesday. \"They just say the word, it doesn't mean anything to anybody. They just say it, affordability. I inherited the worst inflation in history. There was no affordability, nobody could afford anything.\"   \n   But people know what they pay at a grocery store or whether they can afford a house or health care. The party in charge often gets more of the credit and blame for the economy, but in Trump's case, people view his policies as making things worse.   \n   People have a dim view of Trump's tariffs, for example. Three-quarters in a recent Economist/YouGov poll said they have paid higher prices because of tariffs, including a majority of Republicans. Only 13% of respondents said they think tariffs should be increased.   And most say they are paying more, especially for groceries and utilities – 7-in-10 in an ABC/Ipsos poll last month said they're paying more for groceries, for example.   Republican candidates are not echoing Trump's language. The Republican candidate in Tennessee, Matt Van Epps, made specifics about the cost of living a key part of his closing message. But that messaging didn't stave off double-digit Democratic gains in what was a high-turnout election.   The economic tide is clearly against Republicans right now. That's one big reason there have been a high number of Republicans not running for reelection in the House — another indicator of a potential change election.\n",

Only one of those portraits is of a transgender person: Adm. Rachel Levine, who served for four years as President Biden's assistant secretary for health. She was the first transgender person to win Senate confirmation, and her portrait has been displayed in the hallway since soon after she was confirmed in 2021. The role is a four-star admiral position in charge of the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service.   \n   Levine's official portrait was recently altered, a spokesperson for HHS confirmed to NPR. A digital photograph of the portrait in the hallway obtained by NPR shows that Levine's previous name is now typed below the portrait, under the glass of the frame.   Levine responds   \"During the federal shutdown, the current leadership of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health changed Admiral Levine's photo to remove her current legal name and use a prior name,\" says Adrian Shanker, former deputy assistant secretary for health policy in the Biden administration who worked with Levine and is now her spokesperson. He called the move an act \"of bigotry against her.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Adm. Rachel Levine's official portrait has hung in a hallway of the headquarters of HHS since shortly after she was confirmed by the Senate in 2021.\n                \n                    Chris Sean Smith/U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chris Sean Smith/U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps\n    \n\n   \n   Levine told NPR that it was an honor to serve the American people as the assistant secretary for health \"and I'm not going to comment on this type of petty action.\"   HHS statement   NPR asked HHS who made the change and why. In response, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon wrote: \"Our priority is ensuring that the information presented internally and externally by HHS reflects gold standard science. We remain committed to reversing harmful policies enacted by Levine and ensuring that biological reality guides our approach to public health.\"   The current assistant secretary for health is Adm. Brian Christine, a urologist from Alabama who was confirmed by the Senate in October.   \n   An HHS staff member who asked not be identified for fear of professional retribution called the change \"disrespectful\" and added that it exemplifies \"the erasure of transgender individuals by this administration.\"   During the 2024 campaign, President Trump and other Republicans spent millions on anti-transgender ads, some of which featured Levine's image.    \n   Since taking office, Trump has moved aggressively to curtail the rights of transgender and intersex people through many federal agencies, including the Departments of Health, Justice, Education, and others. At the Pentagon, transgender servicemembers were forced out of the military without benefits. At the Department of State, decades-old passport policies were reversed. The president often describes transgender people as a danger to society.   Shanker says the alteration of Levine's official portrait is unprecedented. He praised her public health work on COVID-19, syphilis, HIV/AIDS and opioids, and said rather than act vindictively towards her, current leaders at HHS should focus on the many public health challenges facing the American people.\n",

    "body": "\n      Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is under pressure this week as a Navy admiral faces tough questions from lawmakers about the legality of striking boats allegedly carrying drugs in the Caribbean.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Members of Congress have now seen the video of U.S. strikes on a boat in the Caribbean. In a few moments, we'll hear from one of those lawmakers, Democrat Jim Himes.MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  But first, let's get to what we know. Democrats said they were disturbed by the second hit on a boat allegedly carrying drugs that killed two men after the boat was disabled. Republicans said the strike was justified because those two people might otherwise have continued on to their destination.INSKEEP: That is one of two big stories focused on the Pentagon, and NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman is covering both. Tom, good morning.TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Hey, Steve.INSKEEP: OK. So let's get this other story out of the way first. Inspector general report is now public about Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sharing information about an attack on the Signal texting app. What did you learn by reading the report?BOWMAN: Well, it said that two to four hours before the airstrikes by American F-18 pilots, Secretary Hegseth - he was getting a classified briefing from General Eric Carillo about the upcoming attacks on Houthi rebels. A lot of detail about the number of planes, the targets, the timing. And while Hegseth was getting this, he was sharing it on a Signal chat with other officials and on another chat with his wife, his brother and his lawyer. None of those three had security clearances, and all of this was secret information, the report said.INSKEEP: And let's just disclose, as we do, that NPR's CEO, Katherine Maher, also chairs the board of the Signal Foundation, which has a subsidiary that makes this app. But what has been the reaction to the inspector general?BOWMAN: Well, Secretary Hegseth's spokesman said the IG report exonerates him. That is not true. Nothing in the 76 pages says anything close to that. It does say that the Pentagon should be aware of proper procedures on the handling of classified information. It only states facts, Steve, not what should happen next.INSKEEP: All right. So let's now talk about this second strike on the boat in the Caribbean. What are lawmakers saying, and what are you learning now that they have seen this video and also heard from the commander involved?BOWMAN: Well, Admiral Mitch Bradley, the top commander overseeing Central and South America, appeared behind closed doors to explain what happened. Lawmakers said he defended that second missile strike, saying basically, the survivors of the initial strike were still kind of being active, trying to reach their comrades by radio, trying to corral drugs on the boat that was nearly destroyed. So Bradley, again, ordered this second missile strike to kill them and then two more to sink the boat. Secretary Hegseth said he was only there for the first missile strike on the boat and didn't see the others. He had meetings, he said. Now lawmakers are asking, you know, did the second missile strike result in an illegal killing, a war crime? Because, Steve, the Pentagon's Law of War Manual lays out what is an illegal order that no service member has to obey, and the manual has this example. Get this. Quote, \"for example, orders to fire upon the shipwrecked would be clearly illegal.\"INSKEEP: Tom, granting the differing interpretations, it does seem that everyone came out of the closed-door video session saying this boat was severely damaged at the least and even capsized. Any doubt about that?BOWMAN: I don't think there is. Senator Tom Cotton said these guys, the two survivors, are trying to flip over this capsized boat. Congressman Adam Smith and others said, listen, they were just shirtless guys, and not much of this boat was above water. So that's why it's important, I think, for the public to see this video. It should be released.INSKEEP: NPR's Tom Bowman. Thanks so much.BOWMAN: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Think Beyoncé performing for Tina Turner, Audrey Hepburn rhapsodizing about Cary Grant, Rob Reiner praising Norman Lear, Aretha Franklin singing for Carol King, Sidney Poitier honoring Harry Belafonte or James Taylor and John Williams playing for Yo-Yo Ma.   \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n                    YouTube\n                \n        \n   This year's Kennedy Center honorees are Sylvester Stallone, George Strait, the rock band KISS, Gloria Gaynor and English actor and singer Michael Crawford.   As in years past, Sunday night's gala will be turned into a broadcast special that will air on CBS and Paramount+ on Dec. 23.   But, after months of upheaval at the Kennedy Center, the 48th Honors will be different. In February, President Trump abruptly ousted the Kennedy Center president, Deborah Rutter, and board chair David Rubenstein. Staff who worked on the ceremony and broadcast have also recently resigned.   \n   Here's what else has changed.   The selection process   In the past, honorees were chosen in a months-long, bipartisan undertaking by members of the Kennedy Center board with input from the general public and past honorees. Ultimately recipients were selected by executive members of the board and a couple of other senior staff members, with consultation from past honorees such as Julie Andrews, Lionel Richie and John Williams.   This year, President Trump said he was \"about 98%\" involved in the selection process. He also broke with tradition by personally announcing the names at a press conference at the Kennedy Center last August. Previously, the announcement was made on the center's website and in press releases.   \n   The host   \n   Previous hosts of the Kennedy Center Honors have included Walter Cronkite, Stephen Colbert, Gloria Estefan and Queen Latifah. Trump will host this year, a first for a U.S. president. At the August press conference, Trump said he's hosting because he was asked (he didn't say by whom), and said he was told \"You'll get much higher ratings.\" He continued, \"I used to host The Apprentice finales and we did rather well with that. So I think we're going to do very well because we have some great honorees.\"   Neither Trump nor first lady Melania Trump attended Honors events during his first term.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Actor and singer Queen Latifah, Jill Biden and former President Joe Biden attend the 46th Kennedy Center Honors in 2023.\n                \n                    Kent Nishimura/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kent Nishimura/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   One of the time-honored perks of being chosen is getting to sit with the president and first lady in the Box Tier of the Kennedy Center Opera House. It's unclear how Trump's hosting duties will affect his presence in the box.   \n   The iconic rainbow medallion is no more    In the past, Kennedy Center Honorees were each presented with a vibrant, multicolored satin ribbon adorned with a gold plate inscribed with the honoree's name at a State Department dinner the evening before the gala. Past honorees including Quincy Jones and Rita Moreno would attend subsequent galas proudly wearing their own medallions.   For the first time since 1978, the medallions will not be made by the same family of artists, as first reported by The Washington Post. The new design is by Tiffany & Co. and features a blue ribbon instead of the rainbow one, with rainbow stripes on the medallion itself.    Who will show?   In keeping with tradition, the Kennedy Center is not revealing the names of the performers who will pay tribute to this year's honorees. The surprise on honorees' faces when they see who has come to pay their respects has made for some fun, poignant TV moments.   \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n                    YouTube\n                \n        \n   The upheaval at the Kennedy Center has led to questions about who will be there this year. Historically, even when artists have disagreed with past administrations, they've in large part showed up. Some make it a point to come every year.   \n   This year could be different. Former honoree Herbie Hancock, who has attended many past Honors and consulted during the selection process, will not attend. His spokesperson told NPR he will be on a tour of Asia. Bonnie Raitt, one of last year's honorees who has also been a tribute performer, will not attend either.   Over the decades, the Kennedy Center forged strong relationships with leading performing artists from around the world. At the press conference in August, Trump boasted that he and the center's new leadership \"ended the woke political programming.\" Words that might push some artists away.\n",

The Trump administration is reviewing the racial and ethnic categories approved for the 2030 census and other future federal surveys.\n                \n                    Matt Rourke/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Matt Rourke/AP\n    \n\n   \n   A Trump administration official on Friday signaled a potential rollback of the racial and ethnic categories approved for the 2030 census and other future federal government forms.   Supporters of those categories fear that any last-minute modifications to the U.S. government's standards for data about race and ethnicity could hurt the accuracy of census data and other future statistics used for redrawing voting districts, enforcing civil rights protections and guiding policymaking.   Those standards were last revised in 2024 during the Biden administration, after Census Bureau research and public discussion.   A White House agency at the time approved, among other changes, new checkboxes for \"Middle Eastern or North African\" and \"Hispanic or Latino\" under a reformatted question that asks survey participants: \"What is your race and/or ethnicity?\" The revisions also require the federal government to stop automatically categorizing people who identify with Middle Eastern or North African groups as white.   \n   But at a Friday meeting of the Council of Professional Associations on Federal Statistics in Washington, D.C., the chief statistician within the White House's Office of Management and Budget revealed that the Trump administration has started a new review of those standards and how the 2024 revisions were approved.   \"We're still at the very beginning of a review. And this, again, is not prejudging any particular outcome. I think we just wanted to be able to take a look at the process and decide where we wanted to end up on a number of these questions,\" said Mark Calabria. \"I've certainly heard a wide range of views within the administration. So it's just premature to say where we'll end up.\"   \n   OMB's press office did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment.   Calabria's comments mark the first public confirmation that Trump officials are considering the possibility of not using the latest racial and ethnic category changes and other revisions. They come amid the administration's attack on diversity, equity and inclusion programs, a push to stop producing data that could protect the rights of transgender people and threats to the reliability of federal statistics.   In September, OMB said those Biden-era revisions \"continue to be in effect\" when it announced a six-month extension to the 2029 deadline for federal agencies to follow the new standards when collecting data on race and ethnicity.   \n   Calabria said the delay gave agencies more time to implement the changes \"while we review.\"   The first Trump administration stalled the process for revising the racial and ethnic data standards in time for the 2020 census.    The \"Project 2025\" policy agenda released by The Heritage Foundation, the conservative, D.C.-based think tank, called for a Republican administration to \"thoroughly review any changes\" to census race and ethnicity questions because of \"concerns among conservatives that the data under Biden Administration proposals could be skewed to bolster progressive political agendas.\"   \n   Advocates of the changes, however, see the new categories and other revisions as long-needed updates to better reflect people's identities.   \"At stake is a more accurate and deeper understanding of the communities that comprise our country,\" says Meeta Anand, senior director of census and data equity at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. \"I am not concerned if it's reviewed in an honest attempt to understand what the process was. I am concerned if it's for a predetermined outcome that would be to ignore the entire process that was done in a very transparent manner.\"   Edited by Benjamin Swasey\n",

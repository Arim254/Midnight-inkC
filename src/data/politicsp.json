Mark Kelly, a retired U.S. Navy fighter pilot and NASA astronaut, for possible violations of military law after he appeared in a video with other Democratic lawmakers urging active duty military and intelligence personnel to refuse \"illegal orders.\"   \n   In the case of Kelly, the Pentagon put out a statement saying that it had \"received serious allegations of misconduct against Captain Mark Kelly, USN (Ret.),\" and that \"a thorough review of these allegations has been initiated to determine further actions, which may include recall to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures.\"   The statement, posted on X, said: \"This matter will be handled in compliance with military law, ensuring due process and impartiality. Further official comments will be limited, to preserve the integrity of the proceedings.\"   \n   The move comes as the Trump administration faces legal questions surrounding its deployment of National Guard troops to U.S. cities and deadly airstrikes on boats suspected of drug smuggling in the Caribbean.   Last week, Kelly, a Democrat elected in 2020, joined five other House and Senate Democrats who also served in the armed forces or an intelligence branch in a video on X. In it, Kelly and the others said: \"This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence intelligence community professionals against American citizens. Like us, you all swore an oath to protect and defend this Constitution.\"   \"Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders,\" the video said.   \n   The video included appearances from Sen. Elissa Slotkin, a former CIA analyst, Colorado Rep. Jason Crow, a former Army Ranger who fought in Iraq, two Congress members from Pennsylvania -- Rep. Chris Deluzio, a former U.S. Navy officer, and Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, a former Air Force officer -- as well as Rep. Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, a former U.S. Navy intelligence officer.   After the video's release, President Trump posted on Truth Social that it amounted to \"seditious behavior\" that was \"punishable by death.\" Although the president later clarified that he was \"not threatening death,\" he posted again on Truth Social Sunday (in all caps): \"IT WAS SEDITION AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL, AND SEDITION IS A MAJOR CRIME. THERE CAN BE NO OTHER INTERPRETATION OF WHAT THEY SAID!\"   \n   After Trump's post, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in response to a question about the video on Thursday that any incitement to \"defy the chain of command, not to follow lawful orders\" was \"a very dangerous thing for sitting members of Congress to do, and they should be held accountable, and that's what the president wants to see.\"   Shortly after Trump's initial post on Thursday, House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters: \"For a senator like Mark Kelly or any member of the House or Senate to behave in that kind of talks is to me so just beyond the pale.\"   \"I'm not going to say anything more on it,\" he added.   Speaking on CBS' Face The Nation over the weekend, Kelly said Republicans in Congress had not spoken out after the president's threat. \"We've heard very little, basically crickets, from Republicans in the United States Congress about what the president has said about hanging members of Congress.\"   Only Kelly, who is formally retired from the Navy with the rank of captain, could be recalled to active duty for court-martial. Such a move by the Pentagon is exceedingly rare and it's unclear if defense officials will follow through on the threat.   Kelly is married to former Arizona Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords, who was nearly killed in 2011 in an assassination attempt. As a naval aviator, he flew combat missions over Iraq before being selected as an astronaut by NASA. He went on to fly two Space Shuttle missions as a pilot and two more as commander. His twin brother is former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly.\n",

    "body": "\n      Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene's resignation is forcing the Republican party to reckon publicly with what the political landscape will look like when President Trump leaves the White House.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  What does it really mean when the president breaks up with one of his loudest supporters?MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Marjorie Taylor Greene went to Congress from Georgia in 2021, just in time to promote President Trump's bid to overturn his election defeat. Her comments and conspiracy theories caused even her own party to shun her at times, until she rose as a flamboyant Trump backer. That made it all the more striking when she resigned on Friday, saying the president abandoned his own agenda. In a few minutes, a Republican strategist analyzes the debate over who gets to define the GOP.INSKEEP: And NPR's Stephen Fowler is listening to that conversation. Stephen, good morning.STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Good morning.INSKEEP: How exactly does Greene critique Republicans?FOWLER: Well, there was this nearly 11-minute video she released Friday night that aired a wide array of complaints, including mentioning threats to her adult children and attacks led by President Trump calling her a, quote, \"traitor.\" But I think it's really important to listen to this point she made early on.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE: Americans are used by the political industrial complex of both political parties election cycle after election cycle in order to elect whichever side can convince Americans to hate the other side more. And the results are always the same. No matter which way the political pendulum swings, Republican or Democrat, nothing ever gets better for the common American man or woman.FOWLER: Greene says that American politics are not great right now. And even though Republicans have complete control of Washington, her argument is that party leadership isn't actually keen on leading.INSKEEP: Well, I guess this has been building up for a while. She criticized the president over his foreign policy, like when the United States bombed Iran. She questioned some domestic policies. And above all, she wanted the release of the Epstein files a lot more quickly than Trump was willing to agree to. So did she change?FOWLER: Well, in Greene's view, she's not the one that changed. It's Donald Trump and others in the Republican Party who have not maintained consistency when it comes to being Make America Great Again, America First conservatives. It's also important to note that Trump has never been a traditional conservative, and his return to office was built on convincing a lot of different groups and demographics with different ideologies and priorities to unite under that America First banner but defer to his interpretation of what being a conservative meant. There have been a number of instances where some of the Republican base voters this year have said, whoa, whoa, whoa, that's not actually what we wanted, like the Epstein files, where Trump went from, I will release them, to saying Republicans who want that to happen are stupid to collaring Marjorie Taylor Greene a traitor for supporting the measure to signing the bill.INSKEEP: Indeed. So what's the president saying now about Greene?FOWLER: Well, he told ABC News it was good for the country she was leaving, posted on his Truth Social website that she was a traitor, again, who would have lost a primary. Then he told NBC News that he'd actually love to see her return to politics eventually, all in the span of less than a day or so.INSKEEP: What? OK.FOWLER: It does underscore what people have been saying about the president, both in public and behind the scenes. There are some on the right who are echoing his attacks and say about Marjorie Taylor Greene, good riddance. There are other Republicans and even Democrats in the House who say she's making some good points about things. And for what it's worth, Marjorie Taylor Greene says she would have won her primary and thinks Republicans are set to lose the midterms. Some of that feeling is backed up by voters in the district and in Georgia, expressing support for her and disappointment in what President Trump is doing.And unlike plenty of clashes with more moderate Republicans who have all but disappeared from Trump's GOP, her role as this conservative stalwart inside the MAGA movement is really forcing the party to reckon more publicly and more quickly with the question of what the post-Trump GOP is going to look like.INSKEEP: NPR's Stephen Fowler, who's reporting from Atlanta. Stephen, thanks so much.FOWLER: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

But he offered very little information on what was discussed. He also downplayed a Thursday deadline set by President Donald Trump for Ukraine to respond to the plan, saying simply that officials want to see fighting stop as soon as possible and that officials could keep negotiating Monday and beyond. He said that higher-level officials may eventually have to get involved.   \n   \"This is a very delicate moment,\" Rubio said of what still needed to be worked out. \"Some of it is semantics, or language. Others require higher-level decisions and consultations. Others, I think, just need more time to work through.\"   The 28-point blueprint drawn up by the U.S. to end the nearly four-year war has sparked alarm in Kyiv and European capitals. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said his country could face a stark choice between standing up for its sovereign rights and preserving the American support it needs.   The Ukrainian leader has vowed that his people \"will always defend\" their home.   \n   The proposal acquiesces to many Russian demands that Zelenskyy has categorically rejected on dozens of occasions, including giving up large pieces of territory.   In a subsequent statement Sunday night, the White House said the Ukrainian delegation \"affirmed that all of their principal concerns — security guarantees, long-term economic development, infrastructure protection, freedom of navigation, and political sovereignty — were thoroughly addressed during the meeting.\"   It added that the Ukrainians \"expressed appreciation for the structured approach taken to incorporate their feedback into each component of the emerging settlement framework.\" The White House said changes made to the proposal now reflect \"their national interests\" and provide \"credible and enforceable mechanisms to safeguard Ukraine's security in both the near and long term.\"   \n   But language of such positive steps came only after concerns about the original, Trump-endorsed deal intensified. A bipartisan group of U.S. senators said Rubio told them Saturday that the plan had originated with Russia and was actually a \"wish list\" for Moscow, rather than a serious push for peace.   German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that he'd spoken to Trump and made clear there were some parts of the plans key European nations could agree on but others where they could not.   \"I told him that we are fully in line with Ukraine, that the sovereignty of this country must not be jeopardized,\" Merz said in an interview with DW.   Rubio touts progress on talks, saying efforts will continue   Rubio called the U.S. proposal a \"living breathing document\" that would continue changing. He also made, clear though, that any final product — once it's ready — will still have to be presented to Moscow: \"obviously, the Russians get a vote here.\"   The head of the Ukrainian delegation, presidential chief of staff Andrii Yermak, said of the talks, \"We have made very good progress and are moving forward to a just and lasting peace,\" he said.   The rosy assessment of what was discussed defied Trump himself. Before talks began, the president blasted Ukraine for a lack of gratitude for U.S. military assistance while shying away from criticizing Russia.   Trump has set a Thursday deadline for Ukraine to respond to the plan but also suggested it could slide if there was proof of real progress. He also said that the plan was not his final offer — without offering further details on what that meant.   \"UKRAINE 'LEADERSHIP' HAS EXPRESSED ZERO GRATITUDE FOR OUR EFFORTS, AND EUROPE CONTINUES TO BUY OIL FROM RUSSIA,\" Trump posted on his social media site Sunday morning.   After Trump's post, Zelenskyy cheered U.S.-led efforts on security while also stressing that \"the crux of the entire diplomatic situation is that it was Russia, and only Russia, that started this war.\"   \n   \"Ukraine is grateful to the United States, to every American heart, and personally to President Trump,\" Zelenskyy wrote in a post on Telegram, adding, \"We thank everyone in Europe.\"   \"It is important not to forget the main goal – to stop Russia's war and prevent it from ever igniting again,\" he added.   Ukraine and allies have ruled out territorial concessions   Before convening with U.S. officials, Yermak and his team also met with national security advisers from the U.K., France and Germany. The allies have rallied around Kyiv in a push to revise the plan.   Alice Rufo, France's minister delegate at the Defense Ministry, told broadcaster France Info before the talks began that key points of discussion would include the plan's restrictions on the Ukrainian army, which she described as \"a limitation on its sovereignty.\"   \n   \"Ukraine must be able to defend itself,\" she said. \"Russia wants war and waged war many times in fact over the past years.\"   On Sunday, Zelenskyy said that there was an understanding the U.S. would take into account \"a number of elements\" in a peace deal that are important for Ukraine, but did not elaborate further.   \"There have already been brief reports from the team about the results of the first meetings and conversations,\" he said. \"There is now an understanding that the American proposals may take into account a number of elements based on the Ukrainian vision and are critically important for Ukraine's national interests.\"   Rubio's reported comments cause confusion   Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Sunday that Warsaw was ready to work on the plan with the leaders of Europe, Canada and Japan, but also said that it \"would be good to know for sure who is the author of the plan and where was it created.\"   Some U.S. lawmakers said Saturday that Rubio had described the plan as a Russian \"wish list\" rather than a Washington-led proposal. A U.S. State Department spokesperson said that account was \"blatantly false.\" On his way to Geneva, Rubio then took the extraordinary step of suggesting online that the senators were mistaken, even though they said he was their source for the information.   \n   The issue was still causing a stir on Sunday.   The top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Mark Warner, told ABC's \"This Week\" that the peace plan appeared to be \"almost a series of Russian talking points,\" had made Europeans \"feel like they've been totally left high and dry\" and had led to \"ferocious pushback.\"   Turkish leader plans talk with Putin   Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced that he would hold a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday. He said he would talk to Putin about reviving a previous deal from July 2022 that allowed Ukraine to safely ship exports of grain via the Black Sea.   The agreement stayed in place until the following year, when Putin refused to extend it, saying that a parallel agreement promising to remove obstacles to Russian exports of food and fertilizer hadn't been honored.   \"We had a grain corridor endeavor to open the path to peace,\" Erdogan said, \"Unfortunately we were only partially able to succeed. Tomorrow I will be asking Putin to revisit the endeavor.\"   Erdogan's new diplomatic push comes just days after he met with Zelenskyy in Ankara.\n",

But the entity that the U.S. government alleges is led by Maduro is not a cartel per se.   \n   The designation, published Monday in the Federal Register, is the latest measure in the Trump administration's escalating campaign to combat drug trafficking into the U.S. In previewing the step about a week ago, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio accused Cartel de los Soles, or Cartel of the Suns, of being \"responsible for terrorist violence\" in the Western Hemisphere.   The move comes as Trump evaluates whether to take military action against Venezuela, which he has not ruled out despite bringing up the possibility of talks with Maduro. Land strikes or other actions would be a major expansion of the monthslong operation that has included a massive military buildup in the Caribbean Sea and striking boats accused of trafficking drugs, killing more than 80 people.   \n   Venezuelans began using the term Cartel de los Soles in the 1990s to refer to high-ranking military officers who had grown rich from drug-running. As corruption expanded nationwide, first under the late President Hugo Chávez and then under Maduro, its use loosely expanded to police and government officials as well as activities like illegal mining and fuel trafficking. The \"suns\" in the name refer to the epaulettes affixed to the uniforms of high-ranking military officers.   \n   The umbrella term was elevated to a Maduro-led drug-trafficking organization in 2020, when the U.S. Justice Department in Trump's first term announced the indictment of Venezuela's leader and his inner circle on narcoterrorism and other charges.   \"It is not a group,\" said Adam Isaacson, director for defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America organization. \"It's not like a group that people would ever identify themselves as members. They don't have regular meetings. They don't have a hierarchy.\"   Trump's expansion of terror label to cartels   Maduro's government in a statement Monday categorically denied the existence of the cartel, describing the Trump administration's accusation as a \"ridiculous fabrication\" meant to \"justify an illegitimate and illegal intervention against Venezuela.\"   Up until this year, the label of foreign terrorist organization had been reserved for groups like the Islamic State or al-Qaida that use violence for political ends. The Trump administration applied it in February to eight Latin American criminal organizations involved in drug trafficking, migrant smuggling and other activities.   \n   The administration blames such designated groups for operating the boats it is striking but rarely identifies the organizations and has not provided any evidence. It says the attacks , which began off the coast of Venezuela and later expanded to the eastern Pacific Ocean, are meant to stop narcotics from flowing to American cities.   \n   But many — including Maduro himself — see the military moves as an effort to end the ruling party's 26-year hold on power.   Since the arrival of U.S. military vessels and troops to the Caribbean months ago, Venezuela's U.S.-backed political opposition also has reignited its perennial promise of removing Maduro from office, fueling speculation over the purpose of what the Trump administration has called a counterdrug operation.   Trump, like his predecessor, does not recognize Maduro as Venezuela's leader.   Maduro is on his third term after ruling-party loyalists declared him the winner of last year's presidential election despite credible evidence that the opposition's candidate defeated him by a more than 2-to-1 margin. He and senior officials have been repeatedly accused of human rights violations of real and perceived government opponents, including in the aftermath of the July 2024 election.   Hegseth says designation offers \"new options\"   U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said last week that the designation of Cartel de los Soles will provide a \"whole bunch of new options to the United States\" for dealing with Maduro. But Hegseth, speaking in an interview with conservative news outlet OAN, did not provide details on what those options are and declined to say whether the U.S. military planned to strike land targets inside Venezuela.   \"So nothing is off the table, but nothing's automatically on the table,\" he said.   Trump administration officials have signaled that they find it difficult to see a situation in which Maduro remaining in power could be an acceptable end game. But as Trump considers an array of military and non-military options, including covert action by the CIA, for next steps, there is strong belief inside the administration that Maduro's rule \"is not sustainable,\" according to a senior administration official who was not authorized to comment publicly on the sensitive matter.   \n   The official added that Trump has been keenly listening to his intelligence team, which has reported to him that chatter picked up inside Venezuela indicates growing anxiety from Maduro and other high-level Venezuelan officials as the U.S. strikes continue. Trump, the official said, is \"very content and satisfied\" for the moment with the strikes' impact.   All the while, pleas from Maduro and others close to the Venezuelan leader to speak directly to the administration, relayed through various intermediaries and channels, seem to be more frantic, the official said. But Trump has not sanctioned any intermediaries to speak to Maduro on behalf of the U.S. administration.   Indictment alleges conspiracy to \"flood\" U.S. with drugs   The 2020 U.S. indictment accused Maduro, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López, among others, of conspiring with Colombian rebels and members of the Venezuelan military for several years \"to flood the United States with cocaine\" and use the drug trade as a \"weapon against America.\" Colombia is the world's top cocaine producer.   Before laying down weapons as part of a 2016 peace deal, members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, regularly used the porous border region with Venezuela as a safe haven and hub for U.S.-bound cocaine shipments — often with the support or at least consent of Venezuelan security forces. Dissidents continued the work. Colombia's National Liberation Army guerrilla is also involved in the illegal trade.   Maduro has denied the charges. The U.S. Justice Department this year doubled to $50 million the reward for information that leads to his arrest.   Maduro has insisted that the U.S. is building a false drug-trafficking narrative to try to force him out. He and other government officials have repeatedly cited a United Nations report that they say shows traffickers attempt to move only 5% of the cocaine produced in Colombia through Venezuela.   \n   The U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on the Cartel de los Soles in July, saying Maduro and his top allies had bent the power of the Venezuelan government, military and intelligence services to assist the cartel in trafficking narcotics to the U.S.   U.S. authorities also alleged Maduro's cartel gave material support to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and the Sinaloa cartel, both of which were among the organizations that the U.S. designated as foreign terror organizations in February.\n",

The decision from U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie on the appointment of Lindsey Halligan as the top prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia marks a significant setback to efforts to go after the president's perceived political enemies.    In dual rulings, Judge Currie said \"all actions flowing from Ms. Halligan's defective appointment,\" including the indictments against Comey and James, \"were unlawful exercises of executive power and are hereby set aside.\" Currie was nominated to the bench by former President Bill Clinton.   \n   The cases were dismissed without prejudice, meaning the Justice Department may be able to bring those cases again.   Abbe Lowell, an attorney for James, said they would continue to fight any further charges against her.   \"The President went to extreme measures to substitute one of his allies to bring these baseless charges after career prosecutors refused,\" Lowell said in a statement. \"This case was not about justice or the law; it was about targeting Attorney General James for what she stood for and who she challenged.\"   \n   Former lawyer for Trump   Trump tapped Halligan to serve as acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia after he pushed out the previous top prosecutor, who had expressed doubts about bringing charges against both Comey and James.   Halligan is a former insurance attorney who once served as Trump's personal lawyer before his return to office, when she joined his administration as a White House aide.   Halligan, who has no previous prosecutorial experience, was sworn in as acting U.S. attorney on Sept. 22. Three days later, she secured a two-count criminal indictment against Comey—just days before the statute of limitations expired. He has pleaded not guilty.   \"I'm grateful that the court ended the case against me, which was a prosecution based on malevolence and incompetence,\" Comey said in a video posted on social media. \"A message has to be sent that the president of the United States cannot use the Department of Justice to target his political enemies.\"   \n   Two weeks later, Halligan secured an indictment against James on charges of bank fraud and false statements to a financial institution. James, too, has pleaded not guilty.   \"I remain fearless in the face of these baseless charges as I continue fighting for New Yorkers every single day,\" James said in a statement.   In both cases, Halligan was the only prosecutor to present before the grand jury, the government has said in court papers.   Days before she was sworn into the role, Trump in a social media post called on Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Justice Department to prosecute Comey, James and California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff.   \n   Schiff is not facing charges but federal prosecutors are investigating him on allegations of mortgage fraud.   The Justice Department has defended her appointment and said it followed all proper procedures.   In their separate cases, Comey and James had both sought to have the cases against them dismissed.    —NPR's Carrie Johnson contributed to this report.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Republican strategist Alex Conant about the state of the MAGA coalition following Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's decision to resign from Congress.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  For more on this, we have Alex Conant. He is a Republican strategist with the public affairs firm Firehouse Strategies. Alex, thanks so much for coming back to see us.ALEX CONANT: Good morning.MARTIN: So Marjorie Taylor Greene is such a unique figure in politics, even in this era. But she's been such a strong loyalist for President Trump. Does her recent trajectory, like Steve pointed out - questioning the president's conduct, not just on the Epstein files, but on other policies - does that tell you anything about the state of the MAGA coalition?CONANT: Yeah, I mean, there's been a simmering debate within not just the Trump administration but the Republican Party as a whole over the last several years between the MAGA coalition, as you put it, and traditional conservatives. And you see it bubble up on issues like Israel, where you have a lot of people, MAGA leaders like the congresswoman, like Steve Bannon who don't want America to be very involved, don't want us to be as supportive of Israel compared to the more traditional conservatives.You see it on issues like health care, on issues even like the Epstein files, where you have (laughter) sort of the conspiracy theorists against the more traditionalists. And, you know, at the end of the day, these issues are starting to bubble up into the public. And I think what we saw over the weekend was the most vivid example of this coalition really has a lot of debate going on within it. And I think Trump is starting to struggle just really trying to keep it together.MARTIN: And what about her decision to resign? Does this strengthen or weaken or have any effect on the president's hold on MAGA?CONANT: Well, she's always been a bit of an iconoclast and, frankly, not all that popular within the Republican House caucus. I think the most immediate challenge is that he already has a slim House majority. It just got one vote less. And, you know, if some of her colleagues look at her and say, geez, you know, being a member of Congress isn't all it's cracked up to be, and they start to retire, too, he could have a real crisis on his hands just in terms of keeping the majority over the next year. You know, I think, beyond that, she quit in part because he was threatening to support a primary challenge against her, and she didn't want to lose her primary. That is a tactic he has used many, many times to keep people in line. But if, looking forward, him threatening primary challenges results in people just quitting, that doesn't necessarily help his cause either.MARTIN: You know, her online posts and her video, I'm sure you watched it. It was also an indictment of the current GOP leadership. And she predicted that Republicans would lose the House in the midterms. And I'm just interested in your take on that.CONANT: Well, we're still over a year out. I think it's going to be a very closely fought race. You know, historically, the party in power would lose the majority, and even more so when, you know, people aren't happy about the direction of the economy. That said, we're a long way out. Republicans feel really good about a lot of their recruits. I think the president and the White House have been more engaged in recruiting strong candidates this time than they were during his first term. So Republican insiders I talk to, Republicans running campaigns, they feel pretty bullish about our chances to keep the house.MARTIN: And, you know, the congresswoman threw cold water on this idea that she might've resigned in order to set herself up to run for president. But can you envision a different leadership role for her in the party in the future?CONANT: Well, look, she has a very high profile. The media loves to cover her. We're talking about her right now. I think anyone who can command media attention can command political support as well, especially in this environment. I think the 2028 Republican primaries are going to be fascinating because it's going to be a real debate ultimately between, do you have an America first, MAGA-style president continue, maybe somebody like JD Vance? Or do you have a more traditional conservative, somebody who supports Israel, somebody like Ted Cruz?I think, you know, if either of those two candidates, who both talked about running, if either of them falter, certainly somebody like MTG could see a lane. You know, whether or not she actually chose to run is anyone's guess. But I think we could end up seeing a much more competitive Republican primary than we're expecting right now, especially if Trump's political standing within the party deteriorates over the next 18 months.MARTIN: Before we let you go, what do you make of his kind of turnabout on her? I mean, yes, he generally gets very upset when people criticize him, especially people he thinks are supposed to support him. Well, pretty much everybody. He becomes infuriated when people criticize him or say that he's not doing what he's supposed to do, et cetera. But then within the span of such a short period of time, to sort of say, well, you know, I hope she'll think about a return to politics.CONANT: I think that's classic.MARTIN: How do you read that?CONANT: I think it's classic Trump. I mean, we saw the same thing with the New York mayor on Friday last week. And, you know, I worked for Marco Rubio in a previous life. You know, you talk about two guys who really went after each other and then became best friends afterwards. You know, I think Trump is one who's quick to turn this page, especially when he wins the back-and-forth.MARTIN: That is Republican strategist Alex Conant. Alex, thank you so much.CONANT: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      As Trump administration's clashes with Venezuela continue, we look at why a 50-year-old Senate committee report on the CIA's role in the assassinations of foreign leaders resonates today.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  The Trump administration is talking openly about trying to remove Venezuela's president from power, getting rid in some way of President Nicolas Maduro. The conversation comes on the 50th anniversary this month of a Senate Committee report on the CIA's role in the assassination of foreign leaders, including several in Latin America. Turns out to be kind of relevant. NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre has been digging into the history. Greg, good morning.GREG MYRE, BYLINE: Hi, Steve.INSKEEP: OK. It's called the Church Committee. If you cover intelligence agencies, national security for very long, you hear about the Church Committee. What was it?MYRE: Yeah, Steve, it's a name referring to Idaho Senator Frank Church, a Democrat who headed the bipartisan committee. It was established in 1975 after a series of reports, mostly in The New York Times, about the CIA's role in attempted or actual assassinations in the 1960s and '70s under both Democratic and Republican presidents. I spoke with Peter Kornbluh. He's with the National Security Archive, a private group that researches national security documents.PETER KORNBLUH: From 1947, when the CIA was officially created, all the way through to 1975, when the Church Committee reports began to be released, the CIA basically had no real oversight. The American public was unaware what was being done in its name, but clearly without its knowledge.INSKEEP: Until this report, which said what?MYRE: The committee gained access to the CIA documents and examined five cases where the spy agency was involved directly or indirectly in assassination plots. Three of the five were against left-wing leaders in Latin America, in Cuba, in Chile and the Dominican Republic. Here's AP video footage from Senator Church, speaking when the report was released.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)FRANK CHURCH: We regard the assassination plots as aberrations. The United States must not adopt the tactics of the enemy. Each time the means we use are wrong, our inner strength, the strength which makes us free, is lessened.MYRE: So several additional reports followed, and Senator Church went on to call the CIA a rogue elephant that was out of control, and it led to reforms still in place today.INSKEEP: Ah. Well, if they're still in place today, how do they relate to this talk of getting rid of Maduro?MYRE: Yeah, really in several ways. First, back then, President Gerald Ford responded to the Church Committee with an executive order that barred the assassination of foreign leaders. Now, Steve, a large gray area has developed after the al-Qaida attacks on 9/11. U.S. presidents maintain they can target individuals that are part of an active conflict with the U.S. Most prominent example, of course, would be Osama bin Laden. But an executive order against assassinations still stands. The Church Committee also led to the creation of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, which oversee the intel agencies. You know, however, members of Congress are complaining today that they're getting very little information on U.S. airstrikes against alleged drug smugglers in the Caribbean or possible military action against Venezuela.INSKEEP: Yeah. And we've been following the movement of an aircraft carrier and other ships into that region. I want to ask about little - another aspect of this history, though, Greg, because hasn't the United States, even before the CIA, had a long history of intervening against foreign governments, particularly in Latin America?MYRE: Yeah. Absolutely true. Happened very often in the last century. Hasn't happened recently. But as a possible analogy, some point to 1989, when the U.S. invaded Panama to arrest that country's president, Manuel Noriega. Noriega took refuge at the Vatican embassy, and while he was there, the U.S. military waited him out and set up loudspeakers and blasted music. Memorably, it included \"Give It Up\" by KC & The Sunshine Band, \"No More Mr. Nice Guy\" by Alice Cooper and \"Paranoid\" by Black Sabbath. We don't know what the Trump administration is planning in Venezuela, but the president has acknowledged authorizing unspecified CIA activity.INSKEEP: Greg, thanks so much.MYRE: Thank you.INSKEEP: NPR's Greg Myre.(SOUNDBITE OF DEAN MCPHEE'S \"SKY BURIAL\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

It's why King, a 54-year-old living in Alexandria, Va., is suing Virginia election officials in federal court to get his voting rights restored.   \"I want them to see that their grandfather was on the right side of things for once in his life,\" he said.   King lost his ability to vote in the state because of a 2018 felony drug possession conviction. He served 11 months in prison and is now challenging Virginia's constitutional rule that automatically strips anyone's voting rights if they're convicted of a felony. The constitution gives the governor sole authority to restore those rights.   \n   More than 300,000 Virginians currently can't vote because of the policy, according to filings in King's legal challenge — which is just one of the ways Virginia's voter restoration system could soon change.   \n   Virginia's incoming governor, Democrat Abigail Spanberger, is expected to implement changes and a proposed constitutional amendment could make the restoration process automatic once someone's served out their sentence.   How Virginia stands out   Virginia is one of just three states where only the governor can restore voting rights for people with felony convictions.   And the governors of the other two states, Iowa and Kentucky, have signed orders to make the process automatic for most people with felony convictions, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, which tracks voting regulations.   Virginia's current governor, Republican Glenn Youngkin, rolled back efforts from his last three predecessors — a Republican and two Democrats — that made the restoration process automatic in most cases. He's implemented a case-by-case review system that has led to far fewer people getting their voting rights back.   Youngkin's protocol has sparked lawsuits and questions about the criteria he's using to make decisions. It's also opened up transparency questions.   \n   \"In the current administration, it's been tough, because we in the past had tried to help people understand the process and figure out what their status was and what they could do to get the right to vote back,\" said Rebecca Green, a law professor at William and Mary. \"But it's been a very low information environment.\"   Youngkin's office has said it's appropriate to consider each application individually. They said Youngkin's decisions are made after a review of all the information, including the nature of someone's felony conviction, whether a gun was used and if court fees are paid.   \n   King's case   King's lawsuit argues the state's disenfranchisement policy violates the Virginia Readmission Act of 1870 — which allowed Virginia to regain congressional representation after the Civil War.   In exchange for Virginia's readmission, the state was prohibited from adding laws that take away people's right to vote, with the only exception being those convicted of a crime considered a common law felony at the time.   These 1870 felonies include crimes like murder and manslaughter, but not drug-related ones like the one King was convicted of.   \"Virginia's one of the only states where we still have to go through hurdles and hoops in order for somebody to tell you, 'OK, now we see you,'\" King said. \"I think the laws are draconian, I think they're archaic and it should be changed.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                \"I Voted\" stickers are seen at a polling station on Nov. 4 in Alexandria, Va.\n                \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia and other groups helped King bring the case forward.   Vishal Agraharkar, a senior supervising attorney for the ACLU of Virginia who's working on King's case, said thousands of Virginians with felony convictions could get their voting rights restored if the case is successful.   \"Virginia has been illegally disenfranchising people, and disproportionately Black people, who were targeted with this disenfranchisement after the Civil War for more than 100 years,\" Agraharkar said. \"We're hoping that we can put that legacy of Jim Crow behind us.\"   Civil liberties advocates have often pointed to the disproportionate impact of felon disenfranchisement on Black people.   A 2024 report from the Sentencing Project — which advocates for responses to crime that minimize imprisonment — said an estimated 4 million Americans had lost their right to vote because of a felony conviction. This included one in every 22 eligible Black voters, which was more than triple the rate of other voters.   Big changes are on the horizon   As King waits on a ruling that could change Virginia's voter disenfranchisement practice, Spanberger is expected to change the rights restoration process used by Youngkin once she takes office in January.   \n   The governor-elect has vowed to ensure all eligible Virginians who have served their prison sentences have their voting rights restored.   Voters could take it out of the governor's hands completely if they approve a proposed constitutional amendment that would automatically restore people's voting rights once they've been released from prison.   To get the amendment on the ballot for voters, the state legislature needs to pass the proposal in back-to-back legislative sessions.   The Democratic-led General Assembly has already passed the measure once, and after Democrats expanded their majority in the House of Delegates earlier this month, the proposal is expected to make it on the state's ballot during next November's midterm elections.   Agraharkar, the ACLU attorney, said he hopes King's legal challenge and the constitutional amendment will usher in a new age of voter access.   \"Both of these efforts can work together to really make a big dent, hopefully this coming year, make really an enormous dent in felony disenfranchisement in Virginia, and hopefully this becomes a relic of the past,\" he said.\n",

Kennedy, says she has been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer.   Schlossberg is a journalist and author who writes about the environment.   She made her diagnosis public in an essay, called \"A Battle with My Blood,\" that was published on the website of The New Yorker on Saturday, the 62nd anniversary of her grandfather's assassination.   In the article, Schlossberg reveals that despite fighting the disease for over a year, her treatments did not result in a lasting remission and says the disease will kill her.   \n   Schlossberg is the daughter of Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg. She is 35 years old and is married and has two children. Here's what to know about the cancer, called acute myeloid leukemia, and what else Schlossberg says in the essay.   What is the disease?   Acute myeloid leukemia is a blood cancer. The form Schlossberg has been diagnosed with is known as acute myeloid leukemia with inversion 3, a rare mutation which is most commonly seen in older patients. Schlossberg learned of her diagnosis at just 34.   \"I would say acute myeloid leukemia with inversion 3 is one of the ones that most of us who manage leukemia look at as probably one of the most aggressive mutations,\" says Dr. Clark Alsfeld, a hematology oncologist with Ochsner MD Anderson Cancer Center in New Orleans, who specializes in leukemias and other myeloid malignancies. He's also an expert in stem cell transplantation, which was part of Schlossberg's treatment.   \"It's very, very challenging to get to remission, long-term prognosis is unfortunately very short, and survival rates are much less than we see with other types of acute myeloid leukemia,\" Alsfeld says.   \n   Very little is known about what causes the disease or what might increase someone's risk of getting it, according to Alsfeld. Schlossberg writes that she didn't feel sick and the disease was discovered via blood tests on the day she gave birth to her second child. She had swum a mile in the pool the day before, she says.   \"The challenge that we have with acute myeloid leukemia, patients ask all the time, 'how long did this exist?'\" before it was detected, he says. \"I usually tell them probably not very long. A lot of these leukemias that we have, we don't think of as something that are lingering for years and years and years before they're developed or before they're detected.\"   \n   Schlossberg's rebuke of RFK Jr.   In the essay, Schlossberg also writes about the physical and emotional pain brought about from the disease, and the anguish of seeing her loved ones share in that pain.   But the essay is not only personal. Schlossberg also offers a stinging indictment of her first cousin once removed, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.   \n   \"Throughout my treatment, he had been on the national stage: previously a Democrat, he was running for President as an Independent,\" Schlossberg writes. \"But mostly as an embarrassment to me and the rest of my immediate family.\"   She describes Kennedy's history of vaccine skepticism, inexperience in the medical field, and antipathy for the funding of medical research as her gravest areas of concern.   \"Suddenly, the health-care system on which I relied felt strained, shaky,\" she writes.   Alsfeld says stories like Schlossberg's can make a difference.   \"Pieces like this are so incredibly important to help bring it home for a lot of people that might hear 'acute myeloid leukemia' and just think of a commercial on TV or something and not really be able to make it as heartfelt as that article was, and make it very real for people,\" he says.   Alsfeld hopes the article spurs renewed interest in funding for medical research, after the Trump administration moved to cut federal research grants this year.\n",

    "body": "Pew poll shows Latino support for Trump is slipping   The Pew Research Center's survey of Latinos show majorities disapprove of the president, especially his policies on the economy and immigration.\n\n    \n        Politics\n    \n\n\n                  \n            November 24, 20253:01 PM ET\n\n      \n\n      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Laura Kelley, Miami-Dade County Democratic Party chair, (second from the left) joins others to support a resolution in favor of reinstating temporary protected status for Venezuelans in February in Miami.\n                \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   No Republican presidential candidate in history did better with Latinos than Donald Trump did in 2024.   But there are lots of signs that support has evaporated. Democrats won big victories earlier this month in elections across the country – with large margins among Latinos. Poll after poll has shown Hispanics declining in support for Trump since he was sworn in for a second term.   And a new, major Pew poll of more than 5,000 Latinos across two surveys underscores this point.   \n   There were some eye-opening findings, including:   Seventy percent disapprove of the job President Trump is doing.    A majority — 55% — said they very strongly disapprove.    Among those who voted for him, Trump is down 12 points. At the beginning of his second term, 93% of Latinos who voted for him approved of the job he was doing. Now, it's 81%.    \n   The economy is a major concern; 4 in 5 see it negatively, and they blame Trump.   The economy was a main reason so many Latinos crossed over to vote for Trump in 2024, but they are really down on how they view it now — 78% rated economic conditions today as only fair or poor. Trump does not escape blame, either. Sixty-one percent said his policies have made economic conditions worse; just 15% said they have made things better.Critically, half of poll respondents said that in the past year, they have struggled to afford food, housing or medical care.    Two-thirds disapprove of Trump's approach on immigration.   71% said Trump is doing too much when it comes to deportations, up 15 points since March.   More than half worry that they, a close friend or family member will be deported.   \n   More than two-thirds say the situation for Latinos has worsened.   \n   That's up 42 points from when it was last asked in 2021. That includes 31% of Trump-voting Hispanics.    While Democrats feel this more strongly, the result is not driven by partisan identity. In two decades of conducting this major poll of Latinos, Pew notes that it has never seen Latinos say their situation is worse than the year before.   Four in 5 said Trump's policies have been harmful to Latinos, including a third of those who voted for him.   \n   Most have serious concerns about their place in America.   \n   Fifty-five percent said they have those serious concerns, up from 48% last year.   Remarkably, a third said they have contemplated leaving the country in the last six months.   Forty-six percent said that's because of the political situation in the country.   Twenty-six percent said it would be to find somewhere with a lower cost of living.\n\n\n",

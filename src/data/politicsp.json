    "body": "\n      NPR's Steve Inskeep asks Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff whether his party is willing to allow a partial government shutdown in order to block new funding for the Department of Homeland Security.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  The Democrats who say they're willing to block funding include Senator Adam Schiff of California, who's on the line. Senator, welcome back.ADAM SCHIFF: Thank you. Good to be with you.INSKEEP: I think I understood from Claudia what happens there if you don't reach a deal by tomorrow night. It sounds like the whole government may be affected, not just DHS. Is that right?SCHIFF: Maybe not the whole government because some funding passed in previous legislation that continues for many months more, but much of the government will shut down unless there is a deal reached by midnight tomorrow.INSKEEP: And you're willing to pay that price.SCHIFF: Well, it'll be the Republicans who make that decision. We want the bill separated from DHS. I'm not prepared to spend another dime on ICE unless there's just a massive set of reforms that include things like ending these indiscriminate sweeps of cities, the deployment of mass numbers of ill-trained ICE troops to places that mayors and governors don't want them, the continued wearing of masks. The masks should be gone. They should be wearing bodycams and have ID. We also want to make sure that there's compliance with the law when it comes to warrants. There should be arrest warrants. If you're going to go into someone's home, you need a judicially signed warrant. None of these administrative warrants signed within DHS. There's going to have to be a lot of wholesale reforms, including an end to the excessive use of force and accountability - real investigations with the participation of state and local police.INSKEEP: We heard John Thune there say that he's reluctant to write those provisions into law, wants you to work something out with the White House, some kind of executive order. What do you make of that?SCHIFF: That's a no-go. I mean, there's absolutely no trust in this administration. And even though the president sounds like he is backpedaling at the moment, you know, that changes from hour to hour. He made some mitigating statements, and then they - he followed them with, again, more attacks on Alex Pretti, more lies about Alex Pretti. So there's no trust in this president. So I think in order for this to work, there's going to have to be real written statutory limits on what ICE and the Customs and Border Protection could do.INSKEEP: Is Senator Thune effectively telling you who's in charge here? Republicans in Congress are going to defer to him anyway.SCHIFF: Well, I don't know. Many Republicans are speaking...INSKEEP: I mean to Trump, of course, is what I mean. But go on, please.SCHIFF: Yeah. Well, look, ultimately, Republicans in Congress have a statutory and a constitutional duty themselves, and that duty is not to do whatever the person or the president wants. It's to do their constitutional duty. So they need to rise up and grow a spine and make sure that we put an end to the murder of people in our streets. You're hearing some Republicans speak out and differ with the president. But whether that will continue, you know, past his prologue, I'm not optimistic. But in this moment, we're going to insist on real changes to ICE. Otherwise, they're certainly not going to have my vote.INSKEEP: You've just made an argument for lawmakers not necessarily doing what the president wants but following their duty. And this raises another question about people in the executive branch. We have some news here, Senator. On Wednesday, we're told the FBI served a search warrant at the election headquarters in Fulton County, Georgia, which includes most of Atlanta. They're looking for ballots from the 2020 election. What do you make of the FBI taking such a step seemingly in support of President Trump's baseless theory that he won in 2020?SCHIFF: Americans really need to, you know, wake up to what's happening here. If they're going to use the FBI unlawfully to do an investigation to once again prove nonexistent fraud from an election the president continues to lie about, then what are they prepared to do in the midterm election? What abuse of power will they use? Will they invoke the Insurrection Act and station police outside of polling stations or military outside of polling stations to try to intimidate people? Will they seize ballots, as they're trying to do in Georgia now? If they'll do that over a past election, will they do that over a present election? So this needs to be a wake-up call, I think, for all of us.On the January 6 Committee, I handled the hearing that looked into Georgia. I still remember vividly that call the president made where he badgered the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to find 11,780 votes that didn't exist. If he was willing to do that then, what more is he willing to do in this much more lawless administration to try to overturn the results or prevent people's vote from counting?INSKEEP: Senator, I'm glad you mentioned the elections coming this fall. A few days ago on this program, we had Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, on. And she described Democrats - really smart Democrats, in her opinion - being around the tabletop, making plans for what might go wrong, what might happen and how to respond. Can you talk to me a little bit about that? What are Democrats doing, so far as you know, to prepare for whatever you think might happen this fall?SCHIFF: We are doing exactly that, which is making all the contingency plans we can. But I'll say this - I was part of the same effort four years ago during the last election, when we came up with about a thousand things that might go wrong in the election except the one that did, which was the insurrection.INSKEEP: Got it.SCHIFF: We never anticipated a mass attack on the Capitol. So I'm circumspect about everything we can anticipate. Look, a lot is going to count on whether our institutions hold, whether our military refuses to execute illegal orders, whether our Republicans are willing to defend our democracy or whether they're still going to go along with a president who simply wants to accumulate more power. There are no, you know, magic buttons to push here. Ultimately, I think it's going to count on the most important player in the political process, and that is our citizens, to make sure they overcome every hurdle to vote - and they're going to try to put hurdles in the way - and to insist that their votes count. That's the best protection we have.INSKEEP: I'm really interested to hear you say that before the 2020 election, you tried to game out what might go wrong and didn't figure out the thing that ultimately did go wrong, in your opinion. I'm just curious if you understand the state of play now. Are Democrats, for example, lining up lawyers, getting ready to make legal arguments? Is there something you can do other than going to court if something wrong, in your opinion, is taking place?SCHIFF: Yes. We are doing exactly that, and litigation is a big part of the strategy, as it was during the previous contested election. I think the challenge is the Supreme Court has never been trustworthy. It certainly isn't now, and litigation has its limits. We counted on a lot of state and local officials - Republican state and local officials to do their duty, which they did. People like Brad Raffensperger and others who said no to the president when the president was asking them to do things illegally, like Rusty Bowers, the Republican speaker in Arizona. Will Republican local elected officials - elections officials - again refuse to do things that are unethical and illegal? That was an important check that we're not sure we will have this time.INSKEEP: Adam Schiff is a Democratic senator from California. Senator Schiff, thanks very much for the time. Really appreciate it.SCHIFF: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF ROB FORD EXPLORER'S \"SPIRIT OF THE SPEED EDITION\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

NPR's Leila Fadel speaks to former Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  The attack against Representative Ilhan Omar was not the only one against a member of Congress in the past week. Representative Maxwell Frost, a Democrat from Florida, said he was punched in the face on Friday by a man who crashed a private party at the Sundance Film Festival. Frost said the man told him President Trump would deport him. The man has been charged with assault. The police department that protects Congress and the U.S. Capitol investigated almost 15,000 cases last year. That's up from more than 9,000 in 2024. Thomas Manger is on the line. He was chief of the U.S. Capitol Police for four years, retiring last year, and he joins me now. Good morning, and thanks for being on the program.THOMAS MANGER: Good morning.FADEL: So why are threats increasing like this?MANGER: Well, I think that it's the violent rhetoric that has heightened the threat environment. And this started, in my view, about 10 years ago, when politicians really on both sides of the aisle but certainly President Trump, when - and during his first run was really shocking some folks with some of the things that he said. But it has gotten worse since then. I mean, just the violent rhetoric from both sides of the aisle - to include the last presidential election, when you had one side that said, if my opponent wins, you won't have a country anymore. The other side said, democracy is on the ballot. So these very drastic predictions, you know, if the other side wins or loses is going to get people worked up.FADEL: Do you see the increase in threats specific to one party? Is there one party in particular that's getting more than the other? And I'm asking as - you know, as a former police chief, just retiring last year.MANGER: Yeah. We got nearly - my last year there, we got nearly 10,000 threats against members of Congress.FADEL: Yeah.MANGER: And it was both sides.FADEL: Yeah.MANGER: There are folks that have been radicalized through this rhetoric on both ends of the political spectrum.FADEL: Now, you mentioned President Trump and his rhetoric. After this attack, we heard him not only not express concern but say to ABC News that Representative Omar is a fraud and, quote, \"she probably had herself sprayed, knowing her.\" And he had no evidence for that comment. What do you make of that type of comment right after an attack like this?MANGER: Well, it's not helpful at all. And it's very difficult when you have folks that believe that their cause is so important. And when you have - and it's really the elected officials themselves - to include the president, but it's elected officials on both sides of the aisle that will use the kind of rhetoric and violent metaphors when - you know, during campaigns and during other times when it is - their followers hear that. And some of the folks are just moved by it to thinking that they have to do something for their cause. And oftentimes, then it results in acts of violence against elected officials or people that are running for office. So it's really concerning that these elected officials continue to use this heightened rhetoric because the - what needs to happen is people need to just stop doing that.FADEL: Now, Capitol Police protect the U.S. Capitol. Does the agency have a role in trying to keep lawmakers safe in their districts?MANGER: Absolutely. This is something that changed after January 6, and I was part of not only protecting the elected officials in Congress while they were at the Capitol and in D.C., but while they were traveling, while they were in their home districts, while they were out in public, while there were continued threats and acts of violence that were occurring. So the Capitol Police have reached agreements with hundreds of local law enforcement agencies to assist them. So when a member of Congress is out speaking at a town hall meeting, the Capitol Police will reach out to that local jurisdiction and ask for assistance to provide a little bit more security. So this has been working very well.FADEL: We'll have to leave it there. Thomas Manger is a former chief of the Capitol Police.

Democrats have refused to back the package without major reforms to the Department of Homeland Security and the ongoing immigration enforcement actions led by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.   At one point, it seemed the memory of the historic 43-day shutdown last year would be put firmly in the rearview mirror, and senators would fairly easily fund the remaining appropriations bill for FY 2026. But after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis by federal agents, Senate Democrats are demanding significant changes to the Homeland Security funding bill.   \n   Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has said Democrats will support the other five appropriations bills, but need to see substantive changes to the sixth.   \"Until ICE is properly reined in and overhauled legislatively, the DHS funding bill doesn't have the votes to pass,\" Schumer said Wednesday.    The measure needed to meet a 60-vote threshold in order to pass. The vote was 45-55.   Democrats are calling for broad changes to the way DHS agents are carrying out their work. This includes barring them from wearing masks, requiring body cameras, setting rules around warrants, and creating a uniform code of conduct and use of force rules.   But changes to the DHS bill would ultimately require House approval. That chamber is on recess this week.   Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has acknowledged the difficult task of getting a new bill to pass the House, where some hardline GOP members have already vowed to throw a wrench into any plans to pass a Senate-modified DHS bill.   \"I think it's really important, if possible, to do it here and not to have to send it back to the House of Representatives, where the future of an appropriations package, I think would be somewhat uncertain,\" Thune said.   \n   Speaking at a Cabinet meeting at the White House on Thursday, President Trump said the administration was working to stave off a shutdown.    \"Hopefully we won't have a shutdown. We're working on that right now,\" Trump said. \"I think we're getting close. The Democrats, I don't believe want to see it either. So we'll work in a very bipartisan way I believe not to have a shutdown. We don't want to shut down.\"\n",

Melania, a big-budget movie about first lady Melania Trump, premieres today with a splashy event at the newly renamed Trump Kennedy Center in Washington, DC. It is set to open on 1,500 screens in the U.S. this weekend, a highly unconventional rollout compared to other films of this type.   Amazon acquired the film for $40 million and is spending another $35 million on marketing, according to a source with direct knowledge who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media.   \"It's just hard to imagine why this number is justified for 'Melania,'\" said Jason Spingarn-Koff, a professor of journalism at UC Berkeley.   \n   Spingarn-Koff is a former Netflix executive who has worked on hundreds of documentaries. He says the market for documentary films these days is depressed, and even Oscar-nominated documentaries aren't getting shown on as many screens, if any.   Questions about how much the first lady is personally making from the film and whether its outsized budget could have been an effort to curry favor with the president were not answered by the White House or Mrs. Trump's personal office.   The film follows Mrs. Trump for 20 days in January as she prepares to re-enter the White House as first lady.   \"Here we go again,\" she says, looking directly at a camera as she enters the U.S. Capitol for her husband's second inauguration. It is one of several quick cuts in a trailer that features dramatic music, glamorous visuals, and an intriguing moment of spousal interaction, in which she calls him \"Mr. President.\"   \n   \"Did you watch it?\" he asks, though the trailer doesn't reveal what \"it\" is.   \"I did not, yeah, I will see it on the news,\" Mrs. Trump says as the music swells again.   In an interview earlier this week on Fox and Friends, Trump was asked about the decision to include that scene. She said she was \"very involved in leading the production and choosing the trailer.\"   \"I want to show the people that they will see the communications and private communications between me and my husband,\" said Mrs. Trump, further teasing her film.   \n   Amazon did not release an advance screener to journalists and reviewers as is typically done to promote a film, and all scheduled Thursday screenings in theaters were cancelled. Ticket sales had been anemic and were getting mocked on social media and by late-night talk show hosts.   On its surface, this would seem to be a documentary, but the first lady is also an executive producer.   \"In these situations, you could only have one take, so whatever we got it, we got it,\" Mrs. Trump said in her \"Fox and Friends\" interview. \"And I had a great team around me and a very talented director.\"   That director is Brett Ratner, known for the Rush Hour action films and for being ostracized in 2017 after accusations of sexual misconduct. He denies wrongdoing. He is not a documentary filmmaker. Mrs. Trump said in another Fox News interview that she chose him because he would execute her vision of a cinematic film.   \"Once the subject of the film is a producer or has … editorial input or even editorial control, then I really think we are in the realm of public relations or in this case it seems to be a work of myth making,\" said Spingarn-Koff.   The first lady has a very carefully cultivated and controlled image, which has created an air of mystery around her, one she is capitalizing on with this film.   Kate Bennett, who wrote a book about Melania Trump and covered her for years at CNN, says people are always looking for clues about what Melania Trump is really thinking or who she really is.   \"I don't think the public will ever really know the deep inner thoughts and behind-the-scenes moments of Melania Trump, by design,\" said Bennett. \"She is a private person in her DNA.\"   And, Bennett says, she is also at her core a Trump, a marketer, who rarely appeared during the campaign without getting a financial cut.   \n   \"There's something really interesting to the fact that we're seeing her the most during this presidency on a screen, in a theater,\" said Bennett. \"That's unlike anything we've seen in traditional politics.\"   Editor's note: Amazon is among NPR's recent financial supporters and pays to distribute some NPR content.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Juana Summers speaks with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., on recent developments around the federal immigration enforcement surge in her home state.   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED for NPR News. I'm Mary Louise Kelly in Washington.JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  And I'm Juana Summers in Minneapolis, where a memorial has sprung up for Alex Pretti, the 37-year-old protester killed by federal immigration agents on Saturday.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Vocalizing)SUMMERS: Last night, with temperatures around zero, people stood in an oval surrounding it, some offering cups of tea or hand warmers. There were flowers, candles and signs. One reads, you can't break us. Another reads, ICE will melt - spring will come. Pretti's killing and the shooting death of Renee Macklin Good by ICE officers have shocked the city and the country.The Trump administration has replaced the leadership of its Minneapolis operation with border czar Tom Homan. But criticism of the federal government's immigration enforcement surge, which continue over the objections of state and local authorities, has hardly stopped. For more, we've reached Senator Amy Klobuchar. She's one of two Democrats who represent Minnesota in the U.S. Senate. Welcome back to the program.AMY KLOBUCHAR: Thank you, Juana. It's wonderful to be on again.SUMMERS: It's great to talk with you. And there's a lot I want to get to, but I do want to start with this. There was an incident that happened last night in Minneapolis where your colleague, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, was rushed by a man during a town hall event Tuesday night and sprayed with liquid via syringe. She's posted on her social media and said that she's OK. I wonder, what's your reaction to this? And does it raise security concerns for you?KLOBUCHAR: My first reaction was, is Ilhan OK? And I actually talked to her about an hour after the town hall ended. And she was in good spirits, as good as she can be. And I think one of the things that was kind of extraordinary is she continued on with the town hall. The security was there. They had used wanding to make sure there were no weapons when people had come into the meeting. So under most accounts, for most members, you would think that was good enough. One of the things that happened here, which doesn't always happen, is there was widespread condemnation of this, including from the Republican Party of Minnesota that said these attacks had no place in our politics. And, of course, the Democratic Party.SUMMERS: Shifting gears a bit. Your state's governor, Tim Walz, and Minneapolis' mayor, Jacob Frey, have each met now with Tom Homan, who President Trump has dispatched to aid ICE operations here in Minnesota. And for his part, Mayor Frey characterized this as a productive conversation. But in a social media post, he did add that his main goal was for the federal government to end the operation here as quickly as possible. Senator, have you been in touch with Tom Homan or the White House recently about the operation here?KLOBUCHAR: Well, I will be talking with him soon. But I've been mainly focused on working with the White House, really over the last few weeks. I actually last week told them, high-ranking officials there, that someone else would be killed because of this operation. There are 3,000 ICE officers still in our state. And I am glad that the Border Patrol people have been pulled out, or at least a big chunk of them. But there are still ICE officers there. And you just can't have a situation where you have ICE officers that are overwhelming local police. Eleven hundred sworn police officers - Minneapolis, St. Paul, - 3,000 ICE officers. It's even more than the 10 metropolitan police offices combined. That means all these suburbs.And our police chiefs have been clear statewide, nationally that this isn't making Minnesota or other states safer. It's making them less safe. I believe that they need to get ICE out of Minnesota. The original idea that they were going to assist with fraud investigations? Great. But this has gone way beyond that. That they would be focused on apprehending violent offenders, that's worthy.SUMMERS: I just - if I can, Senator.KLOBUCHAR: Go ahead.SUMMERS: I want to put to you what President Trump said yesterday. He signaled that he wanted to de-escalate the crackdown in your state. But later on, he described people arrested by ICE in Minnesota here as, quote, \"hardened, vicious, horrible criminals.\" What is your response to his rhetoric?KLOBUCHAR: We know from reporting from The Wall Street Journal that about 4% of people that have been arrested nationally are what they call the worst of the worst. But what we've seen - and I'm sure there are some in Minnesota. I know there are, and that's fine, but that's not what's going on here. In fact, they've been picking up 2-year-olds, sending them to Texas. My office had to work on this case and got a successful result. And then we got this 2-year-old back to her mom.Hmong elders who are pulled out of their house by mistake in their underwear, 5-year-olds, schoolkids, teachers being chased in parking lots, legal citizens repeatedly. Our office is handling over 400 cases. So that is why right now in Congress, we are focused on getting this agency overhauled. They already have way too much money. They were given $75 billion from the Republican bill. They're bigger than the FBI.SUMMERS: That's in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.KLOBUCHAR: Yes.SUMMERS: So I have a question there about this funding issue, though. Given the fact that a huge increase in ICE funding that you mentioned already passed in that bill, what would limiting these appropriations actually effectively do to put pressure on DHS in the near term? I understand that Friday is the deadline to avoid another partial government shutdown.KLOBUCHAR: I am opposed, as are so many of my Democratic colleagues, to this budget that has been proposed for ICE. There is also a major effort underway to use the power of our votes to overhaul ICE. And I'll just give you some ideas. Stopping the surge, getting ICE out of Minnesota and other places. The training that has been reduced to 47 days, for the 47th president, when it should be months and months of training. Getting rid of these masks, and in fact, requiring mandatory body cameras.Ending the bounty system, which has resulted in them picking people up, sending them to detention and releasing them because they still get a bounty. Breaking into someone's home without a judicial warrant. Changing the leadership. I mean, that's just a few ideas here, because we all know your eyes don't lie when you see the video of the killing of Alex. You see what actually happened. So I think, having talked to Alex's parents, the rhetoric used by the administration calling him a domestic terrorist, calling him a would-be assassin has been the most hurtful thing to their family.SUMMERS: I just want to press you again on this issue of funding.KLOBUCHAR: Sure.SUMMERS: Are you and your fellow Senate Democrats willing to shut down the government over the issue of funding for the Department of Homeland Security?KLOBUCHAR: So here's what we want to see happen. There's a number of bills, five bills that have strong bipartisan support for different agencies that can be approved. Separate out Homeland Security, which includes ICE, and then make these necessary forms to ICE. So we are united on that. And I think the better question is, are Republicans willing to come to the table for once to actually talk about the changes that they know in their heart need to be made. If they believe in liberty and the Constitution - if they believe in the First Amendment right to assembly, the Fourth Amendment protection against search and seizure, the Second Amendment right to bear arms, the Fifth Amendment right to due process - then they should be standing with us.SUMMERS: Senator, have you heard that willingness from your Republican colleagues? Do they seem prepared to come to the table on this issue of reforming ICE, as you say, or to stop funding for ICE?KLOBUCHAR: They have been talking with us in small groups, one on one. And I think there is some interest. And so they're going to have to understand that Democrats are insisting on this. And that's what's happening right now.SUMMERS: Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat from Minnesota. Thank you so much.KLOBUCHAR: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

PAUL, Minn. — Sen. Amy Klobuchar announced her run for Minnesota governor early Thursday with a video posted on X, following Gov. Tim Walz's recent announcement that he was ending his bid for a third term in the role.   \"Minnesotans, we've been through a lot,\" Klobuchar said in the video, going on to recount several tragedies the state has faced in recent months, including the separate shootings of two American citizens by ICE agents.   \"We cannot sugarcoat how hard this is,\" she said. \"But in these moments of enormous difficulty, we find strength in our Minnesota values of hard work, freedom and simple decency and goodwill.\"    \n   \"I believe we will stand up for what's right and fix what's wrong,\" Klobuchar added before making it official. \"That's why, today, I'm announcing my candidacy for governor of Minnesota.\"   \n            Minnesotans, we’ve been through a lot.And I believe this moment calls for grit, resilience, and faith in each other. I believe we must stand up for what’s right. And fix what’s wrong. Today, I’m announcing my candidacy for Governor. pic.twitter.com/yVnbvmMyxO— Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) January 29, 2026\n   \n   Klobuchar, who won a fourth Senate term in 2024, has racked up double-digit wins in each of her races. In 2020, she ran an unsuccessful presidential campaign among a crowded field of Democratic candidates.   When Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz announced that he would drop his bid for reelection, the idea of Klobuchar entering the race began to emerge.   \"I like my job very much,\" Klobuchar told Minnesota Public Radio on Wednesday, ahead of Thursday's announcement. \"And Minnesota has given me this honor of serving them in the Senate. But I love my state more.\"   Walz faced criticism from state Republicans to President Trump for allegations of rampant social-services fraud on his watch. There is no evidence that Walz took part in the fraud or committed any other crimes, but his political opponents say that he failed to stop the wholesale theft of taxpayer funds during his time in office.   As a sitting governor, Walz was not facing any competition from other Democratic hopefuls. Yet more than a dozen Republicans are in the governor's race, including House Speaker Lisa Demuth, the state's top Republican, businessman Kendall Qualls, state Rep. Kristin Robbins and My Pillow founder and CEO Mike Lindell.   \n   Klobuchar's entrance could upend that GOP field as well, as some of the candidates reassess their chances of defeating a durable statewide official instead of the politically wounded Walz.   Last week, when Klobuchar filed initial paperwork to run for governor, the Minnesota Republican Party called on her to resign from the Senate while she campaigns for another office.   \"Minnesota needs a governor who is all in — not a Washington insider running a gutless political audition,\" Minnesota Republican Party Chair Alex Plechash said in a statement. \"If Klobuchar can't even choose which job she wants, Minnesotans can be confident she won't have the backbone to fix the problems Democrats created.\"   Former Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty is among those who have said Republicans' chances at winning the governor's seat for the first time in 20 years would weaken if Klobuchar joined the race.   \"That's going to fundamentally change the governor's race in Minnesota,\" Pawlenty told MPR News. \"She would be a very, very formidable candidate in that race and so it changes everything.\"\n",

The Jan. 29, 2025, directive targeted antisemitism on campus and launched investigations at five schools — later widened to 60.   But within weeks of the executive order, federal agencies started withholding billions of dollars in contracts and grants from several high-profile schools and pressuring them to align their policies more closely with Trump's on a range of issues that extended beyond antisemitism.   \n   Elite universities soon began reaching settlements, starting with the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University in July. Harvard University was a notable exception, challenging the administration's actions in court. In September, a federal judge ruled in Harvard's favor that the government illegally froze more than $2 billion in federal grants and contracts, a decision the government is appealing. Despite Harvard's victory, more schools agreed to deals.    Some universities paid the government millions of dollars; others paid nothing but agreed to policy or personnel changes. But a common theme has emerged over the past year: The administration is seeking to alter the culture at these powerful institutions, barring them, for instance, from supporting programs aimed at diversity, equity and inclusion.   \n   Loading...\n   What is the administration's goal? And can it do that?    Universities have stressed that reaching a settlement doesn't mean they admit to any wrongdoing. But the deals have called for colleges to agree to policy changes, like adopting definitions of gender as laid out by the president's executive orders, affecting everything from campus housing to athletic programs.   \"In just a year, President Trump has completely transformed American higher education by restoring merit, enforcing civil rights, and eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse,\" White House spokesperson Liz Huston told NPR in an email. Huston said the Trump administration \"will keep holding even more [higher education institutions] accountable over the next three years — to promote academic excellence and maintain America's advantage for generations to come.\"   \n   But Trump's use of federal funds to force changes has raised questions from constitutional scholars about whether his tactics violate the law.   \"What I find striking and disturbing about what's happened here,\" says Thomas Berry, the director of constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, \"is that the federal government started by simply pausing all of this funding\" without proving its allegations.   Berry says that Cato doesn't love the idea of private universities being dependent on federal funds. But he also says the government shouldn't use that relationship to meddle in how schools would normally operate.   \n   \"To me, it's a blatant violation of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine of the First Amendment,\" says Berry.   The idea behind that doctrine is that a government can't say someone has to give up a constitutional right such as free speech or they won't get a benefit — like federal money.   Echoing Berry's point, Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors, says, \"Six or seven [Supreme Court] rulings from 1920 onwards all held that the federal government cannot use purse strings to control speech.\"   \n   The government has formal processes to enforce civil rights statutes and court rulings, but Berry says the Trump administration isn't using those tools. Instead, he says, the administration seems to be channeling Trump's history of filing lawsuits to accomplish his business and personal goals.   \"Trump has such a long history as a private citizen of suing individual people or individual entities and dealing with them one at a time,\" he says. \"But it's concerning when it's from the federal government.\"   \n   The American Association of University Professors has sued the Trump administration in several venues over its withholding of funds and grants. Its president, Wolfson, is blunt in characterizing the settlements.   \"It was extortion.\"   He also says the government's actions are unconstitutional and undermine academic freedoms, while endangering research projects that can benefit the American public.   Still, the government secured significant payments and concessions from a slate of well-regarded universities in 2025:   Northwestern University:    The Illinois school agreed in late November to pay $75 million to the government over three years to unlock some $790 million in frozen federal money and end civil rights investigations by several agencies.The Trump administration had accused Northwestern of allowing antisemitism to spread on campus, related to protests against Israel's attacks on Gaza.Northwestern's interim president, Henry Bienen, said that the university had been paying some $40 million every month to maintain research and that the deal was \"the best and most certain method\" to restore federal funding. A legal battle would likely have lasted for years, he said.Policy changes that Northwestern agreed to included terminating the Deering Meadow Agreement, a 2024 pact with demonstrators under which the university had, among other things, provided temporary space for two Middle Eastern and Muslim student groups.   \n   Cornell University:    Faced with losing more than $250 million in federal funds, Cornell announced a deal with the government on Nov. 7. The government closed civil rights investigations that focused on Cornell's compliance with antidiscrimination laws in its admissions procedures.Cornell will pay a total of $60 million over three years: $30 million to the government and $30 million for \"research to strengthen U.S. agriculture,\" according to the university's president, Michael Kotlikoff.Cornell also agreed to use guidance from the Justice Department \"as a training resource to faculty and staff.\" That July 2025 memo from Attorney General Pam Bondi equates DEI programs to \"discriminatory practices.\"   University of Virginia:    UVA's interim president, Paul Mahoney, signed a deal with the Justice Department on Oct. 22, months after then-President Jim Ryan resigned. Ryan had said the federal government threatened to gut funding if he remained. The university received more than $400 million in federal research funds in the 2024 financial year. The Justice Department had opened seven investigations into UVA in nine weeks, many of them related to the school's response to Trump's order to end diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.UVA isn't required to pay a fine or set up an external monitor of its practices. The school affirmed it will follow civil rights laws, and it also agreed to adopt Bondi's guidance on what constitutes discrimination.   Brown University:    On July 30, Brown University agreed to pay $50 million over 10 years to local workforce development organizations. The deal emerged after the White House said it would freeze $510 million of federal funding due to allegations of antisemitism on Brown's campus and the school's diversity, equity and inclusion work.Under the deal, Brown also pledged to adopt definitions of \"male\" and \"female\" as laid out in a Trump executive order, and to not consider race in its admissions and programming.   Columbia University:    In late July, the White House and Columbia University said the university would pay some $221 million to resolve several investigations, as NPR reported. The school previously said the government suspended \"the majority\" of $1.3 billion in federal research funding.The settlement calls for Columbia to pay $200 million over three years related to the administration's allegations of discriminatory practices, and $21 million to settle an investigation into workplace harassment related to the college's Jewish employees.Among other measures, the settlement stipulates that Columbia won't consider race in admissions, programming or hiring, will provide a demographic and academics breakdown of all rejected and admitted students, and will review its international admissions process.   \n   University of Pennsylvania:    On July 1, the school, Trump's alma mater, reached an agreement that included revising records related to a transgender swimmer's results, as well as its policies on transgender athletes, after the Trump administration froze $175 million of federal funding. In 2022, Lia Thomas, a transgender athlete at Penn, won high-profile swimming titles at the women's Ivy League championships.\n",

We mentioned a confrontation in Congress. Lawmakers face a deadline Friday to fund the government or see a partial shutdown. Senate Democrats are demanding changes before they give their votes to the Department of Homeland Security. Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois is one of those Democrats, and she's on the line. Good morning.TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Good morning, Steve. How are you?INSKEEP: I'm doing fine. Thanks for joining us. I know that one of the things you're demanding is new rules on the use of force by DHS agents. What sort of rules do you mean?DUCKWORTH: Well, there's several things. One is that we want to make sure that if there's any force or - involved with a DHS agent that there's independent investigation. So if they start to use force, whether it is a shooting, something like that, then especially when a member of the public is harmed, there should be independent investigation of those ICE agents.INSKEEP: I want to make sure I understand what you mean by independent. In the case of Alex Pretti, who was killed the other day, federal agents denied state prosecutors access to the crime scene. You're saying that you would want state authorities to investigate a case like this? Or what do you mean by independent?DUCKWORTH: Well, several - over a hundred days ago, I sent their inspector general a request saying, let's form a task force. Let's form a task force with both local police, but also justice and DHS investigators that are independent of ICE, to do - to look into the violence involving ICE agents. And remember, this is after what they did in Chicago, which is when I put in the request. And they denied my request. And then, within the language of the budget bill for ICE that came out of the House, they inserted language that says there will be no independent investigation of ICE. And that, for me, was the last straw.INSKEEP: Meaning that rather than making it a matter of law that there should be, it's actually a matter of law that it should not be independently...DUCKWORTH: Correct.INSKEEP: ...Investigated.DUCKWORTH: Correct. Correct.INSKEEP: You also, as I understand, want ICE to end what are described as roving patrols. I think I understand what you mean, but why don't you describe it to me? What is going on?DUCKWORTH: So ICE is allowed under current law to basically rove around the streets of our cities, of our towns, as long as it is within 100 air miles of a - of our nation's borders. So 100 air miles from the border with Mexico, a border air - you know, 100 air miles on the border with Canada. In my case, in Illinois, they count the Lake Michigan as a border.INSKEEP: OK.DUCKWORTH: So that is a long way for ICE to have unfettered access. I think that if they're going to do their border mission, then it should be reduced to one air mile, 'cause right now they can range all the way through halfway across my state if they want.INSKEEP: And when we talk about roving patrols, these are guys going around on the street saying, you look kind of foreign to me. You have an accent - which is actually described in a Supreme Court ruling, by the way. You have an accent. You look like not from here, and we want to ask you some questions. That's the kind of thing you want to forbid except very near the border. Is that right?DUCKWORTH: That's correct. Now, remember that they also in Chicago, in these roving patrols, did things like saw people going in and out of a Latino grocery store and deployed smoke grenades outside the store so that people would run out. And then they would grab people.INSKEEP: Senator, I want to ask about a bit of news we have in the last 24 hours or so involving the killing of Alex Pretti. There's now a new video moving around. Republicans are making a lot of it. It is not from the day in which Pretti was killed last weekend. It's 11 days earlier. But somebody who looks a lot like him is out on the street, having some kind of confrontation with federal agents. And he gets upset, and he kicks a vehicle and breaks a taillight of a federal vehicle. This, in the eyes of Republicans, shows that he was more violent than people imagined. What, if anything, does this add to the picture for you?DUCKWORTH: Well, this adds for me that my Republican colleagues are on the blame-the-victim bandwagon. We're talking about an incident, captured on video, where it was clear that all he was doing was holding a cellphone and trying to protect a woman from ICE officials when he was brutally murdered. So let's talk about that. I mean, if the - any court, if you were to bring this into court and say, well, you know, this guy was out there protesting before, the judge would throw this out. And so we need to stop blaming the victim, and we need to focus on ICE. And - but that's what my Republican colleagues want to do. They are too afraid to confront Donald Trump and the fact that this brutality is not something that Americans want on their city streets.INSKEEP: OK. And just to be clear here - we've got about 10 seconds left - the deadline is tomorrow. Do you think you'll have an agreement with your Republican colleagues on this bill?DUCKWORTH: I hope that they will agree to something. But my - you know, my hopes are not that high.INSKEEP: Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, thanks so much. Really appreciate it.DUCKWORTH: Thank you.INSKEEP: We've asked Trump administration officials and Republican leaders in Congress to join us for interviews.

    "body": "\n      Democrats are demanding changes to a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security. The fight over spending could cause a partial government shutdown at the end of the week.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Senate Democrats say they're going to block a government funding package that includes money for the Department of Homeland Security until there are reforms to how immigration agents are working in this country.LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer spoke with reporters in the Capitol yesterday.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHUCK SCHUMER: Senate Democrats are united on a set of common sense and necessary policy goals that we need to rein in ICE and end the violence.INSKEEP: Either lawmakers make some agreement or there will be another partial government shutdown at the end of the day on Friday. In a few moments, we'll speak with Democratic Senator Adam Schiff. We begin with the facts.FADEL: NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales has been following this and joins us now. Good morning, Claudia.CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila.FADEL: OK, so this same package passed with significant bipartisan support last week in the House. But then we saw the killing of Alex Pretti over the weekend in Minneapolis by federal agents. So how did that change what we expect to happen in the Senate?GRISALES: Well, in some ways, it changed everything. The Senate is supposed to vote today to advance this $1.3 trillion package. It's a six-bill package, and one of those funds DHS while the other five addresses other parts of the government. And yesterday, we heard Democrats detail this list of reforms. They want to see input implemented before they support the DHS funding after federal immigration officers shot and killed Alex Pretti in Minneapolis over the weekend.FADEL: So what are they asking for?GRISALES: They want to pass those five other spending bills in the package and leave DHS out while they renegotiate those terms. Schumer told reporters he also wants new rules set around warrants. He wants tightened cooperation with local law enforcement, create a new uniform code of conduct, as well as use-of-force rules. They want more accountability and transparency, including taking off the masks and putting body cameras on. But it's unclear if the Senate can reach a deal on this in time. Otherwise, we could see other parts of the government in addition to DHS, like the Defense Department, Health and Human Services, lose funding starting this weekend.FADEL: And it takes months to negotiate...GRISALES: Right.FADEL: ...These bipartisan funding packages. So is it even possible for them to pass those kinds of changes at this point?GRISALES: Well, it is a tall order. The Senate would need consent from all of its members to split up these bills, perhaps setting up a series of new votes, renegotiate a DHS bill in time to try and pass it.FADEL: And how have Republicans responded?GRISALES: Well, Thune and other leaders maintain they can't split this package up. They know it would be a hard pass in the House. Here's Thune.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN THUNE: I think it's really important, if possible, to do it here, not to have to send it back to the House of Representatives where the future of an appropriations package, I think, would be somewhat uncertain.GRISALES: But we should note, we heard some mixed signals last night.FADEL: OK.GRISALES: Some rank-and-file Republican senators said they're on board. I heard one say at least a bunch of his colleagues would agree to the move. So it's an indicator of how at least some Republicans see this as a high political stakes moment to respond to Pretti's death.FADEL: Are there any other ways they could come to a solution without the risk of this partial shutdown?GRISALES: Well, Thune is one key Republican saying yes. He says Democrats need to work this out directly with the White House. Some suggest that could come in the form of executive orders. So we're watching ongoing conversations between Schumer, other Democrats and the White House for any clues of a different off-ramp. But we should note, many Democrats don't trust something that does not become law, so that sets up this stalemate with no clear solution at the moment.FADEL: That's NPR's Claudia Grisales.

Ilhan Omar spoke at a Minneapolis mall Wednesday, one day after a man sprayed her with liquid as she addressed a town hall. Omar said \"fear and intimidation\" won't stop her.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  The man who attacked Democratic representative Ilhan Omar has been transferred to federal custody. He sprayed the Minnesota lawmaker with some kind of liquid at a public event on Tuesday night. Did you see the video of this? People wanted her to stop the event, and instead she just went right on. And then on Wednesday night, Omar held another public event at a Minneapolis mall. Minnesota Public Radio's Peter Cox reports.PETER COX, BYLINE: Omar spoke last night at a mall that houses nearly 100 Somali-owned businesses, which have been hit hard by the immigration crackdown launched two months ago by the Trump administration. The Democrat told last night's crowd the attack would not scare her away from being in public.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ILHAN OMAR: I think my presence here should tell you that fear and intimidation doesn't work on me.COX: Omar was criticizing the administration's aggressive immigration tactics when a man ran toward her, spraying her with a liquid as the audience watched in shock.(CROSSTALK)COX: Video from Reuters shows Omar immediately moved toward the man with her fists up, but a security guard tackled him. The man was arrested and Omar continued her talk. Police identified him as 55-year-old Anthony Kazmierczak. He was booked on suspicion of third-degree assault. Prosecutors say the unidentified liquid used in the attack was not toxic. The FBI is investigating. No charges have been filed yet. Kazmierczak has had previous convictions, one for auto theft in 1989 and two for driving while intoxicated. His social media posts indicated he supported President Trump and was critical of Democrats. Trump has repeatedly criticized Omar and Minnesota's Somali community, at times, calling Somalia a garbage country. Omar is Somali American. Tuesday's attack drew condemnation by Democrats and some Republicans in Congress. President Trump suggested to ABC News, without evidence, that the attack was possibly staged. Omar says Trump's rhetoric against her puts her in danger.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)OMAR: Every time the president of the United States has chosen to use hateful rhetoric to talk about me and the community that I represent, my death threats skyrocket.COX: The White House did not respond to a request for comment. U.S. Capitol Police say threats against congressional lawmakers have nearly doubled over the last three years, with nearly 15,000 reported in 2025.For NPR News.

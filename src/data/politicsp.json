In a few moments, we'll discuss all of this with John Bolton, a national security adviser in President Trump's first term. First, though, let's get the facts.MARTIN: NPR's Jane Arraf is following the talks from Amman, Jordan, and is with us now to tell us more. Good morning, Jane.JANE ARRAF, BYLINE: Good morning, Michel.MARTIN: So these are the third high-level talks between Iran and the U.S. in this round of negotiations over curbing Iran's nuclear program. If you would, just remind us about the background against which this is all taking place.ARRAF: So Israel attacked Iran last June, and those were followed by U.S. airstrikes just before scheduled negotiations. So that obviously put a halt, a dramatic halt, to those talks. These ones now are an even bigger deal because of the U.S. military buildup in the Middle East, the biggest since the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003. So those U.S. threats against Iran and the probable Iranian retaliation have raised what seems to be a very real risk of a wider war, and it has the entire region in a state of high alert. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke to reporters late Wednesday. He said he didn't know if today's talks were the key for a decision on military action, but he added this.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARCO RUBIO: It would be good if progress was made on Thursday. And I would say that the Iranian insistence on not discussing ballistic missiles is a big, big problem. I'll leave it at that.ARRAF: So in addition to uranium enrichment being discussed, the U.S. is demanding that Iran give up ballistic weapons as well.MARTIN: You know, it's interesting, Jane, that both sides seem to be tamping down expectations of any breakthrough today. So just give us a sense of the state of play and what can be accomplished.ARRAF: Sure. The Ammani foreign minister, who's mediating the talks, is going to relay the Iranian counterproposals that he received to the U.S. delegation this morning. That delegation is headed by Steve Witkoff, the billionaire real estate developer appointed by President Trump as his special Middle East envoy, and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. The Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said yesterday there was basis for some agreement with the U.S. on the nuclear issue, but he makes clear that ballistic missiles are not on the table. Iran has said that expecting it to give up its national defense assets is a demand driven by Israel, and he calls it a recipe for failure in negotiations. So bottom line, no breakthrough is expected today. But if more talks are scheduled, that itself is seen as progress.MARTIN: And this demand for no nuclear or ballistic weapons is not all that this administration wants from Iran. So tell us more about that.ARRAF: The administration's also demanding that Iran stop support for militant groups in other countries. It has demanded that it halt its crackdown on Iranian anti-government protests in which thousands of people, mostly protesters, have been killed by security forces. Limited protests restarted in Iran last weekend. Ultimately, though, there's that specter of toppling the regime. Trump in February said regime change in Iran would be the best thing that could happen. So that really is hanging over everything.MARTIN: That's NPR's Jane Arraf. Jane, thank you.ARRAF: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

A US District Court judge denied a preservation group's effort to put a pause on construction, but left the door open to a revised filing.   Trump celebrated with a social media post, writing \"Great news for America, and our wonderful White House! The Judge on the case of what will be the most beautiful Ballroom anywhere in the World, has just thrown out, and completely erased, the effort to stop its construction.\"   That's not exactly what Judge Richard Leon's opinion said.   \n   The National Trust for Historic Preservation argued the president hadn't followed proper procedure in tearing down the East Wing of the White House and soliciting private donations to fund the $300-million ballroom. In his opinion Leon wrote that he wasn't making a determination on the merits because of the way the suit had been framed. He concluded, saying that if the group were to amend its complaint \"the Court will expeditiously consider it and, if viable, address the merits of the novel and weighty issues presented.\"   The group responded with disappointment, but said they would continue pushing to halt construction.   \"While we are disappointed that the Court did not issue the preliminary injunction, we were pleased that Judge Leon ruled that the National Trust has standing to bring this lawsuit, as we have asserted from the start,\" Carol Quillen, president and CEO of the National Trust, said in a statement. \"We are also pleased that he encouraged us to amend our complaint—specifically, to assert that the President has acted beyond his statutory authority—and we plan to do so promptly.\"   The planned ballroom is designed to seat 1,000 guests and has long been a dream project for Trump. It generated massive controversy and public pushback, but recently got approval from the Commission of Fine Arts, an architectural review panel now packed with Trump allies. The commission voted to give it a final signoff despite not seeing the final design. It had received more than 2,000 public comments, which according to staff were 99% negative.   \n   The White House is also seeking approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, which will review ballroom plans at its next meeting on March 5. It is also dominated by Trump appointees and not expected to give final approval until April.   \"The Ballroom construction, which is anticipated to also handle future Inaugurations and large State Visits, is ahead of schedule, and under budget,\" Trump said in his post. \"It will stand long into the future as a symbol to the Greatness of America!\"\n",

    "body": "\n      In California, the two candidates with the most votes in the primary advance to the general election, regardless of party. That's an issue for Democrats who have nine major candidates for governor.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  California Governor Gavin Newsom knows he's widely considered a potential presidential candidate in 2028 because Newsom is term-limited. Something like a small army of Democrats is hoping to succeed him, but the party is worried that the state's unique primary system is leading to something unthinkable - a general election between two Republicans in the nation's largest blue state. Guy Marzorati from member station KQED has this report.GUY MARZORATI, BYLINE: Democratic activists bustled around San Francisco's massive Moscone Center convention hall last week, campaign workers setting up booths and hanging banners for the California Democratic Party Convention. The three-day event was a premiere showcase for the Democrats vying to be the state's next governor.RYAN PARVIZSHAHI: Right now, we have a pretty crowded field with Democrats running to replace Gavin Newsom.MARZORATI: Ryan Parvizshahi, a California political consultant, ran through some of the top names.PARVIZSHAHI: Eric Swalwell. He's a congressman out here in the Bay Area.MARZORATI: There's Tom Steyer, a billionaire philanthropist.PARVIZSHAHI: Matt Mahan, who's the mayor of San Jose.MARZORATI: Xavier Becerra, the former attorney general. Antonio Villaraigosa, the former mayor of LA.PARVIZSHAHI: And Katie Porter, former congresswoman.MARZORATI: And that's just on the Democratic side. There's also two leading Republicans - commentator Steve Hilton and Chad Bianco, the sheriff of Riverside County. In California, Democrats and Republicans appear on the ballot together in the primary. The two candidates who receive the most votes move on to the general election. A poll this week from a think tank, the Public Policy Institute of California, found three Democrats - Porter, Swalwell and Steyer - in a virtual tie with Republicans Hilton and Bianco.MARK BALDASSARE: No telling, at this point, who the top two candidates are going to be...MARZORATI: That's Mark Baldassare, the survey's director.BALDASSARE: ...And whether they're going to be Democrats or Republicans that are going to be running for governor in November.MARZORATI: The fractured vote means that, yes, two Republicans could advance to the general election in California.NANCY TUNG: You know, it's not a negligible concern.MARZORATI: Nancy Tung is the chair of the San Francisco Democratic Party.TUNG: Because, you know, the Republican vote is going to be split two ways versus the Democratic vote that could be split - I mean, we have nine major candidates. It could be split into pieces.MARZORATI: The idea of electing a Republican governor, which California hasn't done in 20 years, is starting to worry Tung.TUNG: If we don't have somebody in the top two, then that seems like a future that I don't want to acknowledge.MARZORATI: But other Democrats are less concerned. State party Chair Rusty Hicks says candidates can take clear steps to stand out.RUSTY HICKS: Those who are able to raise the resources to communicate a message, those who land significant endorsements and supporters.MARZORATI: By the time voting begins in May...HICKS: My guess is we're not going to have the same number of candidates truly competing for the support of California voters.MARZORATI: But candidates can't wait that long to get their names off the ballot. The deadline for that is next month. For NPR News, I'm Guy Marzorati in San Jose.(SOUNDBITE OF MINUTEMEN'S \"COHESION\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The Republican-led committee subpoenaed Clinton, and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, to appear in its investigation into convicted sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.    The former president will take questions Friday from the committee.   In a short press conference following the deposition, Hillary Clinton said she wished the proceedings had been public and that she and her attorneys have asked for transcripts and videos to be available as soon as possible.   \n   \"It was disappointing that they refused to hold a public hearing so I wouldn't have to be out here characterizing it for you,\" she told reporters outside the Chappaqua Performing Arts Center in New York where the hearing took place. \"You could have seen it for yourself. We had asked for that. We think it would have been better for the committee and its efforts to gather whatever information they are seeking.\"    Lamenting what she called \"repetitive\" questioning, Clinton said she would not appear before the committee again, even if the deposition were public.    \"I don't know how many times I had to say I did not know Jeffrey Epstein. I never went to his island, I never went to his home, I never went to his offices,\" she said. The former president, her husband Bill, did have a friendship with Epstein and photographs of him appear in the Epstein files. Bill Clinton has not be accused of wrongdoing.    Clinton said by the end of the hearing, Republicans were asking her off-topic questions about UFOs and the pizzagate conspiracy theory that falsely claimed some high-profile Democrats were involved in a child sex-trafficiking ring.    In a preview of what lawmakers may hear from former President Bill Clinton Friday, Hillary Clinton said she was confident that Bill Clinton knew nothing about Epstein's criminal history and that her husband's relationship with Epstein ended \"several years before anything about Epstein's criminal history came to light.\"    \n   She added Epstein was given a sweetheart deal when he was initially charged and convicted in 2008 of soliciting sex from underage girls in Florida.    \"I think it is fair to say that the vast majority of people who had contact with him before his criminal pleas in '08, they did not know what he was doing,\" Clinton said, \"and I think that that is exactly what my husband will testify to tomorrow.\"    Committee Chair, Kentucky Republican Rep. James Comer, said he hopes to have the video publicly available within the next 24 hours. The transcript, Comer said, will be published once Clinton's attorneys approve it, which are the standard rules of a deposition.    Despite a brief interruption shortly after the proceedings started, when Clinton halted the deposition after a photo from inside the room was posted by a conservative influencer on X, the questioning ultimately continued with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.    Speaking after the deposition, Comer and his fellow Republicans said it was  productive and that Clinton answered most of their questions but that it \"was a shame\" that it took months to get the Clintons to agree to testify.    \"I think we learned a lot. There were a lot of questions that we asked that we, you know, weren't satisfied with the answers that we got, but we will continue to move forward,\" Comer said.    Comer said there were a number of times Clinton responded with \"I don't know, you'll have to ask my husband.\" And that is exactly what he plans to do on Friday.   \"We have a lot of questions for her husband tomorrow, and I'm confident that deposition will last even longer than this one,\" Comer said.\n",

Big tech has \"scrambled the typical ideological alignments of the left and the right,\" says David Primo, a professor of political science and business administration at the University of Rochester in New York. \"Conservatives and liberals are saying, 'Well, here's an opportunity for us to stop what we think is a problem.'\"   \n   And while the two parties remain far apart on many issues — like tax policy, Primo says — it's not just big tech that has Republicans and Democrats aligned.   Regulating artificial intelligence   Ron DeSantis of Florida and Kathy Hochul of New York, two governors on opposite sides of the political spectrum, sound a lot alike when it comes to reining in AI.   DeSantis, a Republican, is backing legislation in Florida called the Artificial Intelligence Bill of Rights. The proposal, working its way through the state Senate, makes it illegal to use a person's name, image or likeness without their consent, requires anyone under 18 to have parental permission to engage with companion chatbots and mandates that bots remind users they're not talking to humans.   \"I really fear that if this is not addressed in an intelligent and proper way, you know, it could set off an age of darkness and deceit,\" DeSantis said when proposing the bill package. Tech companies have to be regulated, he says, because they have prioritized profits over user safety.   New York already requires chatbots to identify themselves as non-humans. This year, Hochul is pushing to further limit them. She wants to ban chatbots within social media apps for kids under 18. Other proposals would limit the way bots can interact with young people.   \n   \"We're going to disable certain companion features. You've heard about these, right?\" she asked an audience gathered at her high school alma mater earlier this year.   \"Under our proposals, we're removing that burden from parents and placing the responsibility where it belongs — on the shoulders of the app companies and the platforms themselves.\"   Late last year, Trump issued an executive order trying to prevent states from regulating AI on their own. But Republicans and Democrats in states are pressing ahead anyway. Nearly every state has a proposal to regulate AI. They range from requiring humans to oversee AI decisions about employees to blocking AI surveillance that could be used to set different prices for consumers.   Data center pushback    As the public's appetite for AI grows, so does the need for more data centers to handle the massive computing demands. That's a concern in states because data centers require substantial amounts of electricity and water to operate.   In Florida, lawmakers are raising issues about effects on the power grid and water use, and the possibility of passing higher utility costs along to residents, which the Republican-led state Senate is working to address. DeSantis says he thinks many of the arguments in favor of data centers, such as the idea that they'll drive job creation or lower property tax rates, are largely overblown.   South Dakota wants to make sure the state can't overrule local governments when it comes to regulating data centers. Oklahoma is also considering bills to limit the impact of data center growth.   As with the AI debate, Trump and most states have found themselves on opposite sides of the data center fight, too. Trump has largely been supportive of their growth, but says tech companies have to pay their own way. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, the president said, \"We're telling the major tech companies that they have the obligation to provide for their own power needs; they can build their own power plants as part of their factory.\" His administration wants to require tech companies building new centers to pay more for electricity to control price increases affecting consumers.   \n   Democratic lawmakers in New York and Maine are proposing a temporary ban on data centers, as are Republicans in Oklahoma.   The bill in New York is fairly new, but Hochul has announced the state's Public Service Commission will take a close look at the issue to ensure that data centers are \"paying their fair share.\"     In Colorado, a proposal would require data centers to use renewable energy for their operations. And many states, led by Republicans and Democrats alike, are considering expanding nuclear energy to help power AI.   Tech companies are opposing many of these proposals and putting money into political campaigns. They say it would be impossible to follow different laws in each state and that regulations could stifle innovation that could benefit the public.   Housing   Nationwide, the rising cost of housing is also a concern for both parties. In Florida, a bill to loosen restrictions on accessory dwelling units received full bipartisan support in the state Senate. DeSantis wants to address the affordable housing crisis by cutting property taxes. That isn't sitting well with Democrats in the state who say they worry about the impact on local governments. They say decreasing property insurance rates would be a better path.   Lawmakers in New York and other states are trying to streamline environmental regulations. Dozens of states are considering proposals to cut building regulations, strengthen tenants' rights and improve conditions in rental housing. In other words, when it comes to housing, lawmakers across the political spectrum are embracing ideas usually popular with one party or the other.\n",

The rules slash requirements for security and environmental protections.\n                \n                    Idaho National Laboratory/Collage by Joan Wong for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Idaho National Laboratory/Collage by Joan Wong for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   The Department of Energy has made public a set of new rules that slash environmental and security requirements for experimental nuclear reactors.   Last month, NPR reported on the existence of the rules, which were quietly rewritten to accelerate development of a new generation of nuclear reactor designs.   The rule changes came about after President Trump signed an executive order calling for three or more of the experimental reactors to come online by July 4 of this year — an incredibly tight deadline in the world of nuclear power. The order led to the creation of a new Reactor Pilot Program at the Department of Energy.   \n   Commercial nuclear reactors have historically been regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which is known for its public process. The Energy Department rules had applied to a small number of experimental reactors on government property. The pilot program extends that authority to a larger set of experimental commercial designs. It also expands where those reactors can be built: several are under construction outside of the department's national laboratories.   To help facilitate Trump's deadline, Energy Department officials rewrote the internal rules. It shared the rules with ten companies who were part of the pilot program, but the rewritten rules, and even their existence, was not known to the public until NPR obtained copies of them.   The rules are now public on the Energy Department's Idaho Operations Office website, located at Idaho National Laboratory, which is running the Reactor Pilot Program for the department. The website also contains standards and policy documents that were revised for the program.   \n   The department notified NPR of their publication in response to a Freedom of Information Act request calling for their release.   \"DOE has recently completed the process of making these Nuclear Energy Orders and Standards publicly available to ensure broad public access,\" the Department of Energy wrote to NPR in a letter on Wednesday.   \"The U.S. Department of Energy posted the [Nuclear Energy] Orders earlier this year,\" an Energy Department spokesperson wrote to NPR in a separate statement. \"They collectively demonstrate the tremendous strides the Department has made under President Trump's leadership to modernize the DOE authorization process while maintaining safety and security standards.\"   \n   \"This is long overdue,\" said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"The public has the right to understand what the directives are that DOE is using to authorize these experimental reactors.\"   The rules, known as orders, define requirements for almost every aspect of the reactors' operations — including safety systems, environmental protections and site security.   NPR's review of the rules found substantial changes that experts warned had the potential to undermine safety, security and environmental protections at the new reactors. The orders slashed hundreds of pages of requirements for training guards and securing nuclear material. They also loosened protections for things like groundwater.    Loading... \n   In total, the new orders cut 750 pages from the earlier versions of the rules, according to NPR's analysis. That means roughly two-thirds of the original pages were eliminated.   In a statement responding to NPR's story in January, the Department of Energy said that early copies of the rules were shared with the companies as part of an \"iterative effort\" to develop a framework to \"expedite our review process while maintaining safety and security standards.\"    Loading... \n   (The orders seen by NPR in January were not marked as drafts and had the word \"Approved\" clearly displayed on their cover pages.)   In the month since NPR's original story, companies involved with the reactor program have rushed ahead with construction of their experimental designs. Two companies, Antares Nuclear and Radiant Industries, have announced they had completed a crucial step known as a Preliminary Documented Safety Analysis with the Energy Department regulators. Both companies say they are on track to start up their reactors this summer. A third called Aalo says it has completed its Final Design Review and hopes to finalize construction this summer.    Meanwhile, California-based Valar Atomics flew their reactor prototype on a military C-17 transport to Utah earlier this month. The Pentagon is looking to deploy small reactors to military bases as part of a separate program known as project Janus.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                An experimental reactor built by Valar Atomics sits inside a C-17 Globemaster. The Pentagon recently transported the reactor without its nuclear fuel from California to Hill Air Force Base in Utah.\n                \n                    Defense Department/Via X\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Defense Department/Via X\n    \n\n   \n   Lyman says he continues to be concerned that the new rules and tight deadlines threaten safety.   \n   \"My concern is that, in the rush to fulfill President Trump's order, they are slashing the procedures that would normally be used to ensure the safety and security case for these reactors,\" he said.   \n   But administration officials like Secretary of Energy Chris Wright remain bullish that the program can safely spark nuclear innovation.   \"Before July fourth of this year, we will have multiple nuclear reactors critical,\" Wright said at a public event on February 15 at Hill Air Force Base in Utah. \"That's speed. That's innovation. That's the start of a nuclear renaissance.\"   Contact Geoff Brumfiel on Signal at gbrumfiel.13\n",

    "body": "\n         Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt leads a state that gave President Trump 66% of the vote in 2024. He is also charting his own course and has publicly differed with the president on multiple occasions this year.   \n   Most elected Republicans have avoided direct criticism of the president. Republicans in Congress have voted for his priorities, even when some disagreed with them. Stitt has made his disagreements clear, though he has avoided personal attacks and isn't a member of the never-Trump movement. For his part, Trump has described Stitt on social media as a \"wiseguy,\" among other things.   Stitt discussed his vision for the Republican Party's post-Trump future and more during an NPR video interview on the sidelines of the National Governors Association meeting in Washington, D.C.   \n   \"We have to get back to integrity,\" Stitt said. He described an action by the administration as \"un-American.\" He differed with Trump on elections and embraced the diversity of the United States. He is himself a member of the Cherokee Nation.   You can watch the full interview by clicking on the video above, or you can listen to the portion of the interview that broadcast on Morning Edition by clicking on the blue play button above.   Below are some highlights from our conversation.   He wants to stop the \"pendulum\" swings   Stitt criticized a signature of recent administrations, especially Trump's: tearing up the work of earlier administrations.    He singled out a wind power project in Rhode Island that was canceled by the Trump administration.    \"They did everything right. They've been working on it for eight years. They have all their permits. They're 90% complete, and they just get the plug pulled on them — that is by the administration. That's un-American. We cannot be a pendulum swing where we are going back and forth and we're killing different projects based on our political views,\" he said.    In mid-January, a federal judge ruled that construction on the wind farm off Rhode Island's coast could continue while the legal battle plays out in court.   \n   He takes his own approach to immigration   Stitt questioned Trump's immigration raids in Minnesota as an infringement on states' rights. He also critiqued Trump's determination to remove everyone without legal status.    \"The president needs to tell us what's the endgame. Is it truly to deport every single person here in the country? I don't think that's what America wants,\" Stitt said.    Stitt advocates issuing work visas to people without legal status who are currently employed. He also has argued that states should play a larger role in immigration issues.   He favors bipartisanship   Stitt is chair of the bipartisan National Governors Association, which put him in an awkward position this month. It's traditional for the governors to meet with the president during their winter meeting each February, but the White House invited only Republicans.   \"The president can ask whoever he wants to the White House, but … if it's not going to include all the governors — I represent all 50 governors — we can't facilitate it from the National Governors Association,\" Stitt said.   Trump publicly criticized Stitt but also phoned him. The White House eventually invited all governors to a meeting, though two Democrats were not invited to a formal dinner. The incident pointed to a larger question of practicing politics: whether and when to deal with the opposition.   He celebrates his Cherokee heritage — and is at odds with Cherokee leaders   Stitt proudly identifies as part of the Cherokee Nation. He can trace his ancestry to an official list of Cherokees that the U.S. government compiled in the late 1800s. As governor, he nevertheless has been in conflict with Cherokee leaders, who are headquartered in eastern Oklahoma. Their debates touch on one of the biggest themes in American history, the country's relationship to Native nations.   In the 1800s, Cherokees and other tribes were forced to leave the eastern United States, surrendering their land in exchange for new land in what became known as Indian Territory. In 1907, that territory was incorporated into the new state of Oklahoma. But Cherokees maintained a separate government with a degree of their old sovereignty, as did other tribes such as the Creeks and Seminoles.   \n   In a 2020 case, the Supreme Court found that Oklahoma law enforcement officials had no right to enforce state law in what was once called \"Indian country.\" The power belonged to the tribes. That ruling set aside the conviction of a Seminole man who had been tried for sexual crimes in the Creek Nation.   Stitt strongly disagreed with the ruling as a threat to state authority. He has continued to battle with the tribes, and in late 2025 the Choctaw, Cherokee and Chickasaw nations sued him over the enforcement of state wildlife laws.   The discussion of his heritage underlines one more theme where Stitt differs with many on the political right. He spoke of Oklahoma's diversity as a strength and said he wanted to attract all kinds of voters to old Republican principles.   It also suggests a common theme in Stitt's governorship: He thinks states should wield more power. He has pushed against the federal government above the state and against the tribes that he feels should rank below.   Can't see the video above? Watch it on YouTube.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks with Sen. Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, about his continued efforts to limit President Trump's ability to use military force through war powers resolutions.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, BYLINE: It's in Article 1, Section 8, Clause 11 where the U.S. Constitution empowers Congress, not the president, to declare war. Of course, anyone versed in recent U.S. history will know that U.S. presidents have authorized plenty of military action without Congress signing off first. One timely example - last year, the U.S. struck three nuclear sites in Iran, joining Israel in its fight against the country. And right now, the U.S. has massively built up military forces in the Middle East. This week, the U.S. is also conducting diplomatic talks with Iran, which could end in a nuclear deal or could end with more violence.In the Senate, Democrat Tim Kaine of Virginia and Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky have filed a war powers resolution to prevent the president from attacking Iran without congressional approval. Senator Kaine joins us now. Welcome back to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.TIM KAINE: Ailsa, great to be with you. Thanks.CHANG: Great to have you. So when do you expect to vote on this resolution?KAINE: Ailsa, it will happen early next week. Even as I sit here talking to you, it's being negotiated, but it will be in the first couple of days of next week when we're back in session Monday.CHANG: OK, but I have to ask because previous votes on war powers resolutions - like over Venezuela, over last year's strikes on Iran - they have failed. Almost all Republicans have voted against them. So why does this moment feel any different to you?KAINE: Well, first, whether they succeed or fail, we shouldn't be at war without a vote, and so members of Congress should be held accountable. Secondly, we learn, and particularly in the Venezuela vote. In the Senate, we actually got enough votes - Democrat plus some Republicans initially - and then a few Republicans got convinced to change their minds in some subsequent votes. But it changed the president's behavior. After the first vote, within a few hours he canceled a second strike on Venezuela. And he also agreed finally to have a public hearing to send Secretary Rubio up to discuss what, in fact, was the mission, what were the goals, what would success look like.And so I very much learned from that effort, even though we ultimately were not successful, that forcing a vote and a debate on these matters brings it more to the public's attention, where the public can decide whether a mission's in the national interest. And it can even change the behavior of the administration.CHANG: But I want to share a statement from a fellow Democrat. This is Congressman Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, who's opposed to an equivalent war powers resolution in the House. And he writes, quote, \"this resolution would restrict the flexibility needed to respond to real and evolving threats and risks, signaling weakness at a dangerous moment.\" What do you say to your colleague there about that?KAINE: I'm on the Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee, and I'm in the classified facility all the time hearing about risks, and I hear nothing whatsoever about any risks right now that Iran poses to the United States that are at a sufficient level that we should allow a president to take our sons and daughters into war without a debate by Congress.CHANG: Well, during the State of the Union address, President Trump said that Iran is developing missiles that may soon be able to reach the U.S. and that Iran is restarting its nuclear program. How much has the Trump administration shared evidence of those claims with lawmakers like you?KAINE: Well, let's take both. So how about the nuclear program? First, we had controlled Iran's nuclear program by a diplomatic deal that we entered into with our allies, with adversaries like China and Russia and Iran. President Trump tore up the deal. President Trump, after a 12-day bombing campaign by Israel over the summer, used U.S. assets to bomb Iranian nuclear sites and claimed that the Iranian nuclear program was obliterated. That was just six months ago. So now all of a sudden, their nuclear program poses such a threat that we can't even have a debate and vote in Congress? It makes no sense.With respect to the missiles, they are developing missiles, which they may use at some time against the United States. There's so many hypotheticals in there, and the overmatch we have is such that Iran knows this. If they were to use a missile against the United States, which they haven't, it would be a catastrophe for them.CHANG: OK, but given what you know now about the situation in Iran and whatever threat they do or might pose to the U.S. militarily, what would you want to see the U.S. military do at this point? Is there anything justifiable in your mind right now?KAINE: I would say, provide defense support to nations in the region. But we shouldn't commit our own children to yet another war in the Middle East when 25 years of war in the Middle East has produced so little for this country and so little for the region.CHANG: OK. As we mentioned, there is a U.S. delegation in Geneva right now...KAINE: Yes.CHANG: ...In talks with Iran. What about concerns that this debate in Congress about limiting presidential power - what about concerns that that might reduce the U.S.'s leverage in those diplomatic talks? Could they?KAINE: Well, you know, a war is a good idea or a bad idea, and if it's a bad idea, I don't think you should bluff it to try to, you know, get the upper hand in a negotiation. It's a bad idea, in this case, in my view. That - but the fact of the discussions even today is one of the reasons why even though my resolution was ripe for voting this week, we decided a few days out in the future, likely next week, would be preferable. Let that negotiation proceed.CHANG: Yeah.KAINE: Let's do all we can to do what we did 10 years ago and find a diplomatic deal to avoid the need for war.CHANG: You oppose the Trump administration's claiming of powers that you believe belong to Congress constitutionally. You also oppose war - war with Iran and the repression by the regime in Iran. So then, what is your larger preferred path forward here when it comes to the regime there?KAINE: Well, look, I do think the tools that we have, the sanctions tools and others, have made a huge impact on the regime. And it's put the regime in a place, as was the case in 2016. The regime came to the table and negotiated the nuclear deal not because of the threat of war. What was real was the sanctions' effect on the Iranian economy. That brought them to the table. We reached that deal. But then we also maintain the ability to use sanctions against Iran for nonnuclear activity - missiles, you know, crackdowns on human rights.CHANG: Right.KAINE: So I think we should try to return to that. Let's get a deal on the nuclear program and then use these other tools that we have to try to deal with nonnuclear activities that are causing instability in the region.CHANG: Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, thank you very much for joining us, and happy birthday.KAINE: Hey, thanks so much.

Kennedy Jr. She made her case before a Senate committee Wednesday.   \n\n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  President Trump's pick for surgeon general made her case in front of a Senate committee on Wednesday. Dr. Casey Means is a wellness influencer, entrepreneur and author. She is closely aligned with Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his Make America Healthy Again agenda. But her nomination has faced plenty of pushback, including from the medical establishment. NPR health correspondent Will Stone covered the hearing. So, Will, first of all, it's been more than a year in the Trump administration. Why's it taken it this long to get a surgeon general in place?WILL STONE, BYLINE: That's right. There have been a few hiccups throughout the process. Casey Means was actually not Trump's first pick. He initially selected a doctor and Fox News contributor, though she ended up withdrawing her nomination. Trump then tapped Means for the job. She's gained prominence in the wellness space, mostly through a book she published about chronic diseases and diet. And she was all set for the Senate hearing back in October, but it was canceled at the last second because she was pregnant and had gone into labor.MARTÍNEZ: OK. So she had a lot going on. What did we hear today from Means during the hearing?STONE: In many ways, very similar messaging as Secretary Kennedy and his MAHA supporters. Mean (ph) talks about chronic diseases, diet and lifestyle, the harms of ultra-processed foods and toxins and the failures of the medical system. Take a listen to what she said during her opening statement.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CASEY MEANS: I believe that every American shares a core yearning to thrive and help their families thrive. But we are asking people to make healthy choices in environments that are squarely structured against them.MARTÍNEZ: All right. So that sounds pretty reasonable. How was she received?STONE: Well, unsurprisingly, she got tough questions from Democrats and mostly praise from Republicans, though not entirely. And that's because there are questions about where she stands on some of the most controversial causes taken up by Kennedy - most of all, vaccines. And Means has previously raised concerns about the safety of the childhood vaccine schedule. And Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican and doctor who chairs the committee, pressed Means on her views. Here he is asking about the disproven claims that vaccines cause autism.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BILL CASSIDY: Been a lot of evidence showing that they're not implicated. Do you not accept that evidence?MEANS: I do accept that evidence. I also think that science is never settled.STONE: And I'd say, A, this exchange is emblematic of how Means navigated many of the questions from senators. She would say she believes in vaccines. At the same time, when pressed, she would not directly say that she actually encourages mothers to vaccinate their kids for measles or for people to get the flu shot. In the past, Means has also questioned the use of birth control pills and their safety. Here, too, she was pressed by Cassidy and Democrats. She said that oral contraceptives should be widely available, but that they do have significant risks that women need to know about.MARTÍNEZ: All right. Now, you know, the surgeon general's considered the nation's top doctor. What's the deal with her qualifications?STONE: Yeah, this is another sticking point. Means did graduate from Stanford medical school, but she dropped out of her surgical training before finishing. She does not have an active medical license. She's an influencer, and she runs a company that sells glucose monitoring devices. So she doesn't have the clinical or leadership experience typical of a surgeon general, which is one reason for the opposition to her nomination.MARTÍNEZ: All right. That's NPR health correspondent Will Stone. Will, thanks.STONE: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Vance announced cuts to some Medicaid funding to the state Wednesday.   \n\n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  The Trump administration is putting a temporary hold on some Medicaid funding to Minnesota. It says it's concerned about fraud. Reporter Matt Sepic of Minnesota Public Radio has been covering fraud investigations there for the past four years. He joins us now from Minneapolis with the facts. So, Matt, what types of Medicaid programs is the administration targeting?MATT SEPIC, BYLINE: They don't appear to be focusing on direct medical care, such as physician visits, rather personal care, as well as home and community-based services. That includes things like intensive residential treatment, night supervision services and nonemergency medical transportation. Those are the same programs in which the state halted new enrollments last month at the direction of the federal government. Vice President JD Vance announced the latest cuts yesterday alongside Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.The Trump administration says it's withholding just over a quarter billion dollars in reimbursements this month. Oz pointed to a Minnesota Medicaid program meant to provide care to children with autism. Last year, federal prosecutors charged two people with setting up phony treatment centers and enrolling kids regardless of their symptoms.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MEHMET OZ: They then bill Medicaid - this has already happened - millions of dollars for services that were never rendered, never delivered by a qualified staff member. These schemes disproportionately involve immigrant communities.SEPIC: One of the defendants in the autism case pleaded guilty in December to stealing $14 million. The other is expected to plead guilty on Monday. More than a dozen other people are charged with ripping off a Medicaid housing program. Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, shut that down last year because of widespread fraud. Many of the defendants are from Minnesota's Somali American community, which Trump disparaged in his State of the Union address on Tuesday.MARTÍNEZ: You mentioned Governor Walz. What's he saying now?SEPIC: On social media yesterday, Walz called it a, quote, \"campaign of retribution\" by President Donald Trump that'll be devastating for people across Minnesota. He notes that Trump has pardoned numerous people convicted of fraud and that his Justice Department has driven out experienced fraud prosecutors.MARTÍNEZ: Why did those federal prosecutors quit?SEPIC: Well, more than a dozen staffers at the Minnesota U.S. attorney's office resigned after immigration agents killed Renée Macklin Good and Alex Pretti last month. They quit in protest after Justice Department leaders pressured them to investigate Good's widow and because the FBI has refused to include state police in the shooting investigations. That's according to a DOJ source who requested anonymity because they're not authorized to speak to the media. The people who resigned include everyone on the team that had been prosecuting fraud.MARTÍNEZ: Matt, what does the federal government want from Minnesota leaders before it releases this Medicaid money?SEPIC: Well, Oz says the state must develop a comprehensive plan to tackle fraud and Walz has 60 days to respond. It's important to point out, A, that fighting fraud is a key priority in the state legislature for lawmakers from both parties. Legislators are trying to hash out the details of a proposed inspector general's office that would oversee anti-fraud efforts in Minnesota. State Attorney General Keith Ellison says he is also asking lawmakers for money to hire more fraud prosecutors.MARTÍNEZ: All right, that's Minnesota Public Radio's Matt Sepic. Matt, thank you very much for your reporting on this.SEPIC: You're welcome.(SOUNDBITE OF LES TRES' \"THE GHOST IN YOUR SMILE\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

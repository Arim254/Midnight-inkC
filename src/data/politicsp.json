    "body": "\n      As the GOP looks at 2025 election results, it's sounding a proverbial alarm ahead of the midterms on messaging, particularly on the economy as President Trump shies away from the term \"affordability.\"   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  At the start of 2025, Republicans came into Washington with a trifecta government, and President Trump promised the start of a, quote, \"golden age of America.\"(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: A tide of change is sweeping the country. Sunlight is pouring over the entire world. And America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before.DETROW: But as 2025 comes to a close, Republicans are fighting against a tide of unpopularity, especially around the economy. And riffs are beginning to emerge within the GOP over the party's direction and commitment to Trump's vision of America. NPR's Stephen Fowler has been covering the changing Republican Party and joins us now. Hi, Stephen.STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Hey there.DETROW: So let's start with that. President Trump returned to office arguing that his party had a mandate from voters to make massive changes across the country. How is that going now?FOWLER: Well, Republicans have spent this year acting like they have a mandate. They've made sweeping changes to the federal government, foreign policy, immigration policy, economic policy - you name it. And that's even with a narrow majority in Congress. But Americans have generally given a thumbs down to those changes, and the president faces record-low favorability ratings. A lot of the concerns people had about the economy last year under the Biden administration that led them to vote for Trump are concerns that now plague the Trump administration in a similar way, especially around the concept of affordability.DETROW: That's right. Biden and his administration dismissed it for a while, and last night, President Trump gave a speech that was supposed to be - it was billed to be - about combating inflation and affordability. What was the message there?FOWLER: Well, the president has simultaneously claimed the economy is doing great under his administration and blamed Democrats for lingering inflation and higher prices.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: They have a new word. You know, they always have a hoax. The new word is affordability. So they look at the camera and they say, this election is all about affordability.FOWLER: There's a real disconnect there because other Republican leaders say the upcoming midterm election is all about affordability, and they're trying to present a plan to help. So when House Speaker Mike Johnson was asked on Fox Business last week, if Republicans have a messaging problem, he had to say...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE JOHNSON: No. It's just that we've had so many things to message. I mean, it's a blessing and a curse. The Big Beautiful Bill was aptly named because there was so much in it, so much policy, and there were so many things to message all at once.FOWLER: He's talking about Trump's signature economic policy, which includes tax and spending cuts, which largely hasn't taken effect yet.DETROW: It's an odd-numbered year, but there's still been a bunch of elections, one-off special elections and bigger contests like a couple governors' races. What sort of temperature check have these results offered Republicans?FOWLER: It's important to remember, Scott, that special elections are lower-turnout affairs that have tended to benefit Democrats. And this year, Democrats did improve on their margins in these races by an average of 13% from how they did last November. There were blowout victories in the New Jersey and Virginia governors' races, plus notable wins up and down the ballot and across the country in November. A lot of that has more to do with Democrats and how they're getting their voters to show up, but affordability and the economy were important factors to voters in those elections. So there are some warning signs for the Republican messaging plan in 2026.DETROW: We mentioned at the top Republicans control all branches of government right now. Historically, midterms do not go well for the party in power, so how are Republicans trying to minimize that impact?FOWLER: Two things at play here. Young people, non-white voters and others who have recently swung to the GOP are also the ones that could swing away in a midterm election and make the difference between a splash and a wave for Democrats. At the same time, there are growing conflicts within the more established conservative base around what parts of Trump's agenda are working and should be kept in the future. There also aren't as many competitive races on the table compared to other midterms, so the Republican Party can focus more on just a few places to really hone in and sell their vision for the final two years of Trump's term.DETROW: That's NPR's Stephen Fowler in Atlanta. Thanks so much.FOWLER: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Eileen Higgins is also the first Democrat in the position in nearly 30 years.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Miami has a new mayor-elect, and a history-making one at that, when voters there elected the city's first female mayor last night, Eileen Higgins, a former county commissioner. She's also the first Democrat to hold the seat in nearly 30 years. She beat Republican Emilio Gonzalez, who had the support of President Trump. For more on this, we turn now to Joshua Ceballos with member station WLRN. Good morning, Joshua.JOSHUA CEBALLOS, BYLINE: Good morning, Michel.MARTIN: So tell us more about last night's election results. I understand you were at the Higgins watch party last night. What was it like?CEBALLOS: Yeah. It was a really exciting moment. I mean, Eileen Higgins won by 19 percentage points against her opponent, Emilio Gonzalez. I was there at the watch party at the Miami Woman's Club, and there was, like, palpable excitement. You could tell that people felt this was a huge moment not just for the city, but for the rest of the country. Even though this was just a local mayors race, it is being celebrated nationally as a big win for Democrats.MARTIN: You know, the mayor's office is technically nonpartisan. At least, the race is technically nonpartisan. So were there local issues that dominated, or was it always a national race?CEBALLOS: Yeah. I mean, funny enough, the candidates were pretty close on platform. They both talked about bringing order to City Hall, which has had a reputation for being pretty dysfunctional because of some political drama. They both talked about addressing Miami's high cost of living, which I think was top of mind for a lot of voters I spoke to throughout the election. And Higgins ran on bread-and-butter issues at the local level - affordability, transit, protecting the local environment. But she also made certain nods to more national and statewide issues, like protecting the LGBTQ+ community and being a home for migrants. Gonzalez has not held elected office, so there wasn't a legislative record he could point to, but his platform included rolling back property taxes, which is a line that local Republicans in Florida have been pushing.MARTIN: How are both parties reacting to this? So let's start with the Democrats.CEBALLOS: Yeah. The party sees this as a huge win and a real response to President Trump's policies, particularly on immigration. After Higgins' victory, I spoke with Laura Kelley, who's the chair of the Miami-Dade Democratic Party. She said this win was a rebuke of Trump and a sign that the Democratic Party is not dead in Florida.LAURA KELLEY: It speaks to the moment. It speaks to what the country is feeling. And I hope that our elected representatives in Tallahassee and in Washington, D.C., are listening to us in Miami and in Miami Beach and they make different choices.CEBALLOS: Both candidates tried to run a fairly nonpartisan race, but they couldn't help things becoming pretty partisan when Trump endorsed Gonzalez. My colleague Daniel Rivero was at Gonzalez's watch party, and local Republicans told him they believe this is a bad sign for their party going into the next year's midterm elections.MARTIN: You know, Miami is a majority Latino city. It's, like, something like 70% Latino. Does this say anything about the Latino vote writ large? Does this signal anything about a wider trend heading into these midterms next year?CEBALLOS: That is the big question. You know, experts I spoke to were watching this race to see if the Latino vote would shift from being overwhelmingly Republican after the first year of President Trump's new term. Many pockets of Miami were staunch Trump supporters in the last few elections. But - so this may result - this result might signal a turn. There's a sense that president's immigration policies, like ICE detentions and rising cost of living, have perhaps soured some voters on Trump. And I should note that this - that Eileen Higgins is the first non-Hispanic to hold the office since 1996.MARTIN: That is Joshua Ceballos with WLRN in Miami. Joshua, thank you.CEBALLOS: Thank you very much.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Republican-led states have raced to redraw congressional lines to advantage their own party. But the effort hit unexpected pushback in Indiana.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Across the country, states led by Republicans have raced to redraw congressional districts to favor Republican candidates under pressure from President Trump. That effort hit unexpected pushback in Indiana, where a NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas has been talking to Hoosiers.SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: The Carmel Christmas market in suburban Indianapolis draws visitors from across the state to sip hot cocoa and munch on schnitzel around bonfires and a skating rink. A lot of Hoosiers are thinking about the holidays now but also redistricting. Steve Saylor is one of them. He says he hopes the Indiana Senate does overhaul the congressional map.STEVE SAYLOR: I love it. I mean, as many Republicans that we can get in, the better.GRINGLAS: Indiana is currently represented in Congress by seven Republicans and two Democrats. The proposed map could wipe out those two Democrats by carving up the districts they represent. Under the plan, a blue-leaning district near Lake Michigan would be split in two, and the city of Indianapolis, now mostly unified, would be divided into four.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GRINGLAS: Nate Byers says he wants Congress to keep supporting President Trump's agenda. He says the criticism of mid-cycle redistricting is overblown.NATE BYERS: I think we probably worry about politics too much. Sure, everybody wants to have power and their voice heard, but a lot of good things are happening right now.GRINGLAS: But go to a neighborhood in the heart of Indianapolis, and you find voters who say there is plenty of reason to worry.UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Singing) Ding-dong merrily on high.GRINGLAS: At the Broad Ripple Christmas parade, I met Lynn Levy, who listed issues facing her community.LYNN LEVY: Affordability, resources to fight crime and work on infrastructure. And when you have your district spread out between a city to the edge of the state line where it's very rural, the issues are completely different.GRINGLAS: A voter in Indianapolis could soon end up in a district stretching 150 miles to Kentucky.LEVY: I think it'll seriously affect voter turnout because people won't think that their vote matters.GRINGLAS: Across town, Genesis Jones saw firsthand how representation in Congress does matter. Jones squeezed in an interview before \"Sunday Night Football.\"GENESIS JONES: I think the Colts are going to win today. Actually, I know they are (laughter).GRINGLAS: For months, Jones had been fighting for Social Security benefits. She says she had head trauma from domestic violence that caused seizures so bad she couldn't drive. A last resort, she called up the office of her congressman, Democrat Andre Carson.JONES: Everybody was kind, and it didn't feel like I was speaking to robots. And ultimately, they resolved what I had been battling for eight months in just a little over three weeks.GRINGLAS: Jones says without a member of Congress invested here in Indianapolis...JONES: I believe that my case would still be sitting on somebody's inbox.GRINGLAS: At a coworking space in an old Stutz car factory downtown, I met Nicole Carey. She runs a new nonprofit called Cradle Indy, focused on fighting maternal and infant mortality. Indiana has among the worst rates in the nation.NICOLE CAREY: Seven of the 10 top ZIP codes in the state of Indiana that have the worst infant mortality rate, seven of them are in Marion County.GRINGLAS: Where Indianapolis is.CAREY: We have an extremely unique population here in Indianapolis, and you need someone who understands their district in an intimate way.GRINGLAS: Redistricting in Indiana was supposed to be a slam dunk. But some Republican lawmakers noted the push was coming from D.C., not Indiana, and said their constituents did not want this. But Trump and his allies amped up the pressure, even calling out undecided lawmakers on social media. They threatened primary challenges and withholding funding from their districts. University of Indianapolis professor Laura Merrifield Wilson says Indiana is a pivotal test for Trump.LAURA MERRIFIELD WILSON: This is the moment in which we evaluate his ability to control the Republican Party.GRINGLAS: Meanwhile, some states controlled by Democrats are now also redistricting, trying to keep pace in the fight for control of a narrowly divided Congress.WILSON: What if enough states do this, and it's actually a wash? The real loser here are voters in those congressional districts.GRINGLAS: This week, hundreds gathered at the limestone state capitol in Indianapolis. The chants of protesters echoed inside the Senate chamber during hours of public testimony.UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: (Chanting) No redistricting.UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) No redistricting.GRINGLAS: Republican Senator Greg Walker was targeted with threats of violence for opposing redistricting. He said capitulating under pressure would have been like accepting the offer of a bribe and that the stakes crystallized as he recently held a constituent's baby.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GREG WALKER: As I thought about a future for that child, where we accept that intimidation is normal. And I shall refuse the offer for the sake of that child, and the future of the state.GRINGLAS: Walker has said he won't run for reelection, but now, despite or maybe because of the pressure, he's thinking about staying. Another open question, the outcome of tomorrow's final Senate vote.Sam Gringlas, NPR News, Indianapolis.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      As Republicans and Democrats gear up for next year's midterm elections, new polling shows they're losing ground with a powerful and growing bloc of the electorate: young voters.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Gen Z and millennials are expected to make up about half of all eligible voters next year. It's a group that typically voted in large numbers for Democrats. But Republicans were able to narrow that gap in 2024. Now, how they vote in 2026 could be key in determining control of Congress. Joining us now to talk about all of this is NPR political reporter Elena Moore. Hi, Elena.ELENA MOORE, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa.CHANG: OK, so what do we know about what's going on with the youth vote right now?MOORE: Yeah, I mean, a lot of folks are unhappy with politics. And that's spelled out pretty clearly in a new GenForward survey from the University of Chicago, which was first obtained by NPR. It surveyed more than 5,000 Americans between the ages of 18 and 42 and found that nearly 60% disapprove of President Trump's job in office. And on the flip side, only 30% approve. And that's a six-point drop compared to his favorability rating this time last year.CHANG: OK, well, that's about Trump. But we're less than a year away from the midterms, at this point. What did they say about Democrats and Republicans in Congress?MOORE: Yeah, well, the results do paint a sobering picture for both parties. When folks were asked who they'd choose on a generic congressional ballot, you know, Democrats or Republicans, Democrats lead by 15 points. But there are some caveats here. You know, young people's support for Democrats has dropped pretty dramatically since last year. And now roughly 6 in 10 have unfavorable impressions of both the Democrats and the Republicans. There's also just a loud call for more party options. You know, pollsters asked respondents if they agreed with the statement that both Democrats and Republicans do such a poor job representing the American people that voters need more political party choices. And Ailsa, more than 80% said yes to that.CHANG: Eighty percent? Wow.MOORE: Yeah (laughter).CHANG: What might be driving that?MOORE: I mean, I talked to Professor Cathy Cohen about this. She's the founder and director of the GenForward Survey. And she argues that, you know, political dissatisfaction that young people are feeling is directly tied to their deeply rooted economic concerns.CATHY COHEN: There is a real sense that these individuals and these parts of the administration are not delivering. Young people are feeling like the state or the government is not, in fact, providing the opportunities that they're seeking.MOORE: And the poll finds that nearly 9 in 10 young people are concerned about the price of food and the cost of health care in this country. Plus, I mean, about a third think they're going to be worse off financially than their parents. So right now, I mean, quite a grim outlook.CHANG: Yeah. How do these economic concerns fit into their views of other big institutions, you think?MOORE: Yeah, I mean, that gets at Cohen's main takeaway from this poll. You know, when asked about factors needed to make democracy work well in the U.S., housing and affordability of food were the top choices after the need for free and fair elections. And to Cohen, you know, that shows that young people believe that their economic struggles are really intertwined with their feelings about democracy.COHEN: These young people are saying that without the ability to have full lives, they can't be full citizens. And they're rejecting this idea that we should separate discussions of democracy from discussions of affordability.MOORE: So Ailsa, essentially, they're saying if the economy isn't working well, neither are the political institutions in charge of fixing it.CHANG: OK. Well, Elena, you have pored over all of this data. What do you think is the big takeaway here?MOORE: Well, I think a lot of young people just, you know, feel unseen. And there are examples, that said, when young people are taken seriously, they can, you know, prove decisive in elections. I mean, look at Democrats' win in the New York mayoral race. Zohran Mamdani centered his campaign on affordability. Or, you know, even Trump's bid in 2024. A lot of young people supported him because of his focus, at least at the time, on inflation. But as this poll shows, those concerns are still very much out there.CHANG: Indeed. That is NPR's Elena Moore. Thank you so much, Elena.MOORE: Thanks.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "\n      President Trump weaved through topics at a rally in Pennsylvania Tuesday night, calling affordability a Democratic \"hoax\" and sharing his grievances about immigrants.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Trump told a rally crowd in Pennsylvania Tuesday night that he has no higher priority than making America affordable again.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They caused the high prices, and we're bringing them down. It's a simple message.(CHEERING)TRUMP: If I had one message tonight - you know, this is being covered, like all over the world. This is crazy, 'cause I haven't made a speech in a little while. You know, when you win, you say, oh, I can now rest.FADEL: He talked about a whole lot of other things, too.MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  And NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith is here to help us decipher what the president had to say. Good morning, Tam.TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning.MARTIN: So did the president have some new message or some policy prescriptions for Americans who are upset about the high cost of living?KEITH: The banners on the stage said, lower prices, bigger paychecks. And that was the message in essence. Trump insists prices are coming down and brought up on the stage a handful of people who stand to benefit from the tax cuts he signed into law earlier this year. There were no new policies and not a lot of new material, but if you go to see the Village People, you'd be disappointed not to hear \"Y.M.C.A.\" So Trump spent much of this 90-minute speech going through the greatest hits, talking about how members of his Cabinet are straight out of central casting, denigrating Somali immigrants, weaving all over the place, joking about how it would be boring if he stuck to the teleprompter, and occasionally making it back to the economy.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Lower prices, bigger paychecks. We're getting inflation, we're crushing it. And you're getting much higher wages. I mean, the only thing that's really going up, big, it's called the stock market, and your 401(k) is going up.MARTIN: OK. That might be true. Stock values are up. But a lot of people, actually, more than a third of Americans, don't have money in the stock market.KEITH: Yeah. And as our friends at marketplace always say, the stock market is not the economy. A recent Fox News poll found three-quarters of voters view the economy negatively, and 2-to-1, they blame Trump for the current economy rather than former President Biden. The economy used to be Trump's strength, but at the moment, it's a major weakness, and Democrats are certainly making the most of it. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro posted on social media that Trump spent his speech, quote, \"telling Pennsylvanians not to believe what they can see with their own two eyes - the skyrocketing cost of living and rising prices at the grocery store.\"MARTIN: So how is the president squaring the sour mood that voters are in with his pitch that he has ushered in a golden age for this country?KEITH: He's not really. Take this from an interview he did this week with Politico's Dasha Burns.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DASHA BURNS: I wonder what grade you would give your economy.TRUMP: A-plus.BURNS: A-plus?TRUMP: Yeah. A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.KEITH: You know, Trump typically has strong instincts for appealing to his base, but he does risk looking out of touch here.MARTIN: And how does he respond when confronted with those concerns?KEITH: Last night, yet again, he mocked the preoccupation with affordability.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: They have a new word. You know, they always have a hoax. The new word is affordability.KEITH: He says that he inherited a mess. In other words, don't blame me, blame the former guy. And he says things are already cheaper. In particular, he talks a lot about gas prices. According to GasBuddy, prices are down about 8 cents on average a gallon from a year ago. But that's not really enough savings to make up for higher grocery prices and utility bills and health care costs.MARTIN: That is NPR's Tamara Keith.

The board recommended the changes after the January collision of a military Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines regional jet near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, killing 67 people.\n                \n                    Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   WASHINGTON — In an unusually harsh rebuke, the nation's top safety investigator voiced concerns about a provision in the defense policy bill before Congress on Wednesday, warning that it would undermine aviation safety improvements made after a deadly mid-air collision in January.   \n   \"It's a safety whitewash,\" National Safety Transportation Board chair Jennifer Homendy told reporters. \"If it sounds like I'm mad, I am mad. This is shameful.\"   Homendy said the NTSB \"vehemently\" opposes a section in the massive National Defense Authorization Act that would roll back safety improvements that were recommended by the agency after the collision of a military Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines regional jet near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, killing 67 people.   After the crash, the Defense Department agreed to require military aircraft to broadcast their position using a technology known as ADS-B. But the NTSB warns the bill's language would create exemptions to the policy — in effect, recreating conditions that were in place at the time of the DCA collision, which was the nation's deadliest aviation disaster in more than 20 years.   \n   \"We should be working together in partnership to prevent the next accident, not inviting history to repeat itself by recreating the same conditions that were in place on January 29th,\" Homendy said.   Homendy laid out the NTSB's concerns in a letter to the chairman and ranking member of both the House Armed Services Committees and the Senate Committee on Armed Services. She said no legislators had approached her during the drafting of the NDAA, and she did not know who added the provision in question.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A crane removes airplane wreckage from the Potomac River, where American Airlines flight 5342 collided with a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter, near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Va., on February 3, 2025. All 67 people on both aircraft died.\n                \n                    Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   In a statement, the committee leaders defended the language in the bill.    \"We all care deeply about and are fully committed to ensuring aviation safety,\" said U.S. Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Ranking Member Jack Reed (D-RI), House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-AL) and Ranking Member Adam Smith (D-Wash.) in a statement.    \n   They say the bill would require any helicopter conducting training missions around Washington, D.C. would have to provide warning of its position to aircraft in the area (though it does not specifically require the use of ADS-B), and that the Secretary of a military department would need to receive concurrence from the Secretary of Transportation prior to waiving this requirement.   Still, some lawmakers on Capitol Hill share the NTSB's concerns.   \"As drafted, the NDAA protects the status quo, allowing military aircraft to keep flying in DC airspace under different rules and with outdated transmission requirements,\" said a joint statement from Senators Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), the leaders of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. \"This comes as Pentagon data shows a spike in military aircraft accidents since 2020. The families of the victims deserve accountability.\"   \n   The senators urged their colleagues in Congress to instead adopt the bipartisan ROTOR Act, which would require aircraft operators to equip their fleets with ADS-B technology and limit exemptions for military helicopters.   Family members of the victims of American Airlines Flight 5342 also expressed concern about the language in the NDAA.   \"The flying public and all those that utilize our airspace deserve better than what this bill provides,\" said Tim and Sheri Lilley, whose son, Sam, was the first officer of Flight 5342, in a statement. \"Congress now has a choice: strengthen this provision and protect the traveling public or leave in place the same vulnerabilities that have already cost too many people their lives.\"\n",

These federal workers, including many attorneys, investigate family complaints of discrimination in the nation's schools as part of the department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR). They were terminated by the Trump administration in a March reduction-in-force, but the courts intervened, temporarily blocking the department from completing their terminations.   \n   That left 299 OCR employees, roughly half of its staff, in legal and professional limbo – because the department elected to place them on paid administrative leave while the legal battle plays out rather than allow them to work. Court records show 52 have since chosen to leave.   On Friday, an unknown number of the remaining 247 staffers received an email from the department. That email, which was shared with NPR by two people who received it, says that, while the Trump administration will continue its legal battle to downsize the department, \"utilizing all OCR employees, including those currently on administrative leave, will bolster and refocus efforts on enforcement activities in a way that serves and benefits parents, students, and families.\"   \n   Staff were instructed to report to their regional office on Monday, Dec. 15.   In a statement to NPR, Julie Hartman, the department's press secretary for legal affairs, confirmed that the department \"will temporarily bring back OCR staff.\"   \"The Department will continue to appeal the persistent and unceasing litigation disputes concerning the Reductions in Force,\" Hartman wrote, \"but in the meantime, it will utilize all employees currently being compensated by American taxpayers.\"   The department did not clarify how many staffers it was recalling or why it was recalling them now, after keeping them on paid administrative leave for much of the year.   \n   \"By blocking OCR staff from doing their jobs, Department leadership allowed a massive backlog of civil rights complaints to grow, and now expects these same employees to clean up a crisis entirely of the Department's own making,\" said Rachel Gittleman, president of AFGE Local 252, a union that represents many Education Department employees. \"Students, families, and schools have paid the price for this chaos.\"   The department did not respond to a request to share the current size of OCR's complaint backlog, but one department source who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by the Trump administration, told NPR that OCR now has about 25,000 pending complaints, including roughly 7,000 open investigations.   \n   Gittleman said the administration's decision to keep these OCR attorneys on paid leave \"has already wasted more than $40 million in taxpayer funds— rather than letting them do their jobs.\"   NPR could not independently verify that cost.   In October, the administration attempted to fire another 137 OCR staffers, though they were reinstated as part of a deal to end the government shutdown.   In all, just 62 employees at OCR have not received a termination notice at some point this year — about 10% of the office's January headcount.   Two days before the department notified staff they were being recalled, NPR reported on the impact these OCR cuts have had on students with disabilities and their families.   Maggie Heilman told NPR that she filed a complaint with OCR in 2024, alleging that her daughter, who has Down syndrome, was denied her right to a free, appropriate public education at school. OCR began investigating in October 2024, but it was disrupted repeatedly by the aforementioned staff cuts. Heilman's case remains one of the roughly 7,000 open investigations.   Of the administration's decision to try to cut many attorneys who protect students' civil rights, Heilman said, \"it's telling families with children like [my daughter] that their hurt doesn't matter.\"   Since Trump took office, public data shows that OCR has reached resolution agreements in 73 cases involving alleged disability discrimination. Compare that to 2024, when OCR resolved 390, or 2017, the year Trump took office during his first term, when OCR reached agreements in more than 1,000 such cases.\n",

The 29-year-old lives in the Dallas-Forth Worth area and usually votes early, which he did as recently as Texas' Nov. 4 constitutional election.   So he was disturbed last month to open a letter from his local election office in Denton County, calling into question whether he was eligible to vote at all.   \"We have received information from the Texas Secretary of State reflecting that you might not be a United States citizen,\" read the notice.   The notice said he needed to provide proof of citizenship — such as a copy of a U.S. passport, birth certificate or naturalization certificate — within 30 days. Otherwise, his registration would be canceled, though it said he could be immediately reinstated if he showed that documentation at a later date.   \n   Nel, who was born in South Africa, became a U.S. citizen as a teenager, more than a decade ago. Yet he is one of 2,724 people Texas Secretary of State Jane Nelson identified in October as \"potential noncitizens\" on Texas voter rolls. Nelson came up with the tally after running the state's entire voting list — more than 18 million voters — through a federal data system known as SAVE that the Trump administration has overhauled this year.   The tally of 2,724 potential noncitizens is about 0.015% of the state's voters.   Nelson's office directed county election officials to investigate the flagged voters, including by sending out the notice Nel received. The list of voters has not been publicly released.   \"I was confused because I have a passport. I've been voting for almost 10 years. Why is this happening now?\" Nel recalled in an interview with NPR. \"My first thought was something is going on in terms of wanting to adjust and change who is registered to vote.\"   \n   Other eligible Texas voters received the same notice, though official numbers are not yet known.   Their experience underscores concerns election experts have had about the reliability of SAVE, which the Trump administration has turned into a controversial citizenship lookup tool. While the changes to SAVE have made the tool more accessible to states, the overhauled system has been widely criticized for being rolled out without public notice, congressional input or transparency about its accuracy.   President Trump has long made exaggerated claims about the prevalence of noncitizens voting in U.S. elections and his critics have expressed concern the revamped SAVE could be used to continue to push false election narratives.   \n   47 million voters have had their data run through SAVE   Originally a data system that searched numerous Department of Homeland Security and immigration-related databases to check if foreign-born individuals are eligible for government benefits, the Trump administration has transformed SAVE into a tool that it claims can verify most Americans' citizenship or show if someone is listed as deceased.   As of May, SAVE is linked to Social Security Administration data, and can be queried with a name, date of birth and the last four numbers of a Social Security number. More recently, it has been linked to the State Department's U.S. passport database so people can be looked up with a passport number.   \"SAVE is a secure, and reliable way for user states to verify the citizenship or immigration status of individuals registering to vote,\" U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement to NPR. \"The program is doing exactly what it is supposed to do – providing states with an easy-to-use tool to stop aliens from hijacking our elections. USCIS urges all states to adopt SAVE and join us in safeguarding the voting rights of American citizens.\"   More than 47 million voters have been run through SAVE, according to the agency. States that have announced their results so far have not identified large numbers of suspected noncitizens casting ballots. Louisiana found 79 likely noncitizens voted in elections going back to the 1980s, Tennessee referred 42 potential noncitizens who cast ballots to the FBI, and Indiana said it found \"at least 21\" noncitizens who voted.   While officials in states like Texas have praised the new SAVE tool, the Justice Department has been suing other states to get access to their voter rolls. Some state election officials have asked DOJ and DHS to clarify whether one goal is to upload state voter lists to SAVE.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon speaks during a news conference on Sept. 29.\n                \n                    Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"We've checked 47.5 million voter records, we have found 260,000 plus dead people enrolled,\" said Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon in a video released last week. \"And finally that there are several thousand noncitizens who are enrolled to vote in federal elections.\"   \n   NPR asked both the DOJ and USCIS whether the numbers Dhillon cited were confirmed noncitizens, or potential noncitizens. DOJ declined to comment and USCIS did not respond to that question.   In a Monday appearance on Newsmax, Dhillon speculated the number of noncitizens on voter rolls could be six figures or higher.   Voting experts have warned that known accuracy issues with SAVE will lead to eligible voters like Anthony Nel being wrongly flagged by the system and potentially disenfranchised, while the problem SAVE seeks to solve — noncitizens voting in federal elections — is incredibly rare.   A \"giant omnibus database\"   There are also questions about whether SAVE's overhaul complies with federal privacy laws, particularly given that it uses sensitive Social Security data for a new purpose. Last month, the judge overseeing a federal lawsuit to reverse the project's updates said she was \"troubled by the recent changes to SAVE and doubts the lawfulness of the Government's actions.\"   But the Trump administration is taking steps to expand SAVE further and add additional data sources so it can be queried with driver's license numbers. Plans include accessing driver's license data from a private entity known as Nlets that helps law enforcement agencies share information across states.   At the end of October, DHS released a belated public notice about SAVE that said data could be shared with other government agencies and \"other entities\" with DHS agreements for purposes that include monitoring or auditing voter registration records.   Election officials are raising concerns about the security of voters' data, which, once uploaded to SAVE, is retained for 10 years.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon testifies during a congressional hearing on Sept. 27, 2023.\n                \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"I don't think most people, most Americans, think that if they give to an elections administrator for voter registration purposes, sensitive data like a full or partial Social Security number, that it's going to end up in some sort of giant omnibus database in Washington, D.C., that can be easily shared with God knows who for God knows what reason,\" Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon told NPR. \"And that is apparently what is going on here.\"   \n   Last week, Simon and 11 other Democratic secretaries of state signed a public comment opposing changes to SAVE that was among thousands of mostly critical comments. The secretaries expressed concern that USCIS has failed to release data on the tool's accuracy for identifying noncitizens.   \"What you don't want out of the system is innocent people to be fingered as illegal voters,\" Simon said. \"And there's a real capacity and concern here that that's going to happen in really large numbers.\"   Removed from the voter rolls   When Nel plugged his own name and birthday into Denton County's online voter registration lookup recently, the system no longer showed him as registered.   He has not yet had a chance to visit the county office and show his passport, and more than 30 days have passed since the notice was mailed. While the county would accept a passport copy over email, mail or fax, he does not feel comfortable sending a copy of a sensitive document and prefers to handle the transaction in person.   Denton County confirmed to NPR that Nel's voter registration was canceled because he has not yet proven his citizenship.   There is not yet any official data on how many eligible Texas voters like Nel were flagged by SAVE but Denton County election director Frank Phillips told NPR that so far out of the 84 flagged registered voters he sent notices to, 14 have proven their citizenship.   The county determined that another 14 people were registered in error because they had indicated on registration forms they were not citizens. The county has canceled their registrations. None had voted.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The courthouse in Denton, which is the county seat for Denton County.\n                \n                    Desiree Rios for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Desiree Rios for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Fifty-five people in Denton County besides Nel have also had their registration canceled after not responding to the notice, including five people whose notices came back as undeliverable, according to Phillips.   Texas election code instructs officials to cancel a voter's registration if they do not respond to such notices in 30 days or if the mail is returned with no forwarding address.   \n   Nel was surprised voters are removed from the rolls after a single mailed letter, with no other follow up.   \"There's no confirmation that someone received the letter,\" Nel said. \"There are probably tons of people out there that have no idea that they're no longer registered to vote.\"   That concern is shared by voting rights advocates.   Danielle Lang, an attorney with nonprofit Campaign Legal Center, said even if a notice arrives at the voter's address, \"They may never open them. Election mail notices and things like that are not a very reliable way of getting voters to engage.\"   While Nel has a U.S. passport, which he showed to NPR, he worries other naturalized citizens may not have the documents they need on hand to prove citizenship. Without a U.S. passport, Nel would have needed his South African birth certificate and one of his parents' naturalization certificates.   A survey last year commissioned by the University of Maryland's Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement and the advocacy group VoteRiders found that in Texas, 7% of adult citizens do not have easy access to citizenship documents. The number went up to 12% for those under 30.   Nel pointed out it takes time for people to get documents once they request them and there are fees. \"It's almost like they're adding barriers for these naturalized citizens to maintain their voter registration,\" he said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Nel, who was born in South Africa, became a U.S. citizen as a teenager and has a U.S. passport.\n                \n                    Desiree Rios for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Desiree Rios for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   An \"unfiltered and unvetted\" list of voters   To use SAVE, the Texas secretary of state's office signed an agreement with USCIS that says the state will \"institute additional verification\" if SAVE does not identify a registered voter as a U.S. citizen, and if the voter still cannot be verified, to contact them to obtain proof of citizenship.   Nelson tasked officials in 177 counties with investigating the flagged voters.   \"Even though the data we received from SAVE is considered a strong match, we directed counties to treat them as weak matches in order to ensure that counties conducted their own investigation,\" Nelson wrote in a November email to Travis County officials. \"Such investigations can include notifying the voter and requesting proof of citizenship directly from the voter.\"   \n   Chris McGinn, the executive director of the Texas Association of County Election Officials, said the state did not tell counties what their investigation must entail so the approach has varied by county.   \"The state said, 'Here, check these people out. They're potentially noncitizens,' without any real strict guidance on what the process should be or what resources they should use to do the research,\" McGinn said.   McGinn has been in touch with 112 counties and learned that while some are trying to gather more information, most relied on sending out mailed notices, and the response rates to those notices were low.   He said it appears more than half of the flagged registered voters were inactive and had never voted, and many may have been registered in error when they got a driver's license.   \"The biggest takeaway is that the narrative that noncitizens are registered en masse and affecting elections is just false,\" McGinn said.   \n   Officials in Travis County, where Austin is located, last week wrote a searing public comment about the use of SAVE in Texas, labeling the list of potential noncitizens that the secretary of state gave counties \"unfiltered and unvetted\" and alleged it was \"another bad faith attempt to remove voters from the rolls, including many people who likely previously demonstrated their citizenship in a transaction with the State of Texas.\"   Travis County officials found a quarter of the voters SAVE flagged in their county had registered to vote at the Department of Public Safety, which issues driver's licenses. Voters who register at DPS are supposed to show proof of citizenship and those documents stay on file, though it is also possible that some of those registrations were in error.   The secretary of state's office did not cross-check SAVE results with DPS records to check for evidence that any of the flagged voters had previously proven their citizenship before sharing the list with counties, according to a statement the office gave the nonprofit news outlet Votebeat. The secretary of state's office did not respond to NPR's request for comment, but DPS officials told Travis County in an email that it was \"not involved\" in creating the secretary of state's list.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Travis County Tax Assessor-Collector Celia Israel speaks at her inauguration ceremony in Austin on Jan. 3.\n                \n                    Jay Janner/American-Statesman/USA Today Network via Reuters\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jay Janner/American-Statesman/USA Today Network via Reuters\n    \n\n   \n   Celia Israel, Travis County's Democratic tax assessor-collector and voter registrar, said she has been asking the secretary of state's office and DPS to help her access DPS records since late October.   \n   \"I don't see anything wrong in asking them to do some more research before I burden a voter,\" Israel told NPR.   Top of mind for Israel is a past episode in 2019 when the secretary of state at the time claimed to have identified 95,000 potential noncitizens on the voter rolls but the list wound up including a significant number of naturalized citizens.   Israel is worried about the possibility of voter suppression efforts ahead of midterm elections and sees this process with SAVE as a test.   \"We're living at a time in which the folks who are running this country are denying election results and using tools like this to tamp down the vote and discourage the vote,\" Israel said. \"We've got a big election coming up next year. So this to me is also a note to how we could deal with this in a larger fashion next year.\"   A known defect in SAVE   Nel was born in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, now known as Gqeberha, and immigrated to Texas with his family when he was just 8. He quickly settled into his new life, riding a yellow school bus to school and celebrating holidays like Halloween and Thanksgiving. His parents became U.S. citizens when he was a teenager, and he acquired American citizenship, too, since he was a minor with a green card.   \"I consider myself more of an American than I do a South African,\" Nel told NPR. \"I have passion for the United States.\"   But cases like Nel's, of foreign-born children who acquired citizenship from parents who naturalized, are known to stump SAVE.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                \"I consider myself more of an American than I do a South African,\" Nel told NPR.\n                \n                    Desiree Rios for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Desiree Rios for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   USCIS' own fact sheet warns that \"if an individual with acquired citizenship has not received a Certificate of Citizenship from USCIS (e.g., some foreign-born children of U.S. citizens) or is not designated as a U.S. citizen in [Social Security Administration] records, SAVE may not be able to confirm that individual's U.S. citizenship.\"   \n   The sheet goes on to say, \"In these circumstances, SAVE returns the case to the user agency for review of their information for data entry errors or to seek additional information from the individual.\"   Furthermore, a Privacy Impact Assessment DHS published at the end of October acknowledges, \"due to misspellings of names, transposed numbers or incomplete information, the SAVE program may produce inaccurate results.\"   The assessment says that SAVE has a multistep review process, but when the system is queried with Social Security numbers — which is what states use to check voter rolls — it \"does not allow for a second and third step review.\"   Voting rights advocates have also raised concerns about the completeness of Social Security Administration's citizenship records and the accuracy of data matches using just the last four digits of a Social Security number.    Nel was frustrated to learn that SAVE is known to not be able to identify U.S. citizens like him, and the only effort to contact him was a single letter.   In his own career in higher education he has set up information systems and said it would never be permissible to put out a product with a known flaw.   \"When something doesn't work, we don't release it,\" Nel said. \"We don't allow people to use a system that doesn't work.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks with Miami Mayor-elect Eileen Higgins, who will be the city's first female mayor and the first Democrat in decades to hold the seat.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Let's go to Miami now where yesterday, voters elected the city's first female mayor. She's also the first Democrat to be elected to that office in 28 years. With all precincts reporting, preliminary results have her winning by about 19 percentage points. So today, we reached Miami Mayor-elect Eileen Higgins. Welcome and congratulations.EILEEN HIGGINS: Well, thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be here.CHANG: So what do you expect your first order of business will be when you start?HIGGINS: Well, the first order of business is to make sure that we have an orderly transition from one administration to the next. But residents of Miami know I campaigned very much on making sure we had a city that worked for them. And that includes changing a lot of processes, especially things like getting the permitting process fixed for them. And then of course, sadly, our city has a history of corruption. And so that has to be stopped immediately. And we've got to do a deep dive in the budget so we can see where we can save folks money by making sure the government's efficient.CHANG: So you've got a full plate going in. Let's talk about the campaign a little bit. The mayoral race was officially nonpartisan. But there was a ton of national campaigning in this city race, all the way to President Trump endorsing your opponent, right? So do you think the fact that you're a Democrat actually helped you win in Miami this time?HIGGINS: I have now represented the city of Miami for eight years as their county commissioner. And I've always been a loud, proud Democrat. But I have represented a Republican part of the community. So what the people of Miami know about me is they know I'm a Democrat - they're not confused - but that when I govern, I govern for them. I don't ask what political party they are. If they need affordable housing, I make sure we build affordable housing.CHANG: But do you think in this case, President Trump's endorsement of the other side helped or hurt you? What effect do you think it had on this race?HIGGINS: In these days, we have this politics of trickle-down hatred that are coming from the federal government, and in our case, sadly, our state government. And that has created a whole new environment here in Miami where the residents for the very first time are afraid of government. I mean, I'm at community meetings - it's so sad - and you'll talk to someone. They'll whisper to you, my brother, my uncle. Sometimes they'll tell you they were taken to Alligator Alcatraz. Sometimes they'll tell you they don't know where they were taken. They've just been disappeared. And so unfortunately, this national anti-immigrant fervor is affecting us here in Miami. And I do think it influenced the way people voted this time.CHANG: I mean, let's be clear, a majority of the population in Miami, it's something like 57% was born outside the U.S., right? So tell me more about what voters had been telling you about President Trump's crackdown on both legal and illegal immigration.HIGGINS: So I'll give you an example. We have a very large Venezuelan community. And about three weeks ago, temporary protected status was eliminated. A gentleman that I know that is in the health care business - has several health clinics - received at one clinic a notice telling him he had to fire 27 people because they had lost their ability to work in America because they're Venezuelan. So that's 27 families without a breadwinner. And now you have a health clinic that is missing 27 employees to service their patients and clients. Not only is this mean and cruel and inhumane, it's just simply bad for the economy. And we need them to change direction.CHANG: That said, Mayor-elect, how do you plan, or how much do you plan to work with the federal government on illegal immigration going forward? Because earlier this year, I understand that the city of Miami had entered an agreement with ICE that would allow Miami police officers to enforce federal immigration law. What do you think the future of that agreement's going to be under you?HIGGINS: First of all, the city of Miami should never have signed that agreement. Now, the law is less clear about whether we can unwind that agreement. But here's what I can tell you. If the law requires us to continue with this, we are going to comply with the law. But we are going to do as little as possible because I'm not going to violate any laws. But here's what I can tell you. When I don't like the laws, you bet I am going to speak up and say the policies that are hurting our economy and our families need to be changed. We want a safe border. We want to know who's coming and going. They told us they were going to go after criminals and now they're going against everybody. That is wrong.CHANG: Well, I just want to remind people that President Trump won voters in Miami-Dade County by 11 points in the 2024 election, the first Republican to do that in more than three decades, I believe. But you won the city of Miami yesterday with almost 60% of the vote. Does that say anything to you about how the electorate in south Florida might be changing or what it's like at this moment? What do you think?HIGGINS: These are the same people. But they now realize that they can have a government that works for them, or they can have a government that works against them. And I believe people are beginning to realize that they need to think more carefully about who is going to be of service to them.CHANG: Miami's mayor-elect, Eileen Higgins. Thank you and congratulations again.HIGGINS: Thank you very much.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

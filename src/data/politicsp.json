    "body": "\n      The White House says \"all options\" are on the table when it comes to the U.S. potentially acquiring Greenland, including diplomacy. Several European leaders have fervently pushed back.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  The Trump administration is amping up its rhetoric about taking Greenland, insisting all options are on the table, including the use of the military. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday echoed President Trump's assertions that the U.S. needs Greenland for national security purposes and appeared to warn Denmark not to dismiss the president's words.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KAROLINE LEAVITT: The president's first option always has been diplomacy. Again, look at Venezuela. He tried ardently to strike a good deal with Nicolás Maduro, and he told him, I will use the United States military, and you will not like it if you don't take such a deal. And look at what happened.FADEL: NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez is with us. Good morning.FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila.FADEL: OK. So that sounded like quite a threat from Karoline Leavitt. Is that how Denmark is taking it?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, I'll say leaders in Denmark are taking this very, very seriously. I mean, it caught a lot of global leaders' attention, showing what the president is potentially capable of. And Secretary of State Marco Rubio, he was on the Hill yesterday briefing members of Congress on Venezuela. Well, he was also asked about Greenland, and he, too, echoed the press secretary's comments about the use of force.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARCO RUBIO: If the president identifies a threat to the national security of the United States, every president retains the option to address it through military means. As a diplomat, which is what I am now and what we work on, we always prefer to settle it in different ways - that included in Venezuela.ORDOÑEZ: Now, U.S. officials argue that Russia and China are making a play for control of the Arctic, making Greenland essentially a strategic asset for the U.S. Rubio says the preference has always been to purchase Greenland and added that he is meeting with Danish officials next week. But he also would not give any details about that meeting.FADEL: OK. So is this all a ploy to scare Denmark into selling Greenland to the United States?ORDOÑEZ: I mean, Danish officials say Greenland belongs to its people, and it's up to them to determine their fate. And the prime minister, he warns that a U.S. invasion would essentially end the NATO military alliance. Denmark is, of course, a NATO ally. And I'll just say that GOP leaders, like House Speaker Mike Johnson, are dismissing the idea of a military action. And foreign policy hands think this is all a negotiating tactic. Mark Feierstein, who advised both the Obama and Biden administrations, says the U.S. is unlikely to do anything remotely similar to Greenland as they did in Venezuela.MARK FEIERSTEIN: I think what the administration wants to do now is give the impression that Trump means what he says. And they want to be able to use the action in Venezuela as a way to encourage other countries, to get them to bend their will to U.S. means. Basically, it's a form of intimidation, a form of threats. And it might work.ORDOÑEZ: Feierstein says there's a big difference between going after a drug-trafficking dictator and going after Greenland, which is part of Denmark - again, a NATO ally - where the U.S. already has a military base. It's just not the same. But this Trump administration has been even more bold than the first.FADEL: Yeah. And Trump never had much love for NATO. And speaking of multilateral organizations he doesn't like, he says he's pulling the U.S. from dozens of international organizations.ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. That's right. I should note that NATO is not one of them. The White House listed the dozens of organizations which it said promote, quote, \"radical climate policies, global governance and ideological programs\" that the administration says are contrary to U.S. interests. Many are U.N.-related agencies and commissions, like the U.N. population agency. A non-U.N. organization on the list is the International Institute for Democracy. It's really just the latest example of the U.S. pulling away from global cooperation.FADEL: White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez. Thank you so much, Franco.ORDOÑEZ: Thank you, Leila.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

That came mere days after Trump said in the wake of the U.S. operation to oust Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend that \"Colombia is very sick too\" and accused Petro of \"making cocaine and selling it to the United States.\"   \n   In comments to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump added of Petro, \"He's not going to be doing it very long, let me tell you.\" Asked whether U.S. intervention was possible, Trump responded, \"Sounds good to me.\"   Later Wednesday, addressing thousands of protesters that he had mobilized to rally against U.S. military threats, Petro said he had spoken with Trump for roughly one hour.   \"I talked about two things: Venezuela and the issue of drug trafficking,\" he told the crowd in downtown Bogotá, where demonstrators had just minutes earlier chanted slogans against the United States at Petro's behest.   Petro explained to the audience that Colombian politicians allegedly linked to narco-trafficking misled the U.S. president about Petro's record to turn Trump against him.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Supporters of Colombian President Gustavo Petro attend a rally he called to protest comments by U.S. President Donald Trump, in Bogota, Colombia, Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2026.\n                \n                    Santiago Saldarriaga/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Santiago Saldarriaga/AP\n    \n\n   \n   \"Those (people) are responsible for this crisis — let's call it diplomatic for now, verbal for now — that has erupted between the U.S. and Colombia,\" he said.   Trump now suddenly warming to Petro is especially surprising since Colombia's president called the U.S. operation in Venezuela an \"abhorrent\" violation of Latin American sovereignty. He also suggested it was committed by \"enslavers\" and constituted a \"spectacle of death\" comparable to Nazi Germany's 1937 carpet bombing of Guernica, Spain.   \n   Colombia has long been among America's staunchest Latin American allies, a pillar of Washington's counternarcotics strategy abroad. For three decades, the U.S. has worked closely with Colombia, the world's largest producer of cocaine, to arrest drug traffickers, fend off rebel groups and boost economic development in rural areas.   Still, before Trump's conciliatory post, tensions had been rising between the U.S. and Colombia for months.   The Trump administration imposed sanctions in October on Petro, his family and a member of his government over accusations of involvement in the global drug trade. Colombia is considered the epicenter of the world's cocaine trade.   Trump began his monthslong pressure campaign on Maduro by ordering dozens of lethal strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats launched from Venezuela in the Caribbean. He eventually expanded the operations to also target suspected vessels in the eastern Pacific that came from Colombia.   The U.S. in September added Colombia, the top recipient of American assistance in the region, to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years. The designation led to a slashing of U.S. assistance to the country.   \"He has cocaine mills and cocaine factories,\" Trump said of Petro on Sunday. \"He's not going to be doing it.\"\n",

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday told the federal government to \"leave Minnesota alone,\" and allow state officials to conduct the investigation into the immigration enforcement agent shooting that left one woman dead and Minneapolis residents on edge.   Walz repeatedly expressed concerns with the federal government leading the investigation without Minnesota officials.   \"It feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome, and I say that only because people in positions of power have already passed judgment, from the president, to the vice president, to [Secretary of Homeland Security] Kristi Noem,\" Walz said.   \n   Officials within the Trump administration quickly defended the ICE agent's actions as justifiable use of force, after civilian footage taken at the scene seemed to show Good's SUV attempting to drive away from masked ICE agents, one of whom subsequently fired three shots into the driver's window, killing the 37-year-old wife and mother.   During Thursday's White House press conference, Vice President JD Vance said \"I don't care what Tim Walz says\" and added that the ICE agent's life was in danger during the incident.   \"You have a woman who was trying to obstruct a legitimate law enforcement operation… You have a woman who aimed her car at a law enforcement officer and pressed on the accelerator,\" Vance said.   At the core of each press conference was a different understanding of the facts.   Governor Walz called the federal law enforcement presence in Minnesota \"a reckless ICE mobilization\" that \"is not keeping us safe\" and encouraged Minnesotans to support Good's family.   At the White House, Vice President Vance said, \"this is absolutely a tragedy, but it's a tragedy of the making of the Far Left. They have radicalized a very small segment of the population, taught them that ICE agents are engaging in widescale violation of people's rights.\"   \n   To get a better understanding of what happened, both men said an investigation would be necessary.   Walz said that Minnesota has the experience required to handle high-profile investigations such as this, pointing to the 2020 murder of George Floyd at the hands of former police officer Derek Chauvin.   \"The only way we find the answers is a thorough investigation by nonpartisan professionals, Walz said. \"We've delivered that. We've been able to do it.\"   The state's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA), which was initially tapped to conduct a joint investigation with the Federal Bureau of Investigations, released a statement on Thursday. It states that the agency had been kicked off the search in favor of allowing the federal government to conduct the operation on its own.   Vance, however, said the federal government is better suited to handle it. \"The Department of Justice is already investigating this. The Department of Homeland Security is already investigating this,\" Vance said.   He added \"But the simple fact is: What you see is what you get in this case.\"\n",

The administration has unveiled a three-pronged plan for the country. It starts with a U.S. quarantine that includes Washington's control of Venezuelan oil sales. The details emerge from a closed-door briefing that Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave lawmakers after the weekend military operation that led to the capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro. Congress was not told about it in advance. NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt reports on what lawmakers learned yesterday.BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: These were the first comprehensive briefings for rank-and-file members who've been waiting for days to hear directly from the administration about the operation that led to Maduro's capture.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE JOHNSON: We had, I believe, a full house. I think almost every member of the House, Republican and Democrat, were present today.SPRUNT: That's House Speaker Mike Johnson, one of the many top Republicans who support President Trump's actions. Rubio told lawmakers that main next goals are stabilization of Venezuela, economic recovery for the country and transition. He did not elaborate on what that transition would look like. As for U.S. involvement going forward, Johnson added the White House's goal is not to have U.S. boots on the ground.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHNSON: That is not the administration's objective, that is not their expectation.SPRUNT: As lawmakers emerge from the classified meeting, the partisan divide was on full display. Republicans praised the operation. Oklahoma Senator Markwayne Mullin even said it was one of the best briefings he's ever received in Congress.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARKWAYNE MULLIN: What we want to do is give the best opportunity for the Venezuelan people to take back their country and put it back in the democracy that they lost 25 years ago, and there was a full plan, full effort.SPRUNT: But Democrats said the exact opposite - that they didn't hear a full plan.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SETH MOULTON: There are a lot of questions from both Democrats and Republicans about what comes next, what the timeline is. And they basically refused to answer any of those questions.SPRUNT: That's Massachusetts Congressman Seth Moulton.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MOULTON: I think the military clearly had a plan, but I think this administration is completely winging it.SPRUNT: Here's how Secretary of State Marco Rubio responded to that exact critique.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARCO RUBIO: I used to be a senator, too. That's what you always say when it's the other party. The bottom line is, we've gone into great detail with him about the planning. We've described it to him.SPRUNT: But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he wants more. And not in classified briefings, he wants public hearings.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHUCK SCHUMER: We need answers to these questions, and we need them made publicly.SPRUNT: Schumer's repeatedly cited concern about the administration taking similar actions in other countries and said he's dissatisfied with the answers given to him by administration officials.

They sat down together in Suozzi's office to talk to our co-host, A Martínez, about the road ahead.SUOZZI: The bill that we're voting on is to put it back the way it was before for three years, but that's unlikely to become the final law. Brian can speak for himself, but he didn't support the idea of a clean three-year extension, but he did this because he knew we had to get it to the Senate. The Senate will then negotiate to try and come up with a bipartisan compromise, we hope, on their side and then bring it back to us again.A MARTÍNEZ, BYLINE: So, Congressman Fitzpatrick, how did you square those two ideas, not being in favor of a clean three years, but also knowing for you, at least, that you wanted something to be there for your constituents?FITZPATRICK: Yeah, because there was only one thing that was worse than a clean extension with no income caps and no reforms and that would be complete expiration, with no bridge, no off-ramp for people who need these subsidies. Myself and Tom and so many of our colleagues, both Democrat and Republican, offered multiple two-party solutions, multiple different iterations, that in large part did the same thing.It enacted reforms, anti-fraud measures, income caps to ensure that the lower- and middle-income earners were benefiting the most from these subsidies. All of those options were rejected, unfortunately, by House leadership, so it left us with two options - either expiration or clean extension. And clean extension is a far better option, in my view, and that's why I proceeded down the path that I did.MARTÍNEZ: How many other of your Republican colleagues do you think would support that?FITZPATRICK: Well, there were only room for four signatures, and we got four signatures almost instantly after I led the charge to sign. There were many others that were ready to sign, but once it hits 218 the petition is closed. So, you know, the number, the final number remains to be seen. And keep in mind, A, that this is a vehicle that will go to the Senate. The Senate will then put their stamp on it.It will, in all likelihood, emerge back to the House as something close to the proposal that Tom and I worked on, along with our other colleagues, that have those reforms and income caps that I mentioned.MARTÍNEZ: Congressman Suozzi, if indeed this bill passes, I mean, will this ultimately be vindication, you think, for your party's decision to make health care such an important issue in last year's government shutdown?SUOZZI: Well, I think it's a victory for the American people, and the people that we serve, both parties - Democrats, Republicans, independents, they all care about this issue. And, you know, Brian and I serve as the co-chairs of a group called the Problem Solvers Caucus, and it's about 50 members of Congress pretty evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans.And every problem we face in our country, including this one, is complicated. And you can't solve complicated problems with everybody just yelling and screaming at each other and saying, you're one of those. No, you're one of those. You need people of goodwill who may disagree with each other, like Brian do - and I do. We disagree on a lot of stuff. But we work together to say, hey, let's try and find common ground.MARTÍNEZ: But Congressman Suozzi, we live in a world where we look at the scoreboard after everything that happens, no matter what. We want to see who wins and who loses. Will it be perceived as a win for Democrats if this happens?SUOZZI: Yeah. It will be. And it'll be seen as a victory also for the people who want to promote bipartisanship 'cause the Democrats couldn't do this on their own.MARTÍNEZ: Congressman Fitzpatrick, even if this bill does pass in the House, it would need, of course, to pass in the Senate before President Trump would have to make that decision to sign it or not. What kind of support do you think this would need to get in the House for Majority Leader John Thune to actually allow a vote in the Senate?FITZPATRICK: Well, I think it's going to be taken up regardless, you know, because getting the vehicle to the Senate was the key. I am very confident in the signals that we see coming out of the Senate. After we got 218 on this discharge, it completely breathed life into this issue in the Senate. It was all but dead. And I'm confident that they're going to get something done and get something back to us.MARTÍNEZ: Are you worried at all over the kind of pressure all of this might put on President Trump? If he's got this on his desk waiting to make a decision, and it seems like it has support both in the Senate and in the House, wouldn't that put a lot of pressure on President Trump to actually sign it?FITZPATRICK: Well, I think it tells him that it's the will of the people. It shouldn't be pressure. It should be an easy signature, and I believe he will sign it.MARTÍNEZ: Congressman Suozzi, what about you? What do you think?SUOZZI: I think there's no question about it. The president - if, you know, for all the things I don't like about him, he follows the polls and he follows what the people are asking for, and the people are asking for us to address this health care affordability issue.MARTÍNEZ: If all this gets to the finish line and the subsidies are extended for three more years, do you think that is enough time to come up with a solution or maybe a different way forward for health care in the United States? Congressman Suozzi, let's start with you on that.SUOZZI: Health care, even if we get these subsidies put back in place, these tax credits put back in place, is way too expensive. We spend way too much money at the end of people's lives. We don't spend enough money on prevention. We know the leading causes of early death, avoidable deaths, are smoking, improper diet and lack of exercise, and we have to do more with preventative, making sure people get their primary care early as opposed to waiting until they're very, very sick.And we have seen during this process that there are a lot of people on both sides of the aisle that really want to get something done. And this is an opportunity for us to show that we can work together like we have here, and we can do even more things together if we get a little bit of a breather, and we're not under the gun like this.MARTÍNEZ: What about you, Congressman Fitzpatrick?FITZPATRICK: Yeah. I think this is a case with a lot of these issues, and health care is certainly included, that for too long, too many have allowed the perfect to be the enemy of the good. I think, A, that we need to get back to the basics with health care. And I represent Levittown, Pennsylvania. Tom here represents Levittown, New York.And when I grew up in Levittown, doctors, by and large, worked out of their own houses. There was very little between the doctor-patient relationship. And you look at the health care system today, where doctors then started working for hospitals, and then the hospitals were working for insurance companies, and then the insurance companies were working for hedge funds.And there's been massive vertical integration that has been incredibly harmful to the health care delivery system, incredibly harmful to patients. So I think we just need to get back to the basics in health care, and to your question, do we have enough time to do it? Of course we do. We know what needs to be done.The question is, are there enough people with courage, with backbone, in both parties to cross the aisle to actually get it done. And that's a question that remains to be seen. You know the answer when it comes to Tom and I. We do it every single day. It's built into our genetic DNA. That's how we operate.FADEL: That's Tom Suozzi, Democrat from New York, and Brian Fitzpatrick, a Republican from Pennsylvania. They're the co-chairs of the Problem Solvers Caucus in the U.S. House of Representatives. Thank you both for your time.FITZPATRICK: Thank you.SUOZZI: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF BLU VELVET'S \"EVERYTHING COMES TO AN END\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

For decades, the landmark law that came out of the Civil Rights Movement has protected the collective voting power of racial minorities when political maps are redrawn. Its provisions have also boosted the number of seats in the House of Representatives filled by Black lawmakers.   That's largely because in many Southern states — where voting is often polarized between a Republican-supporting white majority and a Democratic-supporting Black minority — political mapmakers have drawn a certain kind of district to get in line with the Voting Rights Act's Section 2 provisions. In these districts, racial-minority voters make up a population large enough to have a realistic opportunity of electing their preferred candidates.   \n   But at an October hearing last year for the redistricting case about Louisiana's congressional map, the Supreme Court's conservative majority appeared inclined to issue this year another in a series of decisions that have weakened the Voting Rights Act — this time its Section 2 protections in redistricting.   That kind of ruling could put at risk at least 15 House districts currently represented by a Black member of Congress, an NPR analysis has found. Each of those districts has a sizable racial-minority population, is in a state where Republican lawmakers control redistricting and, for now at least, is likely protected by Section 2. Factoring in newly redrawn districts in Missouri and Texas, which were not included in NPR's analysis, could raise the tally of at-risk districts higher.   Loading...\n   If Republican-led states no longer have to follow current redistricting provisions under Section 2, it's unclear how many Democratic-represented districts could be eliminated, because GOP-led legislatures may see a partisan advantage in preserving some of those districts. The timing of such moves is also unclear, as state lawmakers await the Supreme Court ruling.   Still, the loss of even a handful of those at-risk districts could fuel a record drop in the number of Black representatives. The current record drop was set by the 45th Congress, which began in 1877 and had four fewer House districts represented by Black lawmakers than the previous session.   How Black representation in Congress has grown after the Civil War   The post-Civil War Reconstruction era brought the start of Black representation on Capitol Hill in 1870, around the time when Black men gained the right to vote. The rise of racist poll taxes, literacy tests and threats of violence, however, whittled away the rights of Black voters until the passing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   \n   For a century after the Civil War, the number of Black-represented House districts in each Congress stayed in the single digits or at zero. That continued until 1969, when the number began gradually increasing through today to 63 districts, or about 14% of the current House.   Loading...\n   What the Supreme Court decides in the Louisiana case will set the stage for where that trend line goes.   At the center of the case is one of the state's two majority-Black congressional districts. Louisiana's Republican-controlled legislature drew it after a related Section 2 lawsuit led by Press Robinson, a Black voter and civil rights activist in Baton Rouge.   Robinson says he fears that without Section 2's protections, Black representation in Congress and at other levels of government will be diminished to \"a very minor scale.\"   \"And that is not where we should be in 2026,\" adds Robinson, who became the first Black elected member of the East Baton Rouge Parish School Board in 1980 after filing a federal lawsuit over the board's use of an election system that he argued diluted the power of Black voters.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Press Robinson, a civil rights activist, sits at his desk in his home in Baton Rouge, La., on Aug. 24, 2022. Louisiana's Republican-controlled legislature drew a second majority-Black congressional district after Robinson and other Black voters in the state sued.\n                \n                    Gerald Herbert/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Gerald Herbert/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Robinson's concerns about Section 2's future have been echoed by current members of Congress.   \"For so many of us here today, Section 2 is why we stand before you as members of the Congressional Black Caucus,\" said Democratic Rep. Terri Sewell of Alabama at a press conference, after the Supreme Court's October hearing for the Louisiana case. \"If this court strikes down these critical provisions, it would not only reverse decades of precedent, but it would also take us back to a dark time in our nation's history, a time when discrimination against minority voters went unchecked.\"   Opponents of those Section 2 provisions claim, however, that they violate the Constitution.   In the Supreme Court case, Louisiana's Republican state officials say race should play no role \"in any form\" when redrawing voting maps. A group of self-described \"non-African American\" voters from the state argue that the court should put an end to race-based redistricting under Section 2 now that it has ruled against race-based affirmative action at colleges and universities. Similarly, the Justice Department under the Trump administration has criticized the use of Section 2 provisions in redistricting as \"a form of electoral race-based affirmative action to undo a State's constitutional pursuit of political ends.\"   \n   A weakening of Section 2 could also reduce Latino representation   Additional restrictions on how race can be factored into redistricting could give political mapmakers more leeway to neutralize the collective power of minority voters and lead to fewer representatives of color getting elected, says Katherine Tate, a professor of political science at Brown University.   \"Minority members of Congress are more likely to sponsor bills that talk about minority interests, even controlling for political party. So diversity really is important in terms of fair representation, equal representation of American voters,\" explains Tate, who has written books about Black representation in Congress.   \n   Any weakening of Section 2's current redistricting provisions also puts at risk representation by other racial and ethnic minorities and at lower levels of government.   As much as 11% of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus could be lost, and close to 200 Democratic-held state legislative seats, mostly representing majority-Black districts in the South, could be eliminated, according to estimates by the voting rights advocacy groups Fair Fight Action and Black Voters Matter Fund.   Those changes may play out over years, says Lauren Groh-Wargo, Fair Fight Action's CEO.   \"We could see a very rapid, effective dismantling of Black representation at the congressional level and possibly at the state legislative level in a couple of states. I think other states may hold off and wait to do their gerrymandering\" until the current wave of mid-decade congressional redistricting is over, Groh-Wargo adds.   It's \"always a fight\"   Tate, the political scientist at Brown University, sees the Louisiana redistricting case returning the Supreme Court to a role from more than 150 years ago.   Tate recalls the series of court decisions beginning in the 1870s that eroded the civil rights gains of the Reconstruction era for Black citizens, including millions of formerly enslaved people. Now, the court is weighing the fate of a key remaining section of the Voting Rights Act — a legacy of the Civil Rights Movement that historians consider a second Reconstruction.   \n   \"It'll be like the first Reconstruction, why that failed — because of the Supreme Court rulings,\" Tate says. \"The end of the second Reconstruction will be because of the Supreme Court.\"   For Robinson of Baton Rouge, it's all a reminder that the struggle for fair representation never ends.   \"When it comes to voting rights and other rights for people of color, it's always a fight,\" Robinson says. \"There's never a time that we get what we deserve and that we should have without having to fight for it.\"   \n   Edited by Benjamin Swasey\n",

Reactions to the shooting reflect outrage over Good's death and a deep divide in how it's portrayed – as either a tragic abuse of power or an officer acting in self-defense.   \"This is an experienced officer who followed his training,\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said of the ICE officer who shot Good, when asked about the case on Thursday during a news conference in New York City.   \n   Noem said the shooting occurred after protesters in Minneapolis harassed and impeded ICE agents on Wednesday and that the officer acted to protect himself and fellow officers. She alleged that Good's actions amounted to \"an act of domestic terrorism.\"   Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison told NPR's Morning Edition that he disagrees with Noem's characterization of Good as a domestic terrorist.   \"She was a compassionate neighbor trying to be a legal observer on behalf of her immigrant neighbors,\" Ellison said. \"That's what she was doing at the moment of her death. And she was a poet. She was a mom. She was a daughter. And I am deeply saddened by what happened to her and her family.\"   Competing narratives quickly emerge   Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and other local officials have dismissed Noem's version of events as political spin. At a news conference on Wednesday, Frey said of the self-defense explanation, \"Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody that is bull****. \"   \"This was a federal agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying,\" Frey said, adding that he wants ICE units to leave Minneapolis.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A woman and other demonstrators confront federal officers outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis on Thursday, one day after a federal agent fatally shot a woman in her car in south Minneapolis.\n                \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Scott Olson/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he was angered by the killing, which he linked to President Trump's policy of sending ICE and other federal agents surging into cities such as Minneapolis.   \n   \"What we're seeing is the consequences of governance designed to generate fear, headlines and conflict,\" Walz said on Wednesday. \"It's governing by reality TV and today that recklessness cost someone their life.\"   Noem said on Wednesday that she had spoken with Walz about the killing, but added that they don't agree on whether it was justified: \"We have two very different viewpoints on what happened.\"   Hours after the shooting, Noem defended the ICE officer who shot Good, saying the woman had blocked federal officers with her SUV and disobeyed orders to get out of her vehicle.   \"It's clearly established law that a vehicle driven by a person and used to harm someone is a deadly weapon,\" she said, as NPR reported. \"Deadly force is perfectly lawful when a threat is faced by a weapon, so I do believe that this officer used his training in this situation.\"   When Noem was asked on Thursday whether the officer remains on field duty, Noem said he had gone to a hospital for treatment, but was then released \"and is spending time with his family now.\"   Noem also said the federal surge in Minneapolis will continue, and could even grow.   \"We've got thousands of officers there,\" she said, \"and I'm not opposed to sending more if necessary to keep people safe.\"   Key details of a controversial shooting   Here is a brief overview of what we know so far about the events leading to Good's death:   When: Police officers responded to reports of shots fired just after 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, according to a timeline published by the city of Minneapolis.   \"Minneapolis firefighters then removed the 37-year-old victim from the vehicle and immediately began lifesaving measures until paramedics could respond,\" the city's account states. \"She was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center, where she later died.\"   \n   Where: Good was shot in her car on Portland Avenue, near East 34th Street, in a residential area a few blocks north of where police killed George Floyd in May 2020.   ICE agents at the scene were trying to deal with a vehicle that had gotten stuck in the snow, Noem said on Wednesday. As other ICE vehicles arrived, so did protesters, a witness named Caitlin Callenson told member station MPR.   How: Callenson, who recorded a video of the incident, told MPR that agents gave Good conflicting orders: One agent told her to drive away while another told her to get out of her SUV, Callenson said.   (Warning: The video at the following link includes violent actions and profanity.)   Video footage from the scene shows Good's Honda Pilot SUV sitting sideways on a snowy street, with her driver's side window down. Two uniformed officers approach the vehicle from the left. As one officer grabs at her door handle, a third officer who had circled to the front of the SUV from the opposite side draws his gun. As Good begins to drive away, the officer fires into her car.   \"The preliminary information that we have indicates that this woman was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway,\" Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said at a news conference Wednesday. \"At some point, a federal law enforcement officer approached her on foot and the vehicle began to drive off. At least two shots were fired. The vehicle then crashed on the side of the roadway.\"   What's next: On Wednesday, O'Hara said the FBI and Minnesota's state agency, the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, would jointly investigate the fatal shooting.   But in a statement Thursday, the BCA said that the U.S. Attorney's Office reversed course at the federal level, and the FBI alone would lead the investigation, as MPR reports. The BCA said it \"has reluctantly withdrawn\" from the process, because it would no longer have access to case materials and evidence.   \n   Ellison, Minnesota's attorney general, said that he believes the FBI should not be involved in the inquiry.   \"I know that ICE and FBI are different agencies,\" Ellison said, \"but I think in order for public confidence to be at its best, there is some legitimate question as to what the role the FBI should be playing.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      President Trump loves to use figures and percentages even when they are sometimes mathematically impossible.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  President Trump uses a lot of numbers. When he rallied Republican members of the House earlier this week, he used the word percent more than 30 times. And as NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports, some of his numbers are mathematically impossible.TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: President Trump regularly boasts about the success of airstrikes on accused drug boats near Venezuela, but his numbers have changed repeatedly. Here he is in chronological order over the past month.(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Ninety-two or 94% down in drugs coming in by the sea.We've cut it down 96%. Think of that.Ninety-two percent.Ninety-six percent.Ninety-four percent.Ninety-six point two percent coming into the United States - 92.6 by sea.You know, it's 97%. I'm trying to figure out who are the other 3%.KEITH: He always makes that same joke, too. The White House declined to cite the source or offer an explanation for these shifting numbers. Glenn Kessler led The Fact Checker project at The Washington Post for 15 years.GLENN KESSLER: We often will just make stuff up. I mean, it's a consistent pattern.KEITH: In Trump's first term, Kessler documented more than 30,000 false or misleading statements by the president, and many of them involved numbers.KESSLER: You always want to have a statistic.KEITH: Trump also loves to talk about bringing down the cost of prescription drugs.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Some prescription drug and pharmaceutical prices will be reduced almost immediately by 50 to 80 to 90%.KEITH: That was in May. Since then, the claims have ballooned.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: And we're not talking about a 25% cut or 50, we're talking about a 1,500% cut.KEITH: Fifteen hundred percent. But math can sometimes be tricky. So I dialed up a math teacher. Kirk Weiler taught high school mathematics and became internet-famous with his more than 400 instructional videos. He said what Trump is claiming doesn't make sense when you're talking about the cost of a product.KIRK WEILER: If you had a drug that went down from a hundred dollars by 200%, then the drug would have to cost negative $100, implying, of course, that the drug companies were paying people to take the drug, which would be awesome.KEITH: Awesome, but that isn't what's happening. And in remarks earlier this week, Trump let on that he knew there might be an issue with his numbers.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Depending on the way you calculate it, it could be thousands of percent down. It could also be 90% and 80%. You know, there's two ways of calculate. I don't know if you know. They said, Donald Trump exaggerate - no, there are two ways of calculating it.KEITH: I played that clip for Weiler.WEILER: Wow (laughter).KEITH: And he said there really is only one way to calculate percentage decrease.WEILER: Of all the things that are debatable, this is just simply not one of them.KEITH: Responding to questions, White House spokesman Kush Desai didn't explain the president's math, but did say, quote, \"President Trump has correctly identified how Americans pay several times more for the exact same drugs as their peers in other wealthy nations.\" (ph) Kessler, the fact-checker, says other presidents were more precise about their language and the numbers they cited because what a president says matters.Tamara Keith, NPR News.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

    "body": "\n      Senators are expected to vote Thursday on another resolution to limit the Trump administration's military intervention in Venezuela. NPR speaks with one of its sponsors, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Today, the Senate is expected to vote on a measure that could rein in the Trump administration's military actions in Venezuela. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia is one of the resolution's co-sponsors. He's a Democrat and the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. Senator, good morning.TIM KAINE: Good morning, Leila. Good to be with you.FADEL: Thank you for being here. How would this measure - I mean, what would this measure do if it were to pass?KAINE: Leila, it's a very simple measure that's part of the War Powers Resolution of 1973. It directs the president to cease the use of U.S. military and hostilities against Venezuela, and it has a specific exception where the U.S. always has the ability to defend itself from attack or imminent attack. So it would direct the president to cease military operations. It would have to be passed by the House and go to the president's desk. The president would likely veto it. But I've been down this path before, and what I found is when Congress passes a resolution like this, it's an effective message to the president that the American public is tired of war, and it's time to back off. So I want to get Congress engaged rather than have Congress hide from this, as they've done for the last four months.FADEL: Now, the president's critics have accused him on many occasions of ignoring the will of Congress. So if this resolution passes, as you said, it would have some type of effect, but would it? Would the president just ignore it?KAINE: My experience in President Trump's first term is I did a similar resolution after the president struck and killed the Iranian military leader Soleimani in Iraq, and we did a resolution no war in or against Iran, without congressional approval. It passed both houses. The president vetoed it. And we didn't have the votes to overturn the veto, but we noticed that the president then stepped back for the remainder of his term in terms of the aggressive military action because he knew what it meant. When Congress votes we don't want war, it's because their constituents don't want war. And I can tell you this, Virginia, a very pro-military state, Virginians don't want more wars. They want the president to focus on the cost of housing, food, energy, health care, child care. They don't want more wars. And I'm hoping to get Congress to send that message loud and clear to the president.FADEL: Now, the administration has argued that this wasn't an act of war. It was a law enforcement operation, that the military was there to protect the FBI and DEA. Would the strikes and then capture of Nicolás Maduro be allowed under this resolution? I mean, would it change the actions that we saw?KAINE: They did try to make that argument in the classified hearing we had yesterday. And I can't get into the classification, but you're right, that's the argument they're making. And that argument might have a little bit of sway if all this was was going in in the middle of the night, executing an arrest warrant, bringing Maduro back to the Southern District of New York. But, Leila, that's not what this is. We started with boat strikes against Venezuelan boats on September 2. We amassed naval assets around the country. We're seizing ships, as your last report showed. We did an invasion with a hundred and fifty aircraft that bombed military sites in Venezuela. Eighty Venezuelans were killed, bringing the total deaths of, quote, \"enemies\" to about 200. American troops were injured, and now we're going to occupy and run Venezuela and seize its oil assets, the president said, likely for years. This is more than just the simple execution of an arrest warrant, and Congress shouldn't be silent about it.FADEL: And really quickly. I mean, you've put forward bills before that would limit the administration's use of force in Venezuela, and they failed because they didn't have the Republican support they needed. Would this time...KAINE: Yes.FADEL: ...Be any different?KAINE: I'm likely - I've been able to get two Republican votes on earlier ones, but like my challenge to presidential tariffs, what I've noticed is I start with a vote or two, and then I get three or four, and now I'm getting four or five. I think the Republicans are getting tired of the notion of endless wars - Greenland, Colombia, Cuba, Mexico. What's next? I'm hoping some will step up.FADEL: Tim Kaine, Democratic senator of Virginia. Thank you for your time.KAINE: Absolutely. Take care.(SOUNDBITE OF TALKDEMONIC'S \"MOUNTAINTOPS IN CAVES\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The House is set to vote Thursday on a bill to renew enhanced health insurance subsidies.\n                \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Against the wishes of House Speaker Mike Johnson, the House of Representatives is set to vote Thursday on a measure that would renew enhanced health insurance subsidies that expired at the end of last year.   The three-year extension is expected to pass the House, but it may not go far in the Senate, where a similar measure failed in December. A bipartisan group of senators, however, say they are close to a deal on a compromise bill for the Affordable Care Act subsidies.   While the debate over health care costs absorbed much of the oxygen in Congress in the final weeks of 2025, the rush to take action on the lapsed subsidies is now happening as members find themselves grappling with questions about the direction of U.S. foreign policy following President Trump's actions in Venezuela.    \n   On Thursday, the Senate took a procedural vote to begin debate on a resolution that would require the administration to seek authorization from Congress before taking further military action in the country. The measure advanced by a vote of 52 to 47, with five Republicans joining Democrats in support.    Thursday's votes are part of a whirlwind start to the new year for lawmakers. Adding to their to-do list is a fast-approaching Jan. 30 deadline to fund the government or risk a partial shutdown.   An end-run around the speaker on subsidies    Republican leadership for weeks refused to allow a vote on extending the subsidies.   Then just before the holiday recess, four swing-district Republicans joined with Democrats to force a vote on extending the subsidies for three years through what's known as a discharge petition. The once rare legislative tool allows 218 or more rank-and-file members to sidestep the speaker and force a vote.   A procedural motion Wednesday to set up that final House vote won support from nine Republicans.   \n   But even many backers acknowledge a clean three-year extension is unlikely to pass the Senate. The hope has been that success in the House would recharge bipartisan negotiations in the upper chamber, and there are signs that may be happening.   A small bipartisan group of senators have been negotiating this week, and several of them have told reporters they are nearing a deal.   \"We're in the red zone,\" said Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, on Wednesday. \"But that does not mean a touchdown. It could mean a 95-yard fumble.\"   \n   The path ahead in the Senate   Moreno says the emerging compromise centers on a two-year extension. In the second year, patients could opt to have the funds deposited in a Health Savings Account, instead of government subsidies going to the insurance company.   President Trump has pushed to give federal funding for health care costs directly to patients and has repeatedly decried the subsidies as government handouts to big insurance companies.   The plan would also include an income cap, among other changes Republicans have called for. Open enrollment would likely be extended so people who dropped their policies due to the premium spikes brought on by the expiration of subsidies can have an opportunity to sign up for coverage.   \n   There are still some sticking points to a bipartisan deal. Some Republicans want more specific language around the prohibition of federal funding being used for abortion.   Trump told House Republicans this week that they may need to be \"flexible on this.\"   And there are also many Republicans deeply opposed to the enhanced subsidies at all, so even if the bipartisan group reaches a compromise, their ultimate fate remains unclear.   A busy start to 2026 with Venezuela in focus   As lawmakers look for consensus on the subsidies, questions about the future of the U.S. role in Venezuela have also taken on new urgency.    While most Republicans have voiced support for the military operation that resulted in the capture of Nicolas Maduro, some in the party have signaled unease with what happens next. On Thursday, five Republican Senators joined with Democrats in voting to begin debate on a bill to require congressional approval for any further military action in Venezuela: Susan Collins of Maine, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Indiana's Todd Young.    The vote represented a rebuke for the president, but may ultimately prove symbolic. Even if the measure wins final passage in the Senate, it would face a steep climb in the GOP-controlled House and a likely veto from Trump.    \n   In addition to votes on health care and Venezuela, lawmakers are also facing pressure on funding the government by a deadline of Jan. 30.    Congress has already signed off on full-year funding for some federal agencies, but the record-long government shutdown last fall ended with a continuing resolution that got funding flowing again for most departments only into the first month of the year.   Several of those appropriations bills are slated to come up for votes in the coming days, but appropriators are still working out the details for bills that cover more contentious areas — like the Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services.   \n   Meanwhile, the House is expected to vote Thursday on overriding two vetoes by President Trump just before the new year — a rare show of pushback from Republicans in Congress. One veto deals with water infrastructure in Colorado, while the other affects a Native American tribe in Florida.\n",

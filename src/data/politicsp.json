In the fake video, a crown-wearing Trump is in a fighter jet emblazoned \"KING TRUMP.\" Accompanied by Loggins singing \"Danger Zone\" — a hit single from the 1986 movie Top Gun — the plane dumps sludgy brown material over crowds of protesters carrying American flags and signs in what appears to be New York City's Times Square.   The video was published as an apparent reply to the widespread No Kings protests that took place across the U.S. on Saturday. (On Saturday evening, the official White House account posted a fake image on X of Trump and Vice President Vance wearing crowns, juxtaposed with a fake image of Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in sombreros.)   \n   In a statement sent to NPR on Monday morning, Loggins wrote: \"This is an unauthorized use of my performance of 'Danger Zone.' Nobody asked me for my permission, which I would have denied, and I request that my recording on this video is removed immediately.\" (\"Danger Zone\" was written by Top Gun's score composer, Giorgio Moroder, and songwriter Tom Whitlock, with Loggins as the performer.)   Loggins continued: \"I can't imagine why anybody would want their music used or associated with something created with the sole purpose of dividing us. Too many people are trying to tear us apart, and we need to find new ways to come together. We're all Americans, and we're all patriotic. There is no 'us and them' – that's not who we are, nor is it what we should be. It's all of us. We're in this together, and it is my hope that we can embrace music as a way of celebrating and uniting each and every one of us.\"   There is a long history of musicians objecting to the current president (among other political leaders) using their work to send political messages. However, such use is generally legal, as long as rights holders are paid correctly; the only use that performers and songwriters can specifically prohibit is the use of songs in campaign advertisements. Even so, many artists choose to make such objections public so that a general audience is aware of their stance.   \n   NPR reached out to the White House for a response to Loggins' specific objections and his request that his performance be removed.   In reply, White House spokesperson Davis R. Ingle did not respond to NPR's questions but sent NPR an image from the film Top Gun of stars Tom Cruise and the late Val Kilmer, captioned: \"I FEEL THE NEED FOR SPEED.\"   Various musicians and their representatives, including The White Stripes and the estate of Isaac Hayes, have filed civil suits against Trump alleging copyright infringement. The White Stripes dropped their suit in November 2024. The Hayes suit, which was filed against the president, his reelection campaign and the activist group Turning Point Action, is continuing to wend its way through federal court in Atlanta.\n",

Some reporters watched from a park near the Treasury Department, which is next to the East Wing.   Trump announced the start of construction in a social media post and referenced the work while hosting 2025 college baseball champs Louisiana State University and LSU-Shreveport in the East Room. He noted the work was happening \"right behind us.\"   \n   \"We have a lot of construction going on, which you might hear periodically,\" he said, adding, \"It just started today.\"   The White House has moved ahead with the massive construction project despite not yet having sign-off from the National Capital Planning Commission, which approves construction work and major renovations to government buildings in the Washington area.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A model is seen as President Trump addresses a dinner for donors who have contributed to build the new ballroom at the White House on Oct. 15 in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    John McDonnell/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        John McDonnell/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Its chairman, Will Scharf, who is also the White House staff secretary and one of Trump's top aides, said at the commission's September meeting that agency does not have jurisdiction over demolition or site preparation work for buildings on federal property.   \"What we deal with is essentially construction, vertical build,\" Scharf said last month.   It was unclear whether the White House had submitted the ballroom plans for the agency's review and approval. The White House did not respond to a request for comment and the commission's offices are closed because of the government shutdown.   The Republican president had said in July when the project was announced that the ballroom would not interfere with the mansion itself.   \"It'll be near it but not touching it and pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of,\" he said of the White House.   \n   The East Wing houses several offices, including those of the first lady. It was built in 1902 and has been renovated over the years, with a second story added in 1942, according to the White House.   Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said those East Wing offices will be temporarily relocated during construction and that wing of the building will be modernized and renovated.   \n   \"Nothing will be torn down,\" Leavitt said when she announced the project in July.   Trump insists that presidents have desired such a ballroom for 150 years and that he's adding the massive 90,000-square-foot, glass-walled space because the East Room, which is the largest room in the White House with an approximately 200-person capacity, is too small. He also has said he does not like the idea of hosting kings, queens, presidents and prime ministers in pavilions on the South Lawn.   Trump said in the social media announcement that the project would be completed \"with zero cost to the American Taxpayer! The White House Ballroom is being privately funded by many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly.\"   The ballroom will be the biggest structural change to the Executive Mansion since the addition in 1948 of the Truman Balcony overlooking the South Lawn, even dwarfing the residence itself.   At a dinner he hosted last week for some of the wealthy business executives who are donating money toward the $250 million construction cost, Trump said the project had grown in size and now will accommodate 999 people. The capacity was 650 seated people at the July announcement.   The White House has said it will disclose information on who has contributed money to build the ballroom, but has yet to do so.   Trump also said at last week's event that the head of Carrier Global Corp., a leading manufacturer of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, had offered to donate the air conditioning system for the ballroom.   \n   Carrier confirmed to The Associated Press on Monday that it had done so. A cost estimate was not immediately available.   \"Carrier is honored to provide the new iconic ballroom at the White House with a world-class, energy-efficient HVAC system, bringing comfort to distinguished guests and dignitaries in this historic setting for years to come,\" the company said in an emailed statement.   The clearing of trees on the south grounds and other site preparation work started in September. Plans call for the ballroom to be ready before Trump's term ends in January 2029.\n",

    "body": "\n      \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n   This first appeared in the Planet Money newsletter. Sign up here!   A few years ago, Cory Doctorow coined a word that took the internet by storm. It appeared everywhere, including in our newsletter that analyzed why dating apps are breaking the hearts of their users. The American Dialect Society named it its word of the year in 2023. Merriam-Webster even added it to its dictionary — despite it having a swear word in it.   The word Doctorow coined is \"enshittification.\" And, naturally, that's also the title of his new book.   Enshittification is more than just a catchy word, describing when companies turn to crap. For Doctorow, a long-time internet activist and journalist, it describes a specific process he sees in the evolution — or, really, the devolution — of internet platforms, like Facebook, Google, Uber, and Amazon. (Disclosure: Google and Amazon are financial supporters of NPR and Amazon pays to distribute some of our programming.)   \n   The Stages Of Enshittification   In his new book, Doctorow argues there's a pattern in how these platforms operate. The companies behind these platforms are basically middlemen, connecting their users with businesses that want to make money from these users. So, for example, Facebook and Google connect their users with advertisers. Amazon connects its users with third-party merchants on its marketplace.   Stage 1 is when these platforms are new and want to entice users onto their platforms. They are flush with investor cash, face less pressure from shareholders to make immediate profits, and are in a race to convince people to sign up. This is when the platforms are really good to their users.   For example, in its early days, Facebook told users that they wouldn't spy on them and harvest their data the way they said MySpace did. And they offered \"a feed of things that users wanted to see, rather than things that businesses would pay to show them,\" Doctorow writes. For a while at least, Facebook was \"fun and useful and valuable.\"   Amazon and Uber offered consumers incredible deals during their stage 1. Like others before him, Doctorow alleges these deals were so good that they amounted to \"predatory pricing,\" or when companies charge below-cost, unsustainably low prices aimed at putting their competitors out of business.   \n   Stage 1 is all about achieving scale and locking in users. The platforms want to grow and benefit from what economists call \"network effects.\" That is, the more users they have, the more valuable their platform becomes. These platforms, Doctorow writes, also benefit from \"high switching costs,\" which mean that their users find it hard to leave and switch services.   With Facebook, for example, leaving the platform and going to another social network means trying to convince your friends and family they should leave and go somewhere else too. With Prime, Amazon gets consumers to pay for free shipping up front, incentivizing them to keep using their platform. And, if you've ever bought e-books or movies on their platform, you can't take them with you when you leave.   Stage 2: Being Good To Business Customers   After these platforms achieve scale and lock in a large user base, they enter stage 2. That's when the companies start trying to entice business customers onto their platform by being really good to them — at the expense of their users.   For Facebook, Doctorow writes, this meant changing the feeds that users saw. Facebook began using user data to target them with precise ads. Advertisers loved it. And they got publishers to publish short excerpts of their articles, and Facebook would \"nonconsensually cram those excerpts into the eyeballs of users who never asked to see them.\" This was a great deal for publishers, who became increasingly dependent on Facebook for traffic.   Likewise, Amazon provided a great deal to its business customers. \"Amazon paid full price for their goods, then sold them below cost to its customers,\" Doctorow writes. \"It subsidized returns and customer service, too. It ran a clean search engine, which put the best matches for shoppers' queries at the top of the page, creating a path to glory merchants could walk merely by selling quality goods at fair prices.\"   \n   With users and businesses locked in to their platforms, that tees up Stage 3, when the companies start trying to recoup their investor cash and actually start trying to make a lot of money.   Stage 3: When Everything Turns To Crap   Stage 3 is when these platforms tighten their grips on business customers, squeezing money out of them.   Facebook, Doctorow writes, began forcing advertisers to pay more for ad services and provided those advertisers with lower quality ad targeting. Wanting to keep internet traffic on their platform, they began forcing publishers to publish longer and longer excerpts of their articles in order to appear in user feeds. And they started charging them to \"boost\" their content in order for large numbers of users to see it, even when users had explicitly followed these publishers and signed up to see that content.   \"Meanwhile, for users, things kept getting even worse,\" Doctorow writes. They were fed an algorithm not of stuff they had signed up to see, but rather one filled with \"content people paid to put there: ads and boosted content.\"   We reached out to Facebook (Meta), and they didn't respond for comment.   Amazon, Doctorow writes, began using its data on merchants' sales to \"clone\" their products. He asserts Amazon began gaming their search algorithm to benefit themselves. And Doctorow asserts Amazon began charging merchants junk fees. \"Add all the junk fees together, and an Amazon seller is being screwed out of 45 to 51 cents on every dollar it earns on the platform,\" Doctorow claims. \"Even if a merchant wanted to absorb the 'Amazon tax' on your behalf, it couldn't. Merchants just don't make 51 percent margins.\" So the merchants have to increase their prices. (We reached out to Doctorow about where he got these numbers, and he cites this 2023 study from the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a non-profit research and advocacy organization).   \n   Stage 3, he writes, is also worse for consumers in other ways, like search quality. \"On average, the first result in an Amazon search is 29 percent more expensive than the best result for your search,\" Doctorow claims. \"Click any of the top four links on the top of your screen, and you'll pay an average of 25 percent more than you would for your best match. On average, the best match is located seventeen places down in an Amazon search result.\" (Doctorow cites this study and this study).   From the perspective of these platforms and their shareholders, you might call Stage 3 enrichification. But, for users and business customers, Doctorow writes, this is \"the end-stage of enshittification, the stage at which a platform turns into a pile of shit.\"   Naturally, we reached out to Amazon about Doctorow's arguments and claims. \"The book's entire theory about Amazon is incorrect,\" an Amazon spokesperson says. \"Even a cursory look would show that the value Amazon offers customers has only gotten better and better over time.\"   In regards to Doctorow's assertion that Amazon \"clones\" products of smaller businesses, the spokesperson responded, \"We follow the same practices as countless other retailers to inform our private brands, and we prohibit employees from using non-public, seller-specific data to determine which private-label products to launch.\" About search, they said they do not favor their own products in results. And they say it's \"categorically false\" that Amazon introduced \"junk fees.\" The spokesperson says Docotrow's figures are \"false and misleading because they conflate required selling fees with the cost of optional services — such as logistics, customer service, and advertising — that some sellers choose to purchase from Amazon or other providers. Amazon selling fees are 15% or less in most product categories.\" And, the spokesperson stressed, the extra fees are optional. \"Sellers who choose to purchase optional services from Amazon do so because Amazon provides more value than they can get elsewhere.\"   \n   Why Doctorow believes platforms degrade over time   Most of Doctorow's explanation for why internet platforms have gone down the toilet is hardly novel. While he offers some interesting technical nuances and solutions, his analysis largely comes down to two big factors: a lack of competition and an absence of the right, pro-consumer regulations.   Doctorow argues that these internet platforms have been treating their users and business customers like crap because they can treat them like crap. They can act this way because they don't fear their users will flee to competitors or that they'll be sanctioned much by the government.   Put another way, the castles of these companies' profit engines are protected by moats. Each moat is made of things like network effects and switching costs. Their customers either don't want to leave en masse or have a hard time escaping. And, at least until recently, the government has proven unwilling or unable to try and storm the castles.   To increase competition, Doctorow advocates for more vigorous antitrust enforcement and abandoning an influential legal doctrine known as \"the consumer welfare standard.\" This standard was adopted by the courts in the late 20th century. It judges whether companies are monopolies or anti-competitive not based on how big or powerful they are, but on whether they are measurably harming consumers, typically through demonstrably higher prices (We tell the origin story of this standard, and explore the new movement to change it in this Planet Money series about antitrust. Give it a listen).   When it comes to improving regulation, Doctorow offers a number of interesting ideas. One is, essentially, making it easier for users to leave platforms. For example, passing regulations that would allow Amazon Kindle users to take their e-books with them. He argues that this \"right-to-exit\" would be easy to administer. And it would create real incentives for platforms to be better to their users.   \n   Doctorow also spends a lot of time singing the praises of \"interoperability.\" It's a technical computer term that basically means allowing products or services to work with other products or services. One example is printer ink cartridges. In his ideal world, any competitor would be able to make ink cartridges that are compatible — or interoperable — with a given printer. However, in the existing system, makers of printers are able to make it so users must use only their special, very expensive ink cartridges in their printers. This exclusivity is obviously a money-making scheme.   The tech companies have made it so many of their products and services are not interoperable with each other. iPhones won't run Android apps. Bluesky users can't DM their old Twitter contacts. Doctorow suggests these are artificial barriers created by companies to maintain their market power, and that regulations have helped them do it.   And, yeah, lefty consumer advocates like Doctorow seem to be mostly losing in today's America. But he points out that the anti-tech monopoly movement has really gathered steam in recent years, including overseas. And he believes there are clear policy solutions that are popular, including with many conservatives, that can \"reverse the enshittification of the internet.\"   Reminder for those of you following along with Planet Money's Board Game project: We're going to have a live online chat you can join on 11/1 about the game, the process, and how it's going.

Today's top stories   Many federal workers expect not to get paid this Friday, marking the first full paycheck they will miss due to the government shutdown, which began three weeks ago. So far there has been limited economic fallout. But analysts say that the longer the shutdown continues, the bigger the dent it could leave.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                U.S. Senate Majority Leader Sen. John Thune (R-SD) speaks to members of the press at the U.S. Capitol on Oct. 20 in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 By law, federal workers are supposed to receive back pay once the shutdown ends, but the White House has attempted to cast doubt on that, NPR's Scott Horsley tells Up First. That rhetoric could result in some federal workers pulling back their spending habits, which could impact some of the businesses that those workers frequent. The total price tag of the shutdown is unknown, but past ones show that it has been costly for the government and the broader economy. Horsley says if Congress doesn't resolve the government shutdown by the beginning of next month, the food stamp program, which helps feed millions of people, may not be able to provide benefits.   \n   Colombia announced yesterday that it will withdraw its ambassador to Washington. The country used to be the U.S.'s top ally in Latin America and a key partner in the war on drugs. But its relationship with the U.S. has deteriorated since President Trump started his second term. Colombia's decision to withdraw its ambassador comes after Trump threatened to cut U.S. aid to the country and intervene in Colombia to combat the flow of cocaine.    🎧 Colombia's President Gustavo Petro is a leftist who disagrees with Trump on almost every issue and isn't afraid to say so, says reporter John Otis. Over the weekend, Petro expressed support for the \"No Kings\" rallies in the U.S. and said yesterday that his country doesn't accept kings. Colombia receives around $230 million a year in U.S. aid. Otis says much of those funds go towards helping the Colombians fight the drug cartels.   French authorities are still searching for the culprits who stole millions of dollars' worth of jewels from the Louvre on Sunday. The heist showcased huge gaps in security at the museum. A recent French government report states that more than half of the rooms in some of the major wings of the museum have no video surveillance.    \n   🎧 Prosecutors say they are not ruling anything out as a possibility in finding who did this. Time is of the essence in the investigation as the thieves will likely dismantle the jewels, melt down the gold and sell the gems separately, says NPR's Eleanor Beardsley. If this happens, a part of French history and culture will be gone forever.➡️ This isn't the Louvre's first high-profile heist. Take a look at some earlier thefts in the museum's history.

That's why two major clinical trials in Europe that evaluated cannabis for low back pain caught the attention of those investigating the plant's potential for pain management. The first showcased that a blend of cannabis oil, containing the psychoactive compound THC, as well as CBD and other natural compounds in the plant, outperformed a placebo. The other trial compares the same proprietary cannabis elixir with opioids, revealing that patients who used the elixir experienced fewer gastrointestinal side effects like constipation than when using painkillers.    ➡️ Medical cannabis proponents say that the drug's safety is a clear upside compared to opioids because it does not come with the same concerns regarding overdose and addiction.➡️ Currently, there is one cannabis-derived medication approved by the FDA, and it does not contain any THC. Though it isn't entirely clear, experts believe THC is one of the primary compounds responsible for reducing pain.➡️ While most Americans reside in states where marijuana is legal, there are significant concerns about the quality and consistency of cannabis products. If the FDA were to approve a cannabis product, it would give patients with chronic pain more confidence to use it.

Pickleball has rapidly gained popularity in the U.S. Nearly 20 million people have picked up their racket to play the sport. As more players join the courts, pickleball-related eye injuries, including lacerations around the eye, corneal abrasions and inflamed irises, have increased. A recently published JAMA Ophthalmology study estimates that the incidence of these injuries has gone up by an estimated 405 cases each year from 2021 to 2024.    🥽 The study's authors have called for developing standardized guidelines for eye protection, which has been found to reduce up to 90% of sports-related eye injuries.🥽 Wearing eye protection would require players to purchase another piece of equipment and bring it with them. There are currently many options on the market, which can make deciding what to buy daunting without standardized eye protection guidelines.🥽 One of the most common reasons some players don't wear protective eyewear is that they are not aware of the risks, says Dr. Daniel Henick, an ophthalmology resident at Yale School of Medicine. Henick says that posting guidance outside of courts could help reduce these injuries. Professional pickleball athletes could also set an example by wearing goggles.   3 things to know before you go   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The first phase of  the Reefline project will be Leandro Ehrlich's \"Concrete Coral,\" an installation of 22 cars that will become covered by coral.\n                \n                    Courtesy of the Reefline\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Courtesy of the Reefline\n    \n\n   \n   The first phase of \"Reefline,\" an artificial reef off Miami Beach, begins this month.

They differ on politics, but they all came to Washington, D.C., to lobby Congress to support aid for people with the deadly disease.\n                \n                    Charlotte Kesl for KFF Health News\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Charlotte Kesl for KFF Health News\n    \n\n   \n   Mary Catherine Johnson is a retired small-business owner from outside Rochester, New York. She voted for Donald Trump three times.   Lexy Mealing, who used to work in a physician's office, is from Long Island, New York. She's a Democrat.   But the two women share a common bond. They both survived breast cancer.   And when the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network organized its annual citizen lobby day in Washington, D.C., last month, Johnson and Mealing were among the more than 500 volunteers pushing Congress to keep cancer research and support for cancer patients at the top of the U.S. health care agenda.   \n   An annual plea   The day in Washington is something of a ritual for groups like the cancer organization.   This year it came as Democrats and Republicans in Washington slid toward a budget impasse that has shut down the federal government indefinitely. But these volunteers transcended their own political differences and found common ground.   \"Not one person here discussed if you're a Democrat, if you're a Republican,\" says Mealing, one of 27 volunteers in the New York delegation. \"Cancer doesn't care.\"   \n   Every one of the volunteer lobbyists had been touched in some way by the deadly disease, which is expected to kill more than 600,000 people in the U.S. this year.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Volunteers with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network from all 50 states decorated about 10,000 white paper bags with messages of hope and remembrance for people with cancer.\n                \n                    Charlotte Kesl for KFF Health News\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Charlotte Kesl for KFF Health News\n    \n\n   \n   Johnson said each of her mother's 10 siblings died from cancer, as did a lifelong friend who died at age 57, leaving behind his wife and two young daughters.   Like many of the New York volunteers, Johnson also says she's worried about the state of politics today.   \"I think we're probably the most divided that we've ever been,\" she says. \"That scares me. Scares me for my grandchildren.\"   Katie Martin, a volunteer from outside Buffalo, N.Y., also worries. She and her daughter recently drove past political protesters screaming at one another on the street.   \n    \"My daughter is silent and then starts asking, 'What is this?' And I don't know how to explain it, because it doesn't even make sense to me,\" she says. \"It's very heartbreaking.\"   Mealing says she can barely watch the news these days. \"A lot of Americans are very stressed out. There's a lot of things going on.\"   Bipartisan support   Americans are indeed split over many issues: immigration, guns, President Trump. But helping people with cancer and other serious illnesses retains broad bipartisan support, polls show.   In one recent survey, 7 in 10 voters said it's very important for the federal government to fund medical research. That included majorities of Democrats and Republicans.   \n   \"It's rare in today's environment to see numbers like that,\" says Jarrett Lewis, a Republican pollster who conducted the survey for patient groups. \"But almost everybody in this country knows somebody who's had cancer.\"   Similarly, a recent KFF poll found that three-quarters of U.S. adults, including most Republicans who align with the MAGA movement, want Congress to extend subsidies that help Americans buy health insurance through Affordable Care Act marketplaces. (KFF is a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.)   These subsidies, which are critical to people with chronic illnesses such as cancer, are one of the main sticking points in the current budget impasse in Congress.   As the volunteers gathered in a conference hotel in Washington, they focused on their shared agenda: increasing funding for cancer research, retaining insurance subsidies and expanding access to cancer screening.   \n   \"We may not see eye to eye politically. We might not even see eye to eye in social circumstances,\" said Martin, the Buffalo-area volunteer. \"But we can see beyond those differences because we're here for one cause.\"   The state delegations practiced the pitches they would make to their members of Congress. They ran through the personal stories they would share. And they swapped tips for how to deal with resistant staff and how to ask for a photo with a lawmaker.   \n   On the morning of their lobby day, Sept. 16, they reconvened in a cavernous ballroom, all decked out in matching blue polo shirts and armed with red information folders to leave at each office they would visit.   They got a pep talk from a pair of college basketball coaches. Then they headed across town to Capitol Hill.   The army of volunteers — from every state in the country — hit 484 of the 535 Senate and House offices.   Not every visit was an unqualified victory. Many Republican lawmakers object to extending the insurance subsidies, arguing they're too costly.   But lawmakers from both parties have backed increased research funding and support for more cancer screening.   And the New Yorkers felt good about the day. \"It was amazing,\" Mealing said as the day wrapped up. \"You could just feel the sense of, 'Everybody stronger together.'\"   Memorials and lessons   When evening came, the volunteers met on the National Mall for a candlelight vigil. It was raining. Bagpipes played.   Around a pond near the Lincoln Memorial, some 10,000 tea lights glimmered in little paper bags. Each luminary had a name on it — a life touched by cancer.   John Manna, another New Yorker, is a self-described Reagan Republican whose father died from lung cancer. He reflected on lessons that this day could offer a divided nation.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                An illuminated sign says \"HOPE\" on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., part of an annual event organized by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network to bring the needs of cancer patients to the attention of lawmakers. A steady rain fell on this year's evening vigil.\n                \n                    Charlotte Kesl for KFF Health News\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Charlotte Kesl for KFF Health News\n    \n\n   \n   \"Talk to people,\" he said. \"Get to know each other as people, and then you can understand somebody's positions.  We have little disagreements, but, you know, we don't attack each other. We talk and discuss it.\"   Manna said he would be back next year.   KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues.\n",

She says the debate revealed political vulnerability — not cognitive decline   Jean-Pierre opened her book with her account of the June 2024 presidential debate, the night questions about former President Joe Biden's health and acuity intensified.   \"I had not seen the president because he had been in debate prep,\" she said. \"So the first time I actually heard him speak was while he was debating. So when I heard his voice, I thought to myself, uh oh. He was hoarse. He kind of looked like he was sick.\"   She said she immediately recognized how the optics might play publicly. \"Everything that I've been pushing back on — his age, is he fit — like automatically anytime he would sneeze or have a runny nose or something would happen, that would be where the questions would go.\"   Still, she maintained she had seen no reason to doubt the president's ability to serve. \"I stand by that. I stand by that 110%.\"   2. She blames, in part, Democratic disunity for Trump's return   Jean-Pierre argued that Democrats' inability to rally around Biden cost them politically.   \"Joe Biden, objectively, had a very successful four years,\" she said. \"And here we are on the cusp of an election of a lifetime that we all need to get behind our person, and we couldn't do it. Republicans are able to do it … and we weren't able to do it.\"   \n   She cited figures such as Nancy Pelosi and George Clooney who, she said, signaled their doubts about the president. \"All of it,\" she said, \"contributed to a perception of disunity.\"   3. She says criticism of her as press secretary reflected deeper bias   Jean-Pierre recalled the scrutiny she faced at the podium, including claims she was \"too wooden\" or lacked policy depth.   \"Well, look, in the moment, I was quiet,\" she said. \"What I can do is state facts, which is that no one has ever looked like me that has been at that podium.\"   She said she understood that \"as a Black woman, things are just different for people who look like me.\"   4. She says Democrats had failed Black women — even as they relied on them   In a chapter titled \"Sisterhood,\" Jean-Pierre described the loyalty of Black women voters within the party.   \"I feel like, if you look at Black women and how they come out and vote no matter what, because they understand what's at stake ... we get forgotten,\" she said.   She said she had appreciated the Biden-Harris administration's effort to elevate those voices: \"They felt seen when they saw me at the podium, behind that lectern, whether it was women of color, Black women, queer community, LGBTQ community, immigrant — they felt seen, and that mattered to me.\"   5. She says becoming an independent was about accountability, not defection   Jean-Pierre said her decision to identify as an independent was meant to start a conversation about the direction of American politics.   \"Look, for me, I'm not telling people, Hey, you go become an independent,\" she said. \"There is a growing number of people who see themselves as independents, including young people. We have to question, why is that?\"   She also said Democrats had failed to anticipate what would follow their loss.   Jean-Pierre said she hoped the book would encourage engagement rather than cynicism.   \n   \"There's an opportunity to reimagine what politics can be, to reimagine what America can be. That means you can't stay quiet, because silence is complicit.\"   The radio version of this interview was produced by Barry Gordemer and edited by Adriana Gallardo.\n",

It's unclear what impact this ruling will immediately have on the ground. The 9th Circuit's decision applies to only one of the two temporary restraining orders that U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut issued this month blocking the deployment.   \n   \"Right now, until the district court acts on the second TRO, national guard members from Oregon, or any other state cannot deploy,\" Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek said in a statement.   The ruling comes in the wake of a series of Trump authorizations to deploy National Guard troops to American cities including Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Chicago. President Trump has said the deployments are necessary to protect the work of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and reduce crime.   On Oct. 16, a federal appeals court upheld an earlier District Court ruling in Illinois, temporarily blocking the president's federalization and deployment of the National Guard there. The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to intervene.   Trump called the National Guard to Portland last month   The Trump administration federalized 200 members of the Oregon National Guard on Sept. 28 after the president described Portland on social media as \"War ravaged\" and \"under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists.\"   This characterization is false, according to local and state officials, residents and journalists on the ground. Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek told NPR on Oct. 6 that the president's portrayal was \"ludicrous.\"   \"We had thousands of people on the streets of Portland for the Portland Marathon,\" she said. \"The city is beautiful. The city is thriving.\"   \n   The federal government has argued in court documents that the National Guard is needed to protect an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Portland that has been the site of protests since June. They wrote that protesters had assaulted federal officers \"with rocks, bricks, pepper spray and incendiary devices, causing injury.\"   In their own court documents, attorneys for the city of Portland and the state of Oregon wrote that the protests had been small and largely peaceful for months.   \n   In a declaration provided to the court, Craig Dobson, an assistant chief with the Portland Police Bureau (PPB), stated that the protests have never been so out of control that local officers couldn't respond.   \"In fact, on any given weekend,\" he stated, \"the nightlife in Portland's entertainment district has warranted greater PPB resources than the small, nightly protests in front of the ICE facility.\"   The federal government, however, has argued that things have been quieter because 115 federal police officers were sent to Portland this summer to help protect the ICE building there. It says some of those federal officers have since been sent back. And while it's unclear how many remain, the federal government says their deployment is a strain on resources.   In response, attorneys for the state of Oregon have said such deployments are a normal part of the federal police's responsibilities.   Lower court blocked the deployment    On Oct. 4, Immergut, the U.S. district judge, granted the city and state a temporary restraining order, preventing the federal government from deploying the National Guard to Portland.   The president can federalize National Guard members if there's a foreign invasion, a rebellion or a danger of one, or an inability to carry out federal laws with \"regular forces.\"   Immergut wrote that the Trump administration did not have a legitimate basis for federalizing the National Guard because the protests in Portland had been \"generally peaceful\" since June and did not prevent federal law enforcement officers from doing their jobs.   \n   She wrote that the Trump administration described only a few incidents of protesters clashing with federal officers in September before the National Guard federalization. They involved people shining overpowered flashlights in the eyes of drivers, \"posting a photograph of an unmarked ICE vehicle online\" and \"setting up a makeshift guillotine to intimidate federal officials.\"   \"These incidents are inexcusable,\" Immergut wrote, \"but they are nowhere near the type of incidents that cannot be handled by regular law enforcement forces.\"   The following day, despite her ruling, Trump sent 200 federalized California National Guard members to Oregon. A memo from the Department of Defense also authorized up to 400 members of the Texas National Guard to deploy to Portland and Chicago.   \n   Immergut then granted a second order blocking the Trump administration from sending any federalized members from any National Guard to Oregon.   \n   In its appeal to the 9th Circuit, the Trump administration said in court documents that the lower court judge had \"impermissibly second-guessed the Commander in Chief's military judgments.\"   On Oct. 6, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a press briefing: \"With all due respect to that judge, I think her opinion is untethered in reality and in the law.\" She went on to say that the president was using his authority as commander in chief.   Appeals court sides with the president   The majority opinion for the 9th Circuit was authored by judges Ryan Nelson and Bridget Bade, who were both appointed during Trump's first term.   They wrote that the District Court erred when it discounted \"the violent and disruptive events that occurred in June, July, and August\" outside the ICE facility and focused \"on only a few events in September,\" the month Trump federalized the National Guard.   The law, they argued, didn't put such limitations on the facts or circumstances that the president could consider when making a decision to deploy the National Guard.   \"The President can, and should, consider the totality of the circumstances when determining whether he 'is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States,'\" they wrote.   \"Rather than reviewing the President's determination with great deference,\" the panel of judges wrote, \"the district court substituted its own determination of the relevant facts and circumstances.\"   \n   Appeals court Judge Susan Graber, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, dissented, writing there was no justification to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard.   \"Given Portland protesters' well-known penchant for wearing chicken suits, inflatable frog costumes, or nothing at all when expressing their disagreement with the methods employed by ICE, observers may be tempted to view the majority's ruling, which accepts the government's characterization of Portland as a war zone, as merely absurd,\" Graber wrote.   Officials at the White House praised the court's ruling Monday, saying it affirms that the lower court's ruling \"was unlawful and incorrect.\"   \n   \"As we have always maintained, President Trump is exercising his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel following violent riots that local leaders have refused to address,\" Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement.   Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield also responded to Monday's ruling with a statement: \"Today's ruling, if allowed to stand, would give the president unilateral power to put Oregon soldiers on our streets with almost no justification,\" he wrote. \"We are on a dangerous path in America.\"   Clarification: An earlier version of this story said the 9th Circuit decision removed \"the\" legal impediment to Trump's deployment of the national guard troops to Portland, implying it was singular. While the court granted a stay for one temporary restraining order, at the time of publication a second order is still in force, so the immediate impact of this ruling is unclear.\n",

Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy pilot first elected to Congress in 2018, is facing off against pro-Trump Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a longtime New Jersey politician and small business owner. In the closing weeks, both candidates have hurled increasingly personal attacks against one another and received endorsements from some of the biggest names in their parties.   President Trump, who endorsed Ciattarelli earlier this year, is planning to host tele-rallies for the Republican contender, Axios reported. Meanwhile, former President Barack Obama released an endorsement video for Sherrill last week, calling the Democratic Congresswoman the \"right choice\" to be New Jersey's next governor.   \n   Most mainstream polls show Sherrill leading Ciattarelli, but in some cases the margin is smaller than might be expected in the historically blue state. One poll from September showed the candidates tied.   Political experts say although Democrats have a three-to-two voter registration advantage over Republicans in New Jersey, the Garden State has a history of electing governors from both major political parties.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                New Jersey Democratic candidate for governor, Mikie Sherrill, speaks to a crowd in Westville, N.J., on Oct. 11, 2025. Sherrill is set to square off against Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli on Nov. 4.\n                \n                    Matthew Hatcher/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Matthew Hatcher/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   \"As blue as New Jersey might be in presidential races and U.S. Senate races too, the state is decidedly purple when it comes to gubernatorial elections,\" says Ben Dworkin, director of the Rowan Institute for Public Policy & Citizenship at Rowan University.   Phil Murphy, the state's current Democratic governor is leaving office after serving a limit of two terms. If Sherrill wins, it would be the first time since the 1960s that New Jersey voters elected a governor from the same party three terms in a row.   The campaign has gotten increasingly personal   Tensions have grown in the race to be Murphy's successor, with the two candidates and their campaigns trading personal attacks in recent weeks.   Ciattarelli, who served in the state Assembly from 2011-2018 and is running for New Jersey governor for the third time, has repeatedly slammed Sherrill for being prohibited from walking at her Naval Academy graduation in 1994 in the midst of a cheating scandal at the school.   \n   Sherrill has said she was punished by the academy for refusing to turn in her classmates, and she's criticized the Trump administration for improperly releasing her largely unredacted military records to an ally of Ciattarelli's campaign.   Meanwhile, Sherrill, who is also a former federal prosecutor, has blasted Ciattarelli's former medical publishing company for producing materials downplaying the dangers of opioids. In a televised debate earlier this month, Sherrill said Ciattarelli was responsible for killing tens of thousands of people in New Jersey.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Republican Jack Ciattarelli responds to questions during this year's first gubernatorial debate with Democrat Mikie Sherrill, Sept. 21, 2025, in Lawrenceville, N.J.\n                \n                    Noah K. Murray/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Noah K. Murray/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Ciattarelli's campaign has threatened to sue Sherrill for defamation over those comments, with campaign strategist Chris Russell accusing Sherrill of \"baselessly and recklessly accusing a political opponent of mass murder.\"   Also looming large over the campaign is Trump, who frequents his golf course in Bedminster, in Central New Jersey. Ciattarelli's embrace of Trump earned him the president's endorsement, despite the fact that in 2016 he called Trump \"a charlatan and an embarrassment.\" Sherrill has continued to tie Ciattarelli to the president and is urging New Jersey voters to reject Trump's MAGA movement at the polls.   Affordability is top of mind for voters   Though the personal attacks have stepped up, Dworkin doubts they will overpower voters' concerns about skyrocketing prices.   \"The people who are going to make a difference, who are truly trying to decide where they will vote, want to talk about the cost of living and affordability,\" he says.   Because both Sherrill and Ciattarelli have talked about New Jersey's high cost of living, it may come down to who has the more convincing message.   Nicole Nance, a Republican from Cherry Hill, said at a recent campaign event for Ciattarelli that she thinks his background as an accountant will be useful as he tries to lower the state's notoriously high property taxes.   \"I think I'd rather have a [certified public accountant] with some type of experience help with the budget, you know, help run the state, than a pilot,\" she said, referring to Sherrill's military background.   \n   But Victor Carstarphen, the Democratic mayor of Camden in South Jersey, says he supports Sherrill's plans to build more housing and freeze rising energy costs.   \"Listen, she's talked about these utilities, and how these utilities is going up higher and higher, and that affects a community like Camden,\" he says. \"She hits it spot on with that.\"   In June, New Jerseyans' electricity bills surged 17% to 20% depending on their provider, according to the state Board of Public Utilities.\n",

Today's top stories   The ceasefire in Gaza was tested this weekend when Israel launched an assault on the territory in response to an attack on its troops. The Israeli military said Sunday that \"terrorists\" attacked Israeli troops operating in the Rafah area resulting in two soldiers being killed. Hamas denied involvement in any attacks. Gaza officials say dozens were killed in the Israeli strikes. Both sides are accusing the other of violating the ceasefire deal brokered by the United States.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Smoke billows following an Israeli strike that targeted a building in the Bureij camp for Palestinian refugees in the central Gaza Strip on Oct. 19. Gaza's civil defence agency said a series of Israeli air strikes on October 19 killed at least 11 people across the territory, as Israel and Hamas traded blame for violating a ceasefire.\n                \n                    Eyad Baba/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Eyad Baba/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Yesterday's events mark the most significant threat to the ceasefire deal since both sides signed the agreement, NPR's Rob Schmitz tells Up First. Despite what happened, Hamas and Israel say they are still committed to the spirit of the ceasefire. U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and President Trump's adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, arrive in Israel today and Vice President JD Vance is expected to arrive tomorrow to get the ceasefire deal back on track. The group will try to facilitate the return of the remaining Israeli hostage bodies, which is an important part of the first phase of the agreement.   \n   The government shutdown is entering day 20 with no serious negotiations underway to bring it to an end. The longest shutdown was 35 days and happened during Trump's first term in the White House. However, this time it is different as there is less pressure to get a deal because some of the impacts are not being widely felt, NPR's Deirdre Walsh says.    🎧 Instead of feeling pressure to fold due to their projects being targeted, Democrats are digging in and saying that this is more of the same tactics the Trump administration used before the shutdown happened. The Senate has unsuccessfully voted 10 times on a House-approved stopgap bill to fund the government. The next vote is expected tonight. Senate Democrats are expected to keep blocking that bill, not budging on their position that health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year need to be extended.   The U.S. plans to stop all subsidies to Colombia and implement new tariffs after the country's leader, Gustavo Petro, said Trump's attacks on boats coming from Venezuela amount to murder. U.S. forces have destroyed boats in the open waters in what the government describes as a counternarcotics operation.    🎧 The U.S. government says it has struck at least seven vessels and claims they were loaded with drugs headed to the U.S. NPR's Eyder Peralta says the big picture is that it has been decades since the U.S. military has taken a position like this in the Americas. This has created tension in the region. Renute Roberts, a fisherman in Trinidad, says he can hear drones circling at night. While Roberts says he believes drugs are a problem, he says Trump can handle it without bombing boats.   \n   Cost of living    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                As health insurance prices are surging, some companies are covering their employees' medical plans.\n                \n                    Getty Images/Emily Bogle/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Getty Images/Emily Bogle/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   NPR's series Cost of Living: The Price We Pay is examining what's driving price increases and how people are coping after years of stubborn inflation.    U.S. health care is the most expensive in the developed world and the price point is only rising. Last year, the average annual premium for an employer-based health insurance plan for a family of four was over $25,500. Of that average total, employers contributed about $19,200 and workers contributed the rest. Total premiums have risen over 24% since 2019 and are widely expected to surge next year. Here's how the increasing costs are impacting people and companies:    ⚕️ Drugmakers, hospitals, insurance companies and other for-profit companies have driven up the costs of accessing medical care in the U.S. For example, drugmakers are developing more effective medications, but they are charging a lot for them.⚕️ For many of the millions of people who get health insurance through their employer, their paycheck deductions could surge next year by 6% to 7% on average.⚕️ Some companies are covering all insurance premiums. Offering zero-premium health insurance can help to recruit new employees, reduce turnover rates and help workers stay focused on their job, instead of expenses.   Listen to more about what companies are doing to help with health insurance premiums, or read a conversation about it.

The first cumbia song recorded in Ecuador in the 1960s had just one verse and it was called \"Cumbia Triste.\" Written by Polibio Mayorga, the song combined the rhythms of the San Juanito — traditional Andean music — with rural Colombian cumbia, which arrived to the country by way of the record industry. The result marked a new identity for many migrants who came to live in Ecuador's urban centers. Mayorga laid the groundwork for the Ecuadorian cumbia sound and musicians like Medardo Luzuriaga, who transformed the genre into a national sensation. Luzuriaga recorded over 100 albums, and his emblematic cumbias still live in the collective conscience of the entire country.

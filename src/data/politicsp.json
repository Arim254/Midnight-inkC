The payments are targeted at row crop farmers and will be announced during a roundtable event hosted by President Trump Monday, featuring farmers affected, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, said a White House official speaking on background because they were not authorized to speak on the record.   The move comes as the administration looks to placate economic concerns from key Trump constituencies as the tariff effects play out but also on the heels of a trying few years for row crop farmers.   \n   \"President Trump is helping our agriculture industry by negotiating new trade deals to open new export markets for our farmers and boosting the farm safety net for the first time in a decade. Today's announcement reflects the President's commitment to helping our farmers, who will have the support they need to bridge the gap between Biden's failures and the President's successful policies taking effect,\" said White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly.   The money will be coming from the USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation, which Trump also used to give farmers economic aid in his first term.   This is a developing story and will be updated.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Ayesha Rascoe asks Republican strategist Liam Donovan, head of the consulting and public affairs firm Targeted Victory, how deep current disagreements in the GOP Congressional caucus are.   \n\n    (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE JOHNSON: We've had one of the most productive Congresses in the history of the institution.AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:  That's House Speaker Mike Johnson on Fox Business Friday.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHNSON: Now, remember, in previous years, speakers had 25-, 30-, 40-seat majorities. I have a razor-thin majority. I have to get every single Republican on most days. And so takes a lot of work, but we're going to get there.RASCOE: But the big question is where there is, and it's a question being asked increasingly among House Republicans. Liam Donovan joins us now. He's a veteran political operative who now heads up Targeted Victory, a Republican consulting and public affairs firm. Good morning.LIAM DONOVAN: Good morning.RASCOE: So productive is in the eye of the beholder. But what odds do you give that Republican and Republican-leaning voters will see what the GOP-led Congress has done so far as productive in November?DONOVAN: Well, I think the productivity has been so front-loaded, which is leading to some of the frustrations late in this year, particularly coming out of the shutdown. But that's going to be the challenge of Republicans over this next year. And I think they understand that. I think Mike Johnson is aware of that, but they need to take the accomplishments of the first half of the year, particularly around the extension of the previous Trump tax cuts and the expansion on those, especially with respect to the provisions that people really do like. And they - and as they learn heading into next year, remember, things like no tax on overtime, no tax on tips - those sorts of provisions don't go into effect until next year. So as Americans start to feel the effects of those cuts, of those policies, and Republicans go out and run on those things, I think that's the best thing they have going for them. But remember, they benefited from the affordability conversation under Joe Biden.RASCOE: And now they're...DONOVAN: Now that things have...RASCOE: Now - they're suffering...DONOVAN: Exactly.RASCOE: ...From it now. But there is the issue of the Affordable Care Act subsidies, which is - seems to be a thorn for the GOP right now. Is there a deal that would be able to appeal to Speaker Johnson, pass the House and also pass the Senate?DONOVAN: Look, this is a fraught issue that has really bedeviled Republicans for the last 15 years. And I think particularly if you think back to the first Trump administration, it was the first issue out of the gate that kind of - that President Trump watched and, I think, recognized that this is something that is a little bit snakebitten for Republicans. So I think it takes some presidential leadership to be able to step up and give cover to Republicans to go do this. I think - whatever the president decides, I think that will help...RASCOE: But...DONOVAN: ...Kind of lay the path.RASCOE: Are you worried, though? Because it does seem like whoever touches health care - they kind of get the - they face the repercussions. They face the wrath 'cause it's a very complicated issue, and it's hard to make everybody happy. So if you're the party making the changes, you may have to face the consequences.DONOVAN: Well, and I think that's right because this is - remember, this is a provision that is - was set to expire by the previous Democratic Congress. And so the question for Republicans is, do they own this? Do they decide to extend it when they are now in power? I think where this is heading, it certainly seems like they're more willing to begin to get into the political game of, whose fault is it that it expires? Who set up the system that is leading to these increases in prices? But it doesn't look like there's going to be a deal. And so the question becomes, how does this next few weeks play out in a way that allows people to go run races and try to win elections on it in the next year?RASCOE: Do you think the president's successful push to redistrict House seats in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina and the continued push for seats in Indiana, Florida and Kansas - do you think that's a surefire way for Republicans to keep the House?DONOVAN: Well, I think it depends on that last bit, those remaining states. I think whether this effort was worth it will depend on how much that advantage stretches out as we go into Florida, as we go into Indiana. As it stands right now, I think it's mostly a wash and ends up being a lot of money and a lot of heartburn over very little structural advantage. I think at the end of the day, we look back at those election results in November, that special election in Tennessee. You're not going to be able to draw your way into a majority position. You need to improve your standing. The president needs to be a little bit more popular. You need to get the mood of the country a little bit better around this economy. They have a year to do that.RASCOE: Well, I have to ask you, though, because the president is saying that affordability is a Democrat con job. How is that? You know, what are the Republicans who are running for office next year - how are they feeling about those sorts of comments?DONOVAN: I can tell you, I don't think that'll end up in the ads that Republicans are running. I think that's - you know, the president is, you know, frustrated by the turnabout that we just talked about. But I think Republicans will have to run their races. They'll have to tout the things that I mentioned - the things that they've done well in Congress and the things that really will help or help Americans in their pocketbook, particularly as we head into tax season.RASCOE: I need to preface this one with an acknowledgment that you've worked closely with Texas Senator John Cornyn, who's up for reelection next year. There are three Republicans running in the primary, which is just over 12 weeks away. The polls are very tight between Cornyn and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Does that mean that Cornyn is out of step with Texas Republicans?DONOVAN: No. I think this is just a continuation of what the Republican Party has gone through the last 10 or 15 years. I think the primary will play itself out, but I think the best thing that Republicans have going for them is the potential for an interesting primary on the Democratic side. As Jasmine Crockett comes in, I think every Republican in Texas and around the country will welcome that addition to the race. And I think this will stay Republican in the end, no matter what, and it'll just be a distraction, I think, in the meantime.RASCOE: That's Republican strategist Liam Donovan. Thank you so much for joining us this morning.DONOVAN: Thanks for having me.(SOUNDBITE OF THE BYRDS' \"ALL I HAVE ARE MEMORIES (INSTRUMENTAL)\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts here in Washington. President Trump says he's hosting and emceeing the event himself, in yet another departure from tradition. But it puts the president in a familiar position as a showman and has the promise to be a pleasant diversion for Trump from some unwelcome political realities waiting for him offstage. And that's where we'll start with NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Good morning, Mara.MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Ayesha.RASCOE: So January 6 has dogged the president since the attack on the Capitol in 2021. Now one of the major mysteries of that day has the potential, if proven, to be another drag on him. I'm talking about those pipe bombs found near the Democratic and Republican Party headquarters.LIASSON: That's right. For years in the MAGA world, the pipe bomber, alleged pipe bomber, was described as an antifa plant or some kind of an inside job. It turns out that the suspect, from what we know - the alleged pipe bomber is a Trump supporter. And we also know that Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino, before he came into the administration, trafficked in those conspiracy theories, claiming that the pipe bomb episode was an inside job. But now the facts seem completely at odds with what he used to say. And here's what Bongino told Sean Hannity on Fox to explain this.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DAN BONGINO: I was paid in the past, Sean, for my opinions. That's clear. And one day, I'll be back in that space, but that's not what I'm paid for now.LIASSON: In other words, back then, when Bongino said he had no doubt that the placement of the pipe bombs was a setup, he says, now, quote, \"I'm paid to be your deputy FBI director, and we base investigations on facts.\" In other words, before, the facts didn't matter. Now he's paid to pay attention to reality, and that is a startling reversal.RASCOE: The facts of January 6 - many of them adjudicated by courts, many of them admitted to under oath by their perpetrators - they never have seemed to matter to the president. His blanket pardon, issued on January 20 of this year, requires the Justice Department to, and I quote here, \"pursue dismissal with prejudice to the government of all pending indictments against individuals for their conduct related to the events at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021,\" unquote. Would that include the case against Brian Cole Jr., the man who is - has been arrested for these pipe bombs?LIASSON: It certainly sounds like it could. We know from reporting that Brian Cole has told law enforcement officials that he believed the claims put forward by Donald Trump and his supporters that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen. Those claims are false. So now does it mean that Trump is going to preemptively pardon him, just like he pardoned the 1,500 or so January 6 rioters? Some of them were convicted of assaulting police officers. We'll see. But we do know that the January 6 lie that Donald Trump actually won the 2020 election is so fundamental to Trump's political identity and to MAGA's core beliefs that it suggests he might get a pardon.RASCOE: Trump and House Republicans got good news from the Supreme Court about their efforts to redraw Texas congressional districts, to tilt them heavily toward GOP candidates. Does that mean the party in power, the Republicans, will defy midterm political reality?LIASSON: And political gravity - it could. There are two big forces working at cross purposes in the 2026 midterms. The first one is the fundamentals, public opinion, turned against the Republican Party. Donald Trump's approval ratings are very low. Democrats so far have either won or overperformed in every single off-year election this cycle. But the other force is structural, and that's where Republicans have a lot of advantages, especially in this midcycle partisan gerrymandering, where they will be able to carve out more Republican-leaning districts in red states than Democrats will be able to carve out Democratic-leaning districts in blue states. And if Republicans can net five, six, seven, nine, 10 extra seats, they could defend themselves against a big blue wave if there is one developing.RASCOE: That's NPR's Mara Liasson. Mara, thank you so much.LIASSON: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Lt. Col. Pascal Tigri has been appointed president of the military committee, the soldiers said.   Following its independence from France in 1960, the West African nation witnessed multiple coups, especially in the decades following its independence. Since 1991, the country has been politically stable following the two-decade rule of Marxist-Leninist Mathieu Kérékou.   There has been no official news about President Patrice Talon since gunshots were heard around the presidential residence. The signal to state television and public radio was cut off after the military announcement.   Talon had been in power since 2016 and was due to step down next April after the presidential election.   Talon's party pick, former Finance Minister Romuald Wadagni, was the favorite to win the election. Opposition candidate Renaud Agbodjo was rejected by the electoral commission on the grounds that he did not have sufficient sponsors.   In January, two associates of Talon were sentenced to 20 years in prison for an alleged 2024 coup plot.   Last month, the country's legislature extended the presidential term of office from five to seven years, keeping the term limit at two.   The coup is the latest in a string of military takeovers that have rocked West Africa. Last month, a military coup in Guinea-Bissau removed former President Umaro Embalo after a contested election in which both he and the opposition candidate declared themselves winners.\n",

The former special agents—who together have nearly 200 years of experience—once received awards for helping disrupt mass shootings, expose foreign spies and thwart cyber attacks.   But they say as elite federal law enforcement agents, they never received training on crowd control, nor did they have riot shields, gas masks, or helmets when they faced down volatile crowds in the streets of Washington, D.C., in June 2020.   \n   The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington on Monday, described the small group of FBI agents as vastly outnumbered and literally backed against the wall of the National Archives building as unrest swept the country over the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Court papers said they kneeled not to reflect a left-wing political point of view, but rather to de-escalate a situation that threatened to spin out of control.   \"Mindful of the potentially catastrophic consequences, Plaintiffs knew that a split-second misjudgment by any of them could ignite an already-charged national climate and trigger further violence and unrest,\" said the lawsuit, filed by former Justice Department prosecutor Mary Dohrmann of the Washington Litigation Group.   Accused of 'lack of impartiality'   The Justice Department inspector general reviewed the incident in 2024 and found no misconduct. But the episode went viral on social media, attracting critics who cast the kneeling as a political act. Before he returned to the White House, President Trump also posted a negative story about the matter.   \n   Soon after new FBI Director Kash Patel joined the Bureau this year, the lawsuit said he began targeting the agents involved in the episode for retaliation. Several of plaintiffs were yanked from supervisory roles at the FBI. Officials launched a new investigation. The matter was still pending when they were all fired in September, shortcutting typical procedures for FBI misconduct probes.   In their dismissal letters, Patel wrote: \"You have demonstrated unprofessional conduct and a lack of impartiality in carrying out duties, leading to the political weaponization of government.\"   \n   During his confirmation hearing, Patel told senators he would honor the internal review process. But the lawsuit accuses him of breaking that pledge for his own political purposes.   \n   The abrupt departure of the fired agents disrupted important work, including evidence collection in Utah following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and efforts to support the Trump administration's executive order on \"Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful,\" court papers said.   The case alleges violations of the agents' First Amendment rights to free association and their Fifth Amendment right to due process. They're asking to be reinstated to their jobs and for back pay.   The FBI declined to comment on pending litigation.\n",

The suit, filed on Monday in federal court in Washington, asks a judge to declare that the administration violated the First Amendment when it threatened to criminally prosecute the app's developer and pressured Apple to make the app unavailable for download, which the tech company did in October.   \n   Following Apple ejecting ICEBlock, Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement that \"we reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store — and Apple did so.\"   Lawyer Noam Biale, who filed the suit against the administration, said Bondi's remarks show the government illegally pressuring a private company to suppress free speech.   \"We view that as an admission that she engaged in coercion in her official role as a government official to get Apple to remove this app,\" Biale said in an interview with NPR.   The Justice Department did not return a request for comment, but Trump administration officials have said the app puts the lives of ICE agents in danger.   When reached for comment, Apple also did not respond. The lawsuit, which does not name Apple, says the tech giant bowed in the face of political pressure.   \"For what appears to be the first time in Apple's nearly fifty-year history, Apple removed a U.S.-based app in response to the U.S. government's demands,\" according to the suit.   Developer calls immigration crackdown 'abhorrent'   Joshua Aaron, the Austin, Texas-based developer of ICEBlock, said he launched the app as a way to empower those opposed to Trump's immigration crackdown.   \n   \"It was just the best idea I had to do everything I could to fight back against what was going on,\" Aaron said in an interview, describing Trump's immigration enforcement blitz as \"abhorrent.\"   The app allows people to report an ICE agent sighting within a 5 mile radius, similar to how map apps, like Waze and Google and Apple Maps and others, alert drivers to police setting up speed traps. The ICE sighting alerts do not include photographs or videos and expire in four hours.   \n   Yet the Trump administration has portrayed the app as being used to incite violence against ICE agents, something Aaron denies. An analysis of federal court records does not back up the administration's claim that violence against ICE agents has spiked.    Aaron's lawsuit says Bondi is mischaracterizing the purpose of the app.   \"Fundamentally, ICEBlock neither enables nor encourages confrontation — it simply delivers time-limited location information to help users stay aware of their surroundings in a responsible and nonviolent way,\" according to the lawsuit.   Attorney General Bondi, in a July interview with Fox News, suggested Aaron was under investigation and had committed a crime. \"We are looking at it, we are looking at him, and he better watch out, because that's not protected speech,\" Bondi said.   To legal experts, ICEBlock is latest \"jawboning\" example   To First Amendment advocates, the White House's pressure campaign targeting ICEBlock is the latest example of what's known as \"jawboning,\" when government officials wield state power to suppress speech. The Cato Institute calls the practice \"censorship by proxy.\"   ABC's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel after FCC Chair Brendan Carr threatened regulatory action and Bondi promising a crackdown on hate speech following the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk are two other prominent instances.   \"The use of a high-level government threat to force a private platform to suppress speech fundamentally undermines the public's right to access information about government activities,\" said Spence Purnell, a resident senior fellow at R Street, a center-right think tank. \"If high-level officials can successfully silence political opposition, it sets a dangerous precedent for the future of free expression in this country.\"   \n   Genevieve Lakier, a First Amendment scholar at the University of Chicago Law School, said the White House's campaign against ICEBlock shows the administration using what has become a familiar playbook: \"To use threats of adverse legal and financial consequences, sometimes vague sometimes not so vague, to pressure universities, media companies, law firms, you name it, into not speaking in the ways they like,\" she said.   One potential weak spot for the lawsuit, however, is a lack of direct evidence that Attorney General Bondi, or other administration officials, made threats against Apple to have the app removed, rather than merely convinced the tech company to do so.    \n   \"And government officials do not violate the First Amendment when they persuade private speech platforms to suppress speech because that speech poses a national security risk or is harmful in some other way,\" Lakier said. \"They only violate the First Amendment when they coerce or attempt to coerce the private platform to suppress the speech.\"   Since Apple kicked ICEBlock out of its app store, it cannot be downloaded now, but those who had it on their phones before the ban can still use it. Being removed from the app store prevents Aaron from sending the app software updates, which could eventually make it glitchy.   Aaron said he hopes the suit will lead to ICEBlock being restored to the iPhone app stores and for a clear message to be sent to the Trump administration that prosecuting him for his role in developing the app would be illegal.   Aaron said he and his legal team \"have been preparing for this fight,\" adding that \"we will take it as far as it needs to go to ensure this never happens again.\"\n",

    "body": "\n       Loading... \n   After the Supreme Court's conservative majority ruled in favor of Texas lawmakers last week, Republicans head into the 2026 election year with an edge in the redistricting fight kicked off by President Trump.   The court Thursday allowed Republicans' new congressional map to move ahead — despite a lower court finding that the Texas legislature had likely conducted a racial gerrymander.   The map could yield five more seats for the GOP.   It is the latest major turn in the nationwide redistricting race, from California to Florida, that Trump started to help maintain Republican control of the House of Representatives.   If Democrats take control of the chamber, they could stymie the president's legislative agenda and launch investigations of his administration.   The House is currently closely divided, with 220 seats held by Republicans and 213 held by Democrats. The sitting president's party tends to lose seats in midterm elections.   At this point, it appears the redistricting battle could tilt about 12 or 14 seats toward Republicans and Democrats could counter with around nine seats pushed their way — but that all depends on the outcome of pending court challenges and state legislative votes. So a lot is still in play.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Democratic state Rep. Matt Pierce speaks against redistricting in the Indiana House last week.\n                \n                    Ben Thorp/WFYI\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Ben Thorp/WFYI\n    \n\n   \n   This week, Indiana lawmakers are meeting on redistricting. And in Missouri, petitioners face a deadline on signature collections that could block the redistricting until a public vote is held.   \n   It won't be clear if this all makes the difference in the House until votes are counted in the election on Nov. 3, 2026.   Trump started the race in Texas, California countered   States usually redistrict early in the decade after the decennial census determines how many seats each state gets based on their population. While states used to redistrict frequently in the 1800s and early 1900s, Trump's push has set off a redistricting race not seen since the 1960s.   Last week's Texas ruling followed a drama that played out this summer after Trump called on the state to tilt five seats toward the GOP. Democrats walked out for over two weeks to delay the passage of maps they said diluted the voting power of Black and Latino communities.   \n   Democrats in California countered Texas by approving, with a special election, a map that could flip five seats held by Republicans there.   Republicans in Missouri and North Carolina voted to target a Democratic-held seat in each of those states. On Friday, the Indiana state House passed a new map that could help the GOP win two Hoosier seats. It goes to the Senate next, where Republicans are divided on the issue.   Some Indiana Republicans have been hesitant to follow Trump's call, though he and Republican Gov. Mike Braun threatened to support primary challenges against those who don't get on board. Several lawmakers have also faced anonymous threats to their families over the last few weeks.   \n   It's easier for Republicans to redistrict than Democrats   Republicans have more options for redistricting than Democrats. For starters, redistricting is done by state legislatures and Republicans control more legislatures around the country than Democrats. Also, some of the states that Democrats control have legal barriers to partisan gerrymandering — that is, drawing lines to benefit a party — or they have laws requiring that special commissions draw the lines.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Republican Gov. Mike Braun (in glasses, center left) and Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith in the Indiana Capitol attend a pro-redistricting rally last week that was organized by Turning Point Action.\n                \n                    Zach Bundy/WFYI\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Zach Bundy/WFYI\n    \n\n   \n   Virginia's Democratic-led legislature has voted to hold a special election that could amend the state constitution to allow redistricting. Another vote is required in January to hold the election in time. If it passes, the redistricting could tilt two or three seats toward Democrats.   The Democratic governor of Maryland has formed a commission to make redistricting recommendations. But that state already only has one Republican-held House seat to target.   Meanwhile, Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis is urging Republicans in control of the legislature to redistrict this spring and turn as many as five seats toward their party. A Florida House committee held its first meeting on redistricting last week.   \n   But Florida has laws against partisan gerrymandering and could be limited by bans on racial gerrymandering in the federal Voting Rights Act. On the other hand, the Supreme Court is currently considering the VRA and could weaken it, allowing more redistricting that would likely work in the Republicans' favor.   The VRA outlaws intentional attempts to weaken the voting power of minority communities by \"cracking\" them apart into new districts or \"packing\" them into one district.\n",

Bill Cassidy, R-La., speaks during a hearing in Washington, DC. Cassidy has proposed sending government funds to Americans' health savings accounts instead of subsidizing insurance premiums for those on ACA plans.\n                \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Sarah Monroe once had a relatively comfortable middle-class life.   She and her family lived in a neatly landscaped neighborhood near Cleveland. They had a six-figure income and health insurance through her job. Then, four years ago, when Monroe was pregnant with twin girls, something started to feel off.   \"I kept having to come into the emergency room for fainting and other symptoms,\" recalled Monroe, 43, who works for an insurance company.   The babies were fine. But after months of tests and hospital trips, Monroe was diagnosed with a potentially dangerous heart condition.   It would be costly. Within a year, as she juggled a serious illness and a pair of newborns, Monroe was buried under more than $13,000 in medical debt.   \n   Part of the reason: Like tens of millions of Americans, she had a high-deductible health plan. People with these plans typically pay thousands of dollars out of their own pockets before coverage kicks in.   The plans, which have become common over the past two decades, are getting renewed attention thanks to President Donald Trump and his GOP allies in Congress.   Many Republicans are reluctant to extend government subsidies that help cover patients' medical bills and insurance premiums through the Affordable Care Act.   And although GOP leaders have yet to coalesce around an alternative, several leading Republican lawmakers have proposed Americans who don't get insurance through an employer should get cash in a special health care account, paired with a high-deductible health plan.    In such an arrangement, someone could choose a plan on an ACA marketplace that costs less per month but comes with an annual deductible that can top $7,000 for an individual plan.   \"A patient makes the decision,\" Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said at a recent hearing. \"It empowers the patient to lower the cost.\"   In a post on Truth Social last month, Trump said: \"The only healthcare I will support or approve is sending the money directly back to the people.\"   \n   \"Skin in the game\"   Conservative economists and GOP lawmakers have been making similar arguments since high-deductible health plans started to catch on two decades ago.   Back then, a backlash against the limitations of HMOs, or health maintenance organizations, propelled many employers to move workers into these plans, which were supposed to empower patients and control costs. A change in tax law allowed patients in these plans to put away money in tax-free health savings accounts to cover medical bills.   \"The notion was that if a consumer has 'skin in the game,' they will be more likely to seek higher-quality, lower-cost care,\" said Shawn Gremminger, who leads the National Alliance of Healthcare Purchaser Coalitions, a nonprofit that works with employers that offer their workers health benefits.   \"The unfortunate reality is that largely has not been the case,\" Gremminger said.   Today, nearly all health plans comes with a deductible, with the average for a single worker with job-based coverage approaching $1,700, up from around $300 in 2006.   Plans with deductibles that exceed $1,650 can be paired with a tax-free health savings account.   But even as deductibles became widespread over the last 20 years, medical prices in the U.S. skyrocketed. The average price of a knee replacement, for example, increased 74% from 2003 to 2016, more than double the rate of overall inflation.   At the same time, patients have been left with thousands of dollars of medical bills they can't pay, despite having health insurance.   About 100 million people in the U.S. have some form of health care debt, a 2022 survey showed.   Most, like Monroe, are insured.   Medical price shopping isn't easy   Although Monroe had a health savings account paired with her high-deductible plan, she was never able to save more than a few thousand dollars, she said. That wasn't nearly enough to cover the big bills when her twins were born and when she got really ill.   \n   \"It's impossible, I will tell you, impossible to pay medical bills,\" she said.   There was another problem with her high-deductible plan. Although these plans are supposed to encourage patients to shop around for medical care to find the lowest prices, Monroe found this impractical when she had a complex pregnancy and heart troubles.   Instead, Monroe chose the largest health system in her area.   \"I went with that one as far as medical risk,\" she said. \"If anything were to happen, I could then be transferred within that system.\"   Federal rules that require hospitals to post more of their prices can make comparing institutions easier than it used to be.   But unlike a car or a computer, most medical services remain difficult to shop for, in part because they stem from an emergency or are complex and can stretch over numerous years.   Researchers at the nonprofit Health Care Cost Institute, for example, estimated that just 7% of total health care spending for Americans with job-based coverage was for services that realistically could be shopped for.   Fumiko Chino, an oncologist at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said it makes no sense to expect patients with cancer or another chronic disease to go out and compare prices for complicated medical care such as surgeries, radiation, or chemotherapy after they've been diagnosed with a potentially deadly illness.   \"You're not going be able to actually do that effectively,\" Chino said, \"and certainly not within the time frame that you would need to when facing a cancer diagnosis and the imminent need to start treatment.\"   Drowning in bills   Chino said patients with high deductibles are often instead slammed with a flood of huge medical bills that lead to debt and a cascade of other problems.   She and other researchers found in a study of more than 8,000 cancer patients presented last year at the American Society of Clinical Oncology that cancer patients who had high-deductible health insurance were more likely to die than similar patients without that kind of coverage.   \n   For her part, Monroe and her family were forced to move out of their house and into a 1,100-square-foot apartment.   She drained her savings. Her credit score sank. And her car was repossessed.   There have been other sacrifices, too. \"When families get to have nice Christmases or get to go on spring break,\" Monroe said, hers often does not.   She is thankful that her children are healthy. And she continues to have a job. But Monroe said she can't imagine why anyone would want to double down on the high-deductible model for health care.   \"We owe it to ourselves to do it a different way,\" she said. \"We can't treat people like this.\"   KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF.\n",

At issue is whether President Trump can fire Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, whom Trump appointed in 2018, during his first term, to fill a Democratic seat on the Federal Trade Commission. President Biden appointed Slaughter to a second term, which was supposed to end in 2029.   The court's conservatives pressed Slaughter's attorney, Amit Agrawal, on Humphrey's Executor, the 1935 precedent, and its relevance today. Chief Justice John Roberts said the precedent had \"nothing to do with what the FTC looks like today.\" He said the FTC of that era \"had very little, if any executive power,\" suggesting the agency had far greater power today.   \n   Liberal justices pushed back against the Trump administration's argument that the executive possesses the authority to fire officials at will.   \"You're asking us to destroy the structure of government and to take away from Congress its ability to protect its idea that the government is better structured with some agencies that are independent,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor told Solicitor General D. John Sauer, the government's lawyer.    The court's conservatives were friendlier to Sauer. Justice Samuel Alito asked Sauer to address Sotomayor's assertion: \"You want to take a moment to address that?\" he asked.   \"The sky will not fall,\" Sauer replied. \"The entire government will move toward accountability to the people.\"   Slaughter's removal   In March, Slaughter received an email from the White House Office of Presidential Personnel informing her that she was being removed from office, effective immediately. She was told her \"continued service on the FTC is inconsistent with [the Trump] Administration's priorities.\"   \n   Congress created the FTC in 1914 as a bipartisan, independent agency tasked with protecting the American economy from unfair methods of competition. By law, the five-member commission can have no more than three members of the same political party, and commissioners can only be fired for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.\"   Slaughter had been given no such reason for her removal, and so she sued. A lower court declared that Slaughter had been unlawfully removed from the FTC and ordered her back to work. The Trump administration appealed that ruling, and in September, the Supreme Court issued an emergency order removing her from her seat until the merits of her case could be heard. Justices voted 6 to 3 along ideological lines to allow her firing to stand -- for now.   \n   Reconsidering a 90-year-old precedent   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Franklin D. Roosevelt during a radio broadcast circa 1933–40.\n                \n                    Harris & Ewing/Library of Congress\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Harris & Ewing/Library of Congress\n    \n\n   \n   Proving that history does repeat itself, in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt attempted to fire an FTC commissioner over ideological disagreements. In that case, called Humphrey's Executor, the court unanimously held that while the president has the power to remove purely executive officers for any reason, that unlimited power does not extend to agencies like the FTC, whose duties \"are neither political nor executive, but predominantly quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative.\"   Following that 1935 decision, Congress went on to create many more multimember, independent agencies whose members likewise can only be removed for cause. Since January, Trump has also removed Democratic members from some of those agencies, including the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission.   In Slaughter's case and others, the Trump administration argues that the Supreme Court's decision in Humphrey's Executor was flawed, due to a misunderstanding of the FTC's functions at the time. The administration maintains that the FTC did in fact exercise executive power then and says those powers have only grown in the decades since.   During Trump's first term, the Supreme Court chipped away at Humphrey's Executor when it permitted Trump to fire the head of another independent agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In that case, the Supreme Court held that the firing was permissible because the CFPB is run by a single director rather than a multimember board. Chief Justice John Roberts described Humphrey's Executor as applying to multimember agencies \"that do not wield substantial executive power.\"   \n   On Friday, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling in line with that guidance. In a 2-to-1 decision, the court said Trump's firings of Merit Systems Protection Board member Cathy Harris and National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox were lawful, citing those agencies' \"significant executive powers.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump attends a press event at the White House on Dec. 2.\n                \n                    Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   A clash of views on independent agencies   Slaughter believes that it is vital for the Supreme Court to preserve the independence of bipartisan multimember agencies and allow her to be reinstated.   \n   \"Independence allows the decision-making that is done by these boards and commissions to be on the merits, about the facts, and about protecting the interests of the American people,\" she said. \"That is what Americans deserve from their government.\"   James M. Burnham, an attorney who has served in both Trump administrations, offered an opposing view.   \"I don't think there is such a thing as an independent agency because everything has to be in one of the three branches of government,\" he argued. \"I don't think they've ever been independent because I think the removal protections have been unconstitutional from the beginning.\"   The court will continue its deliberation on Humphrey's Executor on Jan. 21 when it considers another case involving Trump's attempted firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook.\n",

Not just from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, but also French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who are traveling to London in what's being billed as yet another show of support from Ukraine's united European allies, or, as Starmer has called them — \"a coalition of the willing.\"   But even as Europe rallies around him, Zelenskyy's ongoing struggle to secure firmer commitments from the Trump administration could mean Kyiv is heading into its toughest battle yet: navigating a grueling, nearly four-year-old war while its most powerful ally wavers — and as Russia shows no sign of softening its demands.   \n   Last month, the Trump administration introduced a 28-point peace plan seen as favored toward Russia that caught European officials off guard.   \n   The initial proposal offered limited security guarantees and called on Ukraine to hand over territory to Russia, something Zelenskyy has repeatedly ruled out. It also called on Ukraine to reduce the size of its army and block its path to NATO membership.   Since then, Ukraine has introduced modifications to the agreement.   On Saturday, Zelenskyy said he had a \"very substantive and constructive\" call with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner during fresh peace deal talks in Miami. But the talks ended with little breakthrough.   Perhaps even more telling, Russia simultaneously launched a fresh wave of drone and missile strikes over Ukraine this weekend, a reminder that Moscow appears increasingly emboldened on the battlefield even as diplomatic channels stall.   On Sunday, Donald Trump Jr. made headlines at a conference in Doha, Qatar, after he suggested his father — who famously said during his reelection campaign that he could end the war in 24 hours — could be preparing to walk away if Ukraine doesn't make a quick deal with Russia.   But there are a number of reasons why Ukraine — and Europe — say they aren't ready to sign a deal.   \n   Here's what to know as European leaders meet for fresh talks on Monday.   Europe wants to show unity — but can it drive a peace deal on its own?   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                French President Emmanuel Macron (R) welcomes his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, prior to their meeting at the Elysee palace in Paris on Dec. 1.\n                \n                    Stephane de Sakutin/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Stephane de Sakutin/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   European leaders are arriving in London determined to show that they're still firmly behind Ukraine's push for a peace plan that preserves its territory — a message Zelenskyy has been reinforcing across the continent. His stop in London follows a quick tour through Paris and his first official state visit to Ireland last week, where he pressed for continued support and fresh security commitments.   European officials have increasingly framed Ukraine's safety as being tied to the continent's own stability. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said last month that any peace must uphold Ukraine's territorial integrity and its ability to defend itself.   \n   Macron condemned Russia's latest attacks over the weekend as \"escalatory.\" He also said Europe must keep working \"with the Americans\" to secure the guarantees Ukraine needs for lasting peace.   But on Thursday, the German magazine Der Spiegel reported that Macron had privately warned Zelenskyy that \"there is a chance that the U.S. will betray Ukraine on territory, without clarity on security guarantees,\" citing a leaked note from a recent call he had with several European leaders. NPR has not independently verified this reporting.   There are additional fears that such a move from Washington wouldn't end with Ukraine. On Friday, the Trump administration announced a new national security strategy signaling that it would no longer be providing Europe with the security guarantees it has had since the end of World War II. The plan took multiple jabs at Europe and suggested the continent was facing the \"prospect of civilizational erasure,\" because of immigration from non-European countries.   The plan raised doubts about how much not just Ukraine, but the continent as a whole, can rely on the U.S. for support going forward.   \n   All this helps explain why European officials are floating ways to step up support for Ukraine — from scaling up weapons production to deepening Ukraine's ties to the EU and exploring whether frozen Russian assets could be used to bolster Ukraine's defense and reconstruction. The last option has faced resistance — especially from Belgium — home to the EU's largest concentration of frozen Russian funds, totaling around 210 billion euros ($245 billion) across Europe.   Russia doubles down on its demands while escalating attacks   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                In this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Russian President Vladimir Putin, accompanied by Kremlin economic envoy Kirill Dmitriev and Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov, meets with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner at the Kremlin in Moscow on Dec. 2.\n                \n                    Alexander Kazakov/Pool/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alexander Kazakov/Pool/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   As talks for a peace deal continue, Russia is showing no signs of easing its positions. Moscow has doubled down on demands Ukrainian officials say are non-starters, including recognition of occupied territories and long-term limits on Ukraine's security partnerships.   The Kremlin has reinforced that stance on the ground with multiple strikes over the last few weeks. Over the weekend, Moscow launched hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles at Ukraine's energy grid and other infrastructure, wounding at least eight people and causing temporary power outages across several regions. The timing, which coincided with the stalled U.S.-Ukraine talks in Miami, was seen by EU officials as a reminder of Russia's willingness to escalate even as its adversaries pursue diplomacy.   Signs the U.S. could step back if Ukraine won't cut a deal   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Shop owners survey the damage to their business hit by a drone strike on Nov. 29 in Kyiv, Ukraine.\n                \n                    Diego Fedele/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Diego Fedele/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   One of the biggest worries for Ukraine right now is what the U.S. is planning to do next.   The Trump administration has been sending mixed signals, but Ukraine and European leaders fear that the White House wants Ukraine to start moving toward a deal with Russia — even if it means making concessions that threaten its long-term stability.   Over the weekend, Donald Trump Jr. turned heads at a festival in Doha when he told an audience that his father may be ready to move on from Ukraine if the country doesn't accept a deal soon.   \n   Trump Jr., who has no official role in the White House, also took shots at Zelenskyy, who has been facing scrutiny at home because of a corruption scandal involving some of his top aides. Zelenskyy himself has not been accused.   \"Because of the war, and because he's one of the great marketers of all times, Zelenskyy became a borderline deity, especially to the left where he could do no wrong, he was beyond reproach,\" Trump Jr. said.   Asked if his father could walk away from Ukraine, he said \"I think he may,\" referencing Trump's unpredictability.   \"The fact that he's not predictable … forces everyone to actually deal in an intellectually and honest capacity,\" Trump Jr. said.\n",

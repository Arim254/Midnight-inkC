During an interview with YouTuber Brian Tyler Cohen, Obama said many Americans \"find this behavior deeply troubling.\"   \"There doesn't seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office,\" Obama said in the interview, which was posted on YouTube Saturday.   \n   \"There's this sort of clown show that's happening in social media and on television,\" Obama added, describing much of the noise around Trump's presidency as a \"distraction\".   Obama's response follows outrage over the video, which depicted Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the clip, saying \"please stop the fake outrage.\" Trump refused to apologize for the social media post, telling reporters \"I didn't make a mistake\" aboard Air Force One.   The video, which was posted at the beginning of Black History Month, has since been deleted. The White House blamed a staffer for \"erroneously\" posting the video clip.   Obama also shared his thoughts on the immigration crackdown and protests in Minnesota and elsewhere around the country, telling Cohen they have left a good number of American people saying \"we're going to live up to those values that we say we believe in.\"   \"It is important for us to recognize the unprecedented nature of what ICE was doing in Minneapolis, St. Paul, the way that federal agents, ICE agents were being deployed, without any clear guidelines, training, pulling people out of their homes, using five-year-olds to try to bait their parents, all the stuff that we saw, teargassing crowds simply who were standing there, not breaking any laws,\" the 44th president said.   \n   Obama called the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis last month \"a heartbreaking tragedy\" and said it was \"a wake-up call to every American, regardless of party, that many of our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault.\"    He also said that the Trump administration has given explanations for the deaths of Pretti and Renee Good, a 37-year-old woman killed by an immigration agent, \"that aren't informed by any serious investigation.\"\n",

In his speech at the Munich Security Conference, Rubio stressed to allies its shared history with America, calling the U.S. a \"child of Europe.\" He also reinforced the Trump administration's rhetoric suggesting that Europe faces the prospect of \"civilizational erasure\" amid its immigration policies.   \"We gather as members of a historic alliance that saved and changed the world,\" Rubio told attendees.   \n   \"America was founded 250 years ago, but the roots began here on this continent long before. The men who settled and built the nation of my birth arrived on our shores carrying the memories and the traditions and the Christian faith of their ancestors as a sacred inheritance.\"   Rubio described Europe as having grown complacent in the years since the fall of the Soviet Union, having allowed their military budgets to shrink, their jobs to be outsourced and immigration to threaten the \"cohesion\" of society, he said.   \"We made these mistakes together. And now, together, we owe it to our people to face those facts and to move forward to rebuild,\" Rubio said.   Overall, his speech was marked by a softer tone toward Europe than Trump has taken in recent months, with Trump criticizing them as \"weak\" and home to a \"decaying\" group of nations, as well as those made by his predecessor at last year's conference. Vice President JD Vance, who pilloried European leaders for their efforts to combat hate speech and disinformation and for censoring right-wing views.   \n   The secretary of state also downplayed concerns over the effects of climate change, even as many European nations have prioritized a shift to renewable energies.   Rubio also doubled down on the administration's insistence that European allies should do more to provide for their own national security needs, rather than relying so heavily on the United States.   \"We care deeply about your future and ours. And if at times we disagree, our disagreements come from our profound sense of concern about a Europe with which we are connected, not just economically, not just militarily. We are connected spiritually and we are connected culturally.\"   \n   \"Under President Trump,\" Rubio said, \"the United States of America will once again take on the task of renewal and restoration, driven by a vision of a future as proud, as sovereign, and as vital as our civilization's past. And while we are prepared, if necessary, to do this alone, it is our preference, and it is our hope to do this together with you, our friends here in Europe. For the United States and Europe, we belong together.\"   European leaders react   Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Union's executive commission, said during a panel at the conference that she was \"very much reassured\" by Rubio's speech.   \"We know that in the administration, some have a harsher tone on these topics,\" she said. \"But the secretary of state was very clear: He said, 'We want a strong Europe in the Alliance,' and this is what we are working for intensively in the European Union.\"   British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that he agreed with Rubio in the sense that \"we shouldn't get in the warm bath of complacency.\"   Starmer said that, post-Brexit, the U.K. should restrengthen ties with Europe to help the continent become more self-reliant in its defense, so that it can move \"from overdependence to interdependence.\"\n",

European royals, government officials, politicians and others are losing jobs and titles over their connection to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. European law enforcement agencies are opening investigations based on recent troves of documents released by the U.S. government.   Prominent Americans with apparent ties to Jeffrey Epstein — including President Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick— have so far largely kept their positions of power.   Epstein also associated with Democratic politicians and academics, including former President Bill Clinton.   \n   While appearing in the Epstein files is not necessarily proof of wrongdoing, for Europeans, it's been \"very humiliating\" to see their \"rich and famous hobnobbing\" with Epstein, \"a fake American billionaire\" and convicted sex trafficker of minors, said Richard Painter, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School who served as the chief ethics lawyer to President George W. Bush.   But in the U.S., Painter says, the connection between money and politics can shield some of those named in the files. \"You've got all this massive amount of money in politics. So the billionaire class is definitely going to want to be protected,\" he said.   Neither the White House nor the Department of Commerce have responded to a request for comment.   In the United Kingdom, former Prince Andrew was stripped of his royal titles and forced to move out of the royal estate. That was over claims that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, as he is now known, had sex with teenage girls — which he has denied — during his visits with Epstein.   Now, with the latest release of files, the former prince faces an investigation by British police over claims he shared confidential trade information with Epstein in 2010. King Charles III, Mountbatten-Windsor's brother, is \"ready to support\" investigators, Buckingham Palace said in a statement sent to news outlets this week.   \n   Others in the U.K. have faced consequences, not for allegations of sexual misconduct, but for being too friendly with Epstein. Peter Mandelson, a prominent Labour Party figure and Britain's ambassador to the U.S., was stripped of his position in September and resigned from the House of Lords earlier this month. He now faces a criminal investigation after new files suggest he received payments from Epstein and shared government documents.   For a while, Prime Minister Keir Starmer faced calls to step down over his continued support for Mandelson. Starmer, earlier this month, apologized to Epstein's victims. \"None of us knew the depth and darkness of that relationship,\" he said of Mandelson's ties to Epstein.   In countries such as Britain with a parliamentary system, leaders are more vulnerable to calls to resign from political opponents or even members of their own party, Painter noted, than leaders in the United States.   \"Ultimately the Parliament, the legislature, calls the shots and then the members of the legislature are vulnerable to be voted down in the next election,\" he said. \"There's more accountability to the public.\"   Trump is somewhat insulated from political pressure   President Trump was a longtime friend of Epstein's and appears frequently in the released documents from the late financier's estate. Trump and the White House have both consistently denied any wrongdoing.   Still, because he is in his second term and is constitutionally prohibited from running for reelection, he is shielded from some accountability, according to Painter.   Lutnick, Trump's billionaire commerce secretary, previously had said he had \"very limited interactions\" with Epstein, a New York City neighbor after visiting his townhouse in 2005. But this week, at a Senate hearing, he acknowledged that he and his family traveled to Epstein's private island in 2012.   Painter also criticized Attorney General Pam Bondi for \"selectively\" releasing parts of the Epstein files, despite bipartisan legislation passed by Congress which orders a full release of the documents.   \n   In her opening remarks at a contentious House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday, Bondi said she was \"deeply sorry for what any victim\" had gone through, but she avoided apologizing directly to several of Epstein's victims in the committee room.   Painter questioned whether the administration is releasing files that only implicate Democrats while shielding Republicans. Epstein knew Trump, a neighbor in Palm Beach, but Trump says they had a falling out before Epstein's conviction for sex trafficking.   A few Americans have lost positions of power. Larry Summers, a former Treasury Secretary during the Clinton administration and chief economic adviser to President Obama, stepped away from his teaching position at Harvard.   Brad Karp resigned as chair of the prestigious law firm Paul Weiss. And Kathryn Ruemmler, top lawyer at Goldman Sachs, announced that she'll resign from her job at the end of June.   Consequences spread across Europe   France's former culture minister, Jack Lang, resigned as head of a Paris cultural center after the French Foreign Ministry sought to question him about his ties to Epstein.   Former Norwegian Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland, this week was charged with \"gross corruption\" by police there and could face up to 10 years in prison after emails showed he stayed in Epstein's homes in New York and Florida and visited Epstein's private island in the Caribbean. Also this month, Mona Juul resigned as Norway's ambassador to Jordan, after revelations that Epstein left $10 million in his will to her children.   The Epstein scandal has also hit the country's royal family. Norwegian Crown Princess Mette-Marit, the wife of Crown Prince Haakon, apologized after documents showed she vacationed in an Epstein property in Palm Beach.\n",

Lindberg, the director of Sweden's V-Dem Institute, which monitors democracy across the globe, says the U.S. has already crossed the threshold and become an \"electoral autocracy.\"   Steven Levitsky, a professor of government at Harvard University and co-author of How Democracies Die, agrees.   \"I would argue that the United States in 2025-26 has slid into a mild form of competitive authoritarianism,\" Levitsky said. \"I think it's reversible, but this is authoritarianism.\"   Under competitive authoritarianism, countries still hold elections, but the ruling party uses various tactics — attacking the press, disenfranchising voters, weaponizing the justice system and threatening critics — to tilt the electoral playing field in its favor.   \n   Levitsky cited what he considers two strikingly autocratic moments that occurred in September. First, the Trump administration threatened ABC's parent company, Disney, following Jimmy Kimmel's comments on the killing of Charlie Kirk.   \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Brendan Carr, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, warned.   A week later, President Trump proposed that U.S. generals use American cities as training grounds for their troops.   \"We're under invasion from within,\" Trump said to a gathering of military brass in Quantico, Virginia. \"No different than a foreign enemy, but more difficult in many ways because they don't wear uniforms.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Protesters throw trash and objects as they clash with federal agents and police during a \"National Shutdown\" protest against Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Los Angeles on Jan. 30, following the shooting deaths of two U.S. citizens by federal agents in Minneapolis.\n                \n                    Patrick T. Fallon/AFP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Patrick T. Fallon/AFP\n    \n\n   \n   Levitsky said this is the kind of language dictators in South America used in the 1970s — leaders like Augusto Pinochet in Chile.   A smaller number of scholars reject the portrayal of Trump as a would-be autocrat. They say he is expanding executive power to address the excesses of his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.   Jonathan Turley, a professor at George Washington University Law School, says Trump is pressuring news organizations and universities to address problems with liberal bias.   \"There are legitimate objections that have been raised by the Trump administration,\" said Turley, the author of Rage and the Republic. \"That does not justify some of the means, but there is a long-standing need for a debate within these institutions.\"   \n   Other political scientists say the U.S. system of government is battered but still democratic. Kurt Weyland, who researches democracy and authoritarianism at the University of Texas at Austin, says he's increasingly confident that the U.S. can withstand Trump's sweeping attempt to expand executive power.   Weyland said that for the first months of his second term, Trump was like a \"steamroller\" and faced little containment or opposition. But Weyland, who wrote Democracy's Resilience to Populism's Threat: Countering Global Alarmism, says that has changed.   For instance, Kimmel was yanked off the air but soon returned and continues to routinely mock Trump. Weyland also said the president's attempt to tilt the electoral playing field through mass redistricting hasn't worked out as he might have hoped.   \"If the guy had succeeded in seriously skewing [future] elections in the House, that would've gone to the core of democracy,\" said Weyland, \"but he didn't. He got barely anything.\"   Weyland also said federal agents shooting two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis last month was disastrous for the president. Border czar Tom Homan said last week that the immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota is ending. Weyland thinks the public blowback to the killings limits Trump's ability to deploy such aggressive tactics going forward.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Demonstrators spell out an SOS signal of distress on a frozen lake in Minneapolis, in the aftermath of the shooting deaths of Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents.\n                \n                    John Moore/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        John Moore/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The next big test for American democracy could come in November's midterms. The Trump administration is suing states to hand over voter data, which worries Kim Scheppele, a Princeton University sociologist who has studied the authoritarian tactics of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.   In 2014, Orbán's government messaged Hungarian voters living in the United Kingdom to go to one polling place and then switched to a different location on Election Day.   \"They disenfranchised almost all the Hungarians in the U.K., most of whom were oppositional to Orbán,\" says Scheppele.   This month, Steve Bannon, a close Trump ally, proposed that the administration deploy Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to polling places to root out undocumented migrants trying to vote — which is statistically rare.   \n   White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said she'd never heard the president discuss such a plan — and federal law prohibits it.   But Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College, worries that such a move would drive down participation by people of color and naturalized citizens who fear harassment by ICE. If ICE were deployed, Nyhan hopes it would spark even more people to vote.   \"But even contemplating that kind of interference is, I think, a really substantial threat,\" said Nyhan. \"The way Election Day works in this country, there are no do-overs.\"\n",

We'll get back to the original footprint,\" Homan said, speaking on CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday. Exceptions beyond that footprint, he said, will include agents who will remain to finish investigating allegations of fraud related to day care funds as well as the anti-ICE protest that had disrupted service at a church, where a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official is a pastor.   \n   Homan said an additional security force — described in size only as \"small\" — will stay to \"respond to when our agents are out, and they get surrounded by agitators and things got out of control.\"    \"They'll remain for a short period of time, just to make sure the coordination, the agreements we have with local state law enforcement stay in place, and they respond to a public safety threat when needed,\" Homan said, adding that he hoped that contingent of security forces \"can be removed fairly quickly.\"    \n   On Thursday, Homan announced the conclusion of the Trump administration's \"Operation Metro Surge,\" which sent thousands of immigration agents into the state. This drew extensive protests, as agents shot and killed two U.S. citizens.    On CBS on Sunday, Homan was also asked about the shutdown at the Department of Homeland Security that began this weekend after lawmakers failed to agree on agency funding as Democrats push for policy changes. Homan repeatedly said he was not a part of those negotiations, though he also took issue with some of the Democrats' demands, including calls to prohibit ICE agents from wearing masks to conceal their faces.    \"I don't like the masks either,\" Homan said, but also echoed the Republicans' argument that revealing officers' identities would would make it easier for people to dox them. \"The masks right now are for officer safety reasons.\" ICE has not shared details of violence or attacks related to exposure of agents' identities.\n",

    "body": "\n      Secretary of State Marco Rubio delivered a speech at the Munich Security Conference in Germany amid growing tensions between the U.S. and its European allies.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  Secretary of State Marco Rubio has told European allies it's time for a period of renewal as the old world order is ending.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARCO RUBIO: And while we are prepared, if necessary, to do this alone, it is our preference and it is our hope to do this together with you, our friends here in Europe. For the United States and Europe, we belong together.SIMON: He was speaking today at the Munich Security Conference, where diplomats are still reeling from last year's speech by Vice President JD Vance, who lectured Europe about free speech and migration. Secretary Rubio touched on similar themes but in a way some Europeans seem to appreciate. NPR's Michele Kelemen is in Munich. Michele, thanks so much for being with us.MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Nice to be here, Scott.SIMON: What was Secretary Rubio's main message today?KELEMEN: Well, he said that the U.S. and Europe made a lot of mistakes in recent years, focusing on what he called the climate cult and also allowing supply chains to become too dependent on rivals like China. He also spent a lot of time talking about Christian values and fears of civilizational erasure because of mass migration. Those were, you know, a big focus of Vance's speech last year, but Rubio couched it a bit differently. Take a listen.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RUBIO: So in a time of headlines, heralding the end of the trans-Atlantic era, let it be known and clear to all that this is neither our goal nor our wish because for us Americans, our home may be in the Western Hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe.(APPLAUSE)SIMON: I here a pause there, Michele. How did the speech go over?KELEMEN: Yeah. I mean, the host of the conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, said there was a sigh of relief in the room, and he said he saw this speech as a message of reassurance. But, you know, I heard California Governor Gavin Newsom telling a group of reporters yesterday that Vice President Vance set the bar so low with last year's speech. And Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who met Rubio yesterday, also talked about the world order as we know it is in the past, but he told the U.S. that the U.S. isn't strong enough to go it alone. French President Emmanuel Macron, who's also here, told the gathering that Europe needs to become a geopolitical leader and needs to really stand up to Russia's aggression in Ukraine.SIMON: You mentioned Governor Newsom. There are other Democrats there as well, aren't there?KELEMEN: Yeah. New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made her debut here, and she's blaming the Trump administration of ripping up democratic norms and turning the world into what she calls an age of authoritarians who are carving up the world.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ: Where Donald Trump can command the Western Hemisphere and Latin America as his personal sandbox, where Putin can saber-rattle around Europe and for, essentially, authoritarians to have their own geographic domains.KELEMEN: And she says she was here with other Democrats offering a different way forward.SIMON: Russia's war in Ukraine is obviously a big concern for Europe. What did Secretary Rubio say about that?KELEMEN: Yeah. I mean, Europeans are really alarmed by Russia's continued strikes on Ukraine's energy grid during this cold spell. They say Russia is trying to play for time, trying to win territory in talks with Trump's envoys that it hasn't been able to capture on the battlefield. Rubio would only say that he's not really sure if the Russians are serious about ending the war and whether there are any terms that can be negotiated that are acceptable to Ukraine. But he said the U.S. is going to continue to try, and that's been the goal.SIMON: NPR's Michele Kelemen from Munich. Thanks so much.KELEMEN: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

He struck a less aggressive tone than Vice President JD Vance did in lecturing them at the same gathering last year but maintained a firm tone on Washington's intent to reshape the trans-Atlantic alliance and push its policy priorities.   Kallas alluded to criticism in the U.S. national security strategy released in December, which asserted that economic stagnation in Europe \"is eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilizational erasure.\" It suggested that Europe is being enfeebled by its immigration policies, declining birth rates, \"censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition\" and a \"loss of national identities and self-confidence.\"   \n   \"Contrary to what some may say, woke, decadent Europe is not facing civilizational erasure,\" Kallas told the conference. \"In fact, people still want to join our club and not just fellow Europeans,\" she added, saying she was told when visiting Canada last year that many people there have an interest in joining the EU.   \n   Kallas rejected what she called \"European-bashing.\"   \"We are, you know, pushing humanity forward, trying to defend human rights and all this, which is actually bringing also prosperity for people. So that's why it's very hard for me to believe these accusations.\"   In his conference speech, Rubio said that an end to the trans-Atlantic era \"is neither our goal nor our wish,\" adding that \"our home may be in the Western hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe.\"   He made clear that the Trump administration is sticking to its guns on issues such as migration, trade and climate. And European officials who addressed the gathering made clear that they in turn will stand by their values, including their approach to free speech, climate change and free trade.   British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Saturday that Europe must defend \"the vibrant, free and diverse societies that we represent, showing that people who look different to each other can live peacefully together, that this isn't against the tenor of our times.\"   \n   \"Rather, it is what makes us strong,\" he said.   Kallas said Rubio's speech sent an important message that America and Europe are and will remain intertwined.   \"It is also clear that we don't see eye to eye on all the issues and this will remain the case as well, but I think we can work from there,\" she said.\n",

    "body": "\n      Secretary of State Marco Rubio seeks to reassure European allies and a partial government shutdown hits the Department of Homeland Security.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  NPR's senior contributor Ron Elving joins us. Ron, thanks for being with us, as always.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.SIMON: Secretary Rubio gave a major speech at the Munich Security Conference. What do you make of it?ELVING: The expectation had been that Rubio would bring a somewhat more diplomatic version of that speech by JD Vance, this conference a year ago, expressing President Trump's longtime complaint that Europeans don't bear their share of the cost of their own defense. And Rubio was much more nuanced. He said the U.S. was strong enough to go alone but that we would prefer to renew the alliance. And as we just heard from Michele Kelemen, Rubio's statement that the U.S. would always consider itself a child of Europe, that was certainly well received.SIMON: Another Saturday, another shutdown - this one partial. Funding has lapsed for the Department of Homeland Security after lawmakers failed to reach an agreement, Democrats say they won't help approve more funding until new restrictions are placed on federal immigration operations. How do you read the significance of this latest funding lapse?ELVING: It shows the two parties are as far apart as ever on ICE and immigration enforcement. Democrats were almost entirely united on this, even though many of them oppose using shutdowns as a tactic. They could not face their voters if they let Homeland Security continue without serious reforms, even though there's plenty of money on hand for ICE to continue operations, even as other parts of the Department of Homeland Security have to shut down or cut back. That's because ICE got a huge war chest from the last big funding bill - the one Trump called the One Big Beautiful Bill. This may be one reason he liked it so much.So Democrats know this won't keep ICE from operating, but they hope it will call attention to the relationship between ICE and DHS and put more heat on the administration of the overall agency.  That includes the transportation safety folks, unfortunately, at the airports. There may be flight delays or cancellations, so there will be consequences for real people. And it once again demonstrates just how far the two parties are from finding the compromises by which this government is meant to function.SIMON: And this week, Attorney General Pam Bondi testified during a House committee hearing where she defended the Justice Department's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. It got heated. Congressman Ted Lieu,  Democrat from California, asked the attorney general whether there were any underage girls at parties that Donald Trump attended with Jeffrey Epstein. And here's how she responded.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PAM BONDI: This is so ridiculous, and that they are trying to deflect from all the great things Donald Trump has done. There is no evidence that Donald Trump has committed a crime. Everyone knows that. This has been the most transparent presidency. He's the one that asked that those files...TED LIEU: I'm reclaiming my time.BONDI: ...Be released.LIEU: I got your answer. You said there's no evidence.BONDI: President Trump asked that these...LIEU: Mr. Chairman, please stop the clock. Please stop the clock.BONDI: He signed the legislation.SIMON: It went like that. Ron, what do you make of the hearing?ELVING: Oh, it got worse. Bondi and her staff brought armloads of binders with zingers to fire back at members who questioned her on the Epstein files or who asked why Bondi's department was not complying with the bipartisan legislation passed by Congress ordering them to release all the files and use redactions only to protect victims. Instead, we've seen a lot of slow walking and outright stonewalling, with some files released that do expose victims and some files released that redact the identity of Epstein's guests and clients. That seems to turn the law on its head.You have to assume that Pam Bondi had an audience of one for this appearance - President Trump. And he may well have been pleased by her performance. But Epstein is an issue that will not go away. It cuts across a lot of the usual lines, hurts the president with his own constituencies. His numbers are eroding now not only among independents, but even among Republicans, as some have genuine distress about ICE and the whole Epstein affair.SIMON: And we're seeing more Republicans willing to depart from the president, aren't we?ELVING: Yes, that's right. And it's been significant, as you would expect. A lot of it has to do with the midterm elections later this year. Six House Republicans defied their party leaders to vote for a bill blocking tariffs Trump wants to impose on Canada. So with those crossovers, the Democrats were able to pass the measure in the House. It's a clear challenge to House Speaker Mike Johnson. He has the slimmest of majorities in the House and yet the absolute necessity of constant loyalty to Trump.SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving.

    "body": "\n      President Trump seems to lose some of his grip on his base as the Department Of Homeland Security shuts down amidst resistance to changes to immigration enforcement.   \n\n    AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:  Funding for the Department of Homeland Security ran out yesterday morning, and we're now in a shutdown. If it keeps going, the shutdown could upset travel plans, immigration enforcement and disaster relief. This all happened after Democrats demanded a range of new restrictions on immigration agents, and Republicans resisted. NPR senior national political correspondent Mara Liasson is with us now to talk about that and more. Good morning, Mara.MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Ayesha.RASCOE: So even though DHS is technically in a shutdown, the work is ongoing because 90% of its employees are considered essential and have to keep working. So this whole thing, in many ways, is, like, symbolic, right? Like, it's a standoff on immigration policies.LIASSON: That's right. ICE itself has a lot of appropriated money already, so it can continue its work, but it's become very unpopular, including with some of Donald Trump's own supporters. People tell pollsters they like the idea of a secure border. They like the idea of deporting undocumented immigrants with criminal records. But they don't like watching American citizens be killed or children be detained or law enforcement going into people's homes without warrants. And Democrats have pushed back and are asking for a set of reforms that include needing a warrant or having a badge with an ID number on it. And those reforms are pretty common for police departments all over the country.RASCOE: It sounds like Trump is maybe getting a bit of pushback from his own base. Is he losing a grip on his party?LIASSON: I wouldn't go that far, but he certainly is getting pushback from a number of areas. Six Republicans in the House joined Democrats to vote against his tariffs on Canada. A number of grand juries are refusing to indict, as Trump's prosecutors have asked them to. He had to back down on the Epstein files, where when Republicans joined Democrats to vote for them to be released, he got a lot of criticism, even from Republicans, about a racist tweet that he posted. So - and his approval ratings are dropping, and it's a midterm year. So even Donald Trump is not immune from the laws of political gravity, and he is seen as a liability by some Republicans in swing districts.RASCOE: Well, speaking of the midterms, Trump says he wants to nationalize the midterms this year and change the way they're run. Here he is on the Dan Bongino podcast earlier this month.(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE DAN BONGINO SHOW\")PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The Republicans should say, we want to take over. We should take over the voting in at least many - 15 places. The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting.RASCOE: Now, I mean, constitutionally, though, that is not allowed, right? Am I wrong on that?LIASSON: That's right. I mean, Donald Trump has said they should cancel the elections. He has said we shouldn't even have elections. But the Constitution gives states the power to conduct elections. So election experts say canceling the elections would be pretty hard, but there are a lot of things they worry that he can do to undermine the voting. He's already commandeered voter rolls in a bunch of states. He, in the past, has said he wouldn't honor results of an election unless he wins. That's what January 6 was all about when he sent his supporters to the Capitol to try to decertify the election results. But he could challenge voters. He could try to disqualify them, claim that they're not U.S. citizens. So election experts are worried that Donald Trump is laying the groundwork to challenge the results of future elections.RASCOE: Well, switching gears a little bit. Some U.S. lawmakers are in Munich for the Munich Security Conference this weekend, where Europeans are making it clear that U.S. values are becoming increasingly distant from their own values, especially when it comes to NATO, which Trump has threatened to leave. But Secretary of State Marco Rubio, he struck a different tone yesterday, right?LIASSON: That's right. Unlike JD - Vice President Vance's speech at the last Munich conference, where he scolded Europeans for sidelining far-right parties and limiting free speech, Rubio had a slightly different message. He said that the U.S. and Europe belong together. He said the U.S. wants a strong Europe, even though he also criticized Europe's immigration policies. So I would say Rubio came to Munich with a different tone, if not difference in substance.RASCOE: That's NPR senior national political correspondent Mara Liasson.

Members of the Trump administration testified before Congress, as did Epstein's convicted co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell. Members of Congress are still seeking answers on the Justice Department's redactions in the files and the investigation overall. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom continues with its own reckoning.   The massive tranche of documents — including emails, photos and other documents — are materials collected during the Justice Department's investigation into Epstein and Maxwell. Many of the documents include unverified claims and little if any context. Congress passed a law mandating their release, and lawmakers are now combing through them seeking further accountability for the victims.    \n   Here is a round of up of the top political news related to the Epstein files this week:   Maxwell testimony    Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20-years in prison for a child sex trafficking scheme with Epstein, appeared by video for a deposition in front of the House Oversight Committee on Monday. Republicans and Democrats sought answers to a myriad of questions, including who were the other co-conspirators involved in the sex trafficking ring and which men sexually abused girls.   \n   But lawmakers weren't able to get much of anything out of Maxwell. She refused to testify and invoked her Fifth Amendment right to remain silent to avoid self-incrimination. Instead, her lawyer, David Oscar Markus, read a prepared statement to the committee. Maxwell, he said, is \"prepared to speak fully and honestly\" but only if granted clemency by President Trump.   \"Only she can provide a complete account. And some may not like what they hear, but the truth matters. For example, both President Trump and President Clinton are innocent of any wrongdoing. Ms. Maxwell alone can explain why, and the public is entitled to hear that explanation,\" Markus said.   When asked during a press briefing on Tuesday if Trump would consider pardoning Maxwell, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it's not something she has discussed with the president recently because \"frankly, it is not a priority.\"   \n   \"Last time we did speak about it, he said it's not something he's considering or thinking about,\" she told reporters.   \n   After the hearing, committee chair James Comer, R-Ky., said he was disappointed in Maxwell's lack of testimony but that the committee's investigation will continue.   \"I personally don't think she should be granted any type of immunity or clemency,\" he said of Maxwell.   Six names uncovered    The two lawmakers that spearheaded The Epstein Files Transparency Act, the law that forced the public release of the documents related to the investigation and death of Epstein, are still arguing that the Department of Justice isn't abiding by the law. Among their top concerns is how the DOJ has handled redactions in the documents, including redacting names that they say should have been made public under the law and in other instances exposing the names of victims.   Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky., reviewed an unredacted version of the files on Monday at the Justice Department, which is available to lawmakers for the first time. After searching the files, Khanna and Massie said they uncovered the names of six men in the files that were wrongly redacted. The lawmakers accused the DOJ of covering up the identities of the men and scrubbing the files ahead of the release.    \n   Khanna said on the House floor that 70% to 80% of the files are still redacted and announced the redacted names. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said on X that the move \"forced the unmasking\" of people \"who have NOTHING to do with Epstein or Maxwell.\" He added that four of the six appeared in just one document.   \"The two other men — Les Wexner and Sultan bin Sulayem — were unredacted in the one document, and are referenced in the files nearly two hundred times and over 4,700 times respectively,\" Blanche said.   \n   On Friday, Dubai Ports World announced Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem resigned from the company effective immediately.   During a tele-townhall with Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul on Tuesday, Massie said Wexner, a billionaire businessman, should be forced to answer questions about his relationship with Epstein.   In January, House Oversight ranking member Robert Garcia, D-Calif., announced a subpoena for Wexner to testify. Wexner is set to be deposed by lawmakers in Ohio, where he lives, on Feb. 18. A spokesperson for Wexner told NPR member station WOSU that Wexner fully cooperated with federal investigators by providing background information on Epstein and was not contacted again.   Lutnick and Bondi testify and lawmaker surveillance    Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, whose name also appears in the files, answered questions about his relationship with Epstein from members of a Senate committee on Tuesday during an unrelated oversight hearing. Lutinck previously said he cut ties with Epstein before the financier was charged with any sex crimes in 2006.   But the latest batch of files contained an email correspondence between Epstein and Lutnick in 2012, where Lutnick planned a trip to Epstein's island. Lutnick admitted to the committee that his family visited Epstein while on vacation.   \"We had lunch on the island — that is true — for an hour, and we left with all of my children, with my nannies and my wife all together. We were on family vacation,\" Lutnick said. He added, \"I don't recall why we did it.\"   \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n                    YouTube\n                \n        \n   When Trump was asked by reporters on Thursday about Lutnick's visit to the island, Trump said he \"wasn't aware\" of it and that he hasn't spoken with Lutnick about it.   \"I was never there. Somebody will someday say that I was never there,\" Trump added.   Despite Lutnick's connection to Epstein, press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier in the week that Lutnick \"remains a very important member of President Trump's team, and the president fully supports the secretary.\"   \n   U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi also testified before Congress on Wednesday at a heated DOJ oversight hearing, during which she repeatedly dodged questions related to the Epstein files and insulted lawmakers who questioned her about them.   In one instance, Massie pressed Bondi on why some names, including Wexner's, were redacted. Bondi defended the DOJ's work and retorted that Massie suffered from \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\" and was \"a failed politician.\"    \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n                    YouTube\n                \n        \n   Lawmakers later accused Bondi of \"spying\" on their searches of the unredacted documents in the DOJ's secure terminals. After the hearing concluded, a photo emerged of Bondi holding the search history of Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., with whom Bondi also verbally sparred.    \"Members of Congress should be able to conduct oversight without the Department of Justice spying on us. It's outrageous and has to stop,\" Jayapal said on X.   \n   U.K. fallout   Top leaders in the United Kingdom are also facing backlash as a result of the Epstein files.   U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer faced calls to resign this week over a relationship his appointed U.S. ambassador, Peter Mandelson, had with Epstein. The latest batch of files show Mandelson may have shared sensitive U.K. government information with Epstein.   \n   Mandelson resigned last year after the files showed he remained in contact with Epstein after Epstein pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution in Florida, but Starmer faces pressure and criticism for appointing Mandelson to begin with. Starmer admitted he knew Mandelson had a relationship with Epstein prior to appointing him as U.S. ambassador but said Mandelson lied to him about the extent of their relationship.   Two members of Starmer's cabinet, chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney and communications director Tim Allan, resigned this week as opposition parties urged Starmer to step down.   \n   The Epstein files continue to rope in the royal family, too. U.K. police are looking into whether former Prince Andrew, who was stripped of his title, also leaked private government information to Epstein.\n",

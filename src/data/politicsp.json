    "body": "<div>\n         <p>Democrat Andy Beshear has twice won election as governor of Kentucky — thriving in a state that has voted for Donald Trump three times.</p>   <p>Now Beshear is considering a run for president. He discussed what he believes Democrats need to change in an NPR all-platform interview, which included a video and special podcast episode, as well as reports on the <em>Up First </em>podcast and <em>Morning Edition.</em></p>   <p>He has a lower national profile than another contender, California's Gavin Newsom. He's also less well known than some previous guests in the NPR interview series — <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/17/g-s1-89190/jb-pritzker-tenessee-memphis-national-guard\" target=\"_blank\">JB Pritzker</a>,<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/28/nx-s1-5475197/buttigieg-trump-democrats-election-2028\" target=\"_blank\"> Pete Buttigieg </a>and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5306406/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-politics-interview\" target=\"_blank\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>. But he has a credential others lack: winning statewide in a very red state. (A red <em>commonwealth, </em>to be exact; it's the Commonwealth of Kentucky.) In a party eager for new leadership, he is 47.</p>   \n   <p>Kentucky Republicans dismiss his success as a quirk: The son of a popular former governor, Beshear won races in 2019 and 2023, which were not presidential election years. Many of Trump's backers stayed home. Still he received credit for his handling of the pandemic and a string of natural disasters. A major theme of our interview was how Democrats can improve their dismal showing among rural and red-state voters.</p>   <p>You can view the interview above. Here are some highlights:</p>   <h3>He says Trump owns any damage from the government shutdown</h3>   <p>Beshear took note of the president's threat to permanently <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/26/nx-s1-5553544/trump-administration-threatens-large-scale-layoffs-if-government-shuts-down\" target=\"_blank\">fire federal employees</a> as a way to pressure Democrats.</p>   <p>\"If he fires a bunch of people, it's not because Democrats wouldn't reach a deal. It's because the president decides and actually fires people,\" he said. <strong>\"</strong>People aren't a negotiating tool. They are not a prop. And that's how he's treating these families.\"</p>   <p>Some political analysts have suggested that Democrats needed a shutdown, having failed in almost every other way to slow down Trump from enacting his agenda. Beshear said he supported the shutdown only because Democrats settled on an issue affecting millions of people: Obamacare subsidies that expire later this year.</p>   <h3>He makes the case for nominating a Democrat from a red state</h3>   <p>Beshear has sharply criticized Trump — calling his address this week to military leaders \"un-American.\" Yet, he told us that within his state \"the temperature is turned down,\" and in some cases people are \"willing to vote for people of both parties.\"</p>   \n   <h3>He says Democrats can win more votes if they show \"respect\"</h3>   <p>Beshear won two elections in a state where many voters are socially conservative, and Republicans do not let him forget it. Months before the 2023 vote, the legislature passed a bill restricting care for transgender youth.</p>   <p>\"And I knew they did it in part so that they could run tens of millions of dollars of negative ads if I vetoed it. But I did veto it because it was the right thing to do,\" he said. \"My faith teaches me that all children are children of God, and I didn't want these kids being picked on.\" He added that explaining the reason shows voters respect.</p>   <h3>He argues that Democrats can bring more states back into play </h3>   <p>As recently as 2008, Democrats had senators from rural and red states ranging from Montana to Arkansas to North Carolina, achieving a 60-vote supermajority. In that year's presidential election, Barack Obama won Iowa and Indiana. Today it's hard for Democrats to conceive of winning a 51-seat Senate majority, and the electoral map for the next presidential election will again be a challenge.</p>   <p>\"The Democratic Party needs to invest,\" Beshear said, offering himself as proof that the party can win in unexpected places. \"Democrats can win back voters in those rural areas, especially with what we're seeing right now. But Democrats need to be the common sense, common ground, get results, type of party, one that spends 80% of its time on concerns that impact 100% of the American population.\"</p>   <p><em>The radio version was produced and edited by Adam Bearne and Reena Advani, with digital editing by Majd Al-Waheidi.</em></p>\n</div>",

But the Trump administration is using the shutdown to take aim at the Democratic Party.</p>   <p>\"I can't believe the Radical Left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity,\" <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115304455138824245\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Trump wrote on Truth Social</u></a>. He called on Republicans to use the shutdown to \"clear out dead wood\" and said billions of dollars can be saved \"by eliminating waste and fraud,\" though did not give any examples.</p>   \n   <p>While some call the Trump administration's threats a political \"bluff\" to force Democrats to come back to the negotiating table, Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, seems to be making good on that promise.</p>   <p>He announced Wednesday the cancellation of $8 billion in energy projects. He also promised to cancel $18 billion in infrastructure funding to New York City, targeting the home state of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries.</p>   <p>Vought has also warned that layoffs of federal workers would begin within days — though any reductions-in-force would have to come from agencies themselves and follow certain procedures. </p>   \n   <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters on Thursday that Vought has no other choice. He blamed Senate Democrats for forcing the administration's hand, and said Vought is following a directive from the president.</p>   <p>\"Russ has to sit down and decide because he's in charge of that office, which policies, personnel and which programs are essential and which are not. That is not a fun task. And he is not enjoying that responsibility,\" Johnson said. \"It could end today if the Senate Democrats would come to their senses ... if they don't ... it's going to get more and more painful.\"</p>   \n   <p><strong>Executive power in a shutdown</strong></p>   <p>The shutdown does not give Vought or the White House any extra powers, according to Bridget Dooling, a law professor at The Ohio State University who worked at OMB for over a decade.</p>   <p>She argues it's a clear misunderstanding of the differences between temporary lapses in appropriations, which is what a shutdown is, versus permanently laying off workers.</p>   <p>\"This is a bluff,\" she said. \"And this is the administration trying to use some leverage to basically force Democrats back to the table to negotiate, to get the government back open.\"</p>   <p>The White House says Democrats have left them no choice but to look for savings across the federal government. But they have not explained why permanent layoffs would be necessary and not just temporary furloughs.</p>   <p>And Vought's past statements and writings indicate he's less focused on working with Democrats and more focused on making the changes he's long advocated for.</p>   <p><strong>Vought has long advocated for strict cuts</strong></p>   <p>Vought was a key architect of the controversial Project 2025, a conservative playbook released in 2023 to guide a potential future Republican administration. Vought argued in it that the White House needed to take a more activist approach to cutting spending and overhauling the federal workforce.</p>   <p>Now, he's part of the administration, and working to carry out those goals.</p>   \n   <p>He said with Republicans in full control of the federal government, it was time to contain spending regardless of whether they had the support of Democrats.</p>   <p>\"The appropriations process has to be less bipartisan,\" Vought told reporters at a breakfast hosted this summer by the Christian Science Monitor.</p>   <p>On Tuesday, Vought told Fox Business that he saw the shutdown as an opportunity to carry out the administration's broader goals to overhaul the federal workforce.</p>   <p>\"Let it be said there are all manners of authorities to be able to keep this administration's policy agenda moving forward, and that includes reducing the size and scope of the federal government, and we will be looking for opportunities to do that,\" Vought said.</p>   \n   <p>Last week, he sent out <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/24/nx-s1-5552789/trump-government-shutdown-plan-memo\" target=\"_blank\"><u>a memo to federal agencies</u></a> telling them to prepare for large-scale firings of federal workers if the government shuts down.</p>   <p>The move outraged leading Democrats.</p>   <p>Jeffries said the threat would not bend Democrats into supporting Republican spending plans that they say hurts public health.</p>   <p>\"Listen Russ, you are a malignant political hack,\" Jeffries<a href=\"https://x.com/RepJeffries/status/1971041739948556371\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>posted on X</u></a>. \"We will not be intimidated by your threat to engage in mass firings.\"</p>   <p>Republican leaders in Congress claim Democrats have tied their hands and essentially handed over the power of the purse to the executive branch.</p>   <p>The government typically decides which employees are \"essential\" vs \"nonessential\" for a temporary shutdown. But in this case, the White House may be using that concept for permanent cuts.</p>   <p><strong>Hill Democrats say Vought doing same thing he did before shutdown</strong></p>   <p>Most Democrats on Capitol Hill say Vought's actions are no different than what he has been doing since the start of the administration, and that's a key reason they're determined to push back.</p>   <p>\"This is increasing signs of our democracy evaporating before our eyes,\" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told NPR. He said a wind project was canceled in his home state and there is a legal battle over it.</p>   <p>Multiple Democrats say Vought and the president were determined to use the shutdown as a pretense for inflicting further pain on political opponents.</p>   \n   <p>\"I think everybody should be worried,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said about the news of Vought targeting blue states with cuts hours after the shutdown started. He said any deal to reopen the government would have to come with enforceable provisions that ensure money is distributed as specified in legislation. </p>   <p>\"For me the most important thing about this budget negotiation is getting the president to agree that a deal is a deal, because he's just acting like a king unilaterally — go after enemies, go after cities I don't like,\" Kaine said.</p>   \n   <p>Kaine noted that even before the shutdown the Trump administration canceled $40 million for an economic project in Norfolk, Va., and pulled back $400 million in public health money during an uptick in measles cases.</p>   <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., stressed that to reopen the government, he needs five more Democrats to vote with the GOP on a stopgap bill. Three senators — Democrats Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, plus Independent Angus King of Maine — backed the GOP bill this week.</p>   <p>After Cortez Masto broke with her Democratic colleagues, she explained in a statement that she is concerned about her home state and the economic impact on the tourism industry, military installations and more. </p>   <p>\"That's why I cannot support a costly shutdown that would hurt Nevada families and hand even more power to this reckless administration,\" she said.</p>   <p>When Vought <a href=\"https://x.com/russvought/status/1973450301236715838\" target=\"_blank\"><u>posted on social media</u></a> a list of energy projects in blue states that he was cancelling, Nevada — home to two Democratic senators — was not on the list. It's unclear if Cortez Masto's vote for the GOP bill influenced that omission.</p>   <p>Senate Appropriations Committee chair Susan Collins, R-Maine, made it clear on Wednesday that she opposed Vought's unilateral cuts. Collins has stressed that she is focused on working out bipartisan agreements on individual spending bills.</p>   <p>Another GOP appropriator, Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said Vought wouldn't be making these cuts or announcing federal firings if there weren't a lapse in federal funding. Referring to OMB, Rounds said, \"When you shut down government, you provide them a perfect opportunity to have a reason to reduce costs on a permanent basis, and the executive branch is perfectly within their authority to do so, particularly when you have a government shutdown.\"</p>   <p>He said if Democrats want to make it more difficult for Vought to act, they need to vote for a short-term funding bill.</p>   \n   <p>But Democrat Chris Murphy says the more Vought pushes the legal envelope, the more Democrats should fight back. </p>   <p>\"We would be suckers to sign onto a budget in which none of the funding ever gets spent in Democratic states and all the funding gets spent in Republican states. As they act more lawlessly, our spine should stiffen,\" Murphy said.</p>   <p><strong>Labor Unions Fight Back</strong></p>   <p>Federal workers say the Trump administration has already exceeded its authority. On Tuesday, just hours before the shutdown, labor unions representing more than 800,000 federal employees sued Vought, along with Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Director Scott Kupor, over what it called unlawful threats to dismantle essential federal services and functions provided by federal personnel.</p>   <p>\"It's an illegal abuse of power designed to punish patriotic civil servants and put pressure on Congress,\" Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), said <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/01/nx-s1-5558084/federal-workers-union-leader-talks-about-the-government-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\">in an NPR interview Wednesday morning</a>.</p>   <p>AFGE, along with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, argue the OMB memo takes the \"legally unsupportable position\" that the lapse in appropriations eliminates federal agencies' statutory requirements to carry out programs Congress had previously funded.</p>   <p>In their complaint, the unions allege the budget office's memo unlawfully directs agencies to disregard their own authorizing statutes.</p>   <p>The unions have asked the court to declare that both OMB and OPM have exceeded their statutory authority and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner, and to invalidate any actions that may come from the memos and guidance issued.</p>   <p>Loading...</p>\n   <p><em>NPR politics reporter Stephen Fowler contributed to this report.</em> </p>\n</div>",

Since 2021, those have kept ACA plans affordable for people who get their insurance this way. </p>   <p>Earlier this week, Democrats in the Senate <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/30/nx-s1-5555966/government-shutdown-democrats-elizabeth-warren-healthcare\" target=\"_blank\">refused to vote</a> for the Republican short-term funding bill that did not include an extension of the enhanced premium tax credits.</p>   <p>So why do they matter?</p>   \n   <p>The enhanced tax credits are important for people who don't get health insurance through their job or a public program like Medicare or Medicaid. This year enrollment hit a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/08/nx-s1-5252585/affordable-care-act-trump-biden-health-insurance-deadline\" target=\"_blank\">record 24 million</a>.</p>   <p>That is only about 7% of the U.S. population, but the people who rely on these plans are an influential group that includes small business owners, farmers and ranchers, says <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/person/cynthia-cox/\" target=\"_blank\">Cynthia Cox</a>, vice president and director of the Program on the ACA at the nonpartisan health research organization KFF.</p>   <p>Cox and her team just did <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/\" target=\"_blank\">an analysis</a> on what will happen to people's premiums next year if Congress doesn't extend the enhanced subsidies.</p>   <p>\"On average, we're expecting premium payments by enrollees to increase by 114%,\" she says.</p>   <p>That means a lot of people are going to have to pay double the monthly premium they're paying now.</p>   \n   <p>Or, says Cox, they might have to switch to a higher-deductible plan, change jobs to one that offers insurance, or they might lose their coverage.</p>   <p>The Congressional Budget Office <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-09/61734-Health.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">estimates</a> that 4 million people will become uninsured if the enhanced tax credits expire. </p>   <p>It also estimates that extending the policy will cost the government a lot — $350 billion over 10 years.</p>   <p>Premium tax credits have been critical to increasing enrollment in ACA plans.</p>   <p>When the ACA was passed in 2010, Congress created a sliding scale to give people a break on their premiums based on income. But premiums were still too high for a lot of people and those with incomes above 400% of the federal poverty level had to pay full price, says <a href=\"https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014RXPVAA4/sabrina-corlette\" target=\"_blank\">Sabrina Corlette</a>, project director at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.</p>   \n   <p>\"So there was a chunk of folks who just were really struggling to afford\" their premiums, she says. And enrollment was sluggish.</p>   <p>So in 2021, Congress stepped in with a lot more federal funding, which made premiums more affordable <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/explaining-health-care-reform-questions-about-health-insurance-subsidies/\" target=\"_blank\">for people of all income levels.</a></p>   <p>It was an \"incredibly successful effort to get more people into coverage and reduce the uninsured rate,\" says Corlette.</p>   <p>Some Republican lawmakers say the current enhanced tax credits are just too expensive. Other Republicans say they're open to extending the policy but not as part of the shutdown fight.</p>   <p>\"That premium support program doesn't even expire until next year. So why are you shutting down the government on Oct. 1 because of a program that doesn't even expire for another few months?\" Vice President Vance said<strong> </strong>on Fox News on Wednesday.</p>   <p>Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., says that actually, it is an urgent issue. As she explained in a press conference Wednesday, open enrollment for ACA plans starts Nov. 1.</p>   <p>\"Later is too late,\" she said. \"The new higher health care rates, those are being set right now. Notifications to families — they're in the mail now. Open enrollment is weeks away and families are panicking.\"</p>   <p>For Cox, having this relatively small slice of the health insurance pie dominating the political universe takes her back to the repeal and replace fight of 2017 and countless standoffs over the Affordable Care Act since then.</p>   <p>\"Obamacare has always been the center of a political firestorm, at least in health policy,\" she said. \"Here we are again.\"<br /></p>\n</div>",

On Wednesday, federal workers stayed home from work, national parks prepared to close down, and people seeking services from the federal government met a patchwork of availability and access.</p>   <p>In Washington, White House officials and congressional leaders spent the day pointing blame in public while a small group of lawmakers in the Senate began talks about a potential offramp.</p>   <p>Congressional Republicans were quick to dub the funding lapse \"The Schumer Shutdown\" — in a dig at Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. — and maintain that the government should be reopened before any bipartisan negotiations begin. Senate Democrats remained largely united in opposition to the short-term spending bill passed by the House earlier this month, as they continue to push for an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies set to expire at the end of the year.</p>   \n   <p>At the White House, Vice President JD Vance warned that federal workforce layoffs would be coming if the shutdown continues, in a break with past precedent of temporary furloughs. Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, also announced that the government would cancel or delay infrastructure and green energy projects that the administration says do not align with their policy goals — all in states that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>   <div>\n            <blockquote><div><p>Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left's climate agenda is being cancelled. More info to come from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/ENERGY?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ENERGY</a>. </p><p>The projects are in the following states: CA, CO, CT, DE, HI, IL, MD, MA, MN, NH, NJ, NM, NY, OR, VT, WA</p></div>— Russ Vought (@russvought) <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/russvought/status/1973450301236715838?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 1, 2025</a></blockquote>\n   </div>\n   <p>While party leaders refused to deviate from their demands, a handful of Republican and Democratic senators started informal talks about potential paths forward, although it's not clear any compromise they strike could advance in the Republican-controlled House.</p>   <h3>What the White House is saying</h3>   <p>The White House is not backing down from the message that Democrats are to blame. Administration officials at all levels say the push to undo Medicaid cuts Republicans passed this summer amounts to providing health care to undocumented immigrants. </p>   <p>That description does not fully or accurately describe the demands Democrats are making. They want to reverse the Medicaid cuts that were in the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill that Republicans passed the summer. That bill also included a provision that would punish states that provide health coverage to undocumented immigrants. But to be clear, people who are in the country without legal status are not qualified for Medicaid or able to buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act.</p>   \n   <p>The White House is also calling the proposed layoffs one of the \"unfortunate consequences to a government shutdown,\" as press secretary Karoline Leavitt put it on Wednesday. Leavitt and Vance told reporters that a prolonged shutdown would require permanent cuts, even while lapses in spending generally only lead to temporary furloughs.</p>   <p>At the center of those cuts is White House budget director Vought, who was also a key architect of the controversial Project 2025 blueprint, where he advocated for a more activist approach to cutting spending and overhauling the federal workforce.</p>   <p>Now as part of the administration, Vought has expressly stated that the \"appropriations process has to be less bipartisan.\"</p>   <p>Federal employees' unions are <a href=\"https://democracyforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AFGE-AFSCME-Complaint-093025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">suing over the Office of Management and Budget memo</a> preparing agencies for layoffs during a shutdown. The complaint argues that the Trump administration is \"deviating from historic practice and violating applicable laws.\"</p>   <h3>Top congressional leaders aren't talking, but informal bipartisan talks have started</h3>   <p>A pair of partisan stopgap bills <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/01/nx-s1-5558456/government-shutdown-trump-house\" target=\"_blank\">failed once again in the Senate</a> on Wednesday. One bill was the House-passed stopgap bill written by Republicans to fund the government until Nov. 21. The other was an alternative written by Democrats that includes several health care policy changes. Throughout the day top party leaders pointed fingers about who was to blame for the shutdown.</p>   <p>Still, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Schumer aren't engaged in negotiations. Thune has said he's willing to talk about health care once the government reopened.</p>   <p>But a small group of lawmakers from both parties has been huddling in more informal talks.</p>   <p>Groups of lawmakers have been huddling on the Senate floor and in hallways around the chamber working to craft a compromise to reopen government and extend the expiring health care tax credits and subsidies.   </p>   <p>Republicans are floating ways to put income caps on the subsidies or limit the number of people who are eligible to receive them. They also maintain a new plan must eliminate waste from the program. Democrats want to preserve the credits for as many working and middle class people as they can in a bipartisan bill.</p>   \n   <p>Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who has been part of those efforts working on a deal on the health care subsidies, told reporters, \"I am encouraged there are so many people on both sides who think we can work this out.\"</p>   <p>Schumer told reporters Wednesday that he has been pushing for talks for some time, even if he is not directly involved.</p>   <p>\"It's a good thing that Republicans and Democrats are now talking,\" he said.</p>   <p>Thune said he is receiving briefings on the talks and has told people involved to come and talk to him when they have \"critical mass,\" meaning enough votes from Democrats to end a shutdown.</p>   <p>No votes are planned for Thursday to allow lawmakers to observe the Jewish holiday. Senate GOP leaders are expected to call for another vote on Friday on the House-passed stopgap bill that funds federal agencies through Nov. 21. Leaders are still discussing plans for possible weekend votes. But the three times they've attempted to pass the measure did not result in<strong> </strong>the 60 votes needed to advance. Two Democrats — Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and John Fetterman of Pennsylvania — and one independent, Angus King of Maine, did vote with most Republicans on that bill on Wednesday, but Thune needs another five Democrats to clear it through the chamber.</p>   <p>The House is out of session until Oct. 7.</p>   \n   <p>Loading...</p>\n   <p><em>NPR's Elena Moore and Tamara Keith contributed to this report. </em></p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>NPR's Leila Fadel speaks with Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-NY, about the ongoing budget negotiations and the impact of the government shutdown.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>LEILA FADEL, HOST: </p><p> Let's turn now to Democratic Congressman Ritchie Torres of New York. His congressional district includes large parts of the Bronx in New York City. Good morning, Congressman, and thanks for joining us.</p><p>RITCHIE TORRES: It's an honor to be with you.</p><p>FADEL: So I want to start with what we heard there. The president is threatening to cut programs the Democrats, quote, \"like.\" This morning, he threatened to cut, quote, \"many Democrat agencies,\" referring to federal agencies. And he's threatening mass layoffs. Is this going to work and get Democrats back at the table?</p><p>TORRES: Well, there's nothing new there. Like, Donald Trump has been weaponizing government against his political enemies. He has been defunding programs. He has been engaging in mass firings long before the government shutdown. He has never needed a government shutdown to govern like an authoritarian. But the most important point is that there's a clear contrast. You know, Democrats are in Washington, D.C., intent on reopening the government and keeping health care affordable, whereas, Republicans are on vacation. And Republicans have been more than content to let the government shut down and let millions of Americans see massive spikes in their health care costs, and that is unacceptable to Democrats.</p><p>FADEL: Are you worried that this strategy might backfire, and Americans will blame your party because the government shutdown is painful the longer it goes on? What are you hearing from your constituents?</p><p>TORRES: Look, the party that holds the power has the responsibility. Republicans control the White House, the Senate and the House and therefore bear ultimate responsibility for the shutdown.</p><p>Now, my constituents are primarily concerned about the cost of living, particularly the cost of health care, which is the leading cause of bankruptcies in America. The cost of health care's crushing working families. And we cannot stand by idly and allow 4 million Americans to lose their health insurance, allow 24 million Americans to see a premium increase of 75%, allow our hospitals to absorb the loss of $20 billion. Like, that is unacceptable. Our health care system is in danger of falling off a cliff. And we're going to do everything we can to reopen the government and to protect health care.</p><p>FADEL: Let me ask about that because that is what the Democrats have said is behind them not getting on board with this continuing resolution, right? And Republicans wouldn't even allow the Democrats' counterproposal onto the House floor. I mean, how is this shutdown helping to achieve the goal of restoring health care cuts and preserving these Obamacare - the Affordable Care Act - subsidies from expiring in December?</p><p>TORRES: Look, for Democrats, doing nothing is not an option. Like, we have to protect our health care system. Republicans cannot be trusted to do the right thing on their own. Like, what we need is not trust but verification. And the best form of verification is an actual bipartisan agreement that reopens the government and protects health care, protects the ACA enhanced premium tax credits.</p><p>FADEL: Why do you need to get it in this way? I mean, why not agree to continuing resolution and then negotiate with Republicans later, which is what they're saying?</p><p>TORRES: Again, a party that eviscerates Medicaid by a trillion dollars cannot be trusted to protect health care. Like, we have no choice but to pursue a negotiated outcome. The Republicans are more than happy to let 4 million people lose their health insurance, are more than happy to let 24 million people see a 75% increase in their premiums. Like, Republicans, you know - we're not going to put our faith in Republicans who gutted Medicaid by a trillion dollars. That's the wrong strategy.</p><p>FADEL: And what do you say to constituents who will suffer during the shutdown, who maybe are furloughed, who might be one of the people that gets laid off? What do you say to them?</p><p>TORRES: Look, my constituents want the Democratic Party to fight. Like, those of us who are Democrats have a simple choice. We can either stand by passively and allow Donald Trump to gut our democracy, to gut our health care, or we can fight. And we've chosen to fight for the health care of the American people. And the majority of Americans want to see an agreement that both reopens the government but also preserves health care - affordable health care for tens of millions of Americans.</p><p>FADEL: And really quickly, are you hearing any more willingness from Republicans on this?</p><p>TORRES: Look, so far, Republicans remain on vacation, but we're going to do everything we can to pressure the Republicans to return to D.C. and reopen the government because - and do the people's work.</p><p>FADEL: Ritchie Torres is a Democratic congressman from New York. Thank you for your time.</p><p>TORRES: Of course.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The government typically decides which employees are considered essential for a temporary shutdown. In this instance, the White House might be attempting to apply this concept to enforce permanent cuts. Multiple federal employee unions say the White House doesn't have the authority to do so.</li><li>🎧 <strong>Many vital government services, like Social Security payments and Medicaid, are expected to be unaffected by the shutdown.</strong> However, staffing shortages <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5560670:x\" target=\"_blank\">may lead to delays for some services</a> if the shutdown continues, says NPR's Greg Allen. Among the things most at risk are <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/02/nx-s1-5557289/federal-shutdown-nutrition-aid-wic-snap-benefits-government-funding\" target=\"_blank\">federal food assistance programs</a> such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Carlos Hernandez, a 75-year-old, visited a SNAP office in Maryland yesterday to renew his benefits, only to find the office closed. Hernandez said he worries about what the shutdown could mean for his benefits.</li><li>➡️ <strong>Multiweek shutdowns are relatively rare</strong>, but have become more common in recent decades.

The proposal has <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5560670:x\" target=\"_blank\">run into challenges</a>, including far-right ministers in Israel being infuriated that the plan would let Palestinians stay in Gaza and not forcibly displaced. Qatar is helping mediate the ceasefire negotiations, but trust is thin, especially after Israel tried to kill Hamas negotiators in Qatar in September. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized for that action this week.</li></ul>   <p><strong>Democratic Gov. of Kentucky Andy Beshear is considering running for president.</strong> He has won the election for governor twice, excelling in a state that voted for Trump three times. The feat is something Kentucky Republicans have dismissed as a quirk. Beshear discusses changes he believes Democrats need to make in an NPR interview with <em>Morning Edition</em> host Steve Inskeep.

When you sleep in an awkward position, gaps can form between your body and your pillow or mattress. This can lead your soft tissues to sag into those gaps, causing your muscles to tense up in compensation. Whether you're a back, side or stomach sleeper, experts share advice with<em> Life Kit</em> on <a href=\"http://npr.org/2025/10/02/nx-s1-5435668/sleep-body-pain-minimize-morning-aches-soreness\" target=\"_blank\">how to position your body to guard against</a> neck cricks, shoulder aches and other body pain and soreness. <br /></p>   <ul><li>😴 Sleeping in a position similar to standing can reduce muscle strain. Your body should lie flat, forming a straight line.</li><li>😴 Avoid sleeping on your stomach.

In the 2000s, the Mothman Festival in Point Pleasant, W.Va., started. Now, 20,000 people gather to celebrate Mothman, with many donning costumes as they walk beneath giant inflatables ranging from Mothman to the Ghostbusters Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man. For an event celebrating a dark and mysterious being, the vibe is surprisingly uplifting.

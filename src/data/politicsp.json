Israel pledged to continue strikes, saying that it was responding to a militant attack on Israeli soldiers that seriously wounded one.   \n   Among the Palestinians killed were five children, including a 5-month-old and a baby just 10 days old; seven women; and a paramedic, said hospital officials. They are the latest Palestinians in Gaza to die since a ceasefire deal, which has been punctuated by deadly Israeli strikes, came into effect on Oct. 10, 2025. More than 530 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli in that time, according to Gaza's health ministry.   The escalating Palestinian death toll has rocked the U.S.-backed truce and caused Palestinians in the strip to say it does not feel like the war has ended.   \n   \"The genocidal war against our people in the Gaza Strip continues,\" said Dr. Mohamed Abu Selmiya, director of Gaza City's Shifa Hospital, in a Facebook post. \"Where is the ceasefire? Where are the mediators?\"   \n   An Israeli military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in line with military policy, told The Associated Press that Israel would continue striking the strip. Since the ceasefire took hold, Israel's military has defended deadly strikes by saying it is responding to Hamas violations or militant attacks on its soldiers. The military says four soldiers have been killed since the ceasefire took hold.   Mediators have condemned the attacks and Hamas has called them violations of the deal.   Early Wednesday, Israeli troops fired on a building in the Tuffah neighborhood in north Gaza, killing at least 11 people, most from the same family, said Shifa Hospital, which received the bodies. The dead included two parents, their 10-day-old girl, her 5-month-old cousin and their grandmother.   \n   Israel's military said its aircraft and armored units had returned fire after militants started shooting at troops, badly wounding a reservist soldier who was evacuated to a hospital. Israel called the militant attack a violation of the deal.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Palestinian Raed al-Khabba carries his 3-month-old daughter Mira al-Khabbaz, who was killed in an Israeli military strike, at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, Wednesday, Feb. 4, 2026.\n                \n                    Jehad Alshrafi/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jehad Alshrafi/AP\n    \n\n   \n   After the Tuffah strike, Israeli fire continued across the strip, said hospital officials. An Israeli strike on a family's tent in the southern city of Khan Younis killed three people including a 12-year-old boy, said Nasser hospital, which received the bodies. Tank shelling in Gaza City's eastern neighborhood of Zaytoun killed another three Palestinians, according to Shifa Hospital, including a husband and his wife.   \n   A strike on a tent in the Muwasi area of Khan Younis killed at least two people and wounded five others, according to a field hospital run by the Palestinian Red Crescent in the area. The dead included Hussein Hassan Hussein al-Semieri, a paramedic for the Palestinian Red Crescent who was on duty at the time, said the hospital.   Over 71,800 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Gaza health ministry, which does not say how many were fighters or civilians. The ministry, which is part of the Hamas-led government, maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts.\n",

Gavin Newsom speaks in Los Angeles during a 2025 campaign event on Proposition 50. Voters approved the ballot measure, allowing the state's Democratic leaders to temporarily replace the state's congressional map to help Democrats win five additional U.S. House seats.\n                \n                    Ethan Swope/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Ethan Swope/AP\n    \n\n   \n   The Supreme Court is allowing California to use its new congressional map for this year's midterm election, clearing the way for the state's gerrymandered districts as Democrats and Republicans continue their fight for control of the U.S. House of Representatives.   The state's voters approved the redistricting plan last year as a Democratic counterresponse to Texas' new GOP-friendly map, which President Trump pushed for to help Republicans hold on to their narrow majority in the House.   And in a brief, unsigned order released Wednesday, the high court denied an emergency request by the California's Republican Party to block the redistricting plan. The state's GOP argued that the map violated the U.S. Constitution because its creation was mainly driven by race, not partisan politics. A lower federal court rejected that claim.   \n   The ruling on California's redistricting plan comes two months after the Supreme Court cleared the way for the Texas map that kicked off a nationwide gerrymandering fight by boosting the GOP's chances of winning five additional House seats.   \n   \"With an eye on the upcoming 2026 midterm elections, several States have in recent months redrawn their congressional districts in ways that are predicted to favor the State's dominant political party,\" said the court's December order in the Texas case. \"Texas adopted the first new map, then California responded with its own map for the stated purpose of counteracting what Texas had done.\"   The \"impetus\" for adopting both states' maps was \"partisan advantage pure and simple,\" wrote Justice Samuel Alito in a concurring opinion, which fellow conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch joined.   The Supreme Court has previously ruled that partisan gerrymandering is not reviewable by federal courts.   While the Trump administration supported the Texas redistricting by Republicans, it opposed California's, describing it as \"tainted by an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.\" The administration asserted the case was different from Texas' due to the timing of the states' candidate filing periods and the fact that the California Republican Party and the federal government provided alternative maps that met California's \"stated partisan goals.\"   \n   Where the California map fits into the larger redistricting fight   Democrats are counting on California's map to help their party push back against Republican gerrymandering in Texas and other states. With rulings upholding both the Texas and California maps, the end result is that the two states may essentially cancel out each other's partisan gains.   Legal fights are still playing out over other new congressional maps, as Republican-led Florida and Democratic-led Maryland take steps to join the list of states that have redistricted before the midterms.   \n   In New York, Republican Rep. Nicole Malliotakis and GOP members of the state's elections board are appealing a state judge's order for a new redistricting plan that would redraw Malliotakis' district, which the judge found illegally dilutes Black and Latino voters' collective power. A redraw of the New York City-based district could tip it into the Democrats' column.   In Utah, two House Republicans have filed a federal lawsuit that claims a new state court-selected congressional map, which could help Democrats win an additional House seat, violates the U.S. Constitution. Utah's Republican-controlled state legislature has asked the state's highest court to block that map for this year's election.   And in Virginia, a judge has ruled that a proposed constitutional amendment on congressional redistricting violates state law because the process Democratic state lawmakers used to advance it was improper. Virginia Democrats are appealing the decision.   Redistricting also remains an issue for the Supreme Court this term.   It has yet to rule on a challenge to Louisiana's voting map, but the October oral arguments suggested that the court's conservative majority is likely to continue undercutting the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Such a ruling could lead to new rounds of congressional gerrymandering — and the largest-ever decline in representation by Black members of Congress.   Edited by Benjamin Swasey\n",

    "body": "\n      Lawmakers have a little over a week to negotiate changes to federal immigration enforcement. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., talks about what's next and what Democrats are looking to accomplish.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Connecticut Representative Rosa DeLauro has been following all of this, and she's part of it - member of Congress, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, which holds the power of the purse in Congress, or is supposed to. Representative DeLauro, good morning.ROSA DELAURO: Good morning, Steve. Good to be with you.INSKEEP: OK, so Congress is close to asserting itself when it comes to the Department of Homeland Security. We just heard from Ximena a few possible provisions that might be inserted into the law. What do you want when it comes to DHS?ROSA DELAURO: Well, as it's been outlined, we outlined this when we did our appropriations bills several weeks ago in the House, and we gave a bill of particulars - list of particulars to the Republicans. For instance, let's not deport or detain U.S. citizens, requiring the body-worn cameras that Ximena talked about this morning, requiring reporting on the use of force, allowing the access, which has been required by law, for members of Congress to access facilities, training standards. The training has been cut back to, you know, less than a little bit over a month, where there used to be, you know, several months, so - and requiring, yes, judicial warrants. So we have outlined some issues already. And the issue is, it's an enforceable code of conduct, real accountability when agents break the law, prohibitions on detention of department of U.S. citizens, judicial warrants, masks off, badges on, necessary measures to keep communities safe...INSKEEP: I want to be clear - when you say the judicial warrants, I want to be clear what you're talking about here. As I understand it, sometimes, very often, in fact, immigration agents have used what they call administrative warrants, which is essentially the DHS giving itself permission to go grab someone or search a house or whatever. You're saying you want it in law affirmed that they need to go to a judge who is independent.ROSA DELAURO: That's right. Exactly. That you require ICE to have a warrant for any arrest of a noncitizen.INSKEEP: Now, let me ask also about the matter of masks off. We heard Ximena say the Republican argument against this, that the agents are vulnerable, that they've been doxed, which means their addresses could be exposed and that sort of thing. What is the strongest case that you have that agents should be showing their faces, should properly identify themselves as federal agents if they are working on behalf of us, the taxpayers?ROSA DELAURO: Well, they're working on behalf of us, the taxpayers, and you can go to any municipality, Steve, and I just came from dealing with a grant on deescalation techniques in West Haven, Connecticut, for our municipalities. All of our law enforcement people, they have on their jackets their names. They have a badge number, etc., and, you know, that has been the practice, you know, historically, where people are identifying themselves. This is just a - you know, we have people who are masked and armed and marauding our streets. Imagine that. Imagine the terror they are striking, you know, into the minds and hearts of American citizens. And we don't know who they are. They're picking up people off the street, willy-nilly, not criminals, you know? So they need to - we need to know who they are.INSKEEP: Let me ask you about the conversation in Congress. And I will note for people who are not aware, we said you were on the Appropriations Committee. Appropriators, historically, have been a little more bipartisan, a little more pragmatic, a little bit more working across the aisle than maybe some other parts of Congress have been. What have the conversations been like with your Republican colleagues when you lay out some of the requests or demands that we're just discussing?ROSA DELAURO: Oh, well, look, let me just take a step back with you for a second. You know, I think we have - what we needed to do, and I think was demonstrated by yesterday's vote, was we need to govern. I'm an appropriator. I need to govern. The other thing is we need to protest and resist where we think things are not right. So that is the framework, and that is what happened yesterday. Eleven out of the 12 full-year appropriations bills have been signed into law. Significant wins by Democrats. NIH funding, rental assistance - I'm not going to go on with those, but significant gains. And we rejected $163 billion in cuts that the Trump administration sought. Where we have differences - and there will be continued - to be differences. This is going to be a negotiation. And - but that's what we need to do because ICE, DHS, has been lawless, it has been reckless and it has killed two American citizens. And we have to do something.INSKEEP: And do your Republican colleagues agree?ROSA DELAURO: I think some do - that some do. The issue will be, are they willing to speak up? They've spoken about body cameras. They speak about training. But let's get to some of the heart of this matter here to put the American people and their psyches and their mental health state at rest here. Give them some piece of what's happening, not just in Minnesota, but all over this country.INSKEEP: Representative Rosa DeLauro, thanks for your time. Really appreciate it.ROSA DELAURO: Thank you.INSKEEP: And we'll note, as always, we invite Republicans as well as Democrats to join us. We hope to hear from Republicans on this issue a different day.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Juana Summers speaks with Ron Lieber, financial columnist for The New York Times, about the ins and outs of the newly created Trump Accounts.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  This tax season, parents of young Americans can opt to establish a Trump Account. That is the actual name of a new account that has a lot of similarities to individual retirement accounts for children. It was created in the massive tax and spending law last summer. When the program goes live this summer, the federal government has pledged a $1,000 contribution into the Trump Accounts of eligible kids. Here to walk us through all of this is Ron Lieber. He writes the Your Money column for The New York Times. Hi there.RON LIEBER: Hello.SUMMERS: Ron, let's just start with some basics if we can. Who is eligible for a Trump Account?LIEBER: So the people who are eligible are children under the age of 18. If you want that $1,000, that's only for babies who are born between January 1, 2025, and the end of 2028.SUMMERS: If you have kids or you're expecting a child, how exactly do you sign up for one?LIEBER: You can check a box on the tax form that you are filing this season. Now, you don't have to do that. You can set it up some other time in the coming months, but that is one easy way to do it while you're filing your taxes.SUMMERS: Say you're a parent and you decide to open a Trump Account for your kid, where does the initial money go?LIEBER: It is not 100% clear yet where the money is going to land. The administration is engaging in partnerships with different financial services firms. And so sooner rather than later, we will know which ones those are and what kind of choices you may have.SUMMERS: And who can contribute to these Trump Accounts? And I wonder, do we know if there's a cap on how much money you can put in?LIEBER: Parents control the account, or a guardian. But it's not just parents who can put money in and not just the federal government. There may be some employers who offer contributions. Outside philanthropists have some interest in these accounts. And so we'll see how it rolls out in that way.SUMMERS: So that's how the money gets in. But when can a child or their parent or guardian access the money?LIEBER: It is locked up until you turn 18. And at that point, it belongs to the 18-year-old. And they can use it for anything at that point.SUMMERS: I mean, Ron, we know that the United States offers other tax-deferred investment vehicles, and some of those are specifically for kids. I'm thinking about 529 plans for education, Roth IRAs, 401(k)s. The list goes on. How do Trump Accounts compare to some of the other options that are out there?LIEBER: You are correct to note that we have a kind of alphabet soup of savings options in this country. And so one way to think about this is that - let's say you want to open a 529. The advantage there is that that comes with tax breaks that the Trump Accounts do not have. And there may be other savings vehicles that, you know, families want to use that could have more flexibility, particularly in the years when a child is under 18.SUMMERS: I mean, listening to you describe this, this sounds sort of like a free $1,000 from the government for certain parents. Would a person be - I don't know - silly or foolish not to opt in?LIEBER: You would indeed be foolish not to opt in if you've got a kid who is eligible for the $1,000 or some other amount of money that a philanthropist or an employer might toss into the account. Look, it's free money. Anybody who's eligible should go get it.SUMMERS: And say you don't qualify for that $1,000, in your mind, in this still a good investment strategy compared to some of the other options?LIEBER: So they may want to open those accounts if an employer or a philanthropist wants to put some free money in, sure. Beyond that, there may be better options. But much depends on your family and its circumstances. Any savings account is only useful if you have money left over. And chances are the people who are going to have thousands of dollars to toss into an account like this are people who have more money than average, because if you don't have more money than average, you're spending it on everyday items just to keep the roof over your head.SUMMERS: Ron Lieber writes the Your Money column for The New York Times. Ron, thank you.LIEBER: Sure thing.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Steve Inskeep talks to Dan Baer of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace about U.S. Envoy Steve Witkoff's approach to foreign conflicts.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Just to keep track, Steve Witkoff had a meeting on Gaza yesterday. He is expected to hold a meeting on Iran late this week. And in between those meetings, the president's envoy is supposed to make progress in this meeting on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Wow. We've called an observer, Dan Baer, who is director of the Europe Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Good morning.DAN BAER: Good morning.INSKEEP: I want to talk about the person who's conducting these negotiations first. Do you feel you have come to understand Steve Witkoff's approach to meetings like this over the past year?BAER: I mean, we are looking at a highly personalized foreign policy in that President Trump seems to control everything. There's very little in our agency coordination for the foreign policy and an unorthodox use of a trusted associate from the real estate world, who has no prior diplomatic experience or regional expertise as kind of the chief diplomat. And he seems to be a transactions guy, and that seems to be his approach. He's juggling, as you said, three precarious problems this week, and that would be a high-stakes really hard ask of anybody.INSKEEP: I'm holding on to that word, transactions, that you just used because when I have followed past rounds of negotiations, Witkoff seems to have been very open about what he thinks the transaction is. Russia gets some territory from Ukraine, and everybody walks away happy. That's the way Witkoff is said to describe it, although Ukraine, of course, really struggles with that formula, and Russia never seems interested. Can he bring anything more to the transaction this time?BAER: I think it's going to be incredibly difficult. As Eleanor made clear, the Ukrainians are unwilling to give up additional territory, and that's not just because of some kind of emotional attachment to that territory. It's because the territory - the lines exist where they are for a reason. It's because they are defensible lines, and giving up more territory would make the new lines indefensible, and that would be a real threat to Ukraine. And the real problem is that the challenge that Witkoff is trying to solve can't be solved right now at the negotiating table because the real challenge is that Vladimir Putin is not ready for peace. And so the real problem is in Moscow. And I think that what's going to need to happen before Putin is ready for peace is for President Trump to realize that he needs incentives to come to the table in good faith. Those incentives might look like more sanctions on Russia, more support for Ukraine to raise the costs on Russia on the battlefield. But right now, Moscow's not ready for peace, and he's happier - Putin is happy to play for time as he continues this war.INSKEEP: Because you mentioned sanctions, I'm wanting to review some history here. Of course, under Biden, the United States put a lot of sanctions on Russia. There was a lot of congressional support for that. President Trump has periodically, over the past year, talked about sanctions, threatened sanctions, maybe even announced sanctions, but has not really added any pressure on Moscow in the end. Do I have that right?BAER: That's my assessment, yeah.INSKEEP: OK. So what is realistic then to expect out of these talks, if anything?BAER: Like I said, Steve, unfortunately - I wish I were more optimistic, but unfortunately, I think until Moscow is ready, until Putin is ready to come to the table and actually has recognized that the war is costing him more than it's giving him - and we should note that he has retooled the entire Russian economy around this war. The Russian economy's under enormous strain already, but he's retooled it around this war. And in some sense, then he's addicted to it because the war is what's propping up his regime.INSKEEP: Yeah.BAER: Until we change the calculus for him, it's going to be difficult to make any progress at the negotiating table. As Eleanor said, he hasn't accepted the idea that Ukraine should have security guarantees as we saw this week when President Trump asked him for a sign of good faith to hold off on attacks. On Monday night, they launched one of the largest attacks in recent memory overnight. So...INSKEEP: Yeah.BAER: ...He's not sending signs that he's ready.INSKEEP: Let me ask about this next meeting that Witkoff is supposed to attend in Istanbul or maybe Oman. There's a lot of confusion about exactly where it's going to be, who's going to attend. But the idea is for the United States to talk with Iran and find possibly some way out of the threatened U.S. strike on Iran over its nuclear program, protests and other issues. Do you see some basis on which the two countries could stand down?BAER: I guess there's a possibility there, and it's hard to know. You know, this latest episode was brought to a head by the protest that started on December 28, where what - the latest reports are that 30,000 people were killed, and it's hard to tell. He's set the theater now, and so there is a credible middle - military threat, and that's an advantage for Witkoff as he goes into these negotiations. But Iran and the U.S. remain very far apart on the nuclear program and on Iran's nefarious behavior in the region. And so it will be a difficult thing for - to close that gap in one meeting.INSKEEP: Yeah.BAER: And the credible threat of military threat remains, and we know that there are people around President Trump who are probably encouraging military action on the back of the - what they see as successful military action last year.INSKEEP: And I guess we should note, there are many different casualty estimates. Dan Baer, thanks so much.BAER: Thanks for having me.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Now, lawmakers come to a more difficult task: how to find bipartisan agreement on changes to immigration enforcement.   \n\n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  The partial federal government shutdown has ended. The House voted 217-214 on Tuesday to fund most government offices through September.STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Key word there is most. Congress has just nine days to finish negotiating the other thing - the budget for the Department of Homeland Security. Lawmakers seem far apart over how to change immigration enforcement after federal agents killed two Americans in Minnesota. Democrats are demanding changes. We'll speak with one of them in a few minutes, Representative Rosa DeLauro. We begin with the facts.MARTIN: NPR immigration policy correspondent Ximena Bustillo has been tracking all this and is with us now to bring us up to date. Good morning, Ximena.XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Good morning, Michel.MARTIN: So the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, ICE, already got $75 billion from Congress last summer. So what's the difference between that and what Congress is trying to come up with after February 13?BUSTILLO: So in this instance, we're talking about funding for all of DHS and not just ICE through the end of the fiscal year. So that 75 billion that you're talking about was in the One Big Beautiful Bill, and that was just for ICE. It made Immigration and Customs Enforcement the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency. Now, Congress still has to, by law, do what's called annual appropriations, and that's the baseline budget for each department that has to get renewed every year or we have these shutdowns.MARTIN: OK. So this is for the whole department and not just one agency. And so that's why this is a big deal. OK. So body cameras keep coming up. Democrats want immigration officers to wear body cameras, but DHS Secretary Kristi Noem already said this week that every officer on the ground in Minneapolis specifically would be issued a body camera. So what's the issue they still need to negotiate?BUSTILLO: Right. And keep in mind that that wouldn't necessarily happen overnight. It could take over 180 days to fully implement that just in Minneapolis. Noem also said that as funding is available, the body camera program would be expanded nationwide across the agency to all agents. But Democrats want more than just Noem's word for it. They want it written into law. And the current DHS budget bill negotiated by Congress does provide $20 million for body cameras, but Democrats want to mandate that they actually be used. And this is just one of the asks that has been discussed, and this one has gotten some bipartisan support, but other requests have been more contentious.MARTIN: Like what?BUSTILLO: Democrats want to mandate that immigration officers only use warrants signed by a judge to make arrests, for example. They say that the current use of administrative warrants, which are written by DHS itself and not signed by a judge, raises questions about violations to people's Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizures. While some Republicans are interested in negotiating and talking about this, others, like House Speaker Mike Johnson, have poured cold water all over this. Democrats also want to ban officers from using face coverings, but Republicans are broadly opposed to this and say that it would make it easier for people to dox federal agents.MARTIN: OK. So they have nine days. The clock is now ticking. I'm wondering if lawmakers really think they can get this done. What does your reporting suggest?BUSTILLO: You know, many members are skeptical that less than two weeks is even enough time to come up with such a large compromise. If they can't get this done, they could risk a shutdown of just DHS, which puts at risk non-immigration parts of the agency like disaster response and TSA.MARTIN: That is NPR's Ximena Bustillo. Ximena, thank you.BUSTILLO: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Cook is among the CEOs who have personally courted Trump in the past year and whose companies' products have escaped the worst of Trump's tariffs.\n                \n                    Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Two top-ranking Democrats are blasting the Trump administration for playing favorites with tariffs — by giving trade relief to the big companies whose CEOs are cozying up to the president.   In a letter to the White House made public Wednesday morning, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., criticized the administration for relaxing some tariffs \"through an opaque process that appears to favor the politically connected\" and that \"has opened the door to corruption and economic harm.\"    \n   Wyden is the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee; Van Hollen sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee, and is the top-ranking Democrat on its commerce subcommittee.    Now they're raising \"significant concerns that the Trump Administration appears to have created a closed-door tariff exclusion process allowing relief largely for those with political connections,\" according to the letter addressed to U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.   The tariff exemption process \"has lacked transparency and procedural fairness for American stakeholders, especially small businesses and family farms,\" Wyden and Van Hollen added in the letter. An advance copy of the letter was seen by NPR.   \n   The letter comes at a time when President Trump is visibly favoring some companies and investors, some of whom have publicly courted him with personal gifts — like the gold-plated desk clock recently presented by Rolex's CEO — and donations to his controversial plans to build a White House ballroom.   This blurring of the lines between business and government has led political commentators and business leaders across the political spectrum to warn that the United States is tipping into \"crony capitalism.\"   A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the administration has previously dismissed claims of crony capitalism and defended the tariffs. A White House official recently speaking to NPR on condition of anonymity defended Trump's policies as \"the traditional free-market policymaking that you would expect coming out of a Republican administration.\" The official also said that there are U.S. companies benefiting from Trump's policies \"whether or not they have a good relationship with the administration.\"   \n   Since the beginning of his second term, Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs on many U.S. imports through executive orders, in a stop-and-start process that continues today. The Supreme Court is now set to rule on a court case challenging his authority to do so — but the tariffs are already being paid by millions of businesses.   Adding to the chaos, Trump has also reversed course on various tariffs, including for pharmaceutical companies and on beef, coffee and other agricultural products. The senators' letter takes issue with the administration's \"opaque\" and seemingly \"ad hoc\" process for making these exemptions, through amendments to Trump's executive orders.   Wyden and Van Hollen do not name specific companies. But they do note that, for example, smartphones are among the imports that the Trump administration added to an April list of goods that are exempt from the tariffs.   Smartphone maker Apple is among the companies whose CEOs have personally courted Trump in the past year. CEO Tim Cook last summer presented Trump with a glass-and-gold plaque as his company promised to invest $600 billion in the United States.   Wyden and Van Hollen wrote that the administration's apparent process for granting exemptions benefits companies that \"find themselves in favor with the White House.\"   \"The Administration has considered and granted tariff exclusions behind closed doors, through an opaque and unaccountable process,\" they wrote.   Wyden and Van Hollen asked Greer and Lutnick to answer several questions about the administration's process for exempting imports from tariffs and how it will engage with small businesses and other U.S. companies \"that lack a presence in Washington, D.C. or an existing relationship with your agencies.\" They have asked for a response by March 4.\n",

It is a debate that has taken on new urgency among Democrats against a backdrop of bipartisan backlash to the Trump administration's deportation efforts, led by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Critics on both the left and the right say the fatal shootings of two U.S. citizens by federal officers last month show the administration has gone too far.   \n   For Democrats, the events in Minneapolis have created an opening ahead of this year's midterm election to shift the conversation on immigration — a notable change after struggling to message on the issue in the 2024 election.   But internal divides over what to do about ICE could complicate the effort. Calls to \"abolish ICE\" have been particularly amplified by progressive candidates, especially among younger Democrats running for Congress and those challenging Democratic incumbents. On Capitol Hill, far fewer Democrats have re-upped support for abolishing the agency, despite many rallying around the issue during President Trump's first term.   Instead, many elected Democrats have called for reforms at ICE, wary of appearing out of step with voters who want strong enforcement of immigration laws but who disagree with the administration's tactics.   \n   \"There is no question that the dynamic from '24 has flipped, [during] which immigration was a sure strength for Trump and a profound weakness for Democrats,\" said Jonathan Cowan, president and co-founder of the centrist think tank Third Way. But, he cautioned, if the party wants to be successful in November, they should keep the focus on the administration's missteps.   \"The divide in the Democratic Party is not over rage, disgust and anger,\" Cowan said. \"The divide is what are you going to do about it? How do you channel that rage in a way that actually changes policy? Both short and long run.\"   \n   He warns the \"abolish ICE\" slogan may not be universally embraced among voters across the country. Democrats hoping to flip districts or win over swing voters, Cowan said, should lean into different language, such as calling for a \"reform\" or \"overhaul\" of ICE.   He likens the debate to when many Democrats coalesced around the \"defund the police\" movement in 2020, a decision that Cowan argues created an opening for Trump to paint Democrats as soft on crime.   \"People embraced an emotionally satisfying slogan that in the long run proved to be politically toxic and a barrier to getting serious police reform in the country,\" Cowan said. \"We are in grave danger of the same problem happening for those who are embracing abolish ICE.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A protester carries a sign that reads \"Defund The Police\" during a July 3, 2020 march in Richmond, Va. Many Democrats have been wary of calls to \"abolish ICE,\" and point to how calls to \"defund the police\" hurt the party with voters in 2020 and 2024.\n                \n                    Eze Amos/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Eze Amos/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   That may already be happening. In response to calls to abolish the agency, many Republicans have attempted to link the movement with \"defund the police.\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt echoed that in a post on X last week, asking, \"Why do Democrats keep attacking the law enforcement agencies that hunt down criminals and protect innocent American citizens?\"   Loudest calls come from progressives and new candidates   The debate is poised to be especially salient in Democratic primaries and in states that have faced increased enforcement, such as Minnesota, Illinois, California and New York. Democratic candidates have already faced off on the debate stage in Illinois with competing pitches to abolish and reform ICE and the Department of Homeland Security. In Minnesota, immigration enforcement has become a key issue in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Tina Smith.   Some of the loudest calls to abolish ICE have come from Gen Z and millennial candidates, many of whom have sought to frame their bids around a larger rejection of Democratic Party norms.   \n   Darializa Avila Chevalier has embraced that message. The 32-year-old progressive organizer and Ph.D. student is running a primary challenge against Rep. Adriano Espaillat, 71, in New York's 13th Congressional District, which includes upper Manhattan and part of the Bronx.   \"From the very beginning, I've been adamant that I wanted the abolition of ICE to be central to what we're talking about,\" said Avila Chevalier.   \"It's an institution that should have never existed to begin with,\" she added. \"It's an institution that is younger than I am. And so I've lived in a world where ICE didn't exist, and we can all go back to a world where ICE doesn't exist and never exists again.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                ICE agents look for someone at a home on Jan. 28 in Circle Pines, Minn. Protests continue around the Twin Cities area after the Trump administration sent thousands of immigration agents to the region to search for undocumented immigrants.\n                \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Scott Olson/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Avila Chevalier says Democratic candidates need \"to be bold\" in their solutions to issues affecting voters right now, and that includes on immigration.   \n   \"If I could trust that the leadership we have was reflecting our values, was actually meeting this moment,\" she said, \"I wouldn't be running.\"   Avila Chevalier is one of 10 candidates currently backed by Justice Democrats. The political group has supported a handful of progressives who have gone on to win seats in Congress, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who delivered an upset primary win in 2018 and ran on a platform that included abolishing ICE, a stance she's reaffirmed in recent weeks.   For nearly a decade, Justice Democrats has rallied around anti-establishment candidates of all ages who often draw contrast to the Democrats they're challenging by rejecting donations from corporate PACs or pro-Israel lobbying groups. But in the wake of the fatal shootings in Minnesota, candidates the group supports are also drawing a line in the sand on immigration — pledging to abolish ICE.   \"Every single one of these communities has an ICE story of their own. And it's up to us to listen to those communities … and show people what an opposition party, if in power, would actually do,\" said Justice Democrats spokesperson Usamah Andrabi. \"That's what our slate of candidates exists to be.\"   Andrabi disagrees with the idea that \"abolish ICE\" creates more party divides than flips voters.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Protesters stage a march calling for an end to taxpayer spending on ICE and demanding a moratorium on evictions on Jan. 31 in Minneapolis.\n                \n                    John Moore/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        John Moore/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"The slogan is not the problem. ICE is the problem,\" he said.   Recent polling indicates there is some support for the issue among voters, though not overwhelming. A plurality of Americans, 46%, strongly support or somewhat support abolishing ICE, according to a YouGov poll conducted after the shootings in Minneapolis. Americans under 30 were most likely to oppose Trump's immigration agenda, according to the poll, and nearly 7 in 10 voice some level of support for getting rid of the agency.   It's a generational sentiment that may add important context when looking at the influx of younger candidates voicing support for the issue.   \n   \"I think that they are furious. They see it all over their news feeds. They see it in their communities. They also, I think, are less beholden to this idea of tradition or the way things have been done,\" said Amanda Litman, the founder of Run for Something, an organization that recruits and supports young people running for local office.   \"I think that sense of the crisis and of the urgency of this moment … is something that young leaders really bring with them into their positions of power,\" she added. \"And it is both their super strength and often their weakness because they're a little more radical in some ways.\"   Divides on Democratic messaging   Immigration enforcement has become a central issue in funding negotiations on Capitol Hill, where Democrats are lobbying for changes to the tactics used by immigration officers. Democrats want to narrow the type of warrants immigration officers can use to enter homes, require them to wear body cameras and prohibit the use of face masks.   While Democrats in Congress are united in what they see as the bare minimum needed to reform immigration enforcement, there is less consensus on how far to take the rhetoric. Though Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., is pushing to \"defund and abolish ICE,\" as are some House lawmakers, other Democrats have taken a different approach.   \n   Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D–Mass., would not directly answer whether she supports calls to abolish ICE, telling NPR it needs to be \"totally reorganized\" and \"torn down to the studs and rebuilt.\" She declined to say whether campaigning on abolishing ICE would benefit Democrats.   It's a debate that's also playing out in competitive midterm matchups, including in the Senate Democratic primary in Maine, where the state's governor, Janet Mills, and first-time progressive candidate Graham Platner are running to unseat Republican Sen. Susan Collins.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Graham Platner is running against Gov. Janet Mills for the Democratic nomination for Senate in Maine. Platner has called for ICE to be \"dismantled,\" characterizing it as \"the moderate position.\"\n                \n                    Sophie Park/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Sophie Park/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Mills has advocated for ICE reforms, calling for \"measures\" that would \"prohibit ICE's lawless, dangerous conduct and their abuses of power.\" Platner has called for the agency to be \"dismantled,\" characterizing it as \"the moderate position\" in a post on X.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Maine Gov. Janet Mills has not called for abolishing ICE, instead advocating for reforms at the agency.\n                \n                    Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The degree to which candidates choose to embrace — or reject — calls to abolish ICE could prove particularly decisive in swing districts.   \n   Though many voters want the current situation to change, calls to abolish ICE may mean different things to different people, argues Cowan of Third Way.   \"You can take the literal word, slogan, abolish ICE, and it will get a certain level of support,\" he said. \"But the moment you start asking people specifically what they actually support, the concept of abolishing interior immigration enforcement is not popular.\"   Nearly half of Americans say they have some support for abolishing ICE, according to the latest YouGov poll, far fewer, less than a third, support abolishing the U.S. Border Patrol. When respondents were asked if they support Trump moving forward with a smaller enforcement effort, \"aimed at criminals, not at hotel maids and gardeners,\" 55% strongly or somewhat approved.   \n   The lack of Democratic consensus on the issue isn't stopping some progressive congressional hopefuls from standing by the policy they believe is right.   Mai Vang was in high school in 2003 when ICE was created. Now, more than two decades later, the 40-year-old Sacramento city councilmember is campaigning on abolishing the agency as she challenges 81-year-old Democrat Doris Matsui in California's 7th Congressional District.   \"What we've seen is this agency has inflicted harm on our communities, and you can't reform it. There is not enough training or even body cameras that would justify what they are doing,\" she said in an interview.   When asked if she considered shying away from using the slogan, Vang pushed back.   \"Not really because people are being killed and murdered by ICE,\" she said. \"It's not a radical position to say we don't want an entity harming our families and loved ones. I don't think it's radical to want to dismantle an agency that is killing citizens.\"\n",

In 2003, the U.S. removed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and occupied the country until 2011.   \"A fairly rapid change of a head of state prompted by U.S. military forces is always going to bring back memories of Iraq in one way or another,\" says Raad Alkadiri, a managing partner at 3TEN32 Associates, a political risk consultancy, who lived in Iraq from 2003 to 2007.   But Alkadiri says there's a key difference, and that's the way the Trump administration is taking control of Venezuela's oil. It's a process that, so far, has been marked by opacity and questions over whether what the U.S. is doing is legal, oil lawyers and oil analysts tell NPR.   \n   After the invasion of Iraq, the U.S. and the United Nations set up a system for managing Iraq's oil revenue. There was also an independent auditor to track the money. While the handling of Iraq's oil revenues involved the United Nations and independent oversight, that isn't the case with Venezuela's oil.   To date, the U.S. military has seized seven Venezuelan oil tankers. And the U.S. is selling Venezuelan oil through two Swiss oil trading firms, both of which have pled guilty to paying bribes in the past.   \n   At a Senate hearing last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that this is a short-term fix for Venezuela. \"The long-term plan is not those two trading companies,\" Rubio said. \"The long-term plan is for them to have a normal energy program that sells directly into the market.\"   \"This was a historic deal President Trump brokered with the Venezuelan interim authorities that benefits both the American people and the Venezuelan people,\" wrote White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers in an email to NPR.   Here are four things to know about Iraq's oil history and what it can teach us about what could happen to Venezuela's oil.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                In January, President Trump gathered oil traders and oil executives in the White House to talk about Venezuelan oil. He later told the press he didn't like what ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods, fourth from the right, said.\n                \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   Most big U.S. oil companies didn't invest in Iraq post invasion   U.S. oil companies helped develop Venezuela's oil fields. But around 2007, some U.S. oil companies, including ExxonMobil, left after then-President Hugo Chávez renegotiated contracts with worse financial terms for the companies. Right now, Chevron is the only major U.S. oil and gas corporation working in Venezuela.   \n   Trump has made it clear he wants U.S. oil companies to increase investments and operations in Venezuela. In January, Trump gathered a group of oil executives in the White House and told them they would go into Venezuela and \"increase oil production to levels never ever seen before.\"   But at that meeting, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods told Trump that his company could invest in Venezuela again, but only if there were new investment protections and legal structures. Until then, Woods told Trump the country is \"uninvestable.\" Not long after that meeting, Trump said, \"I didn't like Exxon's response.\"   The disconnect between what the U.S. government wants and what U.S. oil executives say is feasible has echoes of Iraq, says Ben Van Heuvelen, editor in chief of Iraq Oil Report.   \n   After the invasion of Iraq in 2003, when the U.S. temporarily controlled the country, some in the Bush administration wanted to privatize Iraq's national oil companies. The U.S. installed former CEO of Shell Oil, Philip Carroll, as advisor for the Iraqi Oil Ministry. But Carroll said no to privatization. As Carroll told the BBC program Newsnight in 2005, \"I was very clear that there was to be no privatization of Iraqi oil resources or facilities while I was involved.\"   Iraq put some of the largest oil fields in the world up for auction in 2009. But many U.S. oil companies chose not to participate. When weighed against a violent war, decrepit infrastructure, and general lack of political and economic stability, most major U.S. oil companies found the financial rewards weren't worth it, Alkadiri says.   The same may be true in Venezuela, says Fareed Mohamedi, managing director at SIA-Energy International, an oil and gas consultancy.   \" Last time in Iraq, this time in Venezuela, [oil companies] are saying 'Show me whether you can create a stable level playing field that we can really do business in,'\" Mohamedi says.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney took to the stage in 2008 to deliver remarks to U.S. troops in Iraq. Cheney had previously been CEO of Halliburton, an oil services company that made billions of dollars in Iraq.\n                \n                    Paul J. Richards/AFP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Paul J. Richards/AFP\n    \n\n   \n   ExxonMobil played the long game in Iraq   Many U.S. big oil companies did not sign contracts in Iraq in 2009, but one U.S. oil giant did: ExxonMobil. \" They had a theory of getting in on the ground floor,\" Van Heuvelen says.   \n   In Venezuela, Chevron stayed when ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips left. \"They played the long game,\" Kepes says.   Chevron is currently in talks with the U.S. and Venezuela about boosting Venezuela's oil output. In an email to NPR, Chevron spokesperson Bill Turenne wrote, \"Our focus remains on the safety of our people, and the integrity of our assets in strict compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to its business, as well as the sanctions frameworks provided for by the U.S. government.\"   Van Heuvelen says it will be interesting to see what happens with Chevron in Venezuela. In Iraq, ExxonMobil's long game \"kind of didn't pay off,\" Van Heuvelen says. \" Profit margins remained suppressed and it was pretty hard to do business there and so they walked away from the project.\"   ExxonMobil left Iraq in January 2024. ExxonMobil did not respond to requests for comment.   \n   Alkadiri says the main American companies that reaped big rewards in post-invasion Iraq were oil services companies. Those companies, including U.S. oil services company Halliburton, provided equipment and technical support to the oil sector.   The former CEO of Halliburton was Vice President Dick Cheney. Halliburton's subsidiary, KBR, came under scrutiny for multi-billion dollar contracts in Iraq.   Kepes says smaller independent oil companies that can take on more risk than big ones may have success in Venezuela, but they will not be able to make a big boost in oil output on their own.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio testifies during a Senate  Committee on Foreign Relations hearing on January 28, 2026. He said the use of two Swiss oil trading companies to facilitate Venezuelan oil sales was a \"short-term mechanism.\"\n                \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   U.N. involved with Iraq's oil revenues   After toppling Saddam, the U.S. began controlling Iraqi oil and gas revenue in a system set up through a 2003 U.N. security council resolution. It was overseen by an independent auditor. The idea was that Iraq's oil money would go to a bank account in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which it still does to this day. Then a small portion of the oil money would pay off debts racked up during the Saddam regime—they were paid off four years ago— and the rest would pay for the reconstruction of Iraq.   \n   Unlike with Iraqi oil, there is currently no independent monitoring of U.S.-facilitated sales of Venezuelan oil. The U.S. brokered a deal so that Venezuelan oil would be sold through Swiss oil trading firms, Vitol and Trafigura. The U.S. says the oil sold for $500 million. Venezuela says it's received $300 million. In the Senate hearing, Secretary Rubio said the remaining $200 million is in a bank account in Qatar.   Both Vitol and Trafigura have pled guilty to bribery and recently settled cases with the Department of Justice. Vitol did not respond to requests for comment. Trafigura directed NPR to statements on its website, including one that states that the past incidents do not reflect Trafigura's values and that they are investing in compliance.   \n   As for Venezuela's oil, Trafigura directed NPR to a statement on their website that reads, \"At the request of the US government, Trafigura and Vitol are providing logistical and marketing services to facilitate the sale of Venezuelan oil... Trafigura operates in full compliance with applicable sanctions.\"   Rubio said multiple times in the Senate hearing that the use of the oil traders was a \"short-term mechanism.\" White House spokesperson Rogers wrote in an email, \"President Trump always does what is in the best interest of the American people, such as brokering this historic energy deal with Venezuela.\"   Alkadiri says there's not enough oversight of Venezuelan oil revenues. That worries him in a way Iraqi oil revenues didn't. \" In the immediate term,\" he asks, \"what's there to protect the Venezuelans?\"   A long road back for Iraqi oil production   Around the time of the invasion of Iraq, senior Bush administration officials announced that Iraqi oil production would rebound—and soon.   That didn't happen. After the 2003 invasion, Iraqi oil production plummeted and it took four years for the country to get back to pre-war levels. It wasn't until 2011 that the country surpassed 2.6 million barrels a day, the production highs of Saddam's regime after the Gulf War.   \n   Loading...\n   Venezuela's oil sector is starting from a weak place, battered by years of sanctions, decreased investment, and the flight of oil professionals under Chávez's administration. Venezuela's oil sector produces a third less than it did in the 1970s, 1990s, and early 2000s.   \n   Today, many parts of Venezuela are controlled by armed gangs known as \"colectivos.\" Trump may want to boost Venezuelan oil production, but to do that, the country has to address security risks and a lack of institutional capacity, says Gerald Kepes, president of Competitive Energy Strategies, an energy consultancy.   \"Until they do, most of this is sheer fantasy,\" Kepes says.\n",

    "body": "\n    TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. My guest, Robert Kagan, used to describe Donald Trump as antiliberal. Then he upped it to authoritarian, and now Kagan says that Trump is getting close to becoming a dictator. Kagan writes, \"President Trump has managed in just one year to destroy the American order that was and has weakened America's ability to protect its interests in the world that will be. Americans thought defending the liberal world order was too expensive. Wait until they start paying for what comes next,\" unquote.We're going to talk about that and Trump's domestic violations of norms, laws and the Constitution, including the ICE immigration crackdowns in cities like Minneapolis. Kagan says some of the Trump administration policies are rooted in the history of Christian white supremacy.Robert Kagan is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a contributing writer at The Atlantic, a former longtime Washington Post columnist, a former Republican and the author of many books. The paperback edition of his latest book is titled \"Rebellion: Donald Trump And The Antiliberal Tradition In America.\" We recorded our interview yesterday.Robert Kagan, welcome to FRESH AIR.ROBERT KAGAN: Thank you.GROSS: So you've recently said we're heading into a dictatorship, if we're not already in one. And you've described Trump over the years as antiliberal and then authoritarian, and now to moving in the direction of dictator or already maybe one. So what promoted him to would-be dictator or maybe already one for you?KAGAN: Well, I started warning that he was threatening to be a dictator back in November '23. And so pretty much everything that's happened since then, I think, was predictable, and I foresaw it. But I have to say, certainly his actions, his administration's actions in the first year, in which they very rapidly sort of dismantled the federal bureaucracy, took over the Justice Department, took over the FBI, took over the CIA and then have created this brute squad, which is called ICE - these are the acts of a dictator, plain and simple.GROSS: He still insists that the 2020 election was stolen from him. And so now he announced on Dan Bongino's podcast - and Bongino had been the No. 2 at the FBI in the Trump administration, but now is back to being a podcaster. So Trump said that he wants to federalize elections in at least 15 states and called for Republican officials to oversee those states' elections.KAGAN: Yeah. No. I mean, look. I think we're already well into a dictatorship. It's just a question of whether he will go ahead and, you know, basically disrupt the '26 elections, which I think he's made it clear he has every intention of doing now. So I think that this should be a five-alarm fire for everybody. I - people, I think, are starting to figure out that the '26 elections are very much at risk and that his intention is to prevent the Democrats from taking the House or the Senate and that, you know, we are there now. You know, people are always talking about when this happens or if that happens. We're there, and I really think it's time for people to start taking that seriously.GROSS: Just describe a little bit what nationalizing the elections would mean and what - like, asking Republican officials to oversee elections. First of all, the Constitution says that states regulate elections and oversee elections, right?KAGAN: Right. I mean, it is the state's prerogative to decide how the elections are going to be conducted and how the votes are counted and all that kind of stuff. Yeah.GROSS: And to have partisans overseeing it - like, how in the world can that be legal?KAGAN: It's not. It's not legal. We've moved out of the realm of legality. Everything now is about power. It's about pure power. And, you know, the fact that the Republican Party has become the party of dictatorship - I think people really do need to focus on that. There's so much focus on Trump. And Trump, of course, is the driving force behind this, although he has other people who are also major figures, like Stephen Miller and, I think, Russell Vought. But even to suggest that Republicans should be overseeing elections - I must say, I'm surprised even to hear that coming out of the mouth of Donald Trump. It's such a blatant declaration of dictatorship, a one-party dictatorship, that it - I have to say, I'm even a little bit surprised that he put it that way.GROSS: And meanwhile, in Fulton County, Georgia, the FBI has seized voting ballots and other documents related to voting. And Trump wants to do that in other states as well, including Minnesota, and this is to build a national voter file. What does that mean?KAGAN: Well, again, it's clear that he has no intention of allowing the elections to play out and allow a Democratic victory. And I think it's important to understand his motives here. He knows perfectly well that, in effect, his presidency will be greatly diminished once the Democrats take either one or both of the Houses. He himself is saying right now that he'll be impeached, and that is why he wants to prevent the Democrats from taking power. And he now has at his disposal a huge, powerful - literally, the forces of power. What they would call in another country the power ministries - he is in full control of that. And, you know, I can imagine any number of scenarios in which he uses that power.By the way, when he talks about the 2020 election being stolen from him, that's not just about 2020. That's about looking forward, too. He wants to set the predicate for the idea that elections are stolen, that he and the federal government and, I guess, the Republican Party have to step in. I can easily imagine them seizing the ballots in some of these districts that are heavily Democratic. That's not even counting the voter suppression that they will engage in in order to prevent nonwhite people from feeling like it's safe to vote. And if you put all that together, then you have the final end to American democracy. I think that's what we're staring at right now.GROSS: Do you think what's happening in Minnesota with ICE is, in part, a way to scare people away from voting?KAGAN: Yes. Absolutely, and I think it's been a big mistake. And I somewhat fault the media for basically treating this like it's an - and the Democratic Party, too, for that matter - treating this like it's an immigration and deportation and maybe even a crime issue, when it's clear and has been clear that the purpose of ICE is to create protests and riots of sufficient size to justify Trump, in his own mind, invoking the Insurrection Act and bringing in the regular military. It's clear that he wants to do that. And so Minnesota, in my view, has been a test run for the seizure of power, using these forces that he has brought under his control and created. This is not about immigration primarily. It's about white supremacy. It's about white Christian supremacy, but it's also about using the full force of the federal government effectively to nullify the voters' choices.GROSS: Can you just briefly list a few of the other actions Trump has taken that have led you to call him a dictator? First of all, just he personally - I think he really is a textbook definition of a megalomaniac. There is never enough power for him. He wants to have power over everybody, including the world, by the way, not just the United States. So there's the clear sense that you get from him that the Constitution means nothing to him, that elections mean nothing to him and that the only thing that he seeks is his own power - and wealth. But I think the power is more important. So there's the personality of Trump. But then, of course, there's all the things that he did in his first year, which we've sort of gotten used to.GROSS: First year of second term.KAGAN: Second term, first year, second - 2025, which is the remarkable - and I got to say, it will go down in history as really a remarkable destruction of the government that - his turning the Justice Department into his personal legal weapon, his turning the CIA into his personal organization, his using the FBI to go after enemies and solidify his position in power. These are all textbook actions of a dictator. He doesn't want to allow any pluralism in this country. He doesn't want to allow any dissent, you know, the way they talk about protesters as domestic terrorists. That's Stalin territory that you're in. So, I mean, it's almost too - there are too many things to list, it seems to me, that make him really not a would-be dictator, but really a dictator at this point.GROSS: There are certain personal characteristics, too, of Trump's that seem to fit with autocratic or dictators in other countries who have taken over. And I wonder if you think that narcissism, lack of empathy, lying, interested in money, corruption in the administration, transactional - are those, like, typical characteristics of people who become autocrats or dictators?KAGAN: They are. And obviously, there are parallels with other countries, but I think we need to recognize that this is very much an American - this is a homegrown dictatorship, if you will. I mean, the forces that are supporting Trump are very much an American phenomenon, this white Christian supremacy, that is - and the sort of status anxiety of white Christian and especially males. This is very much - it goes back, I would say, there have been - a significant portion of the American body politic has held these kinds of what I call antiliberal views, going back to the founding.And Trump is very much an American. I mean, if you look at sort of how he came to, you know, have this power, it was by being a television personality, a kind of a phony billionaire. I mean, he's very much an American phenomenon. So I'm always a little wary of bringing in the examples from other countries because, in a way, it makes us feel like, well, those are in other countries. It couldn't happen here. And I think the belief that it couldn't happen here has been a real handicap for us in trying to prevent him from getting to where he is now going.GROSS: Well, let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Robert Kagan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a contributing writer for The Atlantic and author of the book \"Rebellion: Donald Trump And The Antiliberal Tradition In America.\" We'll be right back after a break. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Robert Kagan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, an author, mostly on foreign policy, and a contributing writer for The Atlantic. His latest article is titled \"America Vs. The World.\" Our interview was recorded yesterday.You write about how Trumpism relates to racism and white Christian supremacy. So how do you define white Christian supremacy?KAGAN: Since the founding of the republic, there has always been a significant portion of the population that does not believe in the principles of the Declaration of Independence, does not believe that all men are created equal and does not believe that individual rights are more - you know, need to be protected from the state. Obviously, the slave-holding South did not believe in the fundamental principles of equality and the principles that are enunciated in the Declaration of Independence, and also the Reconstruction South. I mean, the Jim Crow South.You know, as late as the 1950s and '60s, the federal government had to send troops into the South in order to enforce desegregation. So I don't know where we think all those people went. I think, you know, because we've been living predominantly liberal America since World War II, I think we thought those people had sort of, you know, crawled under rocks and we'd never see them again. But they're alive and well and running the Republican Party right now.GROSS: How would what you describe as white Christian nationalism express itself during the writing of the Constitution? Now, we know that even, you know, Founding Fathers, like Thomas Jefferson, had slaves. So unless the enslaved people aren't really people, then all men are not created equal in the eyes of Founding Fathers, those who held slaves. But can you talk more about how you see white Christian nationalism expressing itself during the founding days and the writing of the Constitution?KAGAN: Well, obviously, the Constitution was a big contradiction because on the one hand - and by the way, the founders were aware of the contradiction in a way that I think subsequent generations maybe sort of decided to forget about the contradiction. I mean, Thomas Jefferson was aware that he was a slaveholder, and yet he was fighting for the rights of all human beings. And he hoped that slavery - he wasn't prepared to get rid of his own slaves because obviously that would be a great economic setback for him, but he was hopeful that at some point, slavery would wash out, that it would just cease to be a phenomenon in the United States.But the Constitution originally was a great compromise, a horrible compromise with slavery, which was a direct contradiction to the principles that undergirded the Constitution and were in the Bill of Rights, etc., etc. And that's why we had a civil war. But I think a lot of people may think that the Civil War sort of changed America so fundamentally that you could never, you know, return to that horrible compromise. And I think we've learned that that's not true, that there's this strain of people who regard themselves - you know, it's a question of, how do you define America? And there's always been a fight between those who define it as an idea, which is to say the idea of universal human rights, and those who wanted to define it and continue to want to define it as an ethnoreligious entity.People talk about, today, heritage Americans or - how long have your people been here? - etc., etc., which is very contrary to the founders' view but which nevertheless has been a very powerful force in American life. And, you know, now you hear it straight out of the mouths of JD Vance and Stephen Miller. It's part of the propaganda, recruitment propaganda of ICE, you know, where they're saying, come defend our culture. Come defend our civilization. And we know what they're talking about, and they know what we're - the recruits also know what we're talking about.GROSS: Before we move on to foreign policy, which is your real focus, I want to ask you what you're expecting now of the midterms and the presidential election.KAGAN: Well, in the midterms, I fully expect Trump to use all the various levers of power that he controls as president to make sure that the Democrats cannot take power either in the House or in the Senate. He will use ICE, in my opinion, to cause disturbances, to frighten away not illegal voters, who generally don't come to the polls, but legal voters who are nevertheless nonwhite and know that they can be scooped up and sent off to Texas, etc. - that he is perfectly capable of declaring a state of emergency over the elections or invoking the Insurrection Act, of going into heavily Democratic districts and seizing the ballot boxes, as the FBI just did in Fulton County, and then saying, we're counting the votes. We'll let you know how it turns out. But somehow or other, a Democratic House is never seated.And I think that that is, at this point, I would say, a likelihood. I don't know what Trump has to do other than stand on the roof of the White House, screaming that he has no intention of allowing a fair election in 2026, but that's basically where we are right now. And to me, the question is, who is going to stand up and prevent this from happening?GROSS: Do you think the courts will?KAGAN: I don't think the courts necessarily will. I mean, the various federal courts may, but the Supreme Court, I think, is - has demonstrated a willingness to let him do whatever he wants. And the minute a president moves into the national security realm and starts declaring national security reasons for why he has to do certain things, traditionally, the court has sort of backed off. I mean, the worst court decision of - certainly of the past 100 years was Korematsu, which was the internment of the Japanese, which the court felt like, well, the president's making a national security determination. What can we do? So, no, I don't think it'll be the courts.I would like to think that some Republicans - it only takes four in the Senate - might stand up for democracy and preserving the American system, but I actually have no optimistic sense about that. So in some respects, I suppose it's going to be left to the American people, and we've seen a lot of brave American people in Minneapolis and elsewhere. But that's a pretty thin reed for our democracy to be hanging on.GROSS: Do you think, if Trump does declare the Insurrection Act, that that would be the kind of, you know, emergency that would prevent the courts from stopping his action?KAGAN: I worry about that, yes. And again, it's not the courts. I'm sure there are plenty of courts who would say, you know, this is not appropriate. But if it gets to the Supreme Court, I'm afraid there are some members of the court who are entirely in favor of the Trump dictatorship and others who are, you know, Republicans and in any case not - have proven unwilling to stand in Trump's way.GROSS: OK. It's time for another break, so let me reintroduce you. If you're just joining us, my guest is Robert Kagan, a contributing writer for The Atlantic, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of the book \"Rebellion: Donald Trump And The Antiliberal Tradition In America.\" We'll be back after a short break. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF WAYNE HORVITZ & ZONY MASH'S \"THE GIFT\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Robert Kagan about why he thinks Trump is on his way to becoming a dictator based on Trump's foreign and domestic policies, his violations of laws and the Constitution and his constant desire for more money and power. Kagan is a contributing writer at The Atlantic, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a former longtime Washington Post columnist, a former Republican, and the author of many books, including his latest - \"Rebellion: Donald Trump And The Antiliberal Tradition In America.\" His latest article The Atlantic is titled \"America Vs. The World.\"So, let's talk about foreign policy, which is your area of expertise. Do you think that Trump has managed to end the NATO alliance without actually withdrawing from it, but by, like, insulting and defying NATO, wanting to buy Greenland, threatening Denmark and trying to make Canada the 51st state?KAGAN: Yes. I've been telling my European friends that they need to understand that NATO is over. I used to just focus on the fact that Trump certainly has no commitment to our Article 5 security commitment to the allies. He's made that clear on numerous occasions. But as you say, and let's be clear about what happened in Greenland, we just had a situation where a number of European powers, our allies, were talking about sending troops to deter a potential act of American territorial aggression against a NATO ally. That's not a thing that goes unremembered. And I think that Europeans today, some of them can't imagine separating themselves from the United States. But I think increasingly, we're seeing Europeans regarding the United States correctly as among their adversaries. Europe now faces a situation where they really have a predatory empire to their east in the form of Russia, and a predatory empire toward the west in the form of the United States. And that leaves them in a very perilous situation.GROSS: I want to quote you. You write, (reading) the Trump administration has told Europeans to be ready to take over their own defense by 2027 and suggests that allies and strategic partners, including Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, should pay the U.S. for protection. Trump has launched aggressive tariff wars against virtually all of America's allies. He has waged ideological and political warfare against European governments and explicitly threatened territorial aggression against two NATO allies - Canada and Denmark. If NATO ends because NATO literally ends or it just ends in the sense that it doesn't really function anymore without the U.S., what would the consequences be, do you think, for the world and for the U.S. in particular?KAGAN: Well, I think that, you know, it's been so long since we lived in a genuinely multipolar world that I don't think people are ready for what that actually means.GROSS: What do you mean by a multipolar world?KAGAN: A multipolar world is one that is not the world we've lived in since World War II. The world we've lived in since World War II has been one where a very large number of once great powers like Britain, which ruled much of the world at one time, like France, which had a huge empire, like Germany, which was so powerful that it almost conquered Europe twice. During this period of what we call the American order, those countries have been peaceful. They have relied on the United States to provide their basic security, which means that they have essentially given up great power ambitions, including the demand for spheres of influence, including the demand for control of resources. All of those things have essentially been provided to them in the American order. If the United States is no longer playing that role, then they have to start dealing with the world without that protection, which, to my mind, means they will have to rearm. And then we will have a situation as we did in say, the 1920s where you have multiple great powers, not just Russia and China, but also perhaps Germany, perhaps Japan, perhaps India, are all great powers, all demanding spheres of influence, all competing for resources. It's a much more combative, brutal world, really. And I - in the essay that you're quoting from, I go back and look at the 19th century 'cause that was a multipolar world, and you even hear some Trump supporters saying we could go back to something like that. And what people don't remember about the 19th century is that it was a century of almost constant warfare among great powers.Every multipolar world we've ever seen is one in which there are multiple conflicts among great powers. And so just imagine every decade, there is some kind of war involving Russia, China, Japan, Germany, the United States. That is, by the way, the normal world. The world we've been living in, where the United States plays this unusual role, has been an aberration. But normal is not good from the point of view of conflict and disruption and economic calamity and all the things that come with a much more competitive multipolar system.GROSS: I want to play an excerpt of a speech that Trump gave on January 21 in Davos. The World Economic Forum was held in Davos in January.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The United States is treated very unfairly by NATO. I want to tell you that. And when you think about it, nobody can dispute it. We give so much, and we get so little in return. And I've been a critic of NATO for many years. And yet, I've done more to help NATO than any other president by far, than any other person. You wouldn't have NATO if I didn't get involved in my first term. The war with Ukraine is an example. We are thousands of miles away, separated by a giant ocean. It's a war that should have never started, and it wouldn't have started if the 2020 U.S. presidential election weren't rigged. It was a rigged election. Everybody now knows that. They found out. People will soon be prosecuted for what they did. It's probably breaking news, but it should be. It was a rigged election. Can't have rigged elections. You need strong borders, strong elections and ideally, a good press. I always say it. Strong borders, strong elections, free, fair elections and a fair media.GROSS: What's your reaction to that?KAGAN: Well, that's sort of everything in a nutshell about Trump. First of all, his description of an ideal, I guess, America is one where he controls the press, he controls the elections and is, in effect, a dictatorship. And making up this nonsense about the 2020 elections is all pursuant to consolidating power in that way. But he also has got, you know, incredible delusions of grandeur on the world stage as well. He is the one who is, in fact, destroying NATO, and yet he says that, you know, he's the one who fixed it.I just think that when people heard that speech in Davos, when people in other countries heard that speech in Davos, I think they began to get a sense of just what we're dealing with here in the United States. And that's a big part of why you see countries like Canada now having to talk to China about trade deals, why everybody is scrambling to find alternative markets to the United States, which is not easy to do, and which is why you're going to see increasing anti-Americanism.And this is the thing Americans need to understand. Trump is under the illusion that America is so powerful that it doesn't matter what anybody else in the world thinks, and that really is a delusion. A lot of American power has derived from the fact that much of the rest of the world, not all - and I'm not saying that America's without flaws. It isn't. But much of the world has actually trusted the United States to hold to its basic bargain, which is to provide security without using its overwhelming power against its own allies. That trust is now gone.GROSS: Also the example that we just heard of the Trump speech in Davos. So he's talking about NATO and how they've been unfair to us. And then he transitions to, it was a rigged election. Everybody knows that. And I think it's an example of mixing personal grievance with world affairs.KAGAN: Yeah.GROSS: And what's your reaction to the way Trump does that?KAGAN: Well, again, there's nothing more important in Trump's world than Trump himself. And so everything is a function of him. And it would be one thing if he really were, let's say, an America First president in terms of foreign policy. It would be one thing if he really did intend to pull the United States back into the Western Hemisphere and let the rest of the world do whatever it's going to do. But, of course, that's not what he's doing because he is Donald Trump. He wants to be world emperor. He wants to be able to bomb Iran and bomb Syria and remove a dictator in Venezuela and change governments in Europe, etc. And so in a way, he's creating the worst of both worlds. It's really a recipe for foreign policy disaster.GROSS: So nobody in the U.S. has prevented Trump from insisting that he needs and will get Greenland and that he intends on annexing Canada. I think he still intends that. I don't think he's withdrawn that, has he?KAGAN: No. And I was sort of stunned, again, not to be critical of the American media, but when Trump said that he was, OK, maybe not going to invade Greenland, the media reported, OK, Trump rules out attack on Greenland. He hasn't ruled anything out, as you say. And Greenland has been an idee fixe for him for a long time, certainly going back to his first term. And I don't think we're done with his efforts to get Greenland. I think he thinks it's going to get on Mount Rushmore and that he'll be the great completer of American territorial acquisition. So I don't think he's given up on that at all. And, again, it's all about his glory. It is not about strategic issues, by the way. We could do anything we needed to do in Greenland with the full permission and cooperation of Denmark and NATO allies.It's his personal glory that he's seeking. And, again, this is true domestically and internationally. Everything is about Trump, his power, his glory. It's not about American interests, and it's not about the interests of American democracy.GROSS: Well, let's take another short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Robert Kagan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. He's an author and a contributing writer for The Atlantic. His latest article in The Atlantic is titled \"America Vs. The World.\"  We'll be back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview that I recorded yesterday with Robert Kagan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. He's an author and a contributing writer for The Atlantic. His latest article in The Atlantic is titled \"America Vs. The World.\"So you have been labeled in the past as a leader of the neoconservative movement. I know that's a word you don't particularly like. It's not a word that you coined. So what did people who called you a neoconservative mean? And how did you define yourself differently than the definition that was placed on you?KAGAN: Well, there's so many - different people mean different things by neoconservative. Let me just start by saying what it is that I would characterize myself as believing, which is I believe that the founders' system, that the principles of the Declaration of Independence, that the belief in universal individual rights and, in particular, the protection of those rights against the state, is one of the greatest developments in the history of humanity, and I believe it is the right way for human beings to live. I also believe that ideas alone don't succeed just because they're the better idea and that they require power behind them if they are to succeed and that the United States, for all the many mistakes it has made - and I'm a historian of American foreign policy, and I'm acutely aware of those mistakes. I'm aware of the weaknesses and foibles of the American people. But nevertheless, if you look at what the United States has done since World War II, in the 80 years since then, the United States managed, in its various peculiar ways, to create a world in which democracy has flourished, in which prosperity is at historic levels compared to the whole breadth of human history, and in which wars among the great powers have been absent for 80 years. And that's a huge accomplishment. And I believe that, again, whatever the flaws of the United States, the world is better off with this kind of American leadership than it would be with any of the actual alternatives. There are utopian ideals about what the world can look like. But in terms of the real world, a world in which power is critical, I think the United States has played that role. To me, if I had to say what neoconservatism is, it's that. It's the marriage of American power and liberal democratic ideals.GROSS: I want to quote something that you wrote.(Reading) Trump has managed in just one year to destroy the American order that was, and he has weakened Americans' ability to protect its interests in the world that will be. If Americans thought defending the liberal world order was too expensive, wait until they start paying for what comes next.What do you think is coming next?KAGAN: Contrary to what Trump seems to think, we have benefited enormously from the vast number of alliances and strategic partners that we've had over the world. In my article, I cite a Chinese strategic thinker named Yan Xuetong who himself wrote at - about a decade ago that the great advantage that the United States had over China was not its wealth and was not its military capability, both of which China was capable of catching up to. It was this vast alliance structure and these vast number of strategic partners, which numbered, when he was counting, something like 50 around the world, compared to China, who has basically no reliable allies in the world. And the same is true of Russia.That was an enormous advantage of the United States, and it was very much a source of American power above and beyond whatever our own material capabilities were. And if we move into a world where instead of having those allies, many of them become independent great powers with their own objectives that have nothing to do with us or are even hostile to us, which is possible, then on the one hand, we're living in a more dangerous world. And on the other hand, we have stripped ourselves of our strongest armor, in a way, by turning all of our allies against us.GROSS: One of the things that Trump seems to want is to say, hey, you take care of your territory. Other countries, you take care of yours. I'm interested - you know, Trump is interested - in the Americas, the Western Hemisphere, our part of the Western Hemisphere, that he's going to be the leader of that and ignore the people across the oceans. Does that sound like the right interpretation?KAGAN: Well, I mean, that is certainly what they have said. That's sort of what the national security strategy sounds like. And so that, if they were doing that, would be like, well, welcome back to America in the 19th - the late 19th century, you know? But in - but as I mentioned before, Trump's actual foreign policy is nothing like that. They are constantly sending administration officials to Europe, to the Munich Security Conference, to Davos, supporting opposition forces in Europe against the sitting governments. The Trump administration has been very active in supporting the AfD, which is a, you know, far-right, almost neo-Nazi party in Germany. They support the right wing in France. They support the right wing in U.K. in the form of Neil Farage.And so they are meddling in the affairs of Europe very, very substantially, and the tariffs are hardly minding our own business. He is attempting to wield power over every nation in the world using these tariffs. They're not about economics. They're about power. Meanwhile, he's removing governments in Venezuela. He's bombing Iran and talking about removing the government in Iran. My point is that, you know, there were - there was a school of foreign policy which, theoretically, Trump was heading toward called restraint. And these are people who think that America should not be so involved in the world. But Trump is the opposite of restrained. He is, you know, really quite deeply involved in the affairs of countries all over the world, and he enjoys that.GROSS: Well, let's take another short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Robert Kagan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. He's an author and a contributing writer for The Atlantic. His latest article in The Atlantic is titled \"America Vs. The World.\" We'll be back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF DON STIERNBERG'S \"FEVER\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Robert Kagan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, an author mostly on foreign policy and a contributing writer for The Atlantic. His latest article is titled \"America Vs. The World.\" Our interview was recorded yesterday.So this might be a depressing answer to this question. But, you know, Martin Luther King said, the arc of history is long, but it bends towards justice. I don't think you believe that.KAGAN: When Martin Luther King was saying those things, that did appear to be the story of the United States, right? I mean, we had moved from slavery to Jim Crow to the Civil Rights Movement. That was progress. Now, I happen to believe that that progress, especially for the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and '60s, was very much a consequence of actual events. It wasn't just the ideas. It was not just history bending in a certain direction. It was specifically the Great Depression and World War II, which basically vanquished a certain kind of antiliberal conservatism in the United States and led to 80 years of liberal ascendancy.And that's what gave us the idea, and which I also share, that America was about progressing toward the perfection of its original intent - you know, the sort of perfection of the principles of the Declaration of Independence in a society that was deeply flawed. But now we see that it isn't always progress. There can be major steps backward, and that's what we're living through right now.GROSS: In terms of the Civil Rights Movement - and it was also, like, very effective protests. It was television showing police fire-hosing...KAGAN: Yeah.GROSS: ...Protesters, dogs sicced on protesters. The whole world saw that.KAGAN: Yeah.GROSS: It was very hard to defend that. And you want to see Americans stand up for democracy. What actions would you like to see Americans take? How do individuals stand up for democracy?KAGAN: Well, I mean, obviously, we see very brave people on the streets of Minneapolis and elsewhere in the country, where they are facing down this brute squad known as ICE. But I also would like to talk about the elite a little bit in America. I mean, I would say the Democratic Party is not doing everything it needs to be doing, even in its own naked self-interest, at this point.The most shocking element of this has been, to me, the collapse of the elites - the universities that cut their deal with Trump, the legal firms that cut their deal with Trump. Corporate America has been absolutely shameful. We're so used to the idea that nobody in a position of actual power - whether you're a billionaire or a university president or a big law firm - we're so used to the idea these people just fold instead of standing up to Trump and showing the necessary courage. But that is what's needed. There is - we need to have courage and lack of selfishness up and down American society.And one of the things that I've noticed in watching all this is just how difficult it is for people, human beings, to recognize that they are in - suddenly in a radically new situation. The desire for normalcy is so powerful. And, you know, you look back on other times when democracies have been taken over by dictatorship, and you always say, how did they let that happen? As we're - as I'm living through it, I see how it happens. You know, we sort of discount all the things that are really quite different about the world and cling to normalcy as best we can. And I just think people need to understand we are not in Kansas anymore. We are living at the edge of the consolidation of dictatorship, and there's no more time for waiting.GROSS: Do you think America will ever return to what, like, you've described as normal? Or do you think when things change, assuming they change, that we'll return to something different, but not what we had in the past?KAGAN: Well, lots of people have been talking about this, and I think it's a very interesting question. You know, what the Trump administration has done to the federal bureaucracy and particularly, as I say, the power ministries - the FBI, the CIA and the Justice Department - is going to be very difficult to undo. I mean, are we going to - every time we have an election, are we going to fire everybody in the federal government because they were put in by a hostile force?I do think that everybody in the government who served the Trump administration will have to go if the Democrats are able to win in 2028, but that is a different America. I mean, that is not an America - the America that we've known for 80 years. It's more like the America of, like, the Andrew Jackson period and, in many ways, worse 'cause I don't think Andrew Jackson was actually a would-be tyrant. So I think it's going to be very hard to put the pieces back together. I - there are instances in history. I don't think, you know - things aren't necessarily over. But I do think it's very hard to go back to what we were after all the destruction that Trump has wreaked, both domestically and internationally.GROSS: Robert Kagan, thank you so much for talking with us.KAGAN: Well, thank you.GROSS: Robert Kagan is a contributing writer at The Atlantic and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

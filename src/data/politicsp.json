Tim Kaine, D-Va., speaks to reporters in the U.S. Capitol Building on Sept. 30.\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   A bipartisan group of Senate Democrats and Republicans reached a deal to reopen the government after the longest shutdown in U.S. history, voting on the first procedural step on the measure.   The agreement would fund the government through Jan. 30 and include full-year funding for a trio of appropriations bills, including full funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, through Sept. 30, 2026, or the end of the fiscal year.   The vote late on Sunday was 60 to 40, with seven Democrats and one independent joining with most Republicans to advance the measure.   It marked the first, but crucial, step towards passing the measure in the Senate. Once the bill cleared the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster, any remaining Senate votes need just a simple majority. However, the legislation still needs to pass the House before the shutdown would end, enabling air traffic controllers and other federal workers to get paid and federal food benefits to resume, among other things.   \n   Senate Democrats had earlier voted against more than a dozen short-term spending measures in their fight to preserve health care subsidies. But as the pain of the shutdown continued to bite, some agreed to more modest changes in the latest framework.   \n   The continuing resolution to fund the government until the end of January would also include language to reverse any reductions in force of federal employees that happened during the shutdown, as well as protections against further such layoffs through the end of the fiscal year, and backpay for all federal employees during the shutdown.   \"I have long said that to earn my vote, we need to be on a path toward fixing Republicans' health care mess and to protect the federal workforce,\" Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said in a statement. \"This deal guarantees a vote to extend Affordable Care Act premium tax credits, which Republicans weren't willing to do.\"   The agreement to reopen the government is also expected to include a Senate vote on health care by the second week of December, on a bill of Democrats' choosing. That informal deal is not part of the legislative text.   Democrats are deeply divided about the compromise measure, which was opposed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.   \n   \"I think it's a terrible mistake,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said of the deal. \"The American people want us to stand and fight for healthcare.\"   \n   Democratic divisions over legislation   Several top Democrats in the House also vowed to vote against the bill.   House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., panned the agreement in a statement before the Senate vote.   \"We will not support spending legislation advanced by Senate Republicans that fails to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" Jeffries said in a statement. \"We will fight the GOP bill in the House of Representatives, where Mike Johnson will be compelled to end the seven week Republican taxpayer-funded vacation.\"   And Democrat Rep. Greg Casar of Texas called the deal a \"betrayal\" and a \"capitulation\" because it doesn't reduce health care costs.   The House has not held a vote since Sept. 19, and previously passed a government funding measure without Democratic support.   The Senate deal on government funding comes after Democrats cruised to a series of electoral victories in the last week, giving some in the party newfound political confidence to continue to fight for health care extensions.   \n   Many Democrats believed that keeping the government shut down gave them their only legislative leverage, with Republicans still in control of Congress and the White House.   Moderate Democrats defended their votes, with some telling reporters that it's the best deal they could do.   Kaine, one of the Democrats who voted for the measure on Sunday, defended his support, saying Democrats would be able to put important health care legislation up for a vote.   \"Lawmakers know their constituents expect them to vote for it, and if they don't, they could very well be replaced at the ballot box by someone who will,\" he said in his statement.\n",

Some faced state prosecutions, while others were never charged.   A proclamation published on Martin's personal X account late Sunday listed 77 people who received \"full, complete, and unconditional\" pardons, including Rudy Giuliani, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, and Sidney Powell, a former Trump attorney who spread conspiracy theories about ballot fraud after Trump lost the 2020 election.   \n   Powell is one of four pardon recipients who previously pleaded guilty in a Georgia court after being indicted for trying to subvert the 2020 election results in Georgia.   The pardons are largely symbolic as none of the names listed were ever charged with federal crimes. Dozens of people listed were charged in multiple swing states that were the center of unfounded claims of election fraud, including Georgia, Nevada, Arizona and Wisconsin. Presidents do not hold the power to pardon state crimes.   \n   The proclamation appeared to have been signed on Friday. It also made clear that Trump was not among those being pardoned. Trump has previously said he had the \"absolute right\" to pardon himself – a claim that remains untested. The Supreme Court granted the president broad immunity for official acts committed during his presidency.   In January, Trump pardoned some 1,500 Jan. 6 rioters who participated in the siege on the U.S. Capitol four years ago. Among those pardoned were Enrique Tarrio, the former Proud Boys chairman, who was convicted of \"seditious conspiracy\" and sentenced to 22 years in the federal penitentiary.   \n   This latest string of pardons, while symbolic, appears to be part of Trump's longstanding efforts to rewrite history and amplify his false claims that the 2020 election, which was won by Joe Biden, was stolen. Pressed about those false claims in a 2022 interview with NPR's Steve Inskeep, Trump repeatedly attempted to cast more misinformation about his election loss, before abruptly ending the call.\n",

    "body": "\n      Prominent conservatives are engaged in a battle over how to respond to antisemitism in their ranks.   \n\n    AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:  This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Ayesha Rascoe. Good morning. There's been fallout from right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson's long and friendly interview with far-right influencer Nick Fuentes last week.(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE TUCKER CARLSON SHOW\")TUCKER CARLSON: Nick Fuentes, thank you for doing this.NICK FUENTES: Yeah, thank you for having me.CARLSON: I've wanted to meet you. I've heard about you.FUENTES: I've heard about you, so...CARLSON: Well, thank you.RASCOE: Fuentes has built an online following promoting many white nationalist and extremist ideas, including Holocaust denial. He's also used violent and degrading rhetoric about women. And a heads up - you'll hear an example of that in this story. As NPR's Sarah McCammon reports, prominent conservatives are now wrestling with how to respond to antisemitism in their ranks.SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Nick Fuentes has suggested that a lot of women want to be raped, claimed that Jim Crow segregation laws were better for Black Americans and expressed admiration for Hitler, among other things. Those kinds of statements have mostly kept Fuentes on the fringes of the conservative movement. But in an episode of \"The Tucker Carlson Show\" published on October 27, Carlson sat down with Fuentes for a friendly conversation that lasted more than two hours. In one exchange, Fuentes invoked an old antisemitic trope, suggesting that Jewish loyalty to Israel and other Jews is standing in the way of a unified American society.(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE TUCKER CARLSON SHOW\")FUENTES: I would say, though, that the main challenge to that, a big challenge to that is organized Jewry in America. I don't think...MCCAMMON: Fuentes then listed several influential Jewish Americans that he claimed were not capable of fostering national unity.(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE TUCKER CARLSON SHOW\")FUENTES: I see Jewishness as the common denominator. And you're right...MCCAMMON: Within days, the interview sparked a backlash among some on the right.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LINDSEY GRAHAM: But I just want to make it really clear, I'm in the Hitler-sucks wing of the Republican Party (laughter).MCCAMMON: That's South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham at the Republican Jewish Coalition meeting in Las Vegas last weekend, where several speakers called out rising antisemitism. But another prominent conservative, Kevin Roberts, the head of the influential think tank The Heritage Foundation, defended Tucker Carlson.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KEVIN ROBERTS: Who remains, and as I have said before, always will be a close friend of the Heritage Foundation - the venomous coalition attacking him are sowing division. Their attempt to cancel him will fail.MCCAMMON: In that video, posted to X on October 30, Roberts also said conservatives should feel free to critique Israel despite pressure from what he described as the globalist class. That sparked backlash from some Heritage staff and allies, including Rabbi Yaakov Menken, with the Coalition for Jewish Values.YAAKOV MENKEN: Obviously, if you want to deride the U.N. as a collection of globalists, that's fine. But if you want to refer to unnamed globalists protesting against antisemitism, hmm, who do I imagine that's talking about?MCCAMMON: Menken was part of a task force Heritage convened to fight antisemitism. Several members, including Menken's organization, ultimately stepped down from the task force in response to Roberts' handling of the situation. On Wednesday, Roberts met with Heritage staff to address the ongoing fallout.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ROBERTS: I didn't know much about this Fuentes guy. I still don't, which underscores the mistake.MCCAMMON: In a video of the meeting published online, senior research fellow Robert Rector said conservatives should learn lessons from when the movement pushed out some of its most extreme voices.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ROBERT RECTOR: You say, oh, we don't cancel. We do cancel. Did we cancel David Duke? Yes. Did we cancel the John Birch Society? Yes - OK? - because they were harmful because if they're in your movement, you look like clowns.MCCAMMON: Rector said he was disturbed both by what he heard from Fuentes and by what he described as Tucker Carlson's failure to ask probing questions. Roberts responded to concerns from Rector and others with this.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ROBERTS: That evil person, Fuentes - although I still have hope for his soul - has an audience of several million people, and at least some of that audience might be open to be converted.MCCAMMON: That evening, Roberts released another video statement, apologizing for his earlier choice of words and also referring to, quote, \"my friend, Tucker Carlson.\" Shortly after, leaders of the antisemitism task force announced they were disaffiliating from Heritage.For his part, Carlson sat down for an interview Thursday with Megyn Kelly, another former Fox News host turned podcaster. Kelly rattled off what she described as a long list of very vile past statements from Fuentes.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MEGYN KELLY: So what do you say to those people saying, why didn't you raise any of that?CARLSON: You know, do your own interview the way that you want to do it. You're not my editor. Buzz off. I mean, I don't know. You want to go yell at Nick Fuentes, I'll give you his cell. Call him.RASCOE: We're now going to bring back in Sarah McCammon. You laid out what's happened in the last couple of weeks. But this isn't the first time that Republicans have had this fight, right?MCCAMMON: Right. President Trump's critics point to a long history of actions and statements that they say have encouraged extremists, like three years ago, when, after facing blowback for dining with Nick Fuentes at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, Trump said on Truth Social that he didn't know Fuentes before hosting him. More recently, Trump's choice of a nominee for the Office of Special Counsel, who had a history of sending white supremacist texts, also caused concern. That nominee withdrew. And, Ayesha, this comes after a scandal involving antisemitic and racist messages exchanged by some Young Republicans.RASCOE: This is all happening at a time when there are rising reports of antisemitic incidents and violence. What are you hearing from Jewish leaders about how this fits into that larger pattern?MCCAMMON: There is a lot of concern about what they're hearing across the political spectrum. But when it comes to Trump, Sam Markstein, with the Republican Jewish Coalition, pointed to his support for Israel and described Trump as the best friend that the Jewish community has ever had in the White House. Now, Amy Spitalnick at the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, which is a progressive group, says this is coming to a head on the right because the optics are just so bad.AMY SPITALNICK: I appreciate the voices who are speaking out right now, but it needs to go hand in hand with the moral clarity and courage to name this normalization of antisemitism wherever it exists within their own party, just as each of us have an obligation to do it in whatever spaces and political arenas we operate in.MCCAMMON: And she says she's concerned about antisemitism across the political spectrum. And if conservatives are truly committed to stamping it out within their ranks, she says they need to hold their movement accountable for the people that they put in leadership.RASCOE: That's NPR's Sarah McCammon. Thank you so much.MCCAMMON: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Trump administration officials on Saturday directed states to \"immediately undo\" any actions they have made to fully fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).   It's the latest in a hail of conflicting court orders and directives to states. Last week, a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration to immediately fully fund SNAP, accusing the government of holding back for \"political purposes\" and causing \"needless suffering.\" The administration said it would send those payments, even as it appealed the order. Then, the Supreme Court on Friday granted a request to pause full payments while the appeals court considers the issue.   \n   Now the administration is threatening that states that do send full payments to SNAP recipients may end up having to cover the costs themselves, and could also face financial penalties.   The U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a statement Saturday that any such payments were \"unauthorized\" and sending full payments \"may result in USDA taking various actions, including cancellation of the Federal share of State administrative costs and holding States liable for any over issuances that result from the noncompliance.\"   The USDA said states must continue to reduce the benefits they are sending by 35%, as the Trump administration had instructed states to do last week to comply with an earlier court order.   Rhode Island is one of several states that had already sent full benefits to SNAP recipients before the Supreme Court temporarily halted full payments.   In a statement Sunday, Democratic Gov. Dan McKee railed against President Trump, saying he \"intentionally created chaos for states across the country — playing games with people's ability to feed their families, weaponizing hunger, and gaslighting the American people. It's inhumane.\"   McKee said he was working on contingency options \"to protect Rhode Islanders against President Trump's volatility.\"   Even before the Trump administration threatened consequences for states that send full payments, some two dozen states, including Rhode Island, asked a federal judge in Massachusetts for protection.   \n   In a brief filed Saturday, the states said they feared that the federal government \"may attempt to recoup funds from the States that the States' residents have used to feed themselves and their families.\" That could amount to hundreds of million dollars, they said, and would \"risk catastrophic operational disruptions for the States, with a consequent cascade of harms for their residents.\"   Trump administration officials did not respond to requests for comment.   But over the weekend, Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins took to X to blame Democrats for the lapse in benefits, and railed against \"activist judges\" who have ordered \"reckless and unconstitutional legal maneuvers\" to force funding that Congress didn't appropriate. Speaking to Fox News, Rollins borrowed language from anti-Trump activists.   \"It's interesting, the 'No Kings' rally, where they said 'we don't want a King in America,'\" Rollins said. \"Except now they want a king who can create money out of the clear blue sky.\"   Meanwhile, SNAP recipients remain in limbo, as do the organizations that serve them.   The Facing Hunger Foodbank in Huntington, W.V., has tripled the volume of food distributions that are usual this time of year, according to CEO Cynthia Kirkhart. People are struggling, she says, and all the uncertainty has just exacerbated their pain.   \"The news comes out that we are going to get SNAP benefits. Then, we aren't going to get SNAP benefits. This is much worse. Folks get their hopes built up and then they crash. It's a lot,\" Kirkhart sighs. \"We can do better.\"\n",

Brazil will host COP30 from November 10-21 in the northern city of Belém.\n                \n                    Wagner Meier/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Wagner Meier/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Most of the world's nations are gathering in Brazil's northern city of Belém to negotiate the ongoing response to climate change. The United Nations annual climate summit, called COP30, begins Monday and is expected to last about two weeks.   This year, the U.S. will not play an active role in the talks. According to a White House statement to NPR, no high-level officials will attend COP30 — breaking a long-standing tradition.   During the previous Trump administration, U.S. delegates participated in the talks. Now, the administration has taken a stronger anti-climate stance, calling efforts to limit global warming a \"hoax.\"   \n   \"President Trump will not jeopardize our country's economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries,\" says White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.   President Trump began to de-prioritize climate in January, when he withdrew the U.S. from the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. In that accord, countries agreed to try to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally less than 1.5 C (2.7 F). The planet is currently on track to warm roughly 2.8 C (5 F) over preindustrial levels by 2100, according to a recent U.N. climate report.   Since the Paris Agreement, the U.S. developed policies to cut climate pollution in ways that would lower future warming. But the Trump administration's sweeping rollbacks to climate policy are affecting those efforts, as well as communities' ability to cope with climate risks, like lengthening extreme heat seasons and increasingly destructive wildfires or floods. Climate experts worry that because the U.S. is setting an example, other countries might pull back on climate goals, too.   If all U.S. climate efforts were discontinued, the U.N. report estimates, the planet could warm by an extra 0.1 C — a small fraction of the total change to the planet, but a chunk that could still have significant real-life impacts.   \n   \"Each fraction of a degree matters for communities facing floods, drought, and heat extremes,\" says Ko Barrett, deputy secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization.   Here are six major shifts in U.S. climate policy initiated by the Trump administration.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                During his two terms in office, President Donald Trump has taken steps to roll back or weaken environmental and climate policy. This term, the administration has made significant changes, from cutting federal support for renewable power to dismantling climate research efforts at agencies like NOAA.\n                \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Rolling back longstanding policies to target climate pollution   In March, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to target more than two dozen rules and policies in what the agency called the \"most consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history.\"   One key component of the administration's efforts focuses on attempting to reverse the \"endangerment finding,\" a legal basis for many of the country's climate policies.   In 2009, the EPA labeled carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses a danger to public health and welfare. But legal challenges from fossil fuel interests and their allies delayed the finalization of rules to rein in greenhouse gas pollution. Now, the Trump administration wants to eliminate that 2009 endangerment finding, which could make it easier to roll back other climate regulations.   In July, Trump's EPA argued that the country's climate pollution is not harming people and doesn't need to be regulated in the way courts and previous administrations have chosen to do it.   Reconsidering limits on climate pollution from power plants   In March, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to target more than two dozen rules and policies in what the agency called the \"most consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history.\"   One key component focuses on reversing the \"endangerment finding,\" a legal basis for many federal climate policies such as improving vehicle mileage and cutting power plant pollution.   In 2009, the EPA labeled carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses a danger to public health and welfare. Now, the Trump administration wants to eliminate that endangerment finding, making it easier to roll back other climate regulations.   In July, Trump's EPA argued that the country's climate pollution is not harming people and doesn't need to be regulated.   \n   Reconsidering limits on climate pollution from power plants   In June, the Trump administration announced plans to repeal limits on greenhouse gas emissions and other airborne pollutants from the nation's fossil fuel-fired power plants. If the proposal survives expected legal challenges and is finalized, it would eliminate controls on the second-largest source of climate pollution in the U.S., behind transportation.   The administration argues U.S. coal and gas-fired power plants are responsible for about 3% of global greenhouse gases that are heating the planet. It says that number is declining — it was 5.5% in 2005. So, the administration argues, reducing it further would provide little benefit to public health. That ignores that the U.S. is responsible for nearly a quarter of the climate pollution in the atmosphere today–more than any other nation, historically.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                During the Biden administration, the Environmental Protection Agency developed rules to reduce carbon emissions and mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants and other pollution sources. Now, several of those rules are being rolled back or reconsidered under the Trump administration.\n                \n                    Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Withdrawing support for renewable energy technologies    The Trump administration is taking steps to open up more areas of U.S. land and ocean to increased oil and gas exploration. At the same time, it has been dismantling federal support for wind and solar industries, which it falsely labels as risky and unreliable.   The new GOP spending law ends federal tax incentives for wind and solar, throwing into limbo thousands of projects. The Trump administration has also canceled more than $13 billion in funds for green energy projects and tried to halt offshore wind projects already under construction. Energy experts say it's too early to know the full impact of these policies, but in the first half of 2025, U.S. renewable investment fell by 36%, according to data from BloombergNEF.   The Trump administration is also targeting subsidies for consumers to buy climate solutions like rooftop solar, efficient heat pumps, and electric vehicles. And it ended a $7 billion grant program for local solar projects. Federal incentives for rooftop solar, heat pumps, and insulation go away Dec. 31. Tax credits for electric vehicles ended Sept. 30.   \n   Cutting climate-preparedness grants nationwide   The Trump administration has also cancelled grants for climate and environmental initiatives around the country. Grant recipients, contractors and activists say the moves have thrown into doubt the government's standing as a reliable partner.   Funding cuts have targeted a range of energy projects, as well, from transmission lines to research on capturing carbon from the atmosphere. Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the moves would set back American innovation and competitiveness.   Democratic lawmakers warn that cancelling Energy Department funding risks driving up utility bills and slowing economic growth at a time when new data centers and factories are expected to increase electricity demand for the first time in decades.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A tropical analysis meteorologist works at his station at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida, in May 2025. Earlier this year, the Trump administration fired hundreds of NOAA staff and deleted government websites with data on weather and climate.\n                \n                    Chandan Khanna/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chandan Khanna/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Slashing federal support for climate science and removing climate data   The Trump administration has systematically removed climate science and climate scientists from the federal government. One of the administration's targets was the National Climate Assessment, which is the most influential and widely-used source of information about how climate change affects the United States. In April, the Trump administration dismissed those who were working on the next edition of the report. In July, the federal website that hosted the most recent edition went dark.   The administration also slashed funding for climate science research at agencies like NOAA, NASA, and even USDA. The cuts have affected long-standing data collection efforts and datasets, like NOAA's Billion Dollar Disaster analysis, which keeps track of the ballooning costs of climate-worsened disasters like wildfires, hurricanes, hailstorms, and floods. The database was discontinued in May.   Lowering federal support for disaster relief and preparedness   As wildfires, hurricanes and storms get more intense, disasters that exceed more than a billion dollars in damage are on the rise. Many communities rely on federal support to prepare, including building flood protection projects, improving evacuation planning and fortifying hospitals and other vital infrastructure. The Trump administration has cancelled more than $4 billion in grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, leaving many communities scrambling to replace that funding and prevent damage from worsening hazards. The Trump administration has said it wants states to take over disaster preparation.\n",

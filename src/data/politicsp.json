He also appeared increasingly infirm in Davos.   \n\n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  Relatively balmy, cloudy with a high in the 40s today in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland. And talk of Greenland is where we begin with NPR senior contributor Ron Elving. Ron, thanks so much for being with us.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to chill out with you, Scott.SIMON: At the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, President Trump said he'd reached a framework for a deal on Greenland. What kind of deal seems to be at hand after weeks of threats of military action and tariffs and musing about buying Greenland?ELVING: We don't have all the details yet, and there's a good deal yet to be learned and assessed for significance. The U.S. looks to have more military presence beyond the Pituffik base - used to be called Thule. We have that in Greenland, and it's been part of the Distant Early Warning system for generations now. But we also expect to see more mining of strategic materials, such as the rare earths, essential to computers and other high-tech products. The deal would bolster the presence of NATO in general in the Arctic and restrict Russian and Chinese efforts to get mining rights for those rare earths in Greenland. Those two items speak to the fears expressed in a lot of President Trump's rhetoric when he was talking about seizing the territory by force.SIMON: Ron, I want to be careful about raising this, but I think it's important to ask you. President Trump rambled a lot in his remarks at Davos. He referred to Greenland as Iceland several times. He mocked the sacrifices, lives lost of U.S. allies and seemed not to know that, in fact, NATO had come to the defense of the United States after 9/11. President Biden had a shaky debate performance. There were calls from both parties for him to step down. Has President Trump's conduct made his mental health a genuine concern?ELVING: One big difference between this moment and the Biden debate is that Trump is not on the ballot in November the way Biden was. But hundreds of other Republicans are, as candidates for Congress and state offices. The Biden example is not lost on those campaigns. And they will be hearing questions. Trump will be 80 in June. People notice changes in his walk and his talk and changes on his face and his hands. Then they start noticing behavior, noticing when he loses his temper repeatedly over small things or when he says adverse polls in The New York Times are fake and fraudulent and should be treated as a criminal offense or when he goes on sending social media messages well into the wee hours.This kind of change in a president was not discussed publicly in the past. But in the wide-open ethos of 21st-century social media, Scott, nothing seems out of bounds. So we have to begin seeing mentions of the 25th Amendment, which was enacted 60 years ago to set a formal procedure in situations that might arise if the president were incapacitated. And it's only been used in temporary situations up to now, such as the president undergoing surgery.SIMON: Canada's Prime Minister Carney had strong words for the president in Davos. Brussels Thursday, President Macron of France urged his fellow EU leaders to implement economic anticoercion measures against the U.S., referred to as a trade bazooka. EU did not agree, but Germany also expressed interest. What does this tell us about the state of the U.S. among those nations usually considered its staunchest allies?ELVING: It says that no matter how politely people may smile and applaud in the audience, they do have ears and egos. World leaders, such as we saw at Davos, have national pride and personal pride, just as we do. And they don't appreciate being treated as junior partners or ungrateful children.SIMON: House Oversight Committee voted to hold Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton in contempt for refusing to comply with subpoenas in their investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. Lawyers for the Clintons say they have communicated voluntarily with the committee but that the subpoenas were a ploy to attempt to embarrass political rivals. Where does this go now?ELVING: Two senior advisers from Trump's first term went to jail rather than cooperate with Congress. I doubt anyone expects the Clinton case to go that route, but one unintended consequence could happen. It may keep the Epstein saga in the news at a time when it might have been losing some steam.SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving. Thanks so much. Take care.ELVING: Thank you, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

Many scholars of democracy say that these moves are unprecedented in U.S. history and that Trump has pushed the United States toward authoritarianism.    The president and his supporters counter that the Constitution provides for precisely the type of muscular presidency he is exercising and that voters gave him a mandate to enact far-reaching changes to government.   Trump remains popular with his base, but most Americans disapprove of his job performance. The president's critics hope that waning popularity — as well as this year's midterm elections — will provide a stronger check on Trump.   \n   So what has happened so far? From firing inspectors general, to sidelining Congress, to attacking the media to control information, Trump and his administration have moved at warp speed from the moment he was sworn in.   As Year 2 of his second term begins, we wanted to look at just some of the ways the president has expanded his authority beyond what his predecessors have done and how his administration has tested the constitutional foundations of the country.   CHECKS AND BALANCES   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Jackie Lay/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Aided by a pliant Republican-led Congress, Trump and his administration have numerous times stretched the power of the executive branch into areas of governance normally reserved for the legislative branch. His aides have pulled back funds appropriated by lawmakers, who constitutionally control federal purse strings. The president has implemented sweeping foreign tariffs, using existing sources of authority in new, expansive ways. And his administration has remade or demolished whole federal departments.   Other checks on a president's power, such as federal inspectors general and agency appointees who previously were insulated from White House influence, have also been sidelined.

He has intimidated major news outlets, defunded public media and made it increasingly difficult for journalists to report on his government, even threatening to jail reporters who won't identify government sources. The Trump administration has sought to erase parts of American history in the nation's museums, and the State Department was instructed to reject visa applications due to some applicants' alleged roles in \"censorship.\"    Loading... \n      RULE OF LAW   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Jackie Lay/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Trump has bulldozed through a norm separating the White House and the Department of Justice, openly using the DOJ to pursue an agenda of retribution by seeking investigations and prosecutions of his political foes. He has liberally used the pardon power to the benefit of allies, including those who were convicted of violent crimes during the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. Federal judges have accused the Trump administration of defying their orders and rebuked the administration for aggressive immigration tactics and attempts to consolidate Americans' sensitive data. And while Trump says he is overseeing a return of law and order, he frequently uses inciting language himself.    Loading... \n      TRUMP, FAMILY BUSINESS AND POWER   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Jackie Lay/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Trump has taken other steps to consolidate power and demonstrate that he alone is in charge. His name and face seem to be everywhere. He receives fawning foreign visitors bearing gifts for him in a newly gold-adorned Oval Office.   And Trump continues to flex his power by mixing policy with the business interests of his family and allies, casting aside any ethical concerns.    Loading... \n      PUBLIC HEALTH AND SCIENCE   The Trump administration has upended the institutions charged with protecting public health and conducting scientific research. Initiatives that once enjoyed bipartisan support and are the shared responsibility of the states and the federal government saw their funding slashed. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. led the overhaul of the children's vaccine schedule, sidelining expert advisers and slashing the number of recommended immunizations. There have been disruptions and turmoil for federally funded research, including at the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The administration abruptly halted USAID's global health work, which had saved millions of lives from scourges like AIDS, malaria and malnutrition over the course of six decades.

Members of a U.S. congressional delegation laid a wreath there on Jan. 17, after a visit to voice support for Denmark and Greenland.\n                \n                    Ida Marie Odgaard/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Ida Marie Odgaard/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   COPENHAGEN, Denmark — On a recent chilly afternoon in Copenhagen, sitting outside a cafe with blinking heat lamps, Company Sergeant Major Henrik Bager shared a Danish expression.   \"You have a cup. When it's filled, you need to empty it so you don't get stressed or angry or to do stupid stuff,\" he explained.   Earlier this month, his cup was full — after escalating rhetoric from President Trump and others in his administration about how Denmark hasn't done enough to secure Greenland, that they've been a poor ally.    \"The first time it felt like a punch to the gut,\" said Bager, who has deployed five times to serve alongside Americans, including in Afghanistan and Iraq. \"You can survive one punch in the gut. When it just keeps on going, then it fills you up with sadness, disappointment, anger.\"   \n   So he emptied those feelings into a letter that reads like a poem. He sent it via Facebook to former U.S. Ambassador to Denmark Rufus Gifford.   Dear Rufus Gifford,I’m not writing as a politician.Not as an analyst.I’m writing as a Danish Afghanistan and Iraq veteran.And yes – this brings tears to my eyes.When the U.S. today calls Denmark a poor ally, it feels like a slap in the face to those of us who were actually there.After 9/11, Denmark did not hesitate.We didn’t debate polls.We didn’t calculate politics.We put on our gear.We said goodbye to our families.We kissed our children goodnight and hoped we’d see them again.We stood side by side with American soldiers.We patrolled together.We covered each other.We bled together.And we lost people.Danish soldiers never came back home because we took the alliance seriously – not as words, but as a promise between soldiers.So when Denmark is called disloyal, it doesn’t just hit a country.It hits those of us who wore the uniform.It hits the fallen.It hits the families still paying the price.We don’t expect thanks.We don’t expect applause.But we do expect honesty.And respect for history.Denmark was there when it mattered.And we were not half-hearted.A solider never forgets who stood by his side.Nations shouldn’t either.Thanks for your voice, you have the respect from the Danish people.   \n   \n            \n      Listen: Company Sgt. Maj. Henrik Bager reads his letter to former U.S. ambassador Rufus Gifford\n   \n        \n                  1:32\n        \n\n\n      \n   \n   Bager never expected a response.   But Gifford did see it.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Former U.S. Ambassador to Denmark Rufus Gifford (L) and Company Sergeant Major Henrik Bager (R) meet for the first time on Jan. 19. Bager sent a letter to Gifford earlier this month expressing his sadness and disappointment at the way in which the Trump administration has been talking about Denmark.\n                \n                    Barbara Sprunt/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Barbara Sprunt/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"I got so emotional when I read it,\" Gifford said. \"It hits me right here — in the heart.\" Bager and Gifford met in person for the first time on Monday, and jointly spoke with NPR.   Gifford said his reaction is borne, in part, from a sense of responsibility. Denmark is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), along with the U.S.    \"You think about the success of this alliance, which is about sticking up for your friends just as much as it is about sticking up for yourself,\" Gifford said. \"You think about Article Five, this idea that if you attack one of us, you attack all of us, which has only been invoked once — and that was after 9/11, which is why Henrik went to Afghanistan.\"   Bager said he served as a squad leader in the Helmand Province in southern Afghanistan in 2009, one of the deadliest battlegrounds of the war.   \"We had the Taliban at our doorstep,\" he said.   His father died during that deployment.   \"I went home, buried him, said goodbye to my sister and mother again, and then I flew back and fulfilled my task,\" he recalled. \"That's how devoted we are when we go out — the Danish soldiers.\"   He said three Danish soldiers were killed and another 22 wounded during his deployment. Denmark had one of the highest per capita death rates among allied countries during the conflict — 43 recorded deaths — a reality that has weighed heavily on a country with a population of roughly 6 million people.    \"For those families who didn't get their soldier home, sitting and listening to this rhetoric being used, it must be more painful, hurtful than it is for me — and I can feel it all the way to my bones,\" he said.   \n   Bager, 47, described how Danish soldiers plan their potential funerals, should the worst happen.   \"What kind of songs we want to have played in the church, what flowers we want to have on the coffin,\" he remembered.   They write goodbye letters, too.   \"A letter for my mom, dad, my sister, my nephews, my kids, my wife — you don't just write one letter,\" he said. \"You want to make it very personal because it's the last words your family will hear from you.\"   Gifford said it's a reminder of the sacrifice Danes have made in the name of the longstanding alliance between Denmark and the U.S.   \"The idea that we would, over the course of one year, create an adversarial relationship with the best friends that we have on the planet is just unthinkable to me,\" he said.   \"Trust is something that takes years to build and you can break it in an instant,\" Gifford added. \"We have been spending decades building trust across borders, in particular with our NATO allies, and it breaks my heart in such a profound way to see the rate at which that trust has eroded in the last year.\"   Bager made a point of acknowledging his American brothers-in-arms.   \"If any American veterans are listening to this, thank you for your service,\" he said. \"I hope that in the future, we can meet up again — hopefully not on the battlefield, but on other missions that are more peaceful. Freedom runs deep for those who fight for it.\"   \"All those deaths seem disrespected\"   Bager's is one of a chorus of voices in Denmark expressing pain and disappointment with the rhetoric coming from the Trump administration.   Last spring, Vice President Vance told Fox News that Denmark was \"not being a good ally\" and not doing enough to defend Greenland. More recently, Trump has ramped up his crusade for the U.S. to acquire Greenland, ignoring Danish sovereignty.   \n   \"A lot of people know people who have served and who have died in Afghanistan,\" said Villads Welling, a 21-year-old political science student at the University of Copenhagen. \"And all of those deaths seem disrespected and like they don't matter now because [the Trump administration] is saying that Denmark is not doing enough and they are not a good ally.\"    Peter Jensen, 63, said the casual way Trump has talked about acquiring Greenland is offensive, and throws into question the longstanding relationship and alliances between the U.S. and Denmark.   \"Betrayal is probably the best word,\" Jensen told NPR. \"Someone you trust, someone you'd do your best to back up when needed, and suddenly — they stab your back.\"   Jensen's son and son-in-law are veterans.   \"Having kids going to war, I can tell you, this is heartbreaking,\" he said. \"You thought you were tough. They are young — they [think] they are invincible. But you are older and you know they're not invincible.\"   While Trump once flirted with the idea of acquiring Greenland by force, he ruled it out in a speech Wednesday. But Jensen said damage has already been done.   \"This is not forgotten,\" he said. \"Even if things calm down around Greenland tomorrow, there are already some long-term effects on what has happened here.\"   He's quick to emphasize his anger and disappointment is directed at the White House — not the American people.   \"Remember that we love America, we love you — but the present administration is just making chaos,\" he said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Søren Knudsen, a retired officer with the Danish Army, and his wife Gina Schaar at their home in Køge, Denmark. The couple said they worry the Trump administration's rhetoric about Denmark risks a fundamental change in the relationship between Denmark and the U.S.\n                \n                    Barbara Sprunt/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Barbara Sprunt/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Taking the Stars and Stripes down    Søren Knudsen, a retired officer with the Danish army, said one of the proudest acknowledgments he's received in his 42-year career came after he served as deputy commander of a NATO mission in Afghanistan.   \"Upon leaving the mission in 2012, the Americans honored me with the Stars and Stripes that were flown in the face of the enemy,\" he said.   \n   \"That was a great, great honor. If you give your national colors to a representative of another nation — that is not just something you do. That means a lot,\" he said. Knudsen was also awarded a Bronze Star.   He and his wife Gina Schaar, who is American-born, hung the framed flag and plaque proudly in the entrance of their home in Ølby.   \"If you have gotten such a strong token that you were so proud of, you would show it to everyone — the first thing they see when they entered our house was this,\" Knudsen said in an interview in his home.   That changed after Vance's comments last spring, which left Knudsen with a mix of emotions: \"pain, betrayal, sadness.\"   \"I walked down the stairs and said, no way, I'm not going to show this,\" he said, pointing to the wall where it once was displayed. \"It was an award that I got on behalf of my efforts, my country's efforts, my comrades' efforts, and now they say it doesn't matter anymore.\"   Knudsen took the frame down. In its place hangs a painting of a vase with white tulips.   \"I was always so proud that I'm married to a foreigner, and yet he is supporting my country. He is risking his safety and his security in support of a mission that my country has asked,\" Schaar said. \"That was something that strengthened our bond as an international couple, and so it feels even worse to have that disparaged.\"   The couple said they worry the Trump administration's rhetoric about Denmark risks a fundamental change in the relationship between their two countries.   \"It's brute power, and no more history,\" Knudsen, 65, said. \"No more alliances. No more confidence.\"   Schaar added she never thought it would get to this point.   \"I never dreamed that there would be this antagonism between two places that I love.\"   \n   Knudsen, who serves as the vice chairman of the Danish Veterans Association, said it's important for Americans to understand how popular the U.S has been in Denmark.   \"The Danes have felt the U.S. was a beacon and a leader of the free world,\" he said. \"What [Danish soldiers] went out for was defending values alongside America, alongside the nation that we believed in.\"   Knudsen said the present situation is so painful because he believes in the transatlantic alliance, in the economic, security and cultural ties that have bound the U.S. and Denmark together.   \"Gina has taught me this, and I need to stay focused on this — there could be a day where the Stars and Stripes would come up again,\" he said. \"I hope one day there is a comeback.\"\n",

At a recent speech in Detroit, even he seemed a bit surprised at everything he's been able to do.   \"I told you we were going to do a lot of things,\" he said. \"Nobody thought it was going to turn out like this. This has been crazy.\"   One big reason is Trump has faced less internal resistance from his staff, Cabinet and the Republican majority in Congress than in his first term.   Back then, Trump bristled at aides who reined in his impulses — and there were a lot of them, says Ty Cobb, an attorney who served as Trump's special counsel in 2017 and 2018.   \n   \"Trump was still learning the levers of government and had not yet determined, as he has now, that he can do whatever he wants if he finds the people who are willing to be loyal to him,\" he said.   Cobb gave examples, saying former chief of staff John Kelly, former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, former ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley would all tell the president \"no\" from time to time. Others he said would stall or parry Trump's demands.   Marc Short puts it a little differently. He was chief of staff for Vice President Mike Pence during the first term. He says initially Trump wanted people with experience, who could give him advice.   \"The second time around, the president knows what he wants and he intentionally put together a team that would execute that,\" he said.   White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said as much in a sit-down with a pro-Trump podcast called The Mom View.   \"There's one star of the show,\" said Wiles. \"There's one most powerful. And our job is to make him the best he can be. And that's what we do, all day, every day.\"   Trump doesn't always listen or do what she recommends, but Wiles added that she doesn't want him to.   \n   Wiles' approach was affirmed by Vice President Vance in an interview with Chris Whipple, an expert on White House chiefs of staff who spent months interviewing Wiles and other top officials for a piece in Vanity Fair.    \"There is this idea that people have that I think was very common in the first administration,\" Vance told Whipple, \"that their objective was to control the president or influence the president, or even manipulate the president because they had to in order to serve the national interest. Susie just takes the diametrically opposite viewpoint, which is that she's a facilitator, that the American people have elected Donald Trump. And her job is to actually facilitate his vision and to make his vision come to life.\"   As a result, Whipple says Trump has faced very little friction as he and his administration moved at light speed to enact an agenda with his wishes guiding the way.   \"He's governing by whim. He's unconstrained,\" Whipple said in an interview with NPR. \"He's certainly without someone who can tell him hard truths.\"   \n   In his second term, Trump is indeed pushing the bounds of what was thought to be established law, citing nearly unlimited Article 2 executive power.   The president signed more executive orders in his first year than in his entire first term. He sent the National Guard into cities in blue states and is threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act. He ordered the prosecution of his enemies and pardoned his supporters, including those convicted of assaulting police. He used emergency powers to impose sweeping tariffs and took military action in Iran and Venezuela, all without congressional approval or even much pushback.   \"Presidents have always had discretion, but Trump has taken it to another level,\" said Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth College.   \"You know, he's pushing on an open door. There's a reason he's able to get away with so much because we've created such a powerful institution, but he's going further than we've ever seen a president go,\" he added.   \n   It appears likely the U.S. Supreme Court will pare back some of the powers Trump has claimed, though with a conservative supermajority he has already notched a lot of wins.   But there may be political costs to being able to do whatever he wants.   Trump's approval rating is at a low point, though his base is still with him. But independent voters have broken away. A new poll from The New York Times and Sienna finds a majority of voters believe Trump has focused on the wrong priorities.\n",

Here is what to know.   The victim was an ICU nurse who loved the outdoors   Pretti, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident and an ICU nurse, has been identified by officials as the shooting victim.   The victim's father Michael Pretti told the Associated Press his son had participated in the protests because he \"cared about people deeply and he was very upset with what was happening in Minneapolis and throughout the United States with ICE, as millions of other people are upset.\"   \n   His mother, Susan Pretti, told the AP her son was passionate about the environment and \"took his dog everywhere he went.\"   Neighbors were also shocked by his death. Jeanne Wiener, who lived next door to Pretti, told MPR News that she would chat with him when he was walking his dog around their Lyndale neighborhood.   \"He was a calm person; he's a nurse,\" Wiener said Saturday. \"I'm mad. I'm angry. This was a good person. This is not a violent person.\"   Dr. Dimitri Drekonja, who worked at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center with Pretti, remembered him as an \"incredibly competent person\" who was good at his job.   \"There is no reason for a guy like that to be dead, let alone to be killed by the agents of a government that employed him,\" Drekonja also told MPR News, adding that Pretti was a sweet, kind man who loved the outdoors and mountain biking.   Pretti's parents said they were \"sickened\" by Trump administration officials suggesting their son was a \"domestic terrorist.\"   Federal officials defended Border Patrol Agents   Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem defended the officers' actions on Saturday and said they \"acted according to their training.\" Noem also accused Pretti of \"brandishing\" his weapon and that he \"attacked\" officers.   \n   \"This looks like a situation where an individual arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement,\" Noem told reporters during a press conference.   Officials said Pretti had a 9mm semiautomatic handgun with him.   Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol commander, said the officer who fired shots was \"highly trained\" and has worked as a Border Patrol agent for the last eight years. Bovino said the shooting remains under investigation.   Bystander videos don't support key details from government   Bystander videos posted on social media appear to contradict DHS' account of the shooting.   Footage appears to show Pretti being surrounded by multiple federal agents, with several restraining him and punching him while he is on the ground before he is shot. Multiple rounds of gunfire can be heard as Pretti lies on the ground.   So far, there has been no video showing that Pretti brandished or tried to use the firearm that federal officials said he had in his possession.   Minneapolis officials are questioning the DHS account   Pretti had no criminal record and his only known interaction with police involved traffic tickets, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara. He also was a lawful gun owner with a permit to legally carry a gun, O'Hara also said on Saturday.   Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said during a press conference he plans to seek a temporary restraining order from a judge on Monday that would grant \"immediate relief\" to stop the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.   Frey also said he sent a request to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for assistance from the National Guard to support \"the limited number of officers that we have in the Minneapolis Police Department.\"   Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar condemned the shooting and called for immigration officers to leave the state.   \"Our message is really clear and straightforward. We need ICE out of Minnesota,\" Klobuchar said during a press conference. \"They are not making us more safe, as the tragic, tragic killing this morning, as people saw it viscerally on that video shows us, they are making us less safe.\"   \n   Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called the shooting \"sickening\" and said the state \"has had it\" in a social media post on Saturday. Walz said he spoke with the White House about the shooting and said \"the President must end this operation.\"   Walz also said he was glad there was footage of the incident, saying: \"Thank God, thank God, we have video because, according to DHS, these seven heroic guys took an onslaught of a battalion against them or something. It's nonsense, people. It is nonsense, and it's lies.\"   This is the third ICE-related shooting in Minneapolis    It is the second killing involving federal immigration officers in Minneapolis this month after ICE officers shot Renee Macklin Good on Jan. 7 in her SUV as she drove away after partially blocking a Minneapolis street.    In another incident, Julio Cesar Sosa-Celia, a Venezuelan national, was shot in the leg by immigration officers during an altercation with those agents.   NPR's Cheryl W.

It called for \"a sharp shift — in approach, focus, and tone.\" That translated to a blunt assessment that allies would take on more of the burden countering nations from Russia to North Korea.   \"For too long, the U.S. Government neglected — even rejected — putting Americans and their concrete interests first,\" read the opening sentence.   \n   It capped off a week of animosity between President Donald Trump's administration and traditional allies like Europe, with Trump threatening to impose tariffs on some European partners to press a bid to acquire Greenland before announcing a deal that lowered the temperature.   \n   As allies confront what some see as a hostile attitude from the U.S., they will almost certainly be unhappy to see that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's department will provide \"credible options to guarantee U.S. military and commercial access to key terrain,\" especially Greenland and the Panama Canal.   Following a tiff this week at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, the strategy at once urges cooperation with Canada and other neighbors while still issuing a stark warning.   \"We will engage in good faith with our neighbors, from Canada to our partners in Central and South America, but we will ensure that they respect and do their part to defend our shared interests,\" the document says. \"And where they do not, we will stand ready to take focused, decisive action that concretely advances U.S. interests.\"   Much like the White House's National Security Strategy that preceded it, the defense blueprint reinforces Trump's \"America First\" philosophy, which favors nonintervention overseas, questions decades of strategic relationships and prioritizes U.S. interests. The National Defense Strategy last was published in 2022 under then-President Joe Biden and focused on China as America's \"pacing challenge.\"   \n   Western Hemisphere   The strategy simultaneously courts help from partners in America's backyard, while warning them that the U.S. will \"actively and fearlessly defend America's interests throughout the Western Hemisphere.\"   It specifically points to access to the Panama Canal and Greenland. It comes just days after Trump said he reached a \"framework of a future deal\" on Arctic security with NATO leader Mark Rutte that would offer the U.S. \"total access\" to Greenland, a territory of NATO ally Denmark.   Danish officials, who spoke Thursday on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations, say formal negotiations have yet to begin.   Trump previously suggested that the U.S. should potentially consider retaking control of the Panama Canal and accused Panama of ceding influence to China. Asked this week if the U.S. reclaiming the canal was still on the table, Trump demurred.   \"I don't want to tell you that,\" the president responded. \"Sort of, I must say, sort of. That's sort of on the table.\"   The Pentagon also touted the operation that ousted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro earlier this month, saying \"all narco-terrorists should take note.\"   China and the greater Asia-Pacific region   The new policy document views China — which the Biden administration saw as a top adversary — as a settled force in the Indo-Pacific region that only needs to be deterred from dominating the U.S. or its allies.   The goal \"is not to dominate China; nor is it to strangle or humiliate them,\" the document says. It later adds, \"This does not require regime change or some other existential struggle.\"   \"President Trump seeks a stable peace, fair trade, and respectful relations with China,\" it says, which follows efforts to climb down from a trade war sparked by the administration's sky-high tariffs. It says it will \"open a wider range of military-to-military communications\" with China's army.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Donald Trump speaks at his Mar-a-Lago club, Saturday, Jan. 3, 2026, in Palm Beach, Fla., as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth listens.\n                \n                    Alex Brandon/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Brandon/AP\n    \n\n   \n   The strategy, meanwhile, makes no mention of or guarantee to Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its own and says it will take by force if necessary. The U.S. is obligated by its own laws to give military support to Taiwan.   \n   By contrast, the Biden administration's 2022 strategy said the U.S. would \"support Taiwan's asymmetric self-defense.\"   In another example of offloading regional security to allies, the document says, \"South Korea is capable of taking primary responsibility for deterring North Korea with critical but more limited U.S. support.\"   Europe   While saying that \"Russia will remain a persistent but manageable threat to NATO's eastern members for the foreseeable future,\" the defense strategy asserts that NATO allies are much more powerful and so are \"strongly positioned to take primary responsibility for Europe's conventional defense.\"   It says the Pentagon will play a key role in NATO \"even as we calibrate U.S. force posture and activities in the European theater\" to focus on priorities closer to home.

But among federal leaders, the questions appear only to be coming from Democrats. The lack of widespread inquiry over policies that may have factored into a high-profile death involving a federal agent has drawn comparisons to another episode, more than 30 years ago, that prompted sweeping changes.   \n   In August of 1992, in an incident often referred to as \"Ruby Ridge,\" armed federal officers were engaged in an 11-day standoff outside a cabin in northern Idaho. The agents were tasked with arresting Randall Weaver, a white separatist, over his failure to appear in court on charges that he illegally sold firearms to an undercover government agent. Ultimately, three people died: a deputy U.S. marshall, Weaver's 14-year-old son and Weaver's wife. Weaver had connections to the neo-Nazi Aryan Nations and held antisemitic, anti-government beliefs. Though many in policy-making and legislative positions may have found his views repellant, that did not distract from bipartisan concern that the federal enforcement operation may have overstepped constitutional bounds.   \"If you take the rules of engagement [at Ruby Ridge] on their face and in a vacuum, they are unconstitutional,\" then-Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick testified during an October, 1995 Senate subcommittee hearing about the incident. It was during those hearings that Gorelick announced to senators that the Department of Justice had, as a result, formulated its first \"uniform, written deadly force policy\" applicable to all of its law enforcement agencies.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                This Aug. 23, 1992, file photo shows Randy Weaver supporters at Ruby Ridge in northern Idaho. A 1992 standoff in the remote mountains of northern Idaho left a 14-year-old boy, his mother and a federal agent dead and sparked the expansion of radical right-wing groups across the country.\n                \n                    Jeff T. Green/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jeff T. Green/AP\n    \n\n   \n   \"The paramount value of human life\"   John Cox, a retired FBI agent, began his career at that agency two months after the DOJ's new use-of-force policy took effect.   \n   \"The use-of-force policy for the department started from the notion of the paramount value of human life, that we're holding that top of mind,\" Cox said.   Cox, who had previously been an assistant U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., before pivoting to the FBI, served as an agent there for seven years. He said through training scenarios, the agency taught them that deadly force may only be used when the subject of the force presents an imminent danger to the officer or another person. But Cox said the instruction went even further, to impress upon new recruits that they could only use deadly force when there was no safe alternative available to them.   \"It was stricter than the constitutional standard, so it actually restricted when you could use deadly force in accordance with the policy because you were elevating and honoring human life, and that's what you were trying to preserve,\" Cox said. \"So there were instances where maybe constitutionally you could use deadly force, but the policy said no.\"   Cox said during his career as an agent, he encountered situations where targets threatened him or others. In some of those cases, where firing a weapon would have created risk to himself or others nearby, Cox said his training supported the judgment that it was safer to let the target go. In at least two cases, he was able to arrest the target later that day, or the next day.   Cox said that had Jonathan Ross, the immigration enforcement agent who fired at Good, been an FBI agent, the department would look particularly at his position at the time of shooting.   \"Without knowing all the facts – and I don't know all the facts – if stepping out of the way was a reasonable alternative, then, under the policy that I was trained on, the department would have expected you to step out of the way,\" he said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent-in-charge Gene Glenn talks to reporters in Naples, Idaho on Aug. 30, 1992.\n                \n                    Gary Stewart/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Gary Stewart/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Looking at DHS use-of-force policy   In 2023, during President Joe Biden's term, the DHS updated its use-of-force policy. It emphasized the importance of \"no reasonably effective, safe, and feasible alternative\" in its framework, and \"respect for human life\" as first among its general principles. However, the policy was an administrative update, not codified by statute. Since President Trump took office, his administration has taken a starkly different posture.   \n   In the days following Good's death, White House adviser Stephen Miller addressed the issue during an appearance on Fox News. The Department of Homeland Security's X account reposted the clip.   \"To all ICE officers: you have federal immunity in the conduct of your duties,\" Miller said. \"Anybody who lays a hand on you or tries to stop you or tries to obstruct you is committing a felony.\"   Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., told NPR she believes this has created space for Congress to act. She and Rep. Seth Magaziner, D-R.I., have co-sponsored the DHS Use of Force Oversight Act to establish a baseline policy.   \"What my bill does, it actually codifies and mandates by Congress a legislative requirement that it doesn't matter if it's Trump's ICE, Biden's ICE, Democrats' ICE or whoever,\" Ramirez said. \"They now have to abide by the policy that is set, regardless of who's in the leadership or who is running DHS.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                In this Sept. 6, 1995, file photo, photographers capture the arrival on Capitol Hill in Washington of Randy Weaver, left, and his attorney Gerry Spence for a hearing of a Senate Judiciary subcommittee.\n                \n                    Dennis Cook/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Dennis Cook/AP\n    \n\n   \n   In 1995, when senators questioned Randy Weaver in a subcommittee hearing over the Ruby Ridge standoff, some asked pointed questions about his political beliefs, including whether he had swastikas in his home. Weaver had testified to having attended a handful of conferences on the compound of Aryan Nations, also in northern Idaho. He had also been photographed with his family wearing a T-shirt alluding to an antisemitic conspiracy theory.   Despite disagreement with Weaver's politics, however, legislators at that time appeared to agree that the policy and conduct of federal agents merited scrutiny. Ramirez said that she would like to see a similar discussion today.   \"This should not be a controversial bill to sign on to,\" Ramirez said. But she said that the administration's rapid characterization of Good's activities as \"domestic terrorism\" complicated further movement. \"It leaves very little room for a real dialogue of 'Let's talk about the policy.'\"   \n   So far, no Republicans have signed onto the bill.   \"But I am not very optimistic that enough of them will understand how critical this is,\" she said. \"With that said, I'm not going to lose hope.\"\n",

By the time President Trump's delayed helicopter landed in the Alpine snow, much of the damage — at least diplomatically — had already been done.   In the weeks leading up to the gathering, occasionally off-the-cuff remarks from Trump and White House staff about a possible U.S. military takeover of Greenland had culminated in renewed tariff threats against eight European nations.   \n   The unprecedented presidential rhetoric had left allies scrambling to interpret American intentions, while global financial markets responded nervously and diplomats questioned how durable long-standing U.S. commitments had become.   A candid speech from Canada   That unease was then voiced openly by several leaders in Davos. Canada's prime minister, Mark Carney, argued that the post-World War II economic and security architecture was breaking down in ways that left middle-sized countries, like Canada, newly exposed.   \"Let me be direct — we are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition,\" Carney told delegates in the forum's large congress hall. \"Great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons — tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited.\"   Carney warned that the rules-based international order that had helped manage great-power rivalry for decades \"is fading,\" and that countries like his could no longer assume the United States would reliably act as the system's stabilizing force.   French President Emmanuel Macron struck a similar note, framing the moment as one of historic political and security uncertainty. \"We are reaching a time of instability, of unbalances, both from the security and defense point of view and the economic point of view,\" he told the Davos audience of global policymakers and business executives.   \n   Macron linked those imbalances to a wider democratic retreat and a resurgence of geopolitical confrontation, what he called \"a shift towards a world without rules, where international law is trampled under foot, and where the only law that seems to matter is that of the strongest.\" It was a characterization that, two years ago, Macron would have intended for leaders like Presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin — but for many in the audience it seemed, this week, to target President Trump too.   \n   When the U.S. commander-in-chief appeared on that same stage a day later, he offered a sharply different interpretation, arguing that raw military and economic power — rather than verbal reassurance — was the key to maintaining security partnerships.   \"We want strong allies, not seriously weakened ones. We want Europe to be strong,\" Trump said, while invoking his own Scottish and German ancestry. \"Ultimately, these are matters of national security, and perhaps no current issue makes the situation more clear than what's currently going on with Greenland.\"   \n   In the same speech, Trump did appear to definitively rule out a U.S. invasion of Greenland, which is a semiautonomous territory of Denmark, a NATO ally. But he still continued to question Denmark's stewardship of the strategically important Arctic territory. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte moved quickly to defuse tensions in a meeting that followed, leaving Trump to declare on social media that a deal on Arctic security — with almost no public details — had been struck. Trump also said he had backed off the new tariffs he planned to impose on goods from European countries.   Denmark's political leadership later said Rutte did not speak on their behalf, only heightening the kind of diplomatic ambiguity that has dogged the U.S. administration's perception, particularly in Europe.   \n   Trump later announced on social media he was revoking an invitation for Canada to join his Board of Peace to work on stabilizing postwar Gaza and possibly other conflicts, an initiative Trump touted at Davos.   Zelenskyy calls on Europe to do more   Nonetheless, the entire episode had already deepened concerns within the NATO alliance about U.S. predictability and trust. For Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, such concerns underscored a frustration he has voiced repeatedly since Russia's full-scale invasion nearly four years ago.   \n   \"Europe loves to discuss the future, but avoids taking action today, action that defines what kind of future we will have,\" Zelenskyy said during his own keynote speech after he arrived in Switzerland Thursday. \"That is the problem.\"   For the Ukrainian leader, it's an issue not merely of strategy but credibility too, at a moment when U.S. political attention appears increasingly distracted and European governments remain occasionally leery about exercising hard power.   The week in Davos began with sharp market reactions and diplomatic shocks, and ended without clear resolution. What lingered instead was a question increasingly voiced by U.S. allies, both publicly and privately: whether the disruptions of recent days are temporary turbulence — or evidence of a more permanent shift in global leadership that they must now prepare to navigate largely on their own.\n",

The ceremonies were largely celebratory experiences. But they took place against the backdrop of a year of unexpected hurdles and changes to the naturalization process in America.   Among those, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) paused the processing of existing immigration applications, including naturalizations, for immigrants from 39 countries who now have travel restrictions to come to the U.S.   \"One thing we're finding is that because the journey to citizenship is slower now than it has been in the past, that there are fewer people making it here today,\" said Barbara Zia. She attended the ceremony in D.C. to register the new citizens to vote on behalf of the League of Women Voters of the District of Columbia. She said usually 125 people are naturalized at that court each time, higher than the 104 at January's ceremony. The ceremony for February is already cancelled.   USCIS Spokesman Matthew Tragesser said the agency \"will not take shortcuts in the adjudications process,\" when asked about the lower number of people getting naturalized in D.C., and the cancellation of a ceremony next month.   \n   'The beginning of the chapter'   For some participating in naturalization ceremonies, the celebrations have been decades in the making; for others, the process began less than a year ago. Some wanted to cement their sense of belonging in America, others desired an added level of safety, or saw it as the next natural step in their lives.   \"People have access to better jobs, opportunities, home ownership, they can run for office if they so choose; so there's a lot of benefits,\" said Nicole Melaku, executive director of the National Partnership for New Americans, an immigrant advocacy group. \"For the larger community, it is an ultimate act of inclusion.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Top: Participants wait in line for the first naturalization ceremony of 2026 at the Albert V.

Preliminary data from the agency for the first six months of the year showed about 517,000 people applying for naturalization, in line with the prior year — but anecdotal evidence from Zia and others suggest that approved applications could be lower than they have been in the past.   At a morning ceremony in Alexandria, Va., 46 soon-to-be citizens waited in the standing-room-only courtroom, holding mini-American flags and pamphlets titled \"Congratulations on Becoming a U.S. Citizen.\"   \"The number of countries represented here today both reflects and further contributes to the rich diversity of the American people,\" said Judge John F. Anderson, who presided over the ceremony. \"As you remember your heritage, share it with your new citizens.\"   Immigrants getting their citizenship in the broader Washington, D.C., area hailed from across the globe, from El Salvador to Ukraine and India.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Ashley Lezama (right), of Honduras, stands with her husband, Nick Moreno, of Bolivia following her naturalization ceremony in Alexandria, Va.\n                \n                    Michael A.

McCoy for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"It's some mixture of emotions only because it seems like it's impossible,\" said Ashley Lezama Moreno, of Honduras. \"You know, finally able to cross that finish line. And it just feels amazing. New opportunities, the beginning of the chapter.\"   \n   An increasingly challenging process   The Trump administration has taken steps to make it more difficult to seek citizenship as the president seeks to limit legal migration to the United States.   Anderson, the judge in Alexandria, invited each new citizen to stand up and say their country of origin. A man in the first row of the courtroom stood up and said \"Brazil,\" another said \"Egypt.\" Two women stood in turn and said \"Guatemala,\" then \"Nepal.\" These are all countries on the new immigrant visa ban list announced earlier this month.   \n   Zaida Meza, of Guatemala, has lived in the United States for 21 years, and applied to naturalize a year-and-a-half ago. She saved up money for years to afford a lawyer to guide her through the process. Her citizenship would likely have stalled indefinitely if she hadn't been approved last year, before the new immigrant visa bans.   \"I love this country and I want to vote in the federal elections,\" Meza said. \"I've been working so hard trying to get my legal papers … I feel so blessed in America.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Zaida Meza, of Guatemala, applied to naturalize a year and a half ago after living in the U.S. for 21 years.\n                \n                    Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   USCIS unveiled a longer, tougher citizenship test in October. It has also moved forward with a rule that would allow officers to consider an immigrant's legal use of public benefits, such as food stamps and healthcare, as a reason to deny status.   In December, the Trump administration also halted processing green card and citizenship applications from nationals of 39 countries with travel restrictions to the U.S. In January, the list was expanded to halt processing immigrant visas indefinitely for 75 additional countries.   The Trump administration has also renewed focus on denaturalization, or revoking citizenship — a process scantly used in the past.   \n   \"For years, the Biden administration prioritized rubber-stamping naturalization applications with minimal vetting,\" said Tragesser, the USCIS spokesperson, adding that the agency plans \"rigorous screening and vetting processes across the country.\"   Ceremonies disrupted   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Cori Alonso-Yoder is the director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law.\n                \n                    Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   There's also been numerous disruptions to regularly scheduled ceremonies.   From October to mid-November, naturalization ceremonies across the country were cancelled due to the government shutdown. Numerous other ceremonies have been cancelled, often at the last minute and without explanation, leaving immigrants in limbo as they await the last step of their naturalization process.   Karim Hamouda, from Egypt, was naturalized in D.C. last week after he was originally scheduled for a ceremony in October. It was cancelled because of the government shutdown and rescheduled to Fairfax County, Va. His Fairfax ceremony also got cancelled; Hamouda says he wasn't given a reason.   \n   \"I'm lucky that I had my oath,\" Hamouda said after his ceremony in January.   \n   Cori Alonso-Yoder, director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law attended the naturalization ceremony in D.C. with one of her clients. The client was \"exceptionally nervous\" about being arrested even during her citizenship interview, bringing someone with them as support, she said.   \"There was a lot of anxiety to get to the place of actually becoming a naturalized citizen today,\" she said.   Still, she says, the ceremonies serve as evidence that thousands still want to become Americans and participate in the U.S. civic process.   \"At its core, citizenship is continuing to move forward and naturalization processes are continuing,\" Alonso-Yoder said. \"The people that we've seen today are truly committed and are taking the steps forward to make that happen.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                David Diemert, of Canada, applied to naturalize in March last year after living in the U.S. since 2001.\n                \n                    Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   David Diemert from Canada has lived in the U.S. since 2001, but applied to naturalize in March last year. He said that naturalizing allows him to leave behind much anxiety and uncertainty to truly build a future in the United States.   \"I got a little bit concerned about the current situation for people who were not citizens yet,\" Diemert said. \"[Naturalizing] is a measure of security, obviously. I want this country to live up to what its ideals are.\"\n",

The Trump administration hasn't been able to answer how much data is at risk, what it was used for or why its unprecedented efforts to consolidate data are needed.   Those questions deepened last week, when the Social Security Administration said it discovered DOGE employees at the agency secretly and improperly shared sensitive personal data last year, but once again can't verify the extent of the violations. The admission came in a court filing last Friday, Jan. 16, that made numerous corrections to testimony given by top agency officials last year in a lawsuit alleging that DOGE was illegally accessing Social Security data.   \n   In the filing, Justice Department lawyers representing the Social Security Administration wrote that two SSA DOGE employees were referred to a federal watchdog to determine whether they violated a law barring government employees from using their job for political activity, known as the Hatch Act.   The unnamed employees secretly conferred with a political advocacy group about a request to match Social Security data with state voter rolls to \"find evidence of voter fraud and to overturn election results in certain States,\" the filing said. It remains unclear whether any data actually went to this group.   \"Based on its review of records obtained during or after October 2025, SSA identified communications, use of data, and other actions by the then-SSA DOGE Team that were potentially outside of SSA policy and/or noncompliant with the District Court's March 20, 2025, temporary restraining order,\" DOJ attorneys wrote.   DOGE team members also circumvented IT rules to improperly share data on outside servers, sent a password-protected file of private records to DOGE affiliates outside the agency and had the ability to see data even after a judge temporarily halted access.   In acknowledging the breaches, the Social Security Administration also repeatedly indicated it still has little knowledge of what data was shared and offers little insight into how those incidents occurred.   \n   Plaintiffs in the lawsuit against the Social Security Administration have asked the two courts currently considering the case to incorporate the \"brazen misconduct\" documented in the corrected testimony.\"The unauthorized release of Americans' personal data represents a profound violation of public trust,\" said Richard Fiesta, executive director of the Alliance for Retired Americans, which is a plaintiff in the case along with unions. \"Retirees, workers, and families depend on the Social Security Administration to protect their most confidential information. We have a right to know what happened to our information, who had access to it, and what it was used for.\"   \n   The revelation bolsters the claims of whistleblower Chuck Borges, who alleged that DOGE staffers repeatedly violated internal SSA policies and federal laws, including a decision to copy a dataset of more than 300 million Americans' sensitive information into a virtual database without following required security protocols.   \"It's disappointing to be proven right,\" Borges, who was the chief data officer for SSA until his resignation in August, told NPR in response to the fling. (He has also filed a separate complaint alleging that he was retaliated against for raising concerns and was forced to resign to uphold his ethical and legal obligations.) \"Yes, it's validating, but it's also disappointing because it puts American public data at risk.\"   He said the filing needs to be \"a wake-up call to Congress\" to investigate what data was accessed and what it was used for. An NPR review of the filings and other statements made by DOGE affiliates shines even more light on how Social Security data was used to advance dubious claims of fraud that have influenced key Trump administration policies on immigration, benefits and election security.   This includes the Department of Justice suing 25 states, primarily run by Democrats, for refusing to turn over nonpublic voter rolls that contain sensitive data, including Social Security numbers. Those states and voting rights groups argue that the Trump administration demand violates federal privacy laws and raises questions about what the data will be used for.   \n   \"This filing shows that the government's efforts are really designed not for what they say they are — to enforce federal law — but to chase down conspiracy theories about election fraud,\" said Brent Ferguson, director of strategic litigation at Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit legal center that has intervened in some of the DOJ lawsuits against states to argue that the demand for sensitive voter data is not lawful.   The Social Security Administration did not respond to NPR's requests for additional information.   \n   How DOGE quickly obtained — and misused — sensitive data   In the first month of President Trump's return to office, the Department of Government Efficiency effort sent representatives into federal agencies and demanded unprecedented access to data. At the Social Security Administration, that included roughly 10 people tasked with reviewing what the Trump administration said was massive fraud.   On Feb. 21, a group of plaintiffs filed the lawsuit arguing that DOGE's efforts to obtain Social Security data violated the law and jeopardized the safekeeping of highly confidential information the agency keeps.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Tesla CEO Elon Musk led the informal Department of Government Efficiency.\n                \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   They had reason to be concerned: According to the court filings made last week, on March 3 a DOGE team member sent an \"encrypted and password-protected file\" with the names and addresses of roughly 1,000 people to the Department of Homeland Security, copying DOGE adviser Steve Davis and a DOGE Department of Labor employee. \"Despite ongoing efforts by SSA's Chief Information Office, SSA has been unable to access the file to determine exactly what it contained,\" the DOJ filing admits.   From March 7 to 17, the new filing acknowledged that SSA DOGE employees were using links to share data through an unapproved third-party server. The agency also said it was unable to determine what data was shared or if it still exists, while also standing by previous testimony that IT safeguards and security protocols ensure no outside servers are integrated with SSA systems and that access to data is controlled and tracked. None of that improper activity was publicly known at the time. But on March 20, a federal judge found there was enough other evidence available to temporarily block DOGE's work, calling the virtually unfettered access to data \"tantamount to hitting a fly with a sledgehammer.\"   \n   Borges' whistleblower disclosure alleged that the following day, DOGE officials possibly circumvented the temporary restraining order by directing career staff to restore access for two DOGE staffers and give them even more privileges than before. Those privileges were apparently cut off by the end of March 24. Last week's court filing appeared to at least partially corroborate that claim by offering a \"clarification\" that one DOGE staffer was searching the agency's master database of all Social Security numbers the morning of March 24, the same day officials told the court all access had been terminated.   At the same time, other federal courts also moved to revoke improper DOGE data access at the Treasury Department, Office of Personnel Management and Department of Education. Some of the same DOGE employees at the Social Security Administration were also given additional access to systems at other federal agencies.   Real data, dubious fraud claims   One reason DOGE and the Trump administration sought sweeping access to the government's data stores was to find alleged voter fraud, reflected in a series of moves made in March 2025.   Aram Moghaddassi, a DOGE engineer at the time, was granted access to a Department of Homeland Security data system known as SAVE that is used to check foreign-born individuals' citizenship and immigration status while he was working simultaneously at DHS and SSA.   \"This access is absolutely critical to get detailed immigration status for non-citizen SSNs to detect fraud and improper payments,\" Moghaddassi wrote to SSA officials on March 15, 2025.   Later that week, Moghaddassi wrote to the deputy chief of staff for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis from a DHS email account asking for help with the state's voting data, according to public records obtained by the nonprofit watchdog group American Oversight.   \"We're working on SAVE access for Florida law enforcement now,\" he wrote. \"On our end, Florida voter registration and voting data would be helpful immediately to check for voter fraud.\"   \n   Moghaddassi did not respond to requests for comment from NPR.   Around the same time, according to the new disclosure from the Social Security Administration, two unnamed DOGE Social Security employees were approached by an unnamed political advocacy group earlier in the month with a request to analyze state voter rolls with a goal to \"find evidence of voter fraud and to overturn election results in certain States.\"   One of the DOGE staffers signed a \"Voter Data Agreement\" and sent it to the advocacy group on March 24, allegedly without the knowledge of or approval of anyone else at the Social Security Administration. The filing said the agency has not yet seen evidence that data was shared.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Investor Antonio Gracias at a campaign event in Wisconsin last year. As part of the DOGE effort, Gracias worked at the Social Security Administration and used some of the agency's data to make spurious claims about voter rolls.\n                \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Scott Olson/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The next day, March 25, Trump announced an executive order directing the Department of Homeland Security and DOGE to \"review each State's publicly available voter registration list\" and directed the Social Security Administration to take \"all appropriate action\" to make SSA databases with relevant information accessible to election officials verifying voter registrations.   In the following days, Antonio Gracias, a private equity investor and ally of DOGE leader Elon Musk who was working with DOGE in the Social Security Administration, would push spurious claims about noncitizen voting and the SSA enumeration-beyond-entry, or EBE program, a process that streamlines the Social Security card process for certain categories of immigrants.   \n   Court filings at the time indicated Gracias' work was supposed to focus on death data and reducing improper payments. The temporary restraining order was also still in effect, raising questions at the time about how he acquired that data.   Gracias was copied on Moghaddassi's request for access to SAVE data, and at a March 30 rally in Wisconsin with Musk, claimed that a sample review of Social Security data with voter rolls found noncitizens who were registered and cast a ballot.   \n   Gracias did not respond to interview requests from NPR via his company.   In a series of media appearances in the following weeks, Gracias gave shifting numbers of alleged noncitizens discovered by DOGE, from \"well over a thousand\" who voted in one state to \"thousands\" in a handful of states. But ultimately, he told reporters at the end of April that DOGE had referred just 57 cases for prosecution, and that they \"may or may not have voted.\"    Voting experts say the type of data cross-checking Gracias and the unnamed political advocacy group seek to do is error-prone and legally questionable.   Gracias told a podcast that his team was looking at public voter registration lists, but those typically do not include full or partial Social Security numbers, making data matching much less precise.   \"DOGE has repeatedly made massive data errors,\" David Bier, the director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, told NPR last year. \"I have some doubts that they've discovered anything more than maybe just some poor government data quality tracking or they don't understand the data they're looking at.\"   Formal ties with activists focused on voter fraud allegations   The Trump administration declined to identify the political advocacy group that two DOGE staffers communicated with in a way that potentially violated the Hatch Act. But the request aligns with the goals of several prominent election denial groups that have called for the Trump administration to use its data to force states to remove ineligible voters from their rolls.   In early March, one such group, True the Vote, made public \"An Appeal to DOGE: Audit the Voter Rolls\" in a newsletter and on social media posts on X that tagged Musk and DOGE's account.    \"We have already aggregated and normalized state voter roll data, cross-referenced against multiple sources, and made our code available on GitHub for transparency,\" True the Vote founder Catherine Engelbrecht wrote. \"By combining DOGE's access to federal databases with our assembled voter roll information, we can efficiently identify discrepancies and work toward a cleaner, more reliable election system.\"   \n   The newsletter and posts on X note, \"We've received word that this message is being carried forward. Godspeed.\"   \n   True the Vote filed numerous lawsuits in swing states won by former President Joe Biden in 2020 making unsupported claims of election fraud and played a role in supplying data for the 2000 Mules documentary that was later pulled from the market and resulted in an apology from its creator, Dinesh D'Souza, for falsely accusing a Georgia man of voter fraud.   Engelbrecht and True the Vote did not respond to multiple requests for comment from NPR.   Federal officials have also held meetings with activists who were involved in helping Trump try to overturn the 2020 election results. In June, a DHS official gave an online briefing to activist Cleta Mitchell's group, Election Integrity Network, about changes the Trump administration was making to the SAVE data system to identify noncitizens on state voter rolls — before details had been shared publicly.   Other figures who were involved in attempts to overturn the 2020 election results now serve in the administration. They include Pennsylvania activist Heather Honey, whose flawed research into the 2020 election was cited by Trump during his speech on the Ellipse on Jan. 6, 2021. She is now serving as the deputy assistant secretary for elections integrity at the Department of Homeland Security. Former Georgia Republican Party official Marci McCarthy, who pushed debunked claims about the state's voting machines, is the director of public affairs for CISA, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.   For his part, the president continues to repeat the false claim that the 2020 election was rigged — as recently as Wednesday during his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos — and said \"people will soon be prosecuted for what they did.\"   DOGE's data has driven key Trump policies   The unprecedented push to consolidate data access by DOGE, the Trump administration's use of that data to justify policy changes, and what judges have said to be violations of privacy laws, extends beyond voting and Social Security.   \n   In the year since Trump returned to office, DOGE has funneled disparate data from federal agencies in service of the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement crackdown.   \n   The administration's efforts include taking steps to share sensitive Medicaid and IRS data with the Department of Homeland Security (though a federal court has blocked most IRS data sharing for now), as well as overhauling the SAVE data system into a centralized national citizenship tool that links to Social Security Administration records and is currently being expanded to include driver's license information. Borges, the SSA whistleblower, said after the Supreme Court lifted the ban on DOGE access at the Social Security Administration on June 6, DOGE employees transferred a live copy of the country's Social Security database into a cloud server without independent security controls, and Moghaddassi authorized its operation.   Borges resigned on Aug. 29. Soon after, Moghaddassi was publicly announced as the agency's co-chief information officer. As recently as Jan. 18, he was listed as the SSA's representative to the Chief Information Officers Council, but his name has since been removed from that website.   \n   By mid-August, SAVE was updated to allow officials to check whether people are citizens or listed as deceased in federal records using name, date of birth and just the last four digits of a Social Security number. DHS has encouraged states to use SAVE to identify noncitizens on their voter rolls. NPR has reported instances of U.S. citizens being erroneously flagged by the tool since its rollout.   As for Borges, he hopes the American people will get full answers about what happened with their Social Security data. He told NPR that the data the agency maintains \"is a very, very complete record of everybody's personal information\" that can include clues to help identity thieves and bad actors. \"And so that, if it were to get out, it would be a catastrophic risk to the American public.\"    \n   He added, \"The cavalier way in which they're treating this data is honestly quite appalling to me.\"\n",

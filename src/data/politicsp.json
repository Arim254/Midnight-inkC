The shutdown has delayed federal funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, a program that helps about 6 million households nationwide pay their heating or cooling bills, buy fuel or fix broken heaters.   For nearly a decade, preschool teacher Justina Ray has relied on LIHEAP to heat her Pennsylvania home.   \"My income itself comes down with all the holidays and the school closures,\" Ray said. Without LIHEAP, she said, her winter energy bills are \"not affordable.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Justina Ray depends on LIHEAP to help heat her home in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, where she lives with her two children and a cat named Flounder.\n                \n                    Sophia Schmidt/WHYY\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Sophia Schmidt/WHYY\n    \n\n   \n   Around this time each year, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sends most of the annual LIHEAP funding to states to run the program. But because of the shutdown, that hasn't happened.   \n   So Pennsylvania has delayed the start of its LIHEAP program by a month, from early November to early December. It's one of several states, including New York, Maine, Minnesota and Wyoming, that have announced delays or disruptions to their programs due to the shutdown. A few others — like Alaska and Massachusetts — are using money left over from last season to give emergency assistance. Some, including Vermont and Connecticut, are preparing to use state funding to front the costs if needed.   For Ray and millions of other people, delays in LIHEAP funding could lead to tough choices. Ray said she's holding off turning on the heat in the gray-shingled duplex just north of Philadelphia, which she shares with her two kids.   \"Without LIHEAP, I really don't know what I'm going to do,\" Ray said.   Pennsylvania has some money left over from last year's allocation, but it's not enough to sustain the program, said Hoa Pham, deputy secretary for the Office of Income Maintenance at Pennsylvania's Department of Human Services. Pham said the state needs a guarantee that more federal funding is coming.   \"I would consider it really detrimental for us to start a program, and then lose funding and then have to close it,\" Pham said.   \n   Concerns about delayed funds, after Trump fired LIHEAP staff   Even after the shutdown ends, it will likely take weeks for the federal government to release LIHEAP funds, said Mark Wolfe, director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, which represents state agencies that run the program. Wolfe worries the process will be slower than usual because earlier this year, the Trump administration fired the staff that administers LIHEAP. Wolfe said while not every state is feeling the pinch, most will need federal funding to fully open their programs.   \"[It will be] December before we see any of the money, and it could be into January,\" Wolfe said. \"We're very, very worried about that, because winter starts.\"   Department of Health and Human Services Press Secretary Emily Hilliard said in an emailed statement that once the government reopens, the agency will \"work swiftly\" to administer the LIHEAP funds.   Households prepare for sacrifices   The delay in federal LIHEAP funding comes amid rising gas and electric bills and disruptions in other assistance programs, like SNAP, said Tony Reames, a professor at the University of Michigan who studies energy justice and worked at the U.S. Department of Energy under the Biden administration.   \"This is kind of like a perfect storm, unfortunately,\" Reames said.   Liz Marx, director of the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project, worries about families whose utility service is currently shut off who are counting on LIHEAP to restore services. She said LIHEAP is also crucial for people who heat their homes using fuel that's delivered, like heating oil, propane or wood, because they are not protected by the restrictions on utility shutoffs that many states institute during the winter.   In Pennsylvania, utility companies, including Ray's, have promised to suspend shutoffs for certain customers during November because of the shutdown. Still, Marx said the delay in Pennsylvania's LIHEAP program will likely force households to make tough choices.   \n   \"I think a lot of people are going to sacrifice food, medicine, medical care, other life essentials,\" Marx said. \"I think people will fall behind on their rent.\"   Remington Steele-Caleñe is planning to apply for LIHEAP this winter. The Philadelphia resident said they're currently unemployed without any income, because chronic illnesses make it difficult to leave the apartment. Until they can secure LIHEAP assistance to run their gas-fired heater, Steele-Caleñe plans to rely on an electric space heater in their bedroom. They're enrolled in an assistance program that caps their monthly electric bill.   \"I'll just go into one room,\" Steele-Caleñe said. \"I'll close the door, and I'll spend most of the time there.\"   Until recently, Justina Ray owed several hundred dollars on her energy bill. But after hearing her story, an NPR listener reached out and paid her overdue balance.   Ray called this a \"blessing,\" but said going forward, she still expects to struggle to make ends meet. She said the LIHEAP delay and uncertainty around SNAP may force her to miss a car payment, skip holiday traditions with her kids or travel less to visit family.   Ray said her family plans to bundle up — rather than turn on their heat anytime soon.\n",

Today's top stories   The government shutdown is now in its 37th day, and President Trump has been urging Republicans to end it by eliminating the Senate filibuster. Earlier this week, some Democrats expressed their interest in finding a way to resolve the shutdown, but their victories at the ballot box on Tuesday have emboldened many to hold firm. Meanwhile, the president acknowledged that the shutdown hurt Republicans on election night.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) speaks to reporters during a news conference on Nov. 5, 2025, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. The record for the longest shutdown in the U.S. Government was broken on Wednesday as it entered its 36th day.\n                \n                    Tom Brenner/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Tom Brenner/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Most Republicans are not in favor of ditching the filibuster, as Trump has sought, but some bipartisan talks appear to have picked up steam this week, NPR's Sam Gringlas tells Up First. The solution that Senate Democrats and Republicans could be discussing is a short-term funding measure until December or later, along with votes on a small package of regular appropriations bills. Republicans would need eight Democrats to sign onto a deal to reopen the government. However, the expiring health care subsidies remain a sticking point during these talks.   The Supreme Court has heard arguments in a case about Trump's tariffs, but has not yet issued a major ruling. Trump utilized a 1977 law, known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, to impose the tariffs. The central question of the case is whether the law gives the president the authority to impose tariffs on products from countries worldwide. The justices' opinions are not yet known, but their questions yesterday indicate that they were skeptical of Trump's position.    \n   🎧 If the court rules against Trump, the ultimate impact on tariffs is unclear. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben says the ruling would make a bunch of his tariffs illegal. Tariffs like the ones he's imposed on goods like steel and aluminum, however, would remain in place. The president has stated that this is the most important Supreme Court case ever. If the high court ruled against the president, it would be the first time they have tried to rein in his power.   In Chicago this week, the Trump administration has been taken to court by city residents who oppose the aggressive immigration campaign there. Judge Sara Ellis has listened to hours of testimony from citizens' accounts of jarring encounters with federal agents. Another judge, Robert Gettleman, presided over a hearing on Tuesday on the conditions inside an immigration holding facility in a Chicago suburb.    🎧 Ellis is preparing to hand down her ruling today in the preliminary injunction, according to Jon Seidel with Chicago Public Media and the Chicago Sun-Times. It would essentially extend the order she issued last month, limiting the use of force by federal agents against protesters. During yesterday's eight-hour hearing, Ellis heard from a woman who found herself staring down the barrel of a gun for filming the arrest of day laborers. She also listened to the video testimony of U.S. Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino, who stated that the use of force has been \"more than exemplary.\"   \n   Deep dive   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Natalya Kosarevich/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Tax season is approaching. The tax breaks extended under President Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" primarily benefit high-net-worth individuals and high-income earners. While middle-income households may experience modest relief, the majority of benefits will be allocated to those with substantial earnings, investment income, or large estates. Here are some provisions in the bill that favor upper-income individuals and families:    💰 Starting next year, Americans will have a permanent lifetime exemption for estate and gift taxes set at $15 million per individual and $30 million per married couple, up from $13.99 million and $27.98 million limits.💰 The exclusion for capital gains from sold qualified small business stock issued after July 4, 2025, has increased from $10 million to $15 million for companies with assets up to $75 million.💰 Bonus depreciation has been extended.

A new analysis shows millions of people may get even less food assistance than expected under the Trump administration's plan to partially fund SNAP during the government shutdown.\n                \n                    Bloomberg/via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Bloomberg/via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   WASHINGTON — Cuts to food stamp benefits for low-income Americans may be far steeper this month than expected, and millions could receive nothing at all, according to a new analysis.   \n   The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research and policy institute, analyzed the partial SNAP benefits payment plan sent Tuesday by the Trump administration to states. It found the roughly 40 percent of households that get the maximum level of food stamp benefits will see payments cut by about half.    But those with some income – whether from social security, disability or employment – will lose a larger share. Some 1-to-2 person households will get just $12, the center found, and as many as 1.2 million households will receive $0.   \n   \"Almost 5 million people will receive no benefits at all,\" said Katie Bergh, a food policy analyst with the center.   CBPP also estimates under the partial spending formula the U.S. Department of Agriculture will only end up spending about $3 billion of its contingency fund – not the full $4.65 billion that two judges said must be used to keep SNAP entitlements flowing.    \"They're, in essence, shortchanging families,\" Bergh said. \"They have funding, but they've set up a benefit reduction scheme that means that they will not spend all of it.\"   The USDA did not respond immediately to NPR's request for comment about the center's analysis.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A motorist, who said he had been waiting in line for two hours, waits with others to receive food boxes this week at a large-scale drive-through distribution in the City of Industry, Calif.\n                \n                    Mario Tama/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mario Tama/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   A federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the administration to restart the country's largest anti-hunger program after funding lapsed last Saturday, a month into the government shutdown. USDA rejected the suggestion by that judge, and another federal judge in Boston, that it tap a larger pot of money to fully cover SNAP payments. Instead, it chose to use only a smaller contingency fund that could cover only about half of the program's monthly cost.   Implementing the administration's complex partial funding formula presents enormous procedural challenges for states, which administer the program that serves 42 million Americans. The USDA itself warned it could take weeks or even months to get the benefits to people.   \n   \"It requires a complete recalculation and a complete recoding of our system,\" said Tikki Brown, the head of Minnesota's Department of Children, Youth and Families. She said there is no timeline yet for payments in her state.   Danny Mintz, who works for the safety net access group, Code for America, said some states have antiquated systems from the 1970s that make it difficult to quickly implement sweeping calculation changes.   \"There are legitimate concerns that altering the calculations of benefits may break things,\" he said. \"The quickest way for states to get benefits into people's hands is for USDA to fund the full amount of SNAP benefits.\"   Some states already are warning it could be weeks before payments can be made.   In a bluntly worded letter to USDA – seen by NPR member station WESA – Pennsylvania Human Services Secretary Val Arkoosh said the federal government is \"directing states to use the most complex and labor-intensive approach possible.\"   Pennsylvania is asking to use a simpler, faster method that was allowed for pandemic-related aid, and would essentially give everyone half their SNAP payment.   The prospect of delays and missed payments has brought a group of cities and nonprofits back to federal court in Rhode Island, to force the Trump administration to comply with an order to restart SNAP aid \"expeditiously.\"\n",

The president has consistently framed the appropriations lapse as something Democrats have caused and only Democrats can solve, but the election results cap a shift in tone that suggests a resolution could come sooner – and with his approval.   Here are four ways Tuesday's results could influence the length of the government shutdown:   Voters unhappy with the Republican Party's governance put pressure on Trump   One of the biggest rebukes of Trump administration policies came in Virginia, home to around 320,000 federal workers and hundreds of thousands of federal contractors.   Democrat Abigail Spanberger won the governor's race there by 15 points with a message that argued Trump's push to fire federal workers and slash federal spending — and later, the ongoing government shutdown — harmed the state's economy.   In New Jersey, the Trump administration's announcement threatening to terminate funding for the major Gateway Tunnel rail project between Newark and New York City loomed large over the final days of the election. Democrat Mikie Sherrill bested Trump-backed Jack Ciattarelli in the governor's race by a similar margin to Spanberger's.   \n   The Democratic Party is also touting upsets in two Georgia statewide utility regulator contests, the retention of state Supreme Court judges in Pennsylvania and a slew of flipped municipal elections as evidence its message as the party that is better for economic and public safety policies is resonating.   Democrats keep holding out, emboldened by the election   Tuesday's election has Democrats feeling good about how they are responding to Republican governance, which could lead to a continuation of the shutdown.   Democrats want the Republican-led Congress to prevent insurance premium subsidies from expiring at the end of the year for millions of Americans enrolled in Affordable Care Act health plans. If Republicans agree to that, Democrats say they would then vote to fund the government so it can reopen.   Researchers estimate the average cost of insurance purchased through the health insurance marketplace would double and millions would become uninsured without the subsidies.   \n   At several points during the shutdown, the White House has taken steps to try to target Democrats and force them to drop their demands, like cutting grant funding for programs the Biden administration supported, seeking to lay off workers and reversing guidance that would keep SNAP benefits going through the funding lapse.   After the election, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sent a letter to the president demanding he negotiate with them to reopen the government.   \"We write to demand a bipartisan meeting of legislative leaders to end the GOP shutdown of the federal government and decisively address the Republican healthcare crisis,\" the letter reads. \"Democrats stand ready to meet with you face to face, anytime and any place.\"   The note ends with Trump's signature line: \"Thank you for your attention to this matter.\"   The president once again accused Democrats of holding the country \"hostage\" over the shutdown in remarks at a business forum Wednesday afternoon.   \n   Trump keeps pushing for an end to the filibuster   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., greets President Trump as he arrives to speak with Senate Republicans at a breakfast in the State Dining Room of the White House on Nov. 5, 2025.\n                \n                    Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The president has declined to negotiate with Democrats and has doubled down on his belief that Senate Republicans should eliminate the legislative filibuster that maintains a higher vote threshold for some legislation to pass through the upper chamber.   \"It's time for Republicans to do what they have to do, and that's terminate the filibuster,\" Trump reiterated at Wednesday's Republican breakfast. \"It's the only way you can do it. And if you don't terminate the filibuster, you'll be in bad shape. We won't pass any legislation.\"   Senate Majority Leader John Thune has indicated that ending the filibuster is a non-starter. Senate Republicans are overwhelmingly opposed to using what's called the \"nuclear option\" of abolishing the filibuster, warning that Democratic control of Congress in the future could see the passage of sweeping legislation.   Time runs out to pass an existing funding fix   The House passed a temporary spending plan at the end of September without any Democratic voters but Senate approval requires seven Democrats or independents to join with the Republican majority. The continuing resolution has an expiration date of Nov. 21, though.   That means the House, which has been out of session for more than 40 days, will have to come up with a new plan to reopen the government and resume work on bills to fund different parts of the government for the full fiscal year — and get the Senate to agree.   \n   In the meantime, more essential services the government provides run the risk of running out of money, seeing staffing shortages and encountering other problems due to the lapse in funding.   \"When you shut down the government, bad things happen, and the longer the government is shut down, the more bad things will happen,\" Devin O'Connor with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, previously told NPR. \"And even with the Trump administration taking relatively aggressive actions to try to prevent certain harms over time, it's just going to grow and it's going to become more and more painful.\"\n",

In 2007, she became the first woman elected to serve as speaker of the House.   \"For our daughters and our granddaughters: today we have broken the marble ceiling,\" she said at the time.   \n   As speaker and House Democrats' leader, Pelosi was known for her shrewd political judgment and incisive skills as a legislative strategist.   She was also a consistent political target for Republicans, who cast her — a San Francisco multi-millionaire — as the ultimate coastal elitist. Pelosi, who raised five children before coming to Congress, rejected the characterization.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Rep.

She famously claimed she went \"from the kitchen to the Congress\" after raising her children and staying active in state politics.   Fond of saying \"Congress has the power of the purse,\" she began her time on Capitol Hill as an appropriator, a role she drew from throughout her career. She quickly rose through Democratic leadership and became the first woman to lead a major party in either chamber when she was elected as the House Democratic Minority leader in 2002.   She led Democrats to retake the House majority in 2006 and after her history-making speakership election in 2007, Pelosi held the gavel for four years — until Republicans won back control of the chamber.   \n   Pelosi, who often called herself a \"master legislator,\" could reliably deliver Democratic votes on must-pass legislation when necessary, although her first speakership came at a complicated time — a financial crisis was looming and ultimately brought the U.S. economy to its knees.   In September 2008, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke huddled with congressional leaders in the speaker's office on the second floor of the U.S. Capitol. There, Paulson outlined a pending financial crisis \"from the depths of hell,\" as Pelosi later described it. The Bush administration was asking Congress for $700 billion to prop up the U.S. economy.   \n   \"When I asked Bernanke what he thought of the secretary's characterization, he said, 'If we do not act immediately, we will not have an economy by Monday.' This was Thursday night. Everyone in the room was flabbergasted,\" Pelosi later recalled.   After Barack Obama was elected that fall, Pelosi pushed forward the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, a stimulus package to counter the effects of the Great Recession. She was also instrumental in passing the Dodd-Frank reforms to the banking industry and was an architect of the Affordable Care Act. The sweeping health care reform law became the signature achievement of Obama's presidency.   In the wake of those bills, the far-right Tea Party movement helped harden Republican opposition to Obama and Democrats more broadly, and Democrats saw major losses in the 2010 midterm elections that relegated Democrats to the minority and ended Pelosi's first run as speaker. Obama himself described the defeat as \"a shellacking.\"   There was growing expectation that Pelosi would retire from Congress after losing the gavel and control of the House. She was featured in attack ads in swing districts, where Republicans used her image relentlessly and effectively to characterize the entire party as far-left elitists.   Ultimately, Pelosi reclaimed the gavel in 2019 — the first person to do so in over 60 years. Originally thought by analysts to be too liberal to be an effective leader, her legacy is ultimately that of a centrist and legislative pragmatist.   A long tenure   Pelosi served alongside four presidents during her time as speaker.   \n   Her contentious relationship with former Republican President George W. Bush was an early showcase of her ability to turn from aggressive critic to critical legislating partner.   Her relationship with President Trump was more fractious. She led two presidential impeachments and created the bipartisan Select Committee to investigate the Jan. 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol.   It was the election of President Joe Biden and Democrats gaining control of both chambers of Congress that saw Pelosi enact trillions in new spending through the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS bill and the bipartisan infrastructure law.   \n   When Democrats lost control of the chamber in the 2022 midterm elections, Pelosi stepped down from leadership amid demands for a turnover to allow a new generation of leaders to ascend. Pelosi continued to serve in the House during a time when Democrats continued to search for a path out of the minority in Washington.   \"History will note she is the most consequential speaker of the House of Representatives in our history,\" then-President Biden said at the time.   That same year, Pelosi's husband, Paul, was violently attacked by an intruder who broke into their home demanding to see the then-speaker. Paul Pelosi underwent surgery to repair a skull fracture and serious injuries to his right arm and hands. The attack was a stark example of the increase in political violence in the country.   Some two years later, Pelosi reportedly played a role privately and publicly in encouraging Biden to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race.   In 2024, Pelosi was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country's highest civilian honor.   Earlier this year, Pelosi signaled she would wait to make an announcement on her political future until after California voted on Proposition 50, a ballot measure that would enable state leaders to temporarily redraw current congressional lines to favor Democrats.   In a recent interview on CNN, Pelosi said she had \"no doubt that if I decided to run, I would win.\"   \"It isn't arrogant,\" she said. \"It's confident.\"\n",

Many federal workers have missed paychecks, including air traffic controllers, who are working unpaid. One air traffic controller is warning over the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday season we could see \"the worst day of travel in the history of flight\" if the shutdown doesn't end soon.   Meanwhile, the fate of federal food and nutrition benefits like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, previously known as food stamps, has been uncertain since they expired on Saturday. On Monday, the Trump administration said it will restart SNAP food benefits but it will pay out only half the amount people normally get. But it's still not clear how soon that money will get to those who rely on it as states increasingly report it could take weeks to get the federal money onto the debit-like EBT cards.   \n   More on SNAP funding and what communities are doing to fill the SNAP lapse gap, here.   The Agriculture Department says it will reopen about 2,100 county offices despite the government shutdown to help farmers get access to $3 billion of aid. At the same time many American farmers say the Trump administration's trade policies have them on the brink.   As the shutdown continues, here's the latest on what we know.      Jump to state-specific impacts.      Why did the federal government shut down?   It started as a fight over health care -- specifically expiring subsidies for health insurance premiums purchased on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace.   Some 24 million people — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans.   Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the health care of undocumented immigrants. That is not true.   Democrats in the Senate refused to vote for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP spending and tax bill that passed over the summer.   \n   Nov. 1 marked the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the ACA, when subscribers could start to see big premium increases unless the subsidies that have been helping people pay for coverage since 2021 are extended.   — Sam Gringlas and Selena Simmons-Duffin, NPR   Read more about the health care fight behind the shutdown here      What about WIC and SNAP benefits?   The Trump administration says it will use $4.5 billion in a contingency fund for SNAP payments this month. That comes after they stopped for millions of people over the weekend — the first time the country's largest anti-hunger program has been suspended since it began six decades ago — and after two federal judges ruled that freezing payments for the country's biggest anti-hunger program is unlawful.   But the contingency fund only covers about half the full cost of SNAP benefits each month. States — who administer SNAP — will now have to recalculate for partial payments. And in a recent court filing officials say that could take weeks or even months, especially in states with older systems for folks to get the money on their EBT cards.   The administration also says depleting its contingency fund means there will be no money to sign up new people for SNAP in November — and it's also unclear what doing so would mean for SNAP payments in December if the shutdown persists.   A separate nutrition program is also at risk. The Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) provides nutrition education, breastfeeding support, and other healthcare screenings for 7 million people. Some states are now using emergency funds to keep clinics open and benefits available, but the National WIC Association says those funds are running out quickly.   — Jennifer Ludden, NPR   Read more on the impact of this lapse across the country, here — and you can read more here about how food banks are bracing for it.   \n      What about Head Start?   As of Nov. 3, more than 8,000 children had lost access to Head Start, the federal early-learning program for low-income families. That's because federal funding for individual Head Start programs cannot be disbursed while the government is shut down.   Among the states hit hardest by the November funding lapse: Florida, Georgia, Missouri and Ohio.   Nationally, Head Start serves roughly 750,000 infants, toddlers and preschool-age children, providing not just childcare and early learning but also free meals, health screenings and family support.   Local Head Start programs are funded annually, though at different times of the year. Some programs get their money on Oct. 1, others on Nov. 1 and so on. If the shutdown lasts until December, says Tommy Sheridan of the National Head Start Association, still more programs would see their funding run out.   Without federal funding, Sheridan says, some programs will have to close immediately. Others have the resources to stay open at least another week, in hopes that politicians in Washington can resolve their differences.   — Cory Turner and Kadin Mills, NPR      What the shutdown means for federal workers   Altogether, about 1.4 million civilian federal employees across the country are going without pay, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank in Washington, D.C.   Of those, roughly half are furloughed, which means they are not working and not getting paid, but expect to return to work once the federal shutdown is over.   The other half have been deemed essential and so are continuing to work.   By law federal workers are supposed to get back pay once the shutdown ends, but the White House has tried to cast doubt on that.   The Senate has failed to advance a pair of competing measures to pay at least some federal employees during the government shutdown.   The Trump administration has managed to move money around to ensure that some people get paid, including active duty military and law enforcement officers with the Department of Homeland Security.   \n   Many other federal workers are also still getting paid as usual during the shutdown. Salaries for some federal employees, including the vast majority of those at the Department of Veterans Affairs, do not come out of appropriations that Congress must approve every year.   Are government workers being laid off during the shutdown?   The Trump administration has been following through on threats to further slash the size of government during the shutdown, seeking to lay off roughly 4,000 workers last month.   Some unions that represent workers are fighting back in court; the federal judge overseeing the case on Tuesday indefinitely halted the Trump administration's shutdown layoffs, noting human toll. The order applies to federal employees in programs or offices where the plaintiff unions have members or bargaining units.      How is the shutdown impacting active duty military?   The White House has identified additional funding for the latest round of military paychecks despite the shutdown, according to a spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The spokesperson says that the agency is using around $5 billion from a military housing fund, a military research and development fund and a Defense Department account used for building ships. NPR asked if part of the money is also coming from a $130 million donation made by a billionaire Trump ally, but the OMB did not respond.   In October, the Trump administration found unused research and development funds to pay many active military members so they wouldn't miss a full paycheck, according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly.   Military families are already seeking additional assistance from food banks and other groups to help with paying bills.      USPS is \"open for business as usual\"   \"U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted,\" according to a statement by USPS. The postal service is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual.   \n      IRS furloughs nearly half its staff   A contingency plan from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS' approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees were issued reduction in force, or RIF, notices on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9.   The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year's tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data.   — Scott Horsley, Andrea Hsu and Stephen Fowler, NPR      National Nuclear Security Administration furloughs 1,400 employees   On Oct. 20, the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the nation's nuclear weapons, said it is furloughing approximately 1,400 employees. The agency is responsible for overseeing thousands of warheads that are not currently deployed on missiles, bombers and submarines.   According to an Energy Department spokesperson, the furloughs are due to the \"Democrat shutdown.\"   Roughly 400 employees remain on the job providing security and safety oversight. And the office responsible for moving nuclear weapons around the country remains funded until next week.   — Geoff Brumfiel, NPR   In addition, Nevada Public Radio is reporting more than 1,000 nuclear contractors in Nevada could receive notices by the end of the month, because their work relies on the federal government remaining open.      National Parks are a mixed bag   Across the country, the National Park Service (NPS) have brought their operations to a halt. That includes the National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities. NPR's Alana Wise reports that the Smithsonian assured the public that animals would still be cared for during the zoo's closure. Animal cams are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown.   \n   As KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported, a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails \"will generally remain accessible to visitors\" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided.   Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services.      Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue   Social Security, VA and other benefits will continue.   But employees at Social Security field offices earlier last month said the government shutdown has left them unable to carry out an important service for some recipients. As NPR's Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These official letters act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits.   In an Oct. 21 email to users answering commonly asked questions about how shutdown impacts, SSA noted the online portal can still be used to access benefit verification letters.   Some furloughed employees at the Labor Department were brought back to work, in order to complete the September inflation report, which is a key ingredient used to calculate the cost of living adjustment that Social Security recipients will receive next year. Last week, the SSA said the payments to recipients will increase by 2.8% next year, or an increase of about $56 per month starting in January.   Read more on how a fight over health policy led to the government shutdown from NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin.      ICE will mostly continue uninterrupted   Immigration cases and enforcement are proceeding as usual during the government shutdown, with a few small exceptions. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the employees in the Office of Detention Oversight, which inspects immigration detention centers, are currently not working. \"We hope Democrats will open up the government swiftly so that this office can resume its work,\" McLaughlin said.   \n   According to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, DHS law enforcement, including ICE agents, will be paid for work done during the shutdown.   \"More than 70,000 sworn law enforcement officers across DHS including those serving in CBP, ICE, Secret Service, TSA and other critical mission areas will be paid for all hours worked during the shutdown period,\" Noem posted on X last month. \"By Wednesday, October 22, law enforcement officers will receive a \"super check\" — which covers the 4 days lost, their overtime, and their next pay period.\"   — Ximena Bustillo, NPR      Flying could be challenging   The government shutdown is taking a growing toll on the nation's air traffic controllers, who are working without pay.   Some have taken on second jobs to support themselves during the shutdown, and many have called in sick. That's led to staffing shortages and extensive delays at some airports, raising concerns about more widespread travel chaos if the shutdown continues.   Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy insists the U.S. air travel system is safe, and that the Federal Aviation Administration will continue to reroute and limit the number of planes in order to keep it that way.   Duffy said the administration could be forced to close some of the nation's airspace if the government shutdown continues into next week and controllers miss a second full paycheck.   \"You will see mass flight delays, you'll see mass cancellations, and you may see us close certain parts of the airspace, because we just cannot manage it,\" Duffy said on Tuesday.   Meanwhile, the Transportation Department says that federal subsidies for rural air travel will continue through Nov. 18.   Read more on what a shortage of air traffic controllers could do to bring an end to the shutdown, here.   –  Joel Rose, NPR      The impact of the shutdown looks different in different parts of the country   Some states across the country are uniquely positioned to feel the impact of the government shutdown. Reporters from the NPR Network are digging into the ways the government shutdown is playing out in their region.   \n   Here's what we know so far about how the shutdown is affecting specific communities across the country:   Alaska   The roughly 66,000 Alaskans who participate in the federally funded, state-run SNAP program did not have their cards refilled on Saturday. Alaska will use state funds to fill their SNAP cards and help food banks amid federal delays. [Alaska Public Media]About 15,000 federal employees live in Alaska, one of the highest percentages of federal employees when compared with other states. President Trump's threat that federal employees could receive termination notices increases the uncertainty around how this crucial workforce to Alaska's economy could be affected. [Alaska Public Media]   For more on the impact in Alaska, head to Alaska Public Media.   Arizona   Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs is allocating $1.8 million in emergency state aid [KNAU] She conceded that was only a \"drop in the bucket\" compared to Arizonans' needs. [KJZZ] She said she would not spend state funds to keep Grand Canyon National Park open. [KJZZ]Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport joined a handful of other airports across the country that have refused to display a video from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blaming Democrats for the government shutdown. [KJZZ]   California   Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Oct. 25 that he would deploy the California National Guard to support food banks across California as the federal government shutdown drags on, threatening to delay and stall food stamp benefits for millions of residents. [KQED]Well over 1 million people in L.A. County get food benefits from CalFresh — the state's implementation of the federally funded SNAP program. The other major SoCal counties — San Bernardino, Riverside and Orange — each have more than 300,000 people on CalFresh, according to state data. [LAist] The shutdown of the federal government has brought the full or partial closure of many National Park Service sites across California: Muir Woods is fully closed. Alcatraz Island is slated to stay open. Other sites like Point Reyes National Seashore and Fort Point have partial closures, with some parking lots blocked or bathrooms locked. Even some park staff said they didn't learn the plan until Sept. 30 — the afternoon before the government shut down. Yosemite is open, but with lots of changes for visitors. [KQED]   Colorado   The state is providing funds to operate two visitor centers at Rocky Mountain National Park. Sites and lands in Colorado operated by the National Park Service are open, but \"some services may be limited or unavailable,\" according to the agency's website. [Colorado Public Radio]In Colorado, the federal government employs thousands of workers at federal laboratories, environmental agencies and about 50,000 federal civilian employees working for departments like Agriculture, Interior and Veterans Affairs. [Colorado Public Radio] Court documents show almost 200 Colorado-based positions that the Interior Department wants to cut. [Colorado Public Radio]Unemployment claims from Colorado's federal workers are surging amid the U.S. government shutdown. 1,946 furloughed federal employees have applied for unemployment benefits so far. [Colorado Public Radio]Several Colorado credit unions are already issuing Government Relief Loans to help workers make ends meet. These short-term loans charge no interest as long as they're paid off within six months. [Colorado Public Radio]   Coloradans: Been impacted by the federal government shutdown? Colorado Public Radio wants to hear from you.   Connecticut   Connecticut will spend $3 million, which will stretch about two weeks, to partially supplement federal food aid benefits through the nonprofit Connecticut Foodshare. [WSHU]Connecticut has a $2.5 billion budget surplus this year — its second largest in history. Advocates are asking Lamont to consider using it to help offset the federal shortfall. Legislative leaders are considering appropriating the money during a special session next month. [WSHU]   Georgia   The government shutdown triggered a wave of closures of Head Start centers, leaving students who are from low-income households, are homeless or are in foster care without preschool. [WABE]Kemp has said he will not release any funds for Head Start, SNAP, or other federal programs. [WABE] He instead called on Georgia's two Democratic senators to vote to reopen the government, calling SNAP benefits running out \"the latest example of D.C. Democrats putting bad politics over the people they claim to care about.\" [Georgia Public Broadcasting]For federal workers living paycheck to paycheck, one option to get through being furloughed could be filing for unemployment insurance, Georgia Labor Commissioner Barbara Rivera Holmes said. The employees will have to pay the benefits back once the shutdown ends and they receive back pay, but the benefits can help them make ends meet while they are not being paid. [GPB]Georgia farmers could also face delays in block grant funding and commodity data they rely on during the time-sensitive season of planting and harvesting. [NPR]   Hawaii   Uncertainty surrounding the distribution of SNAP benefits and ongoing furloughs during the government shutdown is straining federal employees in Hawai'i. A food pantry in  Oʻahu food pantry added an extra day of distributions specifically for federal workers. [Hawai'i Public Radio]Hawaii is setting aside $100 million to help eligible families with housing and utility payments. [Hawai'i Public Radio] Farmers in Hawaii also worry about the impacts of the lapse in SNAP funding, as they rely on selling their produce at markets and grocery stores that serve SNAP users. [Hawai'i Public Radio]University of Hawaiʻi is paying affected employees out of pocket during shutdown. Over 830 University of Hawaiʻi employees are at least partially paid through federal dollars, with thousands more in positions that are fully federally funded. UH has been able to pay them with internal funds, but it costs more than $20 million a pay period — every two weeks — for the system to match their salaries. [Hawaiʻi Public Radio]   For more on the impact in Hawai'i, head to Hawaiʻi Public Radio.   Illinois   Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker signed an executive order to direct $20 million in state funding from the Illinois Department of Human Services and the BRIDGE Fund to support food banks across Illinois. The state's BRIDGE reserve fund has about $100 million in it and was created to fill short-term needs in response to Trump administration actions. [WBEZ]. Food pantries and pop-ups on the South and West sides of Chicago were hit with long lines on Saturday [WEBZ]. Three workers who spoke with the Chicago Sun-Times said they haven't been furloughed, but they've dealt with uncertainties and fragmented coordination since the federal government shut down Oct. 1 on top of a year of uncertainty. [Chicago Public Media]Pritzker also signed an executive order to mobilize state support for farmers who have been feeling the impact of Trump's tariffs, including soybean prices dropping and leaving farmers with losses of $100 to $200 per acre. [WBEZ]   Indiana   U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins visited Indiana for the National FFA Convention and Expo and spoke about SNAP benefits. She blamed Democrats' refusal to approve stop-gap funding: \"Even if we could, we're going to be back at this same conversation in two weeks when it runs out again,\" she said. [WFYI]An estimated 24,000 civilians in Indiana work for the federal government. Gleaners Food Bank set up food distribution systems to help federal workers in Indiana impacted by the shutdown. [WFYI]Nonprofits that serve lower-income families in Southern Indiana say they're worried about the shutdown exacerbating food insecurity in the area.  [Louisville Public Media]   Iowa   Over 60,000 Iowans participate in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children. [IPR]Iowa's Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been meeting with the state's six regional food banks. HHS will use existing state funds to match cash donations to the food banks up to $1 million [Iowa Public Radio]   Kansas   Jimmy Chen, who grew up living with food insecurity in Kansas City, made a free app for people on food stamps. His company is giving some of its users $50 each to help offset the government's delayed SNAP payments. [KCUR]During the last two shutdowns, the USDA did not publish its monthly crop reports. This comes at an inconvenient time as Midwest farmers are in harvest season. [KCUR]   For more on the impact in Kansas City, head to KCUR.   Kentucky   Gov. Andy Beshear has been \"noncommittal\" toward the idea of holding a special legislative session on SNAP funding. [Louisville Public Media]State Rep. Nancy Tate said that she supports holding a special legislative session to consider how the state could help food banks: \"They're the people that are on the front line.\" [WKU]Food Pantries called for extra support in navigating the SNAP benefits cliff. [Louisville Public Media]   Louisiana   Gov. Jeff Landry has declared a state of emergency to fund Louisiana SNAP benefits amid federal shutdown. The initial round of funding will come from the Louisiana Department of Health. Legislators also have the option to tap into a state reserve fund to subsidize future months and have approved the initial $150 million ask. [WWNO/WRKF]Some Head Start providers in Louisiana have taken out loans to keep operating if the government shutdown stretches into its second month. [WWNO]The National Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP, is managed by FEMA and provides flood insurance to those who don't have a private option. It has grown in size as most homeowners' insurance policies across the U.S. have dropped flood damage entirely. It covers nearly half a million Louisianans. Policyholders with expiring contracts could lose coverage and funds to pay claims have dropped $30 billion due to the shutdown. [WWNO/WRKF]   For more on the impact in Louisiana, head to WWNO/WRKF.   Maine   Maine receives $29 million monthly for roughly 170,000 residents who are on SNAP. [Maine Public]Officials from the Maine Department of Health and Human Services say they are still waiting for guidance from the Trump administration about when food assistance money will be available. \"Once that direction is received, the department stands ready to issue payments to eligible recipients as quickly as possible,\" Lindsay Hammes, spokeswoman for DHHS said. [Maine Public]Even though much of the staff of Acadia National Park in Maine has been furloughed, it has still been busy at the park. [Maine Public]   Maryland   Maryland Gov. Wes Moore declared a state of emergency Thursday, citing widespread economic disruption, and allocated $10 million to food banks and partner organizations across the state. [WAMU]Prince George's County is home to more than 60,000 federal workers. The Capital Area Food Bank has been distributing food to federal workers affected by the shutdown. But the timing is a double burden: The Capital Area Food Bank has seen some of its own federal funding slashed even as demand skyrockets. [WAMU]   Massachusetts   Gov. Maura Healey said she won't tap Massachusetts' multi-billion-dollar rainy day account to shore up federal food benefits. Instead, she announced $4 million from another state fund, doubling the state's regular November payment to food banks. [WBUR]Still, food banks warned they can't make up for the 56 million meals SNAP benefits would typically cover in Massachusetts this month. On Saturday, the first day of the freeze, nearly 600 people waited in line outside a health center for just one bag of groceries. [WBUR]   Michigan   Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and House Republican leaders announced a plan to use $4.5 million in state money for the Food Bank Council of Michigan. [WEMU]Michigan food pantries say they're already overwhelmed by the demand, including from SNAP recipients. [Michigan Public]More than 9,700 Michigan retailers accept SNAP benefits. In 2023, those retailers redeemed more than $3.6 billion in benefits. Many of those places are now bracing for uncertainty. [Michigan Public]Some Michigan counties have taken extra steps. Washtenaw County Commissioners scheduled a vote to allocate funding from the Older Persons' Millage to various food assistance programs. \"We had to think about what we could do to try to shore some of this up to try and help a little bit,\"Commission Chair Katie Scott said. [WEMU]   Minnesota   The head of Minnesota's Department of Children, Youth and Families said SNAP recipients in the state can expect to receive partial benefits this month although the timeline is unclear. [MPR News] Last week, Gov. Tim Walz announced $4 million in emergency state funding for Minnesota's food pantries as the federal shutdown continues. [MPR News]   Mississippi   Gov. Tate Reeves attacked Democrats in Congress for the shutdown, saying on X that his state is unable to cover the costs, \"There is sadly no simple way for state government to just step in and pay the hundreds of millions of dollars in harm that this shutdown by the Washington Democrats is causing.\"Reeves announced that he has requested a waiver from the USDA to ban the purchase of unhealthy processed foods and drinks using SNAP benefits, and allow the purchase of hot prepared chicken.   Missouri   Roughly 650,000 Missourians will not receive SNAP benefits for the month of November due to the ongoing government shutdown. [St. Louis Public Radio]The Gateway Arch and Old Courthouse in downtown St. Louis are temporarily closed, with National Park Service work largely on hold. [St. Louis Public Radio] The Gateway Arch briefly reopened, but closed again once the shutdown went into its second month. Gov. Mike Kehoe announced funding for Missouri food aid programs. The state is transferring $10.6 million to Missouri Area Agencies on Aging to provide meals to seniors across the state. Another $5 million will be given to food banks using Temporary Assistance for Needy Families funding. [St. Louis Public Radio]   New Hampshire   SNAP serves more than 75,000 people in New Hampshire. New Hampshire food assistance programs will receive an influx of $2 million in state funding for more than 75,000 state residents who rely on SNAP. [NHPR]On Oct. 7, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., the veteran appropriator who has helped broker past bipartisan deals, told NPR, she has been working behind the scenes with senators from both parties to \"find common ground.\" [NPR]Gov. Kelly Ayotte announced Monday mobile food pantries for SNAP recipients will be available starting Wednesday, Nov. 5, and encouraged Granite Staters who could to make a donation to the New Hampshire Food Bank.   For more on the impact in New Hampshire, head to NHPR.   North Dakota   The state-owned Bank of North Dakota is partnering with local banks and credit unions to provide short-term low interest loans to federal government employees and members of the armed services stationed in North Dakota, if they experience financial hardship because of the federal government shutdown. [Prairie Public]Gov. Kelly Armstrong announced he has directed more than $1.5 million in state funds to support food assistance programs. He said the state possesses the resources to respond to the shortfall — but not the infrastructure. \"We're still trying to get more guidance to figure out if there's a way we can lessen the impact.\" [Prairie Public]   For more on the impact in North Dakota, head to Prairie Public.   Oklahoma   With the federal government shut down, National Park rangers are not present at the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum. Victims, family members and first responders are stepping in to educate visitors on the location's story.⁠ [KOSU]Gov. Kevin Stitt, House Speaker Kyle Hilbert and Senate Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton announced a vote to make $1 million a week available to Oklahoma food banks. It comes from the $7.8 million State Emergency Fund and would last up to seven weeks. [KOSU]   Oregon   Oregon's political representatives espouse opposing statements about who is to blame for the shutdown depending on their political party [OPB]. Gov. Tina Kotek announced she's sending $5 million in state funding to food banks. The governor is tapping unspent funds from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the federal program that aids low-income families with children. [OPB]    Pennsylvania   Despite a court ordering the federal government to pay at least partial November food assistance benefits, Pennsylvanians likely won't see that aid anytime soon — due to an extremely complex and cumbersome process federal officials are requiring — according to state human services officials. [WESA]Tens of thousands of Pennsylvania-based federal workers furloughed during the government shutdown may be eligible for unemployment compensation through the state Department of Labor & Industry. [WITF]The SNAP freeze comes at the same time as the commonwealth's own budget impasse, which has stalled billions of dollars meant for schools and social services. [WHYY]\"The Commonwealth cannot backfill these costs,\" Pennsylvania human services officials said in a statement. [WESA]   Tennessee   There are several levers federal and state officials could pull to keep 700,000 Tennesseans from losing food aid. But as of now, it seems no one is touching them. [WPLN]Timmeshia Fleming is a mother of three in Nashville who has used SNAP benefits off and on for years. She said interruptions and delays mean money has to go to food instead of other bills. She told WPLN, it's especially harrowing when it comes without ample warning.

But as the shutdown drags, it is becoming increasingly difficult for Austin's chronically short-staffed tower [KUT].The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides food purchasing support to approximately 3.5 million Texans, including more than 1.7 million children. Those benefits amount to around $617 million per month. [KUT]U.S. Customs and Border Protection employees who inspect cargo at the 32 other official ports of entry are among the essential federal workers who must remain on the job unpaid. The longer the shutdown lasts, the greater the risk of cargo backups at these Texas ports due to unpaid employees calling in sick. [Houston Public Media]   Utah   In Ogden, Utah, about 10 percent work for the IRS, and when federal workers stop getting paychecks, impacts are felt quickly and broadly. [KUER]State leaders have pledged $500,000 a week to Utah Food Bank to support Utahns who rely on federal government food assistance, up to $4 million. [KUER]The connection between economic stress and domestic violence is long established. Some domestic violence service providers in the state worry the resulting stress from the shutdown could lead to more violence at home. [KUER]   Vermont   Vermont's Democratic congresswoman Becca Balint called on House Speaker Mike Johnson to bring House Republicans back to the negotiating table: \"It's astounding,\" she said. \"We have never had a Speaker of the House give up all of his power and authority — and by extension, all of our authority — by disbanding the House.\" [Vermont Public]Gov. Phil Scott and legislative leaders have approved a $6.3 million plan to backfill food benefits for 15 days but the Department for Children and Families says it might not be able to transfer that money to recipients' Electronic Benefits Transfer cards until Nov. 7. [Vermont Public] Lawmakers and the governor allocated $250,000 to bolster supplies at local food banks in the meantime. Anore Horton, executive director of Hunger Free Vermont, said that figure falls well short of the lost buying power SNAP recipients will experience in the meantime. [Vermont Public]Most Head Start programs in Vermont are not being immediately affected by the federal government shutdown, but that could change if the shutdown continues for another month. [Vermont Public]Meanwhile, Vermont is waiting on more than $22 million in federal funds for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance, or LIHEAP, which helps people who can't afford to fill their heating tanks this winter.

Telehealth payments for people on Medicare are on hold during the shutdown.\n                \n                    Fotografía de eLuVe/Moment RF/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Fotografía de eLuVe/Moment RF/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   A few weeks ago, when Vicki Stearn, 68, tried to schedule a virtual visit with her doctor, she was told Medicare — at least temporarily — stopped paying for telehealth appointments when the government shut down. So Stearn was offered a choice: Make an in-person appointment, or pay out of pocket for telehealth.   \"So I said, 'OK, well, when can I get an in-person appointment?' And it wouldn't have been until December.\"   So Stearn, who lives in Bethesda, Maryland, paid — hoping that when the government reopens, she'll be reimbursed. But Stearn, who serves on the patient advisory council for Johns Hopkins Medicine, says the loss of telehealth services complicates life for almost everyone – from the working person to Stearn's own 90-year-old mother, who hates traveling to and from the doctor.   \n   \"When I have a cold, do you really want me to go into the doctor's office and confer with everybody else?\" Strearn says. \"There are just so many different reasons why telehealth is a good idea.\"   'A continual disaster for access'   The use of telehealth in Medicare began in earnest during the pandemic and quickly became popular. Nearly 7 million people on Medicare use telehealth services every year to see their doctors, but the federal shutdown put an abrupt halt on payments covering those services. Specifically, the temporary pandemic-era allowances that have been repeatedly renewed to enable payments, could no longer be reauthorized. Without that administrative approval, Medicare patients — and their doctors — have been left in a very complicated and confusing limbo.   \"It's a continual disaster for access,\" says Kyle Zebley, senior vice president of public policy at the American Telemedicine Association.   Even large hospital systems, he says, do not have a large financial cushion to be able to continue offering services without government reimbursement. Plus, there is no clear guidance that providers will be reimbursed for telehealth services during the shutdown.   Hundreds of hospitals across the country have also suspended their investments in what's often called \"hospital at home\" programs, which offer more elaborate remote monitoring and care that enable patients with more serious conditions to remain at home. Zebley says those patients have been discharged or checked into hospitals if they need continued care.   \n   Zebley says this temporary halt to telehealth services is especially frustrating, because it is expected to return, eventually, and then hopefully made permanent. It's convenient, efficient, and beloved across the political spectrum too, he says. \"There's broad-based bipartisan support from the furthest left member of the Democratic caucus, of the furthest right member of the Republican caucus – nobody is anything other than universally supportive of maintaining these services. And yet here we are.\"   Different ways to deal with the interruption    In the meantime, doctors' offices and hospitals must decide: Do they continue to offer services, float the cost, and hope to recoup payments from Medicare later? Or, do they halt services and require patients to come in, causing a potential backlog in appointments and forcing patients in rural areas to drive long distances?   Helen Hughes, a pediatrician and director of Johns Hopkins' telehealth services, says every Medicare provider she's spoken with seems to be taking a slightly different approach.   During the first two weeks of shutdown, the Hopkins network of hospitals and clinicians continued to offer telehealth appointments that were already on the books. They held off on billing Medicare, though, in the hopes that they'll be reimbursed once the shutdown ends. \"Our clinicians put a charge into our electronic health record, but we're not sending them out to Medicare,\" Hughes says.   But as the shutdown has dragged on and unpaid charges stacked up, Hughes and the hospital system switched course. On Oct. 16, they informed Medicare patients to schedule any new visits in person.   Hughes says, unfortunately, many of those getting called back into doctors' offices are cancer patients, or people who received neurology treatments — conditions for which driving can pose real challenge and physical strain.   And pausing telehealth is not as simple as turning a switch on or off, says Hughes. In the years after the pandemic, Johns Hopkins set up a centralized hub of about 16 physicians who all work remotely — and therefore can see patients over longer hours, more days of the week, and a larger pool of patients, even in rural areas.    \n   That team has continued to work, since it also sees patients with private health insurance.   But Hughes worries the halt in telehealth for Medicare will set back progress, saying that \"in this confusing environment,\" when patients try to \"access this type of care, and can't … we can lose the credibility that this is a stable type of care.\"\n",

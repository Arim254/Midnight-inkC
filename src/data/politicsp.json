Crockett has garnered national attention for her outspoken criticism of President Trump. And now she's aiming to do something no Texas Democrat has done since 1994, and that's win a statewide election. Bekah Morr from member station KERA in Dallas reports.BEKAH MORR, BYLINE: As Jasmine Crockett told supporters at her campaign announcement in south Dallas Monday night, her gloves have been off, but now she's jumping into the ring.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JASMINE CROCKETT: Because, Texas, this moment we're in now is life or death. It's all or nothing. It's now or never.MORR: Texas Democrats know that unseating the incumbent Republican John Cornyn won't be easy but think their best chance is with a more polarizing candidate, like Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. He's running against Cornyn in the GOP primary. Paxton is a Trump loyalist with a controversial background. Democratic organizers hope that makes him vulnerable given recent trends, and a candidate Crockett could beat. In last month's election, voters showed strong support for Democratic candidates in typically Republican strongholds. And Crockett's hoping to capitalize on that shift.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CROCKETT: My message - rooted in slashing costs, making home ownership and entrepreneurship attainable for all, strengthening and growing the middle class - is one that Texas, all of Texas from the panhandle to Port Arthur and from El Paso to east Texas, can believe in.MORR: And polling shows Crockett may have the best chance of all the Democratic hopefuls. In a recent survey from the University of Houston's Hobby School of Public Affairs, she received the majority support of likely voters in a hypothetical contest against Texas state Representative James Talarico and former Congressman Colin Allred. She'll only face Talarico in the primaries, though. Allred dropped out to avoid a runoff and to maximize the chance of Democrats flipping the seat. But doing so in a reliably red state will be an uphill battle. Crockett urged her supporters not to let that deter them.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CROCKETT: For most of us, a Republican-controlled Texas is all we've known. But we cannot let that diminish our faith and belief in what can be.MORR: If Crockett is successful in her Senate bid, she'll be the first Black woman to ever win a statewide election in Texas.For NPR News, I'm Bekah Morr in Dallas.(SOUNDBITE OF WU-TANG CLAN, ET AL.

    "body": "\n      President Trump will hold a rally in Pennsylvania Tuesday, where he's expected to talk about his administration's efforts to address two major concerns for voters: the economy and affordability.   \n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  President Trump travels to Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, today to talk about his administration's efforts to address a top concern for voters - affordability.LEILA FADEL, HOST:  At the White House on Monday, he gave a preview.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You can call it affordability or anything you want, but the Democrats caused the affordability problem, and we're the ones that are fixing it. So it's a very simple statement, and they caused it. We're fixing it.FADEL: This claim after he previously called affordability a, quote, \"hoax.\" In a few moments, we'll unpack the administration's messaging with a Republican strategist. First, let's take a look at Trump's trip, as recent polls show voters blame the president's policies for high prices.MARTÍNEZ: NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith joins us now. Tam, this sort of travel, going out and selling your policies, that's what presidents typically do, except not this year so far.TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Yeah. In his second term, President Trump has done very little domestic travel aimed at pitching his policies to the American people. In fact, he's done way more travel to sporting events than going out in the country and making his case. A senior White House official I spoke with, who was not authorized to speak publicly, readily acknowledged that this sort of messaging travel has been lacking and said the president would be ramping it up late this year and into next year, starting with today's trip to Pennsylvania, which is to a competitive congressional district.MARTÍNEZ: I'd rather go to sporting events, too, but that's just me. So what's this first stop message going to be?KEITH: Well, the senior White House official I spoke to said that the president will be balancing talking about what they see as real economic good news with an acknowledgment that there's more work to do. And just ask President Biden about the perils of telling people that, well, actually, the economy is fine when their cost of living is way up. Getting the tone right on the economy is something presidents have often struggled with. Trump himself has been a bit off message. Take this from a Cabinet meeting last week.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: The word affordability is a con job by the Democrats. They say afford - I watched the other day where some very low-IQ congresswoman talked about affordability, affordability, affordability. She had no idea. Their prices were much higher.KEITH: And inflation did get alarmingly high under Biden, but then it slowed down. The most recent inflation numbers show that the rate in September was the same as it was during Biden's last month in office.MARTÍNEZ: OK. Then will Trump's messaging be paired with any new policies that could actually bring prices down?KEITH: It's a good question, and I'd say that you can never be certain what Trump will say until he says it. But in recent weeks, we've seen a lot of officials all the way up to the vice president asking for patience, saying it will take time for the president's policies to hit the economy. White House economist Kevin Hassett was on CNBC yesterday and said, people with income from tips and overtime should get tax refunds next year.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KEVIN HASSETT: That kind of stuff is going to make it so that people are going to look at their wallets and say, oh, boy, this guy's really making me better off. And in the end, that's more important than any poll.KEITH: But the polls are a problem. Trying to turn that around before the midterms is part of what Trump's doing out on the road today. And yesterday, the president announced a $12 billion bailout for farmers who have been hurt by his tariffs. The administration is casting this as bridge money until the president's trade deals pay off. But it's also an acknowledgment that there are real economic pain points.MARTÍNEZ: All right. That's NPR's Tamara Keith. Thanks a lot.KEITH: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      President Trump is pursuing aggressive policies throughout the Western Hemisphere. His administration is calling it the \"Trump Corollary\" to the Monroe Doctrine.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  The Trump administration has a new name for its aggressive policies in the Western Hemisphere, including military attacks on alleged drug smugglers and threats of regime change in Venezuela. His administration is reaching back two centuries and calling this Trump's version of the Monroe Doctrine. NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre is following all this and is with me in the studio now. Good morning.GREG MYRE, BYLINE: Hi, Leila.FADEL: OK. So for those of us who have forgotten U.S. history here, just give us a refresher on the Monroe Doctrine.MYRE: So U.S. President James Monroe proclaimed this doctrine in 1823, saying European countries should not interfere in the Western Hemisphere, that this is a U.S. zone of influence. Now, any number of U.S. presidents have cited the Monroe Doctrine. For example, Teddy Roosevelt...FADEL: Yeah.MYRE: ...Who oversaw the building of the Panama Canal in the early 1900s. As we know, the U.S. carried out many military and political interventions. In the 20th century, though, in recent decades, the U.S. approach has been a little less heavy-handed.FADEL: And to say the least, not all of these interventions have been successful. What is Trump's version of this doctrine?MYRE: Well, we've been seeing it really since the beginning of this term. He's threatened or imposed actual tariffs against major trading partners from Mexico to Brazil. The U.S. is waging this ongoing military strikes against suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean and the Pacific, and there's this major U.S. naval and troop presence. It's really the largest in decades, and it's accompanied by threats to oust Venezuela's president, Nicolas Maduro. Here's Christopher Hernandez-Roy with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.CHRISTOPHER HERNANDEZ-ROY: The use of hard power, the use of economic power to achieve objectives is something that is more consistent with a sort of a Monroe Doctrine-type of approach to the region, and I think that's what we're seeing.MYRE: And the Trump administration made this explicit last week when it released the national security strategy. Now, this document marks a major change in the overall U.S. approach to the world and to Latin America, in particular. It says, prominently, quote, \"we will assert and enforce a Trump corollary to the Monroe Doctrine.\"FADEL: How is the overall strategy being received in the region? I mean, there are the questions of the legality around these attacks, but particularly the idea that the U.S. military might attack Venezuela directly.MYRE: Yeah. A Brazil research group, AtlasIntel, recently conducted a very detailed survey across the region and found that 53% of Latin Americans would support a U.S. military intervention. Now, in contrast, polls in the U.S. have found a much lower level of support among U.S. citizens, where there's only around 30% who say they support U.S. military action. Now, these findings surprise Hernandez-Roy.HERNANDEZ-ROY: It kind of flips what you would expect on its head, where you'd think that there would be more support in the U.S. for removing a dictator than support among Latin Americans, given the long history of U.S. interventionism.MYRE: So when it comes to Trump's approach to the region, he's also - Hernandez-Roy has also made the point that a number of countries like Mexico have opted for compromise rather than confrontation.FADEL: Right.MYRE: No one really wants to be the country having a showdown with the Trump administration.FADEL: You mentioned that the original Monroe Doctrine was designed to stop other countries from influencing geopolitics in the hemisphere. So what's the goal here? Will Trump be able to stop or reverse the influence of powers like China in Latin America?MYRE: Well, Leila, that's a tall order. And here's a pretty remarkable statistic - China is now the leading trade partner of every country in South America, except Colombia, where it's second to the U.S.FADEL: Wow.MYRE: China has made tremendous economic inroads with Latin America. Trump wants to boost the U.S. role, but some of his policies can be counterproductive. When he placed huge tariffs on China, China responded by halting the purchase of U.S. soybeans and began buying them in Argentina. So getting tough with Latin American countries could have unintended consequences.FADEL: That's NPR's Greg Myre. Thank you, Greg.MYRE: Sure thing, Leila.(SOUNDBITE OF BILL FRISELL'S \"MONROE\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

But there are signs that some Republican lawmakers are trying to reassert their independence.   When news broke last week that the Pentagon carried out a second strike on two individuals on a largely-destroyed alleged drug boat in the Caribbean Sea, even some Republicans expressed alarm.   \"Somebody made a horrible decision,\" Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told reporters in the Capitol. \"Somebody needs to be held accountable. This is our job. This is part of oversight. That's pretty straightforward.\"   \n   The strikes are not the only actions that have spurred a handful of Republicans to stake out a bit of daylight with the Trump administration. Some have criticized Trump's tariffs, like Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.   \"Our lobsterman, our blueberry growers, our potato farmers will pay the price,\" Collins said in October, before a vote to roll back tariffs on Canada.   Ahead of the upcoming expiration date for enhanced health care subsidies, which Trump has signaled indifference to renewing, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., warned last month of a \"massive crisis unless Congress acts.\"   Nebraska Congressman Don Bacon has been one of the most consistent critics of Trump's approach to Russian President Vladimir Putin's incursion into Ukraine. Bacon consistently calls it a soft touch, particularly in contrast to Trump's approach to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.   \"The velvet glove, red carpet treatment for Putin and then the condescending, boorish behavior that the president and the vice president has done towards Zelenskyy — it's a contrast,\" Bacon told Nebraska Public Media earlier this year.   Senators have also pushed back on Trump's intermittent calls to end the filibuster. \"You'd have to be smoking wizard weed to vote for that,\" Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., told reporters during the 43-day government shutdown that ended last month.   \n   And Trump's reluctance to release the investigative files into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein spurred a break between the president and one of his closest allies, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.   \"He called me a traitor for standing with these women,\" she said.   Moments of GOP resistance or a growing trend?   After months of the White House steamrolling Congress on tariffs, appropriations and military intervention, even this careful pushback is a departure, says former Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz.   Flake says the shift is accelerating with Trump's declining approval rating. The pushback also grew following Republicans' poor performance in off-year elections last month.   \"There was a lot of fear about what he could do to you electorally,\" Flake said. \"That's diminishing.\"   \n   Flake, who did not run for reelection in 2018 in part because he refused to unconditionally back Trump, says some lawmakers are now more willing to say aloud what they long expressed behind closed doors.   \"Obviously behind the scenes, it's a whole different ballgame,\" he said. \"This migration is happening and when Republicans get there, they'll get to a new-old place where they were on some of these threshold issues that have animated conservatives for decades.\"   But this is not the first time observers have declared a new era, only for Trump to firm up his grip on congressional Republicans, including the aftermath of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.   \"A lot of us have been wrong on how long this has endured,\" he said.   Most of the Republicans vocalizing their disagreements are retiring, represent competitive districts or are perennial centrists. And some of the splits with Trump have not been over traditional Republican values, but urging him to follow through on the populist platform he ran on.   \n   Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said Congress has made some recent attempts to push back on the White House, like resolutions rebuking the tariffs and boat strikes, but they have not been very successful or sufficient.   \"I'd like to see more, and I believe that if we don't stand up for our powers under the Constitution, nobody else will,\" Murkowski told NPR in an interview.   Constitutional role of Congress   The framers gave the Congress the power to appropriate funds, to declare war and levy taxes, like tariffs.   \n   Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., says it is unfair to say this Congress has relinquished its authority as an independent, coequal branch.   \"I don't know how much different this one is,\" Thune told NPR. \"A lot of times if I have differences with the administration, I don't litigate it in public. But we do have a responsibility as partners to try to get an agenda done for the American people that they voted for.\"   Molly Reynolds, a Brookings Institution expert on Congress, says it's true this is not just a Trump-era phenomenon. Congress has been ceding power to the executive and judicial branches for decades.   \"And in some cases, Congress has been a willing and eager participant in sacrificing its own power to the other branches,\" she said.   Reynolds said this did not start with Trump's willingness to act more unilaterally in his second term, but it did escalate the trend. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., recently told The Katie Miller Podcast that, \"We have this joke that I'm not really a speaker of the House.\"   Reynolds, who jokingly calls herself a partisan of the first branch, says it is no accident the legislative branch is established in Article 1 of the Constitution. She said the framers saw the legislative branch as the closest to the people. The separation of powers and checks and balances are foundational concepts of the American form of government.   Reynolds said there is precedent for Congress taking steps to reassert its power, like the Watergate-era reforms to rein in the power of the president.   \"It was in a really different political moment than the one we're living in now,\" Reynolds said, noting that politics is more polarized today. \"Which is part of what makes it challenging to see the prospects for a similar burst of institutional patriotism.\"\n",

Senators plan to vote on new political maps that would help Republicans capture all nine of Indiana's seats in Congress.A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  It's the latest in an unprecedented wave of mid-cycle redistricting spurred by President Trump's demands to boost his party's chances in next year's midterms.FADEL: NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas joins us now from Indianapolis. Hi, Sam.SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: Hey, Leila.FADEL: So lots of states - right? - are doing this mid-cycle redistricting in this kind of tit for tat. Why is Indiana so notable?GRINGLAS: Well, first, it is high drama. We do not know what's going to happen here. Currently, Indiana is represented by seven Republicans and two Democrats. The proposed map would dismantle those two heavily Democratic districts. Even many Republican lawmakers have pushed back despite a lot of pressure from Trump and his allies. So if this effort fails, it's a huge rebuke. And if it passes, Democrats could be wiped out from Indiana's delegation.FADEL: So a lot at stake here. You're there in Indianapolis. What are you seeing at the state capitol?GRINGLAS: Hundreds of protesters with handmade signs packed the hall outside the Senate yesterday. The protesters opposed to redistricting were chanting so loudly that senators could hear it inside the chamber. A hundred and twenty-seven people signed up for public comment. I met one of them, Leon Bates.LEON BATES: Franklin said democracy is a wonderful thing if you can keep it, and here we are. We may be watching it slip away right before our eyes.GRINGLAS: Bates told me his predominantly Black community will be chopped up. The new map will divide Indianapolis into four, so a voter in the city could soon be in a district that stretches 150 miles to Kentucky.FADEL: Wow. So remind us why this redistricting push is happening now.GRINGLAS: Normally, new maps are drawn after a census, but Trump has pushed Republican-run states to redraw before the midterms. Voter Gregory Cantor (ph) told lawmakers that Republicans have to do what they can to keep the House.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GREGORY CANTOR: It's a choice between the president your voters elected 60-40 having a full term or being a lame duck, fighting endless nonsense impeachments and investigations.GRINGLAS: So now some Democratic-controlled states are trying to redistrict, too.FADEL: Now, Republicans control Indiana's Legislature. So why is passing this new map not a sure thing?GRINGLAS: A lot of Republicans have heard from constituents that they do not want this. The top Senate Republican initially rebuffed holding a session, saying the votes just weren't there, but Trump amped up the pressure, even calling out undecided members by name. Some Republican senators, like Greg Walker, faced threats of violence. Last night, he said relenting in his opposition would have been like accepting a bribe and said the stakes really crystallized for him recently as he held a constituent's baby.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GREG WALKER: As I thought about the future for that child, where we accept that intimidation is normal. And I shall refuse the offer for the sake of that child in the future of the state.FADEL: You can really hear the emotion in his voice. Does it seem like this new map will become law?GRINGLAS: The map already passed the House and advanced out of a Senate committee last night, but the Indiana Senate majority leader told us we're all going to find out what will happen when the Senate votes later this week.FADEL: NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas in Indianapolis.

    "body": "\n      Affordability was a huge theme of Trump's campaign and is top of mind for the GOP as he heads to Pennsylvania for a rally. How are Pennsylvanians feeling, and can the GOP salvage its economic message?   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  Life has gotten very expensive for Americans - food prices, utility bills, health care costs. So it is no surprise that affordability is becoming a campaign centerpiece for Democrats and Republicans as we start looking ahead to next year's midterms. President Trump is in the most important swing state in the country, Pennsylvania, today to try to take those issues head on, but this is a topic that in recent weeks, the president has struggled to address.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You use the word affordability. It's a Democrat hoax. They're the ones that drove the prices up.DETROW: Trump is in Monroe County, a place in northeastern Pennsylvania that backed President Biden in 2020, then swung to Trump in the 2024 election. So how are swing voters in a swing state feeling about all of this? We called up Christopher Borick, professor of political science at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and the director of the college's Institute of Public Opinion. Welcome to the show.CHRISTOPHER BORICK: Hey. Thanks, Scott.DETROW: You are the person to call when we want to know about public opinion in Pennsylvania. So let's start with kind of the basic numbers that you are seeing. How are Pennsylvanians feeling about the economy? How are they feeling about President Trump?BORICK: Yeah. Not surprisingly, Scott, they mirror lots of what we see nationally. Pennsylvanians are not in a good mood regarding the economy, the direction of the nation as a whole. And that's reflected in their appraisals of President Trump. His job approval numbers are in the low 40s, which, again, mirror what's happening nationally. It's not the same environment that he found just a year ago in the commonwealth when he was able to carry the state for the second out of three attempts here.DETROW: In terms of the numbers you're seeing, approval ratings, things like that, how much has changed or how little has changed over the past 12 months?BORICK: Well, as you know very well, Pennsylvania is a state that's always on the margin when it comes to presidential elections, and often just the smallest changes are really impactful. And so last year when the president carried Pennsylvania, he did so by, you know, a little over a point, almost two points. And therefore, his margin of error, if you will, in terms of staying above water, isn't that great. And so if you lose even 5- to 10% of the voters in the state, it's significant. And if you look at where his polls are now compared to where they were a year ago, there has been loss. And most of that loss is in terms of his handling of areas that were once a strength.DETROW: Yeah.BORICK: And those strengths are economic matters where he's seen the biggest decline in terms of how the public views him.DETROW: He, just like Joe Biden before him, would blame the economy on Donald Trump. Trump is regularly blaming the economy on Joe Biden. We are a year into this administration. Do you have any sense from what you're seeing and hearing of the limits of that kind of message?BORICK: I think it's very limited, Scott, the ability to really convince people a year in almost to his administration that this is largely the impact of the cards that he was dealt when he came into office. I think the president has got to really difficult time making that case. It's going up against what people feel and Pennsylvanians feel. And right now they don't feel good. They don't feel good about lots of things. They don't feel good about electricity prices. They don't feel good about housing prices in the area. They certainly don't feel good about health care. And while the president can craft a message that targets the Biden-era impacts, I think it's just - it's not necessarily reaching the audience in a way that's mattering for him.DETROW: You know, it's such a static political country. You talk about the fact that Pennsylvania is always on the margins, but it's a state that went for Trump, went against Trump, went for Trump again. What is the best way to think about the voters who have gone back and forth and what draws their attention, what turns them off, what wins their support?BORICK: Yeah. Scott, it's a group that I think is longing for something and not always easily defined. As you said, they've vacillated now in Pennsylvania, in places like Monroe County, Northampton County, the eastern side of the state, over the last three elections. And I think they're searching for something that's not necessarily always easily attainable. And right now, who's ever in power seems to be paying a price for that longing. It's hard to make a case, right? It's hard to make a case to voters who aren't happy that you are really doing a good job. Biden struggled. Trump struggled before him, and now Trump is struggling again. It's a big challenge to convince unhappy voters that you're doing a job that's, you know, serving their best interest.DETROW: That's Christopher Borick, professor of political science at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania, also the director of the college's Institute of Public Opinion. Thank you so much.BORICK: Hey. Thanks, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Democrats are watching to see if Latinos in south Florida shift toward their party. From member station WLRN in Miami, Joshua Ceballos reports.JOSHUA CEBALLOS, BYLINE: This is the first competitive mayoral race in the city of Miami in nearly two decades. For the past 20 years, the mayor has been voted in without a runoff, and the position has been consistently held by a Latino Republican. But this year is different. Republican and former city manager Emilio Gonzalez faces off against Eileen Higgins. She is a Democrat and has served on the Miami-Dade County commission. If Higgins wins, she'd be the city's first female elected mayor and the first non-Hispanic in decades. Observers, like political analyst Susan MacManus with the University of South Florida, say this race could be a bellwether for the Latino vote in 2026.SUSAN MACMANUS: Most outsiders looking in at this, their No. 1 question is, is the Latino vote noticeably going to switch from Republican to Democrat, and if so, how much?CEBALLOS: President Trump is likely to cast a shadow over the local election. He endorsed Gonzalez, who was the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under George W. Bush. Gonzalez says he wants strict immigration standards.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)EMILIO GONZALEZ: I'm in support of a border policy. We did not have a border policy.CEBALLOS: He is also supporting Trump's move to end temporary protected status, which provides a legal way to stay in the U.S. for several migrant groups, including Venezuelans. Higgins, meanwhile, is critical of policies that led to the development of the ICE detention facility dubbed Alligator Alcatraz, which has been widely criticized for harsh confinement practices.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)EILEEN HIGGINS: From Washington and from Tallahassee, there is this culture of trickle-down hatred. We have governments that are building cages for people rather than building housing.CEBALLOS: Immigration issues, experts say, are dividing Latino voters in south Florida and may not only influence this mayor's race but impact midterm elections nationwide next fall.For NPR News, I'm Joshua Ceballos in Miami.(SOUNDBITE OF CHANCLA AND OATY.'S \"AZOIA\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "\n      Americans are concerned about high costs, but President Trump recently called affordability \"a Democrat hoax.\" NPR unpacks the administration's messaging with GOP strategist Brendan Buck.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Donald Trump made rising costs a central theme of his 2024 presidential campaign. Here he is during a campaign rally last year.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Under Kamala Harris and crooked Joe Biden, the American dream is dead. You don't hear about the American dream anymore. It's dead. Their radical liberal policies have caused horrific inflation, decimated the middle class and gutted the finances of millions and millions of American families.FADEL: But 11 months into Trump's second term, consumer prices are rising, and he's trying to distance himself from the problem.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Just about everything is down. You know, this whole thing is - they use the word affordability. It's a Democrat hoax. They're the ones that drove the prices up.FADEL: How's that message playing with voters, and could it be a problem for Republicans in the midterms? Let's talk about it with Republican strategist Brendan Buck. He's a partner in the consulting firm Seven Letter and previously worked as a staffer for two former House speakers, Paul Ryan and John Boehner. Good morning.BRENDAN BUCK: Good morning.FADEL: OK. So the president campaigned on affordability. Then from the White House, he's calling it a Democratic hoax, but at the same time, blaming higher prices on Democrats. How's that going to play with voters?BUCK: Yeah. Messaging on the economy is always hard because you're confronting people's experiences every day and trying to - especially when you're trying to tell them something that is different than what they feel. So it takes a lot of work, and it takes a lot of discipline. I think the challenge for this White House is that this is a president who seems very not-bought-into this idea that it is even a problem. And they can send him to Pennsylvania, and they can put the right talking points in the teleprompter. But if he doesn't actually believe it, I think it's going to be hard for them to continue to make a difference on people - how people feel about it. All it takes is one or two more lines like that - that this is a hoax or a con job - and Democrats are going to be able to take this issue away from him. And, like, as you said, it's the issue that he won the election on.FADEL: So you mentioned Pennsylvania. He's expected to talk about high costs at a rally later today. What should he tell Americans? I mean, you're saying he doesn't even believe there is an affordability issue.BUCK: Well, one of the things that Donald Trump was always very good at, and polls showed this, is that he had - was better than most Republicans at empathy. People felt like he was actually fighting for them. And that was an issue where polls showed that Donald Trump cared more about people than the Democratic Party. And that's something that Republicans had always struggled with, and that was an advantage that he took. And now I think he's squandering that away. It certainly doesn't feel empathetic when he's telling people that their issue is a con job.At the same time, people don't see him focusing on this issue every day. You know, they're talking about a few of these economic issues now, but most of this administration has been spent focusing on economic or, excuse me, foreign policy issues, or even some trivial issues. I mean, people look up and see him working on the - a ballroom or hosting Kennedy Center Honors, and that doesn't project a message that you are laser-focused on the thing that they care about. So they need to talk about it. They need to put policies in place. I would start with the tariffs. Getting rid of those would be, I think, a huge start. But I'm not holding my breath that he's going to give up on what he considers one of his signature policy achievements.FADEL: Is this president making the same mistake as President Biden, trying to convince Americans that affordability - that what they're feeling is not really what they're feeling? The economy's good. Affordability isn't an issue.BUCK: Clearly. And we've seen what happens with voters when you do that. Voters will take it out on the party in power. I mean, I think every party suffers from this a little bit, where you get elected and you think that you were elected based on everybody loving all of your ideas, when in reality, they - it was really more likely just a rejection of the previous administration and what they did. Voters will take it out on you if you do not make their lives feel better. And right now it's very clear that the president has squandered his polling on the economy. And it would be one thing if there really was a bright light at the end of the tunnel here, if there was something coming next year that we could reliably think is going to make people feel better. I'm just not convinced that the One Big Beautiful Bill, the tax act that they did last - this past year, is actually going to change people's feelings going into next year. So, yeah, it's a huge problem.FADEL: So is this lane that the Democrats now own politically, messaging-wise with voters, because they're not in power? We saw that work really well in elections this year for Democrats like New York City Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani's race.BUCK: Yeah. And it's as simple as you said - just not being in power. I mean, sometimes we overthink these things, that Democrats need a 10-point plan of how they're going to lower inflation. I think that is good to have if they have it. But as a matter of pure politics, simply being the out party and the party out of power and saying that the people in charge aren't getting it done is really powerful. That's what happened with Joe Biden. He was in charge. It was on his watch. Didn't solve the problem. And Donald Trump will probably meet the same fate in the midterms if he faces the same situation. You've been in charge for a year, or two years by the time the midterms comes around, and you haven't solved the problem. It's as simple as that. And people will swing to the other party unless they feel like you are addressing their core concerns.FADEL: Brendan Buck is a Republican strategist with the firm Seven Letter. Thank you so much for your time.BUCK: My pleasure.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      The recent shooting of two National Guardsmen in D.C. has revived calls from the Trump administration for \"reverse migration,\" or \"remigration.\" But those ideas trace back to European extremists.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  After an Afghan national was charged in the ambush of two national guardsmen last month in Washington, D.C., the U.S. has further restricted immigration from 19 countries. President Trump has also revived a call for, quote, \"reverse migration,\" a once fringe idea that has become a mantra for this administration. NPR domestic extremism correspondent Odette Yousef joins us now to talk about all of this. Hi, Odette.ODETTE YOUSEF, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa.CHANG: OK, so where exactly within this administration are you seeing these calls for reverse migration or remigration, as it's sometimes referred to, right?YOUSEF: Right. So President Trump on Thanksgiving Day posted to social media about how immigration policies have hurt, quote, \"gains and living conditions for many.\" And he said only reverse migration can fully cure this situation. But also, the State Department's proposed reorganization plan included a new office of remigration, and the Department of Homeland Security has called for remigration on social media posts. One of them, for example, Ailsa, with simply the word remigrate.CHANG: OK. So what does remigrate exactly mean?YOUSEF: Well, here's how Heidi Beirich explained it to me. She's with the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism.HEIDI BEIRICH: Basically, what it means is ethnically cleansing or forcibly deporting from traditionally white countries everybody who's not white. That's the idea.YOUSEF: The idea is often attributed to a French novelist who became known as the originator of the Great Replacement conspiracy theory, which is this baseless claim that white Christian Europeans are being systematically replaced by immigrants in an attempt to dilute European or Western cultures. And remigration was the solution he proposed. And the idea was that it would be a kind of organized removal of immigrants and even the children of immigrants. And Ailsa, these were fringe ideas earlier this century, but they are now associated with a movement that cuts across Europe known as the identitarian movement and which has increasingly informed party politics there and here.CHANG: Right now. OK, so talk more about that. Like, how have these ideas become mainstream today?YOUSEF: So the change is largely attributed to an extreme right Austrian political activist named Martin Sellner. He's a former neo-Nazi, and now he heads up an international network called Generation Identity, and he has worked to bring terms like remigration into popular discourse. I spoke to Julia Ebner about this. She heads the Violent Extremism Lab at the University of Oxford, and she has sat in on strategy sessions for identitarian groups. She says they staged events to create uncertainty and fear because then they found that people were more open to their extreme ideas.JULIA EBNER: The strategy was all about controlled provocation and strategic polarization. So they were launching media stunts in the streets of - from Vienna to Berlin to Paris, where they tried to generate as much media attention as they could possibly get from, for example, simulating a terrorist attack in the heart of Vienna or putting a burqa on top of an old statue. So their idea was to really to provoke strategically and step by step to move the Overton window.YOUSEF: The Overton window, Ailsa, refers to the range of policy ideas that the public considers acceptable. Remigration for a long time fell outside that window, but that's no longer true.CHANG: No longer true. I mean, it is interesting that these ideas are so strongly associated with Europe. Like, how did they take root here in the U.S. then?YOUSEF: So a personal story. Years ago, I was interviewing someone who was in charge of recruitment in the Midwest for a group called Identity Evropa, which at the time was the U.S.-based identitarian group. And I remember asking him how did he think the U.S. would become a white nation if not with violence. And he said he thought people would just remigrate. I think that was the first time I heard the term. And it sounded ridiculous to me. You know, why would millions of people who had put down stakes just willingly uproot?CHANG: Yeah.YOUSEF: Well, years later, remigration has been operationalized. We are seeing it with immigration operations in LA, Chicago, Charlotte, New Orleans and so on. I did some reporting from Chicago about, you know, the disorder, the tear gas, the pepper guns, military-style raids and beatings that occurred in that operation in places that didn't normally see those things. And so it has been clear that the removal of people is violent.CHANG: But what are you hearing, Odette, from White House officials when they are being asked why they are using terms that are adopted by white nationalists?YOUSEF: The White House, the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department all rejected or didn't acknowledge the European extremist roots of this policy idea when I asked them about it. But I think it's important also to add the context of other terms that this administration has been using, you know, talking about Western values, Western civilization, chiding European allies for making themselves vulnerable to civilizational suicide or civilizational erasure. Beirich says this is language that sits firmly within the rhetoric of the identitarian and broader white nationalist movement.CHANG: That is NPR's Odette Yousef. Thank you so much, Odette.YOUSEF: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

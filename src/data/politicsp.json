Greg Abbott has quickly appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court a ruling that the redistricting passed by lawmakers at the urging of President Trump was based on racial gerrymandering.   \"Any claim that these maps are discriminatory is absurd and unsupported by the testimony offered during ten days of hearings,\" Abbott, a Republican, said in a statement. \"This ruling is clearly erroneous and undermines the authority the U.S. Constitution assigns to the Texas Legislature by imposing a different map by judicial edict.\"   A three-judge panel had earlier Tuesday placed a temporary block on the map that Republican lawmakers passed this summer and ordered the state to use the district maps from the last two elections.   \n   The map that was overruled had been drawn to give Republicans an advantage in flipping as many as five House seats held by Democrats.    \"To be sure, politics played a role in drawing the 2025 Map. But it was much more than just politics. Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map,\" wrote the majority from a three-judge panel.   The panel heard a trial on the case in October. The plaintiffs included several civil rights groups and individuals.   The ruling is a blow to Trump and the Republicans in a nationwide redistricting race that began in Texas this summer.   Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate, also said he would appeal the ruling on the \"Big Beautiful Map\" which he called \"entirely legal\" in a statement.   Democrats praised the court ruling. \"Race was always a driving factor and a driving factor to make it harder for minority Texans,\" said Texas Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher in an interview. \"This map was drawn to make it harder for them to have an impact in elections.\"   \n   The court's decision, in a 2-1 ruling, comes at a pivotal moment. Around the country, Trump is pressing Republican state lawmakers to reshape congressional voting maps to hold the party's slim majority in the House and support his agenda.   Using their heavy Republican majority in the legislature, Texas lawmakers passed a map in August designed to help their party grow its ranks in the 2026 elections for the U.S. House.   The process gained national attention when Democrats in the legislature fled the state for over two weeks to delay a vote and Republican leaders threatened to arrest them. Democrats argued the new map weakened the voting power of Latino and Black communities.   \n   The redistricting in Texas also prompted California Democrats to act. This month California voters passed an initiative allowing redistricting that could help Democrats win five seats in that state.   Was it partisan gerrymandering or racial gerrymandering?    Republicans in the Texas Legislature passed the map saying it was designed to improve their party's chances of winning five congressional seats. They noted that, unlike in some states, the law in Texas does not prohibit redistricting for partisan advantage and that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that federal courts could not intervene when it's done.   But partisan gerrymandering can often overlap with racial gerrymandering, which is illegal. Opponents of the map argued in court that it intentionally diminished the voting power of minority communities.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Texas state Sen. Sarah Eckhardt, a Democrat, right, questions Republican Sen. Phil King during debate in August over the Republican-backed district map that a federal court blocked and called a racial gerrymander on Tuesday.\n                \n                    Eric Gay/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Eric Gay/AP\n    \n\n   \n   The 160-page opinion was written by District Judge Jeffrey V. Brown, who was appointed by Trump during his first term as president. His ruling drew upon statements and contradictions in what Republican lawmakers said as the maps were passed.   A letter the Department of Justice wrote to encourage the redistricting ended up being grounds the court used to block the effort.   The judges noted that when Gov. Abbott originally called lawmakers into session to draw the map, he cited a letter from Justice Department officials criticizing districts that had majority nonwhite voting populations as \"racial gerrymanders.\" In other words, the letter implied the districts as they stood gave non-white voters an advantage and that had to be reversed.   Eventually, Texas Republicans said the map was not intended to correct for a racial tilt but for partisan gain.   That letter put lawmakers, who for years had denied their use of race when making maps, in \"a difficult spot,\" according to University of Texas at Austin political scientist Josh Blank, because they were \"ultimately saying opposite things.\"   Brown's ruling criticized the construction of the letter itself, which was sent by Harmeet Dhillon, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. \"It's challenging to unpack the DOJ Letter because it contains so many factual, legal, and typographical errors,\" Brown wrote.   \n   \"This decision is a rebuke of Donald Trump and to some degree a rebuke of lawmakers in Texas,\" said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political scientist with the University of Houston. \"They think the process was flawed and the Department of Justice was not credible in their legal arguments.\"   Rep. Gene Wu, Democratic leader in the Texas House, said Tuesday's ruling shows the courts still hold true to American principles.   \"The striking down of the maps is fundamentally a sign that the courts still believe in the core principles of this country: That one man, one vote idea is something that is absolute and must be kept up,\" Wu said.   Around the country, Republicans have more options for redistricting seats their way than Democrats do, in part because the GOP controls more state legislatures. Usually, states redistrict at the start of the decade after the national census.   At the behest of Trump, lawmakers in Missouri and North Carolina passed new maps that could help the GOP win a seat in each state. Ohio drew a map that analysts say gives Republicans a slight advantage in a few seats.   For Democrats, in addition to the five seats that could be gained in California, a court-ordered redistricting in Utah could help Democrats win a seat there. And Virginia Democrats have started a process that could yield two seats in that state.      Blaise Gainey covers state politics for The Texas Newsroom.

It was the marquee event of the annual Tradeswomen Build Nations conference. The women marched, sang and rang cowbells, proudly sporting their union t-shirts and carrying banners announcing their trades: plumbing, pipefitting, roofing, drywall finishing and many more.   Leading the parade in fluorescent vests and hardhats was a drumline made up of a dozen or so staff from the nonprofit Chicago Women in Trades.   \"This is amazing to see what it has grown into,\" says Lauren Sugerman, who worked as an elevator constructor in the 1980s before spending the bulk of her career at Chicago Women in Trades. \"To see the sisterhood that has been built is so empowering.\"   \n   But behind the celebration are grave concerns that the organization, which has been breaking down barriers for women in the construction industry since Ronald Reagan was president, could be brought down by President Trump.   As Trump wages a war against diversity, equity and inclusion or DEI, Chicago Women in Trades is fighting back in court, both for its own preservation and for the movement.   Trump's all-out effort to end DEI   Hours after Trump took office, he signed a pair of executive orders cracking down on what he said was widespread and illegal use of \"dangerous, demeaning, and immoral race- and sex-based preferences.\"   His orders called on government agencies to cease DEI-related work and directed government contractors and grantees to end their programs promoting it. Trump also rescinded a 1965 executive order, signed by former President Lyndon B. Johnson, that required federal contractors and subcontractors to take proactive steps to ensure they weren't violating federal anti-discrimination laws.    Trump promised a renewed emphasis on merit, replacing what he called a \"pernicious identity-based spoils system.\"   \n   Here's why that's a problem for Chicago Women in Trades: The organization was founded in 1981 in response to Johnson's executive order and a subsequent Labor Department requirement — also now gone — that federal contractors make good faith efforts to get women onto construction sites. Its stated mission is to promote diversity, equity and inclusion, including by recruiting women and helping them qualify and compete for high-wage union construction jobs.    Some 70% of its participants are Black and Latina. As of January, roughly 40% of its annual budget came from U.S. Labor Department grants.   \n   What is illegal DEI? Lots of threats but no clarity   While the loss of federal grants would be devastating, perhaps even more damaging to Chicago Women in Trades is the certification provision tucked inside one of Trump's executive orders.   Going forward, federal contractors and grantees must certify that they are not operating programs \"promoting DEI that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws.\" Anyone found to have knowingly reported false information could face steep civil and criminal penalties, according to the executive order.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Chicago Women in Trades Executive Director Jayne Vellinga says the organization is in limbo as it fights Trump's anti-DEI executive orders in court.\n                \n                    Chicago Women in Trades\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chicago Women in Trades\n    \n\n   \n   \"There's a lot of threats out there but no clarity on what is illegal DEI,\" says Chicago Women in Trades Executive Director Jayne Vellinga. \"It is unclear how the industry or anyone is going to respond to it.\"   It's a conundrum that puts the nonprofit in a precarious position. Chicago Women in Trades works closely with labor unions and contractors to ensure the women they recruit and train can get into apprenticeship programs to grow their careers. Would unions and contractors now sever those relationships if forced to certify that they're not engaging in illegal DEI? Without those established systems, Vellinga fears hard-won gains for women could be lost.   \"We have an administration that is trying to turn back the clock on progress it has taken decades to achieve,\" says Vellinga.   In a statement to NPR, White House spokesman Kush Desai pushed back.   \"Instead of DEI boondoggles that accomplish nothing, the Trump administration is laying the groundwork for Americans of all backgrounds to help build our next Golden Age,\" Desai wrote, pointing to another executive order Trump signed that aims to boost the country's skilled trades workforce. Trump has pledged to support 1 million new registered apprenticeships per year and says a plan for doing so is forthcoming.   \n   Women-focused programs have changed lives   Talk to female construction workers around Chicago and you get a sense for how Chicago Women in Trades has long worked to achieve those same goals.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Second-year plumbing apprentices Charlie Willoughby, Juliet Silvestre and Kaitlyn Truty all came into the skilled trades through a pre-apprenticeship program run by Chicago Women in Trades.\n                \n                    Andrea Hsu/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrea Hsu/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Second-year plumbing apprentices Kaitlyn Truty, Charlie Willoughby and Juliet Silvestre credit the nonprofit with getting them into their careers.   \"I 100% believe so,\" says Truty.   All three women came through the organization's free, 10-week training program, where they got an introduction to the gamut of construction trades and learned basic skills such as tool handling and blueprint reading.   \n   \"We had to work out as well,\" says Willoughby, recalling the morning gym sessions. As part of an assessment to enter the plumbers union, they had to lift an 80-pound box onto a shelf over their heads. Chicago Women in Trades brought in plumbers to teach them how to do it.   \"It was so intimidating,\" says Truty. \"I couldn't do more than two pushups walking in, and I walked out … being able to do 50-plus pushups in one go, and I lifted that box.\"   The apprentices say having a community of women around them helped them believe that they were up to the task and prepared them for the challenges they would face as females in the industry. Even now, they say they are often the only woman on a job site.   \"The people in your family don't understand what you're going through, but another tradeswoman can relate to you,\" says Silvestre. \"They understand me.\"   The carpenters union ends \"Sisters in the Brotherhood\"   Already, one building trades union has taken steps to avoid running afoul of Trump's executive orders. Earlier this year, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, representing more than a half million workers in North America, disbanded its Sisters in the Brotherhood program.   For more than a quarter century, the program gave women carpenters a space to build networks and share ideas for how to overcome barriers. In a memo, Douglas McCarron, the union's general president, wrote that current policies targeting identity-based initiatives put the program at legal risk. It's been replaced with an engagement program, open to all members.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Retired union carpenter Kina McAfee listens to stories of other tradeswomen who, like her, entered the construction industry in the 1980s. McAfee says women-focused programs are critical to getting women established in the industry and keeping them on the job.\n                \n                    Chicago Women in Trades\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chicago Women in Trades\n    \n\n   \n   \"It's very ironic that you can have a 'Brotherhood of Carpenters' which references brothers, but you can't have – because of DEI – a 'Sisters in the Brotherhood,'\" says Kina McAfee, a retired union carpenter who is now on staff at Chicago Women in Trades. \"I don't understand it. And it will impact our ability to get women into the trades in the future.\"   \n   The union did not respond to NPR's questions about the change.   \n   Awaiting a major ruling   Already, Chicago Women in Trades' lawsuit challenging Trump's anti-DEI executive orders has brought the nonprofit some protection.   In April, U.S. District Judge Matthew Kennelly in the Northern District of Illinois preemptively blocked the termination of one of the nonprofit's federal grants.   Kennelly also blocked the certification provision in Trump's executive order for Labor Department contractors and grantees nationwide, after finding that Chicago Women in Trades was likely to prove it would suffer irreparable harm should the provision stand.   The Trump administration has appealed that part of Kennelly's decision to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. In court briefs, the administration has argued that the provision merely requires grantees to verify that they won't violate existing federal anti-discrimination laws.   The court is expected to hold a hearing on the matter, though a date has not been set.   As Vellinga awaits a ruling, she says it's hard to imagine what the future will look like.   \"We feel like we're in limbo,\" she says.   Particularly vexing to Vellinga is that Chicago Women in Trades is fighting this battle at a time when women still make up less than 5% of the skilled trades workforce nationwide.   \"You cannot look at the workforce of the construction trades and say, 'Oh, they've taken DEI too far,'\" she says with a rueful laugh. \"You look at the workforce of the construction trades and you see we have a long way to go.\"\n",

The survey of 1,443 adults, conducted from Nov. 10-13, found:   Democrats holding their largest advantage, 14 points, since 2017 on the question of who respondents would vote for if the midterm elections were held today;President Trump's approval rating is just 39%, his lowest since right after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol;A combined 6-in-10 blame congressional Republicans or Trump for the government shutdown; and Nearly 6-in-10 say Trump's top priority should be lowering prices — and no other issue comes close.   \n   \"I don't think rent prices or food prices are at the forefront like they should be,\" said Nicole Stokes of Dallas, Texas, who participated in NPR's poll and voted for Trump last year. \"You know — the American people — it's our pockets that are getting ripped apart to fund things.\"   From the political parties and Congress to the Supreme Court and the media, other respondents said they had little to no confidence in these critical institutions.   \"I feel lost,\" said poll respondent Wayne Dowdy of Memphis, Tenn., who calls himself a \"lapsed Democrat.\" \"The parties don't speak to me anymore.\"   He said he often feels unseen by the Democratic Party, but, given the alternative, he plans to keep supporting Democratic candidates — for now.   The disillusionment extends to how people see those in the opposite political party. Big majorities of Democrats and Republicans said the other party is \"dishonest\" and \"closed-minded\" about politics.   All of it makes for a volatile political stew heading into the holidays, but with Republicans in charge of all the levers of power in Washington, Democrats have the clear advantage a year out from next year's midterm elections.   Loading...\n   Democrats in the driver's seat for control of Congress   Coming off huge wins up and down the ballot across the country in this year's off-year elections, Democrats lead Republicans, 55%-41%, when people were asked who they would vote for in their district if the election for Congress were held today.   It's the largest Democratic advantage on this question, known as the congressional ballot, in the Marist poll since November 2017. The parallel is striking, considering that was at the same point in Trump's first term as this poll now. Democrats wound up winning 40 House seats in 2018.   Loading...\n   What's more, independents chose Democrats by a 33-point margin on this question. It's all quite the reversal of fortune from a year ago when, just before the 2024 elections when President Trump won back the White House, the parties were tied on the congressional ballot.   Historically, Democrats have needed a sizable advantage on the congressional ballot to signal that they would do well in upcoming midterms.   Consider:   In the fall of 2022, with Democratic President Biden in the White House, Democrats' lead ranged from 0 to 4 points. They lost nine House seats;In 2018, during Trump's first term, Democrats' lead ranged between 6 and 12. They won 40 seats; In 2014, when Democrat Barack Obama was president, Republicans had a 5-point advantage. The GOP gained 13 seats.   All that said, with redistricting, the number of competitive seats has shrunk significantly, so major gains are less likely than they were in previous years. Trump has also encouraged conservatives in red states to try and create more Republican districts in rare mid-decade redistricting.   \n   Democrats have responded in kind, so the landscape for control of the House for next year remains uncertain at this point.   The Trump drag on the GOP   A big reason for Democrats' advantage is that Trump is unpopular. Not only is he at 39% approval, the lowest of this second term in the Marist poll, but he gets just a 24% rating with independents as well.   Overall, almost half of those surveyed — 48% — said they strongly disapprove of the job the president is doing. That's also the highest of this term and the highest since just after Jan. 6, 2021.   The president has seen low ratings for his handling of various policy areas, including the economy and foreign policy, and people think he's gone too far on immigration.   Trump has said on more than one occasion in this second term that while campaign advisers told him prices were the most important issue, he always felt it was really immigration. But respondents in the NPR survey are sending a clear message: they think the cost of living should be Trump's top priority.   Almost 6-in-10 — 57% — said lowering prices should be his top priority. Immigration is a distant second at 16%. Even a plurality of Republicans (40%) said lowering prices should be the priority compared to immigration (34%).   Loading...\n   Despite Trump's slide in approval ratings, he's holding up well with his base — 9-in-10 Republicans continue to say they approve of the job he's doing.   Stokes, the Trump voter from Dallas, said a year into his presidency, said she's pleased by his attempts to tackle illegal border crossings and restrict U.S. foreign aid, but she is concerned that the president hasn't made the economy a focus.   But her support of Trump doesn't translate to Republicans on Capitol Hill. Instead, she said, she has little confidence in the elected officials representing either political party.   \"They're not in tune with anyone on the ground,\" Stokes said. \"I don't really see anyone in [the House] or in the Senate that's really for the American people right now.\"   It's not just Trump. Democrats and others get low marks   Trump's approval is low and so is confidence in the office he holds — 61% said they have little to no confidence in the institution of the presidency.   \n   But the scores were even poorer for other key institutions. Worst among them was Congress — 80% said they had little to no confidence in it, followed by the media (75%), the Democratic Party (71%), the Republican Party (65%) and the Supreme Court (62%).   This is yet another poll that shows Democrats have a problem with their base. While 80% of Republicans have \"quite a lot\" or a \"great deal\" of confidence in the GOP, just 57% of Democrats said the same of their party.   Despite long supporting liberal candidates, Dowdy, the Democrat from Memphis, argues the party has become disconnected from everyday voters.   \"They don't interact with working people,\" he said, \"regardless of whether they work in an office or on a job site or building homes or working in a factory. They don't know how people like that live... They have no connection to the real people. And there's no attempt to try and reach that.\"   And yet, Democrats have a wide advantage on the congressional ballot, which, coupled with the electoral gains earlier this month, indicate that left-leaning voters may rally to Democrats' side when faced with having to choose between them and Republicans.   Democrats and Republicans see each other as \"dishonest\" and \"closed-minded\"   \nLoading...\nLoading...\n\n   It's no wonder political acrimony is as high as it is in the country; people have very little respect for where the other side is coming from.   The survey found that more than 8-in-10 Republicans and Democrats described people in the other political party as \"closed-minded\"; more than 7-in-10 Republicans and roughly two-thirds of Democrats also see the other as \"dishonest\" when talking about politics.   Independents have better views of Democrats than Republicans. They said Republicans were more dishonest and closed-minded than Democrats with a majority of independents (54%) saying Republicans were \"mostly dishonest\" compared to more than 6-in-10 saying Democrats were \"mostly honest\" when it came to politics.   Nearly 7-in-10 independents also described Republicans as mostly closed-minded, while a majority (53%) said Democrats were mostly open-minded.\n",

    "body": "\n      A measure to compel the Justice Department to release its files on Jeffrey Epstein is on its way to President Trump's desk after quickly advancing through both chambers of Congress Tuesday.   \n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  Both chambers of Congress have now moved to force the Justice Department to release its files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. We'll hear from one of the senators who voted for the bill, Democrat Maggie Hassan, right after we get up to date on the facts.LEILA FADEL, HOST:  President Trump has promised to sign the measure but told reporters that the intense focus on the files is a Democratic hoax.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein. I threw him out of my club many years ago 'cause I thought he was a sick pervert. But - and I guess I turned out to be right.MARTÍNEZ: NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas is following this story from Capitol Hill. So when we talk about releasing the Epstein files, Sam, I mean, which ones are we talking about?SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: So this legislation applies to unclassified documents, communications or investigation materials held by the Justice Department, the FBI and U.S. attorneys' offices related to federal investigations into Epstein in New York and Florida. Now, it's worth noting that the House Oversight Committee has already released other Epstein files, including thousands of pages of emails obtained from the Epstein estate. That batch of documents included Epstein telling a journalist that Trump, quote, \"knew about the girls,\" seemingly referring to people Epstein was trafficking. As we just heard, the president has said he broke ties with Epstein years ago and has denied any wrongdoing.MARTÍNEZ: Now, releasing the files has been a very divisive thing within the Republican Party. But, yeah, yesterday, legislation sailed through both chambers. So take us through what changed.GRINGLAS: For months, President Trump and Republican leaders in Congress tried to thwart a vote on these files. But Democrats and some Republicans, like Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, pressed ahead. Greene said Trump's refusal to release the files was a betrayal of his most ardent supporters.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE: For people that slept in their cars to go to rallies, have fought for truth and transparency, watching this actually turn into a fight has ripped MAGA apart.GRINGLAS: But once a bipartisan petition to force the issue got enough signatures, Trump reversed course. And that paved the way for Tuesday's vote in the House, which several survivors of Epstein's abuse actually watched from the gallery. Here's one of them, Jena-Lisa Jones, who spoke outside the Capitol before the votes.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JENA-LISA JONES: It is not about you, President Trump. I voted for you, but your behavior on this issue has been a national embarrassment.GRINGLAS: The House passed the legislation 427 to 1. And within a few hours, the Senate agreed to automatically advance the measure without a vote as soon as it arrives from the House, and that is expected sometime today.MARTÍNEZ: Four hundred twenty-seven to 1 sounds like unity, right?GRINGLAS: I mean, on paper, sure, but it's clear that many Democrats and Republicans are looking at this fight through different lenses. Just listen to House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer of Kentucky.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JAMES COMER: Democrats have chosen to manufacture yet another anti-Trump hoax instead of pursuing justice.GRINGLAS: And compare that to his Democratic counterpart on that committee, Robert Garcia of California.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ROBERT GARCIA: Trump has the power to release the files today. He does not even need a vote. What is Donald Trump hiding?MARTÍNEZ: So, Sam, the debate over the files - I think it's still a couple of steps to go before we get any resolution.GRINGLAS: The materials have to be made public within 30 days of Trump signing the bill. Depending on what comes out, that could fuel new conflicts. Trump, for example, has pledged to focus on Democrats whose names might come up. And depending on what the Justice Department redacts, that could spark even more questions.MARTÍNEZ: All right. NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas. Thanks a lot.GRINGLAS: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      After cutting ties with the Heritage Foundation, an antisemitism task force formed to address what they described as left-wing antisemitism has reformed independently and broadened its focus.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Conservatives are regrouping after a task force set up to fight antisemitism announced it was cutting ties with the influential conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation. The foundation's president is facing criticism for defending Tucker Carlson after he hosted far-right influencer, white nationalist and antisemite Nick Fuentes on his podcast. The antisemitism task force met publicly Tuesday for the first time since the split happened about two weeks ago. NPR political correspondent Sarah McCammon was there, and she joins me now in studio. Good morning.SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Good morning.FADEL: OK. So how did the antisemitism task force find itself separating from Heritage?MCCAMMON: Yeah. Just to step back a little bit, Tucker Carlson's interview with Nick Fuentes triggered a backlash from some prominent Republicans because Fuentes has this long history of extreme remarks. He's praised Hitler, proudly called himself a racist. It rose to another level after The Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts defended Carlson. As a result, the National Task Force to Combat Antisemitism announced it was cutting ties with Heritage.FADEL: OK. So now they're reformed independently. What's next?MCCAMMON: Well, they say the events of the past few weeks have broadened their focus as a group. And one of the task force co-chairs, Luke Moon, says they had been focused on what they describe as left-wing antisemitism.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LUKE MOON: The fight on the left is still happening. That is not done. That is a work that still has to go on. But we now have an emergent threat on the right.MCCAMMON: And so, Leila, now, the task force wants to push back forcefully against rhetoric from people like Fuentes.FADEL: Right. And he's an influential person. You were there. Who else was in the room?MCCAMMON: Well, there were a lot of conservative Christian groups and some conservative-leaning Jewish leaders, and several prominent evangelical leaders were present too. Plus, President Trump's ambassador to Israel, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, spoke to the group through a video message.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE HUCKABEE: So, in Genesis, when the scripture says, God will bless those who bless Israel and curse those who curse Israel, we don't argue with God about that.MCCAMMON: So Huckabee tried to make the case for Israel from the Bible and told the group that Christians should have respect for Judaism because their faith comes from it.FADEL: What was he trying to accomplish with this messaging to this room?MCCAMMON: Yeah. Evangelical Christians, for the most part, ground their support for Israel in their interpretation of the Bible, and they have historically been the group most likely to support the Jewish state, even more than Jewish Americans in some polls. But other broadly pro-Israel groups warned that invoking religion only heightens tensions around the conflict in the Middle East. Jeremy Ben-Ami is president of J Street, which describes itself as a liberal, pro-Israel Jewish group.JEREMY BEN-AMI: When any side, whether it is Muslims, Christians or Jews, begin to introduce the idea that God somehow gave only one people a piece of land, you make it a conflict that can't be resolved.MCCAMMON: But some of the Jewish leaders involved in this task force are willing to work with Christian groups who share their position on Israel.FADEL: Now, this is coming at a time when President Trump's supporters are divided on a number of issues. What does this debate over how to fight antisemitism mean for conservative activists going forward?MCCAMMON: Well, a Heritage spokesperson pointed to a past statement from their president, Kevin Roberts, that called for fighting antisemitism across the political spectrum. The task force co-chair Luke Moon told me that he would not rule out the possibility of the group returning to Heritage one day, but he says this is a good time right after the off-year elections and well before the midterms for the conservative movement to be having this conversation.FADEL: That's NPR national political correspondent Sarah McCammon.

    "body": "\n      The House and Senate voted overwhelmingly to approve a bill that would compel the Department of Justice to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  In a watershed moment on Capitol Hill, both the House and Senate approved a bill to release the Jeffrey Epstein files. Nearly every House member voted yes, and then hours later, the Senate set up a process to unanimously approve it. The rapid-fire progress is a far cry from when Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie began pushing for the bill months ago.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)THOMAS MASSIE: We fought the president, the attorney general, the FBI director, the speaker of the House and the vice president to get this win.DETROW: President Trump has said he would sign the measure, marking a huge reversal. Joining us now is NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales. Hey, Claudia.CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Hey, Scott.DETROW: So Republicans rarely go against President Trump's wishes. How did this come together for something that was so controversial for Republicans up until just a few days ago?GRISALES: Right. This dragged out much of the year, and this sudden resolution was striking. First, a little bit of background. Massie worked alongside California Democrat Ro Khanna, starting what's known as a discharge petition four months ago. This is an arcane procedure that skips committees and leadership to force a floor vote with signatures from a simple House majority, and they hit that mark last week. Trump fought them all the way until this past weekend as momentum shifted in their favor, and it set the stage for the House to pass it 427 to 1. And now the Senate's moving pretty fast. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer got unanimous consent to pass the bill automatically after the House sends it over. Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters tonight he expects that to happen tomorrow morning.DETROW: Quick aside, Claudia. I did not know the Senate had the ability to pass bills automatically. I learned something today.GRISALES: Right. Exactly. And usually you see this happen with noncontroversial bills, bills that are low profile.DETROW: Yeah.GRISALES: This is exactly the opposite.DETROW: Right.GRISALES: So it was very remarkable, Republicans really wanting to turn the page on something that has taken up so much oxygen...DETROW: Let's...GRISALES: ...Here in Washington.DETROW: Let's talk more about that. President Trump did an abrupt about-face, said his party should vote for this bill, after fighting it for months and in a really intense way. How did Republicans on the Hill address that huge shift?GRISALES: Well, House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters he had major issues with the process, and he rejected claims this was a reversal.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE JOHNSON: Having now forced the vote, none of us want to go on record and in any way be accused of not being for maximum transparency.GRISALES: And he said he voted yes with a caveat. He expected the Senate to amend the bill to ensure survivors' names were redacted, among other concerns. But Thune told us tonight that wasn't needed, especially after this overwhelming House vote.DETROW: Epstein survivors were at the Capitol today. What did they have to say?GRISALES: They told harrowing stories of the abuse they suffered, and many asked Trump to stop injecting politics into this fight. That includes Jena-Lisa Jones, who was once a Trump supporter. Let's take a listen.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JENA-LISA JONES: I voted for you, but your behavior on this issue has been a national embarrassment.GRISALES: She said this fight has been distressing, as Trump has gone back and forth on releasing the files. And when the bill finally passed in the House, survivors in the gallery broke out in cheers and emotional applause.DETROW: Another big player here is Georgia Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a longtime ally of President Trump who pushed for this bill to move forward, and that led to a pretty high-profile rift.GRISALES: Right. After that clash, Greene faced a pipe bomb scare. Her son received a death threat. Today, she said she fought for Trump for six years and gave him her loyalty for free.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARJORIE GREENE: I've never owed him anything, but I fought for him for the policies and for America First. And he called me a traitor for standing with these women.GRISALES: And she says this fight has now torn the MAGA movement apart. And as a reminder, Trump and Republicans made releasing these files a top priority on the campaign trail last year, and Democrats have added fuel to this fire by pushing for this.DETROW: What happens next?GRISALES: President Trump is expected to sign the bill as soon as tomorrow. Then it'll be up to the Department of Justice to interpret what can and should be redacted and what can actually be released to the public. It's unclear how long that could take.DETROW: NPR's Claudia Grisales, thank you so much.GRISALES: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Greg Abbott has appealed a ruling that blocked the state from using a voting map designed to give Republicans an advantage in next year's midterm elections.   \n\n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  A federal court in Texas dealt a blow to President Trump's effort to reshape the midterm elections in favor of Republicans. A three-judge panel on Tuesday blocked the redistricting that Texas Republicans passed this summer. They were aiming to improve the GOP's chances of winning five more seats in the U.S. House, where Republicans have just a narrow majority. We're going to talk more about this. We're joined by Houston Public Media's Andrew Schneider. So, Andrew, Republicans in Texas said they were drawing new maps to get a political advantage in next year's election. What did the court have to say about that?ANDREW SCHNEIDER, BYLINE: Well, the court didn't buy the Republicans' arguments that they were only engaging in partisan gerrymandering, which would have been legal. They call it racial gerrymandering. Judges noted that Governor Greg Abbott and state lawmakers didn't start the redistricting process until Abbott received a letter from the Trump administration framing Trump's request to redistrict, quote, \"as a demand to redistrict congressional seats based on their racial makeup.\" The judges said that the plaintiffs, which included several civil rights groups were likely to prove at trial that Texas had racially gerrymandered the 2025 map, which is illegal. So they issued an injunction against its use in the 2026 midterms. Texas Republican leaders have already appealed a ruling directly to the US Supreme Court, so we haven't heard the final word.MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. President Trump called for the redistricting there, and his Justice Department wrote that letter. It seemed to backfire, though.SCHNEIDER: Exactly. The judges said the DOJ got the case law on which it called for the districts to be redrawn completely wrong. District Judge Jeffrey V. Brown wrote the opinion yesterday. He was appointed by President Trump back in his first term. He zeroed in on the letter from the Justice Department that set the redistricting in motion, even how it was written. He said there were typos and legal mistakes in it. He said even attorneys employed by the Texas attorney general described the letter as legally unsound, baseless, erroneous, ham-fisted and a mess.MARTÍNEZ: And there's been a lot of reaction from both sides. Can you give us a sample of that?SCHNEIDER: Yeah. Democrats are saying they're elated. I talked to Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher, who represents a Houston district that was largely left intact by the redistricting, but she said the plan hurt voters in every district in Texas.LIZZIE FLETCHER: Every Texan should be supporting this decision to make sure that Texans, every single one of us, has the opportunity to have our voices heard and to cast a meaningful vote at the ballot box.SCHNEIDER: And on the other side, we've got Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who said any claim that the maps are discriminatory is absurd. He called the ruling erroneous and has gone to the Supreme Court.MARTÍNEZ: Now, California's redistricting response to Texas, that was Prop 50. That was passed by voters earlier this month. It faces its own legal battle, with its first court date set for December 3. But, Andrew, I mean, so far, it looks like Gavin Newsom, the governor of California will move forward with it.SCHNEIDER: Yeah. Usually, states redistrict at the start of the decade when a census comes in, but now because of Trump, there's a redistricting race across the country. California already responded to Texas by drawing maps designed to give Democrats help winning five seats there. Missouri and North Carolina have redistricted to Republicans. It's ongoing, and it could determine who runs the House in 2027, and Democrats can check the Trump agenda.MARTÍNEZ: All right. That's Houston Public Media's Andrew Schneider. Thanks a lot, Andrew.SCHNEIDER: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The flight landed near the Polish border in the early hours on Monday. Since Russia's invasion in 2022, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has deported 105 Ukrainians in total, with 13 in the last quarter of 2024, according to the latest data available in ICE's publicly available tracker.   \n   The Trump administration originally wanted to send 80 people on the flight, according to Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine's ambassador to the United States. That original list also included at least one person that Ukraine had previously been unable to claim as a citizen of the country.   It wasn't immediately clear why only 50 people out of the group of 80 ended up in Ukraine.   Immigration lawyers have raised concerns that those deported to Ukraine could be conscripted to fight in the war. All men in Ukraine from ages 25 to 60 are eligible to be drafted, though some women and younger people have also volunteered. While U.S. law permits deportations, including to countries that people are not originally from, domestic and international laws prohibit deportations to place where someone may face violence, persecution or torture.   \n   The Trump administration has brokered deals with countries with notorious human rights records or who are facing conflict, including with South Sudan, Libya, Eswatini, Rwanda and El Salvador, to receive deportees from the United States, as it seeks to ramp up mass deportations.   Six of the 8 men deported to South Sudan over the summer are still there, according to their lawyers, while the Associated Press reported that those sent to the other countries have been imprisoned there.   \"Currently, border guards have ensured their registration in the border relation for entry into Ukraine in accordance with the rules established by law,\" Andrii Demchenko, spokesman for Ukraine's State Border Service, told NPR. \"It is worth noting that Ukraine accepts its citizens in any case.\"   \n   The spokesperson said Ukraine would accept any of its own citizens who had been deported from the U.S.   The embassy did not answer questions regarding what would happen to people deported to the country.   \"It should be noted that deportation is a widely used legal mechanism provided for by the immigration laws of most countries around the world,\" Stefanishyna said in a statement provided to NPR. \"It is a routine procedure applied to all foreign nationals and stateless persons who violate the terms of their stay in the United States, regardless of their nationality.\"   \n   One migrant first profiled by NPR fought immediate deportation   Eric Lee, an immigration lawyer with a client on the flight, said the detainees include people who have lived in the U.S. since they were children.   \"Many have U.S. citizen spouses and children. Some do not even speak Ukrainian, and others are not even Ukrainian citizens, having been born in the Soviet Union before Ukraine existed as a separate country,\" Lee said in an interview.   One of Lee's clients, Roman Surovtsev, was recently transferred through several detention centers in Texas in preparation for the deportation to Ukraine, even as his attorneys continue to fight his removal in court.   \n   According to Justice Department court filings, the administration had intended to put him on the flight. NPR confirmed he ended up not being deported after an immigration court stayed his deportation hours before the flight, while his case was reopened in immigration court.   Surovtsev, who lived in Dallas with his U.S. citizen wife and two children, was born in the Soviet Union. He came to the U.S. as a refugee, but lost his green card when he was a teenager when he pleaded guilty to a carjacking in California.   \n   As NPR has previously reported, the U.S. previously tried and failed to deport Surovtsev to Ukraine, which was unable to provide the necessary travel documents for deportation. For years, Surovtsev completed yearly check-ins with Immigration and Customs Enforcement until he was detained during his visit in August. ICE then tried to give him deportation documents, but those papers were in Ukrainian, a language he does not speak.   \n   His team of lawyers was able to vacate his conviction and move forward with reinstating his green card. Still, Surovtsev has remained in detention.   U.S. District Judge Ada Brown, who was appointed by President Trump, originally blocked Surovtsev's removal earlier this month through Jan. 13 but reversed her decision a few days later, surprising Surovtsev's attorneys.   \"He is likely to receive his green card once again very soon. And he has also not been given the opportunity to express his fear of being deported to an active war zone,\" Lee said.   A DHS spokesperson said in a statement that Surovtesev has already received due process.   \"He received full due process and was ordered removed by an immigration judge on November 4, 2014 — over a decade ago,\" the spokesperson wrote. \"Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, if you break the law, you will face the consequences. Criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the U.S.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire reacts after both chambers of Congress moved to force the Justice Department to release its files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire is among the many Democrats who had been pressing for a vote so Epstein's victims could have, quote, \"answers, accountability and the truth.\" And she joins me now. Good morning, Senator.MAGGIE HASSAN: Good morning, Leila. Thanks for having me.FADEL: Thank you for being here. Does the passage of this bill satisfy your calls for greater transparency?HASSAN: Well, it's certainly a beginning, and it's long overdue. The president needs to sign this into law. But I think what's really important to be thinking about today is the pain that the survivors and victims have suffered at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. I hope that the president's signature will mean that there is a prompt release of the files, and that that can bring some accountability and some closure. I just finished the memoir of Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein and Maxwell's victims...FADEL: Yeah.HASSAN: ...And it is really clear that without their voices, without their strength and bravery, which required that they relive pain over and over and over again, this wouldn't have happened. It's also a really important example, I think, to all Americans, about the difference you can make when you speak up and are persistent in the cause of this kind of justice and accountability.FADEL: Do you have any concern that if this bill is signed into law, for some reason, the Justice Department won't release the files? We heard Republican Congressman Thomas Massie, who, as you know, has long backed the releasing of these files, say he's worried that President Trump's demand for a Justice Department investigation into Democrats with Epstein ties will be used to prevent the release of the documents.HASSAN: Well, I certainly understand that concern, but what I hope is that the Trump administration has received the message loudly and clearly that there was unanimous passage of this bill in Congress, that the people of the United States are united in wanting answers here, that this long history of treating Epstein and Maxwell as a special class of people needs to end. And I think, you know, I'm hopeful that they will understand that the pressure from the American people and particularly from survivors and victims of Epstein and Maxwell is not going to subside simply because he signs a bill. He's going to have to follow through. The Justice Department is going to have to follow through here.FADEL: The bill passed with unanimous consent, as you mentioned in the Senate. The lone holdout in the House was Louisiana Republican Clay Higgins, who said he voted no on principle. In his words, quote, \"it abandons 250 years of criminal justice procedure in America.\" And we also heard House Speaker Mike Johnson - who did vote for it - say he was upset that what passed the Senate didn't include changes that he'd wanted, things like victim and whistleblower name protections. How would you respond to those concerns?HASSAN: Well, first of all, the legislation provides for privacy protections for victims and survivors. But let's also just think this through for a minute. Two hundred and fifty years of criminal justice procedure and law has also shielded abusers of children and women and people who traffic them. And the victims and survivors, in this case, have been unbelievably brave. They're the ones who have been calling for the release of these files for transparency, and they understand how important it is for people to understand the horror, the physical pain, the psychological pain this and trauma that Epstein and Maxwell and people like them and people who participated in this trafficking and abuse caused. And, you know, this is a really important moment because women and girls are not invisible, and they should be listened to and have the same rights and be able to hold the powerful to account the same way everybody else can.FADEL: What do you say to the Republicans who voted for the release of these files, but also say Democrats are using this as a way to attack the president, versus go after - protect the victims or get justice for victims?HASSAN: Look, the victims and survivors are the people who are speaking up and wanting this transparency. This was a - of course, a campaign promise that President Trump made that he would release the files. It is, of course, one of many campaign promises that this president has broken. But what I think is really critical is for people to understand that Epstein and Maxwell had reached well beyond the United States. They attempted to intimidate these victims wherever they were around the world. In Virginia Giuffre's case, threatening her as she was living in Australia, trying to silence her. And I think it's really important for the truth to come out here. And again, for us to take a step forward to say, trafficking of girls and boys, sexual abuse of girls and boys and women and men is wrong. And we need to stand together as a country and address this horror.FADEL: Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire. Thank you for your time.HASSAN: Thank you.

WNYC's Mike Hayes discusses the special election for the House seat left open by now-Gov. Mikie Sherrill.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  One of the first congressional primaries of the year is being held today in New Jersey for a special election in a seat left open when Democrat Mikie Sherrill won her race to be the state's governor. While Sherrill won with a message focused on improving the cost of living, recent concerns among Democrats about ICE tactics have changed the dynamics in a Democratic primary race in a district that historically elects moderates. Here to walk us through why this race matters is WNYC's New Jersey politics reporter Mike Hayes. Good morning. Welcome to the program.MIKE HAYES, BYLINE: Good morning. Thanks for having me.FADEL: So, Mike, this is a primary in a safe, Democratic congressional district for a special election. So why are you watching it?HAYES: Yeah, here's why this race is uniquely interesting, Leila. So on the Democratic side, 11 candidates are running to replace Sherrill. So you have a diverse range of candidates across the party spectrum. And what this has set up is an interesting test to see what sort of Democrat voters are favoring at this moment, a progressive outsider or one of the more moderate establishment candidate.FADEL: OK, so tell us about some of the candidates.HAYES: There's Tom Malinowski, Brendan Gill and Tahesha Way, all well-known in New Jersey, strong fundraisers, particularly Malinowski. They're our top tier of establishment, middle-of-the-road Democrats, Leila. Now, challenging them, there's a crop of outsiders in this race trying to upend that establishment wing. And the candidate consolidating the most progressive support is longtime New Jersey labor activist Analilia Mejia. She's run to the left of the other candidates in this race and tried to use their political insider status against them. And she's got some heavy hitters backing her, Leila, most notably Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Elizabeth Warren.FADEL: So Mejia has a lot of progressive supporters. But as we said earlier, this is pretty traditionally a moderate district for Democrats. So does she have a chance of actually winning?HAYES: Yeah, if Mejia were to win Leila, it would definitely be an upset. This is a safe Democratic district, but you're right, it's a moderate district. Something else interesting to note here that speaks to that, before Mikie Sherrill won, this district was held by Republicans for three decades. A lone Republican is running in the GOP primary, but recent shifts in this district make it more favorable to the Democrats. However, we've seen a trend of late with progressives mounting effective challenges against establishment Democrats. Several outsider left-wing candidates won seats on the New Jersey state assembly this November.FADEL: Yeah.HAYES: And if you look to places like Maine, we see progressives running in races we are going to be watching come the midterms.FADEL: And we've seen some upsets before - right? - like New York City. Tell me about how ICE enforcement is factoring into this race.HAYES: Yeah, it's become a big factor here, Leila. Most of the candidates in the race have come out against more funding for ICE. However, Mejia has also taken a stronger stance when it comes to ICE. She says she wants to abolish the agency. Now, concerns over immigration enforcement tactics is something we've seen appear in races across the country after the fatal shootings in Minnesota. And as the results come in tonight, Leila, this will be one of the first times this year we learn if a far-left message on ICE is resonating with voters or if they prefer a more moderate approach.FADEL: That's WNYC's Mike Hayes. Thank you, Mike.HAYES: Thanks so much for having me.(SOUNDBITE OF 2ECOND CLASS CITIZEN SONG, \"ROLL ON\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Now, lawmakers come to a more difficult task: how to find bipartisan agreement on changes to immigration enforcement.   \n\n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  The partial federal government shutdown has ended. The House voted 217-214 on Tuesday to fund most government offices through September.STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Key word there is most. Congress has just nine days to finish negotiating the other thing - the budget for the Department of Homeland Security. Lawmakers seem far apart over how to change immigration enforcement after federal agents killed two Americans in Minnesota. Democrats are demanding changes. We'll speak with one of them in a few minutes, Representative Rosa DeLauro. We begin with the facts.MARTIN: NPR immigration policy correspondent Ximena Bustillo has been tracking all this and is with us now to bring us up to date. Good morning, Ximena.XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Good morning, Michel.MARTIN: So the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, ICE, already got $75 billion from Congress last summer. So what's the difference between that and what Congress is trying to come up with after February 13?BUSTILLO: So in this instance, we're talking about funding for all of DHS and not just ICE through the end of the fiscal year. So that 75 billion that you're talking about was in the One Big Beautiful Bill, and that was just for ICE. It made Immigration and Customs Enforcement the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency. Now, Congress still has to, by law, do what's called annual appropriations, and that's the baseline budget for each department that has to get renewed every year or we have these shutdowns.MARTIN: OK. So this is for the whole department and not just one agency. And so that's why this is a big deal. OK. So body cameras keep coming up. Democrats want immigration officers to wear body cameras, but DHS Secretary Kristi Noem already said this week that every officer on the ground in Minneapolis specifically would be issued a body camera. So what's the issue they still need to negotiate?BUSTILLO: Right. And keep in mind that that wouldn't necessarily happen overnight. It could take over 180 days to fully implement that just in Minneapolis. Noem also said that as funding is available, the body camera program would be expanded nationwide across the agency to all agents. But Democrats want more than just Noem's word for it. They want it written into law. And the current DHS budget bill negotiated by Congress does provide $20 million for body cameras, but Democrats want to mandate that they actually be used. And this is just one of the asks that has been discussed, and this one has gotten some bipartisan support, but other requests have been more contentious.MARTIN: Like what?BUSTILLO: Democrats want to mandate that immigration officers only use warrants signed by a judge to make arrests, for example. They say that the current use of administrative warrants, which are written by DHS itself and not signed by a judge, raises questions about violations to people's Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizures. While some Republicans are interested in negotiating and talking about this, others, like House Speaker Mike Johnson, have poured cold water all over this. Democrats also want to ban officers from using face coverings, but Republicans are broadly opposed to this and say that it would make it easier for people to dox federal agents.MARTIN: OK. So they have nine days. The clock is now ticking. I'm wondering if lawmakers really think they can get this done. What does your reporting suggest?BUSTILLO: You know, many members are skeptical that less than two weeks is even enough time to come up with such a large compromise. If they can't get this done, they could risk a shutdown of just DHS, which puts at risk non-immigration parts of the agency like disaster response and TSA.MARTIN: That is NPR's Ximena Bustillo. Ximena, thank you.BUSTILLO: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Juana Summers speaks with Ron Lieber, financial columnist for The New York Times, about the ins and outs of the newly created Trump Accounts.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  This tax season, parents of young Americans can opt to establish a Trump Account. That is the actual name of a new account that has a lot of similarities to individual retirement accounts for children. It was created in the massive tax and spending law last summer. When the program goes live this summer, the federal government has pledged a $1,000 contribution into the Trump Accounts of eligible kids. Here to walk us through all of this is Ron Lieber. He writes the Your Money column for The New York Times. Hi there.RON LIEBER: Hello.SUMMERS: Ron, let's just start with some basics if we can. Who is eligible for a Trump Account?LIEBER: So the people who are eligible are children under the age of 18. If you want that $1,000, that's only for babies who are born between January 1, 2025, and the end of 2028.SUMMERS: If you have kids or you're expecting a child, how exactly do you sign up for one?LIEBER: You can check a box on the tax form that you are filing this season. Now, you don't have to do that. You can set it up some other time in the coming months, but that is one easy way to do it while you're filing your taxes.SUMMERS: Say you're a parent and you decide to open a Trump Account for your kid, where does the initial money go?LIEBER: It is not 100% clear yet where the money is going to land. The administration is engaging in partnerships with different financial services firms. And so sooner rather than later, we will know which ones those are and what kind of choices you may have.SUMMERS: And who can contribute to these Trump Accounts? And I wonder, do we know if there's a cap on how much money you can put in?LIEBER: Parents control the account, or a guardian. But it's not just parents who can put money in and not just the federal government. There may be some employers who offer contributions. Outside philanthropists have some interest in these accounts. And so we'll see how it rolls out in that way.SUMMERS: So that's how the money gets in. But when can a child or their parent or guardian access the money?LIEBER: It is locked up until you turn 18. And at that point, it belongs to the 18-year-old. And they can use it for anything at that point.SUMMERS: I mean, Ron, we know that the United States offers other tax-deferred investment vehicles, and some of those are specifically for kids. I'm thinking about 529 plans for education, Roth IRAs, 401(k)s. The list goes on. How do Trump Accounts compare to some of the other options that are out there?LIEBER: You are correct to note that we have a kind of alphabet soup of savings options in this country. And so one way to think about this is that - let's say you want to open a 529. The advantage there is that that comes with tax breaks that the Trump Accounts do not have. And there may be other savings vehicles that, you know, families want to use that could have more flexibility, particularly in the years when a child is under 18.SUMMERS: I mean, listening to you describe this, this sounds sort of like a free $1,000 from the government for certain parents. Would a person be - I don't know - silly or foolish not to opt in?LIEBER: You would indeed be foolish not to opt in if you've got a kid who is eligible for the $1,000 or some other amount of money that a philanthropist or an employer might toss into the account. Look, it's free money. Anybody who's eligible should go get it.SUMMERS: And say you don't qualify for that $1,000, in your mind, in this still a good investment strategy compared to some of the other options?LIEBER: So they may want to open those accounts if an employer or a philanthropist wants to put some free money in, sure. Beyond that, there may be better options. But much depends on your family and its circumstances. Any savings account is only useful if you have money left over. And chances are the people who are going to have thousands of dollars to toss into an account like this are people who have more money than average, because if you don't have more money than average, you're spending it on everyday items just to keep the roof over your head.SUMMERS: Ron Lieber writes the Your Money column for The New York Times. Ron, thank you.LIEBER: Sure thing.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Lawmakers have a little over a week to negotiate changes to federal immigration enforcement. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., talks about what's next and what Democrats are looking to accomplish.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Connecticut Representative Rosa DeLauro has been following all of this, and she's part of it - member of Congress, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, which holds the power of the purse in Congress, or is supposed to. Representative DeLauro, good morning.ROSA DELAURO: Good morning, Steve. Good to be with you.INSKEEP: OK, so Congress is close to asserting itself when it comes to the Department of Homeland Security. We just heard from Ximena a few possible provisions that might be inserted into the law. What do you want when it comes to DHS?ROSA DELAURO: Well, as it's been outlined, we outlined this when we did our appropriations bills several weeks ago in the House, and we gave a bill of particulars - list of particulars to the Republicans. For instance, let's not deport or detain U.S. citizens, requiring the body-worn cameras that Ximena talked about this morning, requiring reporting on the use of force, allowing the access, which has been required by law, for members of Congress to access facilities, training standards. The training has been cut back to, you know, less than a little bit over a month, where there used to be, you know, several months, so - and requiring, yes, judicial warrants. So we have outlined some issues already. And the issue is, it's an enforceable code of conduct, real accountability when agents break the law, prohibitions on detention of department of U.S. citizens, judicial warrants, masks off, badges on, necessary measures to keep communities safe...INSKEEP: I want to be clear - when you say the judicial warrants, I want to be clear what you're talking about here. As I understand it, sometimes, very often, in fact, immigration agents have used what they call administrative warrants, which is essentially the DHS giving itself permission to go grab someone or search a house or whatever. You're saying you want it in law affirmed that they need to go to a judge who is independent.ROSA DELAURO: That's right. Exactly. That you require ICE to have a warrant for any arrest of a noncitizen.INSKEEP: Now, let me ask also about the matter of masks off. We heard Ximena say the Republican argument against this, that the agents are vulnerable, that they've been doxed, which means their addresses could be exposed and that sort of thing. What is the strongest case that you have that agents should be showing their faces, should properly identify themselves as federal agents if they are working on behalf of us, the taxpayers?ROSA DELAURO: Well, they're working on behalf of us, the taxpayers, and you can go to any municipality, Steve, and I just came from dealing with a grant on deescalation techniques in West Haven, Connecticut, for our municipalities. All of our law enforcement people, they have on their jackets their names. They have a badge number, etc., and, you know, that has been the practice, you know, historically, where people are identifying themselves. This is just a - you know, we have people who are masked and armed and marauding our streets. Imagine that. Imagine the terror they are striking, you know, into the minds and hearts of American citizens. And we don't know who they are. They're picking up people off the street, willy-nilly, not criminals, you know? So they need to - we need to know who they are.INSKEEP: Let me ask you about the conversation in Congress. And I will note for people who are not aware, we said you were on the Appropriations Committee. Appropriators, historically, have been a little more bipartisan, a little more pragmatic, a little bit more working across the aisle than maybe some other parts of Congress have been. What have the conversations been like with your Republican colleagues when you lay out some of the requests or demands that we're just discussing?ROSA DELAURO: Oh, well, look, let me just take a step back with you for a second. You know, I think we have - what we needed to do, and I think was demonstrated by yesterday's vote, was we need to govern. I'm an appropriator. I need to govern. The other thing is we need to protest and resist where we think things are not right. So that is the framework, and that is what happened yesterday. Eleven out of the 12 full-year appropriations bills have been signed into law. Significant wins by Democrats. NIH funding, rental assistance - I'm not going to go on with those, but significant gains. And we rejected $163 billion in cuts that the Trump administration sought. Where we have differences - and there will be continued - to be differences. This is going to be a negotiation. And - but that's what we need to do because ICE, DHS, has been lawless, it has been reckless and it has killed two American citizens. And we have to do something.INSKEEP: And do your Republican colleagues agree?ROSA DELAURO: I think some do - that some do. The issue will be, are they willing to speak up? They've spoken about body cameras. They speak about training. But let's get to some of the heart of this matter here to put the American people and their psyches and their mental health state at rest here. Give them some piece of what's happening, not just in Minnesota, but all over this country.INSKEEP: Representative Rosa DeLauro, thanks for your time. Really appreciate it.ROSA DELAURO: Thank you.INSKEEP: And we'll note, as always, we invite Republicans as well as Democrats to join us. We hope to hear from Republicans on this issue a different day.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The proposal, which is part of a regulatory filing for the test, comes months after President Trump — in the middle of a redistricting push for new voting maps that could help Republicans keep control of the U.S. House of Representatives — put out a call on social media for a \"new\" census that would, for the first time in U.S. history, exclude millions of people living in the country without legal status.   \n   In Congress, a growing number of Republican lawmakers are backing similar controversial proposals to leave out some or all non-U.S. citizens from a set of census numbers used to determine each state's share of congressional seats and Electoral College votes.   According to the 14th Amendment, those census apportionment counts must include the \"whole number of persons in each state.\"   And in federal court, multiple GOP-led states have filed lawsuits seeking to force the bureau to subtract from those counts residents without legal status and those with nonimmigrant visas, such as international college students and diplomats living in the United States. Missouri's case goes further by calling for their exclusion from all census counts, including those for distributing federal dollars for public services in local communities.   Results from the 2026 test are not expected to be used to redistribute political representation. Instead, the test is designed to inform preparations for the next once-a-decade head count in 2030, which include a report on the planned question topics that is due to Congress in 2027.   \n   The planned questionnaire for the test comes from an annual U.S. Census Bureau survey that is much longer than recent forms for the national tally. It's not clear why the bureau is using the American Community Survey to test methods for the census. Spokespeople for the bureau and its parent agency, the Commerce Department, did not immediately respond to NPR's requests for comment.   In addition to citizenship status, the form asks about people's sources of income, whether their home has a bathtub or shower, and whether the home is connected to a public sewer, among other questions.   \n   The form, however, does not reflect changes to racial and ethnic categories that the Biden administration approved for the 2030 census and other federal surveys, including new checkboxes for \"Middle Eastern or North African\" and \"Hispanic or Latino.\" A White House agency official said in December that the Trump administration is considering rolling back those changes.   On Monday, the bureau announced major cutbacks to the census test, which is now set to take place between April and September and involve around 155,000 households in Huntsville, Ala., and Spartanburg, S.C.   As with all surveys conducted by the bureau, federal law bans the agency from putting out information that would identify a person to anyone, including other federal agencies and law enforcement.   \n   Still, many census advocates are concerned the Trump administration's plan will discourage many historically undercounted populations, including households with immigrants and mixed-status families, from participating in the field test at a time of increased immigration enforcement and murky handling of government data.   Previous Census Bureau research has found that adding a citizenship question would likely undermine the count's accuracy by lowering response rates for many of the least-responsive populations.   During the first Trump administration, the U.S. Supreme Court blocked a citizenship question from being added to the 2020 census, while declining to rule on whether the president can carry out an unprecedented exclusion of people without legal status from apportionment counts.   In one of its new filings to the White House's Office of Management and Budget, the bureau says the form for this year's census test \"will ask no questions of a sensitive nature.\" Whether its proposed questions move forward is now for OMB to decide.

The winner of the Democratic primary will go on to face the lone Republican, Randolph Township Mayor Joe Hathaway, in the special general election in April.   Mikie Sherrill resigned from the seat shortly after she won the state's gubernatorial election last November.   The special primary contest is one of the first congressional primaries of the year where we will find out what issues are currently resonating with some Democratic voters. Here are some key things to know about the contest:   \n   1. A labor activist is seeking to upend the race    Analilia Mejia, director of the New Jersey Working Families Alliance, has been endorsed by several progressive groups and politicians including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Locally, she has received the endorsement of Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark, New Jersey's largest city.   \n   Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, campaigned alongside Mejia in January at an event at William Paterson University.   \"In a moment of rising authoritarianism, of economic insecurity, of state-sanctioned violence, any old blue just won't do,\" Meijia said at the event with Sanders. \"If you send weak sauce to Congress, we will get weak sauce back.\"   Meijia also called for ICE to be abolished at the event.   \"You can't reform that. It's not fixable,\" she said. \"Get it out. Kick it over. It is done. Forget it.\"   2. A former congressman, from another district, is aiming for a political comeback   Former Rep. Tom Malinowski, has the backing of New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim.   In a video, Kim said he cited Malinowski's experience among his reasons.   \"Tom Malinowski knows the House of Representatives. He knows Congress. He knows New Jersey,\" Kim said. \"He knows how to be able to stand up to Donald Trump, and that's what I need right now is someone there as a partner with me in the Capitol.\"   \n   Malinowski represented a neighboring congressional district for two terms. Redistricting made his district more Republican, which factored in his loss to Republican Rep. Tom Kean Jr. in 2022.   The fact that voters may already be familiar with his work as a former congressman is an important factor in this race, says Micah Rasmussen, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University.   \"With a short runway of a special election – name recognition, money, experience – all can matter,\" he said.   In addition to Malinowski and Mejia, other candidates on the ballot are: former Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way, Passaic County Commissioner John W. Bartlett, venture capitalist Zach Beecher, attorney and comedian J-L Cauvin, former Obama administration staffer Cammie Croft, Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill, Morris Township Deputy Mayor Jeff Grayzel, Chatham Borough Council member Justin Strickland and community advocate Anna Lee Williams.   3. Immigration is taking center stage    Following the fatal shootings of Nicole Macklin Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minnesota, immigration enforcement has become a focal point in the New Jersey contest.The special election primary will be one of the first races this year showing whether a far-left message on the future of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, is resonating with Democratic voters – or if they prefer a more moderate approach.   \n   At a recent forum hosted by AAPI New Jersey, the 11 Democratic candidates ranged in their responses to ICE tactics, saying either that the powers of the agency need to be limited, or the agency should be abolished outright.\"Budgets are supposed to be about values,\" said Way, adding that ICE is not being held true to the country's values. \"As a congresswoman, I will definitely look at this budget and, of course, be open to defund it.\"   Beecher said he would be a champion of \"getting rid of ICE.\"   The forum also addressed affordability issues, which remains a concern among residents. It is an issue that Sherrill campaigned on during her run for governor, as New Jersey continues to be a state with a high cost of living.   4. There are regional implications tied to this election   The district includes many residents who commute regularly to New York.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Mikie Sherrill, then a congressional lawmaker running for New Jersey governor, speaks to commuters at a train station where she addressed the Gateway Tunnel Project on Oct. 30, 2025 in Westfield, N.J.\n                \n                    Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Rasmussen, at Rider University, said the winner of the general election in April will immediately have to address funding for the Gateway tunnel project. The $16 billion project includes the building of a new, two-tube rail tunnel beneath the Hudson River connecting New Jersey and Manhattan and rehabilitation of the North River Tunnel, which has been in service since 1910.   \n   Billions of federal dollars for the project were frozen by the Trump administration last October. A lawsuit against the administration was filed Tuesday.   \"It was one of the biggest priorities that was a hallmark of Mikie Sherrill's time in Congress,\" Rasmussen said. While in Congress, Sherrill helped secure federal funding for the project. \"There's a widespread perception that whoever fills Mikie Sherill's seat, this is going to be front and center in their lap.\"   When Sherrill was elected to the seat in 2018, she flipped a district that had been reliably Republican for decades. Since new maps took effect in 2022 following redistricting, the district has become more Democratic.\n",

The EEOC sought the company's criteria for selecting employees for layoffs, how it tracks and uses worker race and ethnicity data, and information about programs which allegedly provided race-restricted mentoring, leadership, or career development opportunities, according to court documents.   In a statement, Nike said the company has worked to cooperate with the EEOC and the subpoena \"feels like a surprising and unusual escalation.\"   \n   \"We have shared thousands of pages of information and detailed written responses to the EEOC's inquiry and are in the process of providing additional information,\" Nike said in a statement sent to The Associated Press.\"   EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas has moved swiftly to target diversity and inclusion policies that she has long criticized as potentially discriminatory, tightly aligning the agency with one of President Donald Trump's top priorities.   Nike appears to be the highest profile company the EEOC has targeted with a publicly confirmed, formal anti-DEI investigation. In November, the EEOC issued a similar subpoena against financial services provider Northwestern Mutual.   \n   \"When there are compelling indications, including corporate admissions in extensive public materials, that an employer's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion-related programs may violate federal prohibitions against race discrimination or other forms of unlawful discrimination, the EEOC will take all necessary steps — including subpoena actions — to ensure the opportunity to fully and comprehensively investigate,\" Lucas said in a statement.   The disclosure comes two months after Lucas posted a social media call-out urging white men to come forward if they have experienced race or sex discrimination at work. The post urged eligible workers to reach out to the agency \"as soon as possible\" and referred users to the agency's fact sheet on DEI-related discrimination.   \n   The investigation against Nike, however, does not stem from any worker complaint against the company. Rather, Lucas filed her own complaint in May 2024 through a more rarely used tool known as a commissioner's charge, according to the court documents. Her charge came just months after America First Legal, a conservative legal group founded by top Trump adviser Stephen Miller, sent the EEOC a letter outlining complaints against Nike and urging the agency to file a commissioner's charge.   America First Legal has flooded the EEOC with similar letters in recent years urging investigations into the DEI practices of major U.S. companies. It is unclear how many other companies the EEOC may be targeting through such commissioner's charges. The EEOC is prohibited from revealing any charge — by workers or commissioners — unless it results in fines, settlements, legal action or other such public actions.   Lucas' charge, according to court filings, was based on Nike's publicly shared information about its commitment to diversity, including statements from executives and proxy statements. The charge, for example, cited Nike's publicly stated goal in 2021 of achieving 35% representation of racial and ethnic minorities in its corporate workforce by 2025.   \n   Many U.S. companies made similar commitments in the wake of the widespread 2020 racial justice protests that followed the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man. Companies have said such commitments are not quotas but rather goals they hoped to achieve through methods such as widening recruitment efforts and rooting out any bias during hiring process.   Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, employers are prohibited from using race as a criteria for hiring or other employment decisions. Lucas has long warned that many companies risk crossing that line through DEI efforts that would pressure managers to make race-based decisions.   In its statement, Nike said it follows \"all applicable laws, including those that prohibit discrimination. We believe our programs and practices are consistent with those obligations and take these matters seriously.\"\n",

Gavin Newsom speaks in Los Angeles during a 2025 campaign event on Proposition 50. Voters approved the ballot measure, allowing the state's Democratic leaders to temporarily replace the state's congressional map to help Democrats win five additional U.S. House seats.\n                \n                    Ethan Swope/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Ethan Swope/AP\n    \n\n   \n   The Supreme Court is allowing California to use its new congressional map for this year's midterm election, clearing the way for the state's gerrymandered districts as Democrats and Republicans continue their fight for control of the U.S. House of Representatives.   The state's voters approved the redistricting plan last year as a Democratic counterresponse to Texas' new GOP-friendly map, which President Trump pushed for to help Republicans hold on to their narrow majority in the House.   And in a brief, unsigned order released Wednesday, the high court denied an emergency request by the California's Republican Party to block the redistricting plan. The state's GOP argued that the map violated the U.S. Constitution because its creation was mainly driven by race, not partisan politics. A lower federal court rejected that claim.   \n   The ruling on California's redistricting plan comes two months after the Supreme Court cleared the way for the Texas map that kicked off a nationwide gerrymandering fight by boosting the GOP's chances of winning five additional House seats.   \n   \"With an eye on the upcoming 2026 midterm elections, several States have in recent months redrawn their congressional districts in ways that are predicted to favor the State's dominant political party,\" said the court's December order in the Texas case. \"Texas adopted the first new map, then California responded with its own map for the stated purpose of counteracting what Texas had done.\"   The \"impetus\" for adopting both states' maps was \"partisan advantage pure and simple,\" wrote Justice Samuel Alito in a concurring opinion, which fellow conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch joined.   The Supreme Court has previously ruled that partisan gerrymandering is not reviewable by federal courts.   While the Trump administration supported the Texas redistricting by Republicans, it opposed California's, describing it as \"tainted by an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.\" The administration asserted the case was different from Texas' due to the timing of the states' candidate filing periods and the fact that the California Republican Party and the federal government provided alternative maps that met California's \"stated partisan goals.\"   \n   Where the California map fits into the larger redistricting fight   Democrats are counting on California's map to help their party push back against Republican gerrymandering in Texas and other states. With rulings upholding both the Texas and California maps, the end result is that the two states may essentially cancel out each other's partisan gains.   Legal fights are still playing out over other new congressional maps, as Republican-led Florida and Democratic-led Maryland take steps to join the list of states that have redistricted before the midterms.   \n   In New York, Republican Rep. Nicole Malliotakis and GOP members of the state's elections board are appealing a state judge's order for a new redistricting plan that would redraw Malliotakis' district, which the judge found illegally dilutes Black and Latino voters' collective power. A redraw of the New York City-based district could tip it into the Democrats' column.   In Utah, two House Republicans have filed a federal lawsuit that claims a new state court-selected congressional map, which could help Democrats win an additional House seat, violates the U.S. Constitution. Utah's Republican-controlled state legislature has asked the state's highest court to block that map for this year's election.   And in Virginia, a judge has ruled that a proposed constitutional amendment on congressional redistricting violates state law because the process Democratic state lawmakers used to advance it was improper. Virginia Democrats are appealing the decision.   Redistricting also remains an issue for the Supreme Court this term.   It has yet to rule on a challenge to Louisiana's voting map, but the October oral arguments suggested that the court's conservative majority is likely to continue undercutting the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Such a ruling could lead to new rounds of congressional gerrymandering — and the largest-ever decline in representation by Black members of Congress.   Edited by Benjamin Swasey\n",

On the heels of two fatal shootings of U.S. citizens in Minnesota at the hands of federal immigration agents, 65% of Americans said Immigration and Customs Enforcement has \"gone too far,\" according to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll. And President Trump is facing the highest intensity of disapproval since just after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.   The percentage of those saying ICE has gone too far in enforcing immigration laws is an 11-point increase since last summer. It's driven by independents and Democrats; both groups went up by double-digits.   \n   Trump's overall approval rating remains low at 39%, with 56% disapproving, and a whopping 51% strongly disapproving. That's the highest Marist has seen in its polling since it started asking how strongly respondents approve or disapprove of presidents dating back to 2017.   \"The thing in the numbers that we've been experiencing is the shift among some of the folks who voted for him — his voting coalition — not necessarily the governing support he has, but his voting coalition,\" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion.   \n   That coalition included younger people, Latinos and independents, all of whom Trump is struggling with in this survey.   \"Right now, those groups — they're the ones who deserted,\" Miringoff added.   Trump's base, on the other hand, is sticking with him on a range of policies that are otherwise unpopular, from ICE's conduct and the job Trump is doing, to tariffs, the need to consult with Congress before taking military action and even whether the United States should take control of Greenland.   On Greenland, for example, almost 7 in 10 Republicans said they supported taking control of the Arctic Danish territory, while overwhelming numbers of independents and Democrats opposed such a move.   \"For those who are always thinking that, 'Ah! This situation is really going to break loose the Republicans; his base is crumbling,' \" Miringoff said, \"reports of that tend to be overexaggerating and based on very, very skimpy evidence.\"   \n   And despite all of the attention on immigration enforcement, as well as Trump's action in Venezuela and threats to invade Greenland in recent weeks, a majority of voters continue to say, by wide margins, that the Trump administration's focus should be on lowering prices.   \n   Americans largely disapprove of ICE   After two Americans were killed in Minnesota and the uproar that followed, the Trump administration reassigned Greg Bovino, the man who had been in charge of the enforcement operations. On Wednesday, White House border czar Tom Homan, who took over the Minnesota operation, said he was drawing down 700 federal agents in the state.   When asked in an interview with NBC News what he learned from the situation in Minneapolis, Trump said, \"I learned that maybe we can use a little bit of a softer touch. But you still have to be tough. These are criminals. You're dealing with really hard criminals.\"   \n   Neither of the U.S. citizens killed by federal agents — Renee Macklin Good or Alex Pretti — fit Trump's description, but the shift in tone is notable.   There's good reason for it: Public opinion is not on the Trump administration's side. In addition to the two-thirds who said ICE has gone too far, 6 in 10 also said they disapprove of the job ICE is doing overall, and almost the same number think the agency is making Americans less safe.   When it comes to the mass protests against ICE, by a 59%-to-40% margin, more said the demonstrations are mostly legitimate as opposed to people acting unlawfully.    Loading... \n   Republicans marginally increased in saying ICE has gone too far, but they largely remained steady in their support of ICE. Almost three-quarters said they approve of the job ICE is doing, 77% said the agency is making Americans safer, and about three-quarters said the way it is going about enforcement is either \"about right\" (45%) or \"not far enough\" (28%). Three-quarters of Republicans also see the protesters as acting mostly unlawfully.   Trump's job approvals remain low, from the economy to foreign policy   The president's overall job approval rating is just 39%. His approval rating in the Marist poll has now been below 40% since November and is consistent with polling averages also showing a decline.   He is also underwater on how he's handling the economy and foreign policy — 59% disapprove of the president on the economy and 56% disapprove on foreign policy.   \n   Trump's tariffs clearly continue to hurt him. By a 56%-to-31% margin, more people say they hurt rather than help the economy.   On foreign policy, two-thirds oppose the possibility of taking control of Greenland; two-thirds said the U.S. benefits from its relationship with NATO, and 56% of respondents have a favorable view of the alliance; and 72% believe the president should have to consult with Congress before taking military action.   Republicans continue to steadfastly support Trump's policies, but he's lost ground with voters who helped him win in 2024   Trump made it over the finish line in the last presidential election with the help of independents, Latinos and young voters, but this and other surveys show that coalition has frayed.   \n   In this poll, just 30% of independents approve of the job he's doing overall. Almost two-thirds disapprove, 56% strongly so; two-thirds disapprove of how he's handling the economy and nearly 6 in 10 think lowering prices should be the Trump administration's top priority.   \n   In fact, on every single question asked, independents aligned with Democrats — often overwhelmingly.   Trump won a record share of Latinos for a Republican presidential candidate, and as has been the case for months, they have slid heavily away from him. Just 38% of Latinos approve of the job he's doing; 60% disapprove of his handling of the economy and a plurality said lowering prices should be the administration's top priority; 61% disapprove of how ICE is doing its job and 70% think the agency has gone too far.   Trump's base, however, shows no signs of cracks and are outliers in nearly every question. For example:   85% approve of the job Trump's doing; 80% approve of how he's handling the economy; 77% approve of how he's handling foreign policy; 77% think ICE is making Americans safe, including 52% who say \"much more safe,\" whereas 56% of independents and 80% of Democrats say \"much less safe\"; 75% said demonstrators are people acting mostly unlawfully; 66% think tariffs are helping the economy; 58% don't think the president needs to consult with Congress before taking military action; andwhile Democrats and independents said lowering prices should be the administration's No. 1 priority, a plurality of Republicans (44%) said it should be immigration.\n",

    "body": "\n    TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. My guest, Robert Kagan, used to describe Donald Trump as antiliberal. Then he upped it to authoritarian, and now Kagan says that Trump is getting close to becoming a dictator. Kagan writes, \"President Trump has managed in just one year to destroy the American order that was and has weakened America's ability to protect its interests in the world that will be. Americans thought defending the liberal world order was too expensive. Wait until they start paying for what comes next,\" unquote.We're going to talk about that and Trump's domestic violations of norms, laws and the Constitution, including the ICE immigration crackdowns in cities like Minneapolis. Kagan says some of the Trump administration policies are rooted in the history of Christian white supremacy.Robert Kagan is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a contributing writer at The Atlantic, a former longtime Washington Post columnist, a former Republican and the author of many books. The paperback edition of his latest book is titled \"Rebellion: Donald Trump And The Antiliberal Tradition In America.\" We recorded our interview yesterday.Robert Kagan, welcome to FRESH AIR.ROBERT KAGAN: Thank you.GROSS: So you've recently said we're heading into a dictatorship, if we're not already in one. And you've described Trump over the years as antiliberal and then authoritarian, and now to moving in the direction of dictator or already maybe one. So what promoted him to would-be dictator or maybe already one for you?KAGAN: Well, I started warning that he was threatening to be a dictator back in November '23. And so pretty much everything that's happened since then, I think, was predictable, and I foresaw it. But I have to say, certainly his actions, his administration's actions in the first year, in which they very rapidly sort of dismantled the federal bureaucracy, took over the Justice Department, took over the FBI, took over the CIA and then have created this brute squad, which is called ICE - these are the acts of a dictator, plain and simple.GROSS: He still insists that the 2020 election was stolen from him. And so now he announced on Dan Bongino's podcast - and Bongino had been the No. 2 at the FBI in the Trump administration, but now is back to being a podcaster. So Trump said that he wants to federalize elections in at least 15 states and called for Republican officials to oversee those states' elections.KAGAN: Yeah. No. I mean, look. I think we're already well into a dictatorship. It's just a question of whether he will go ahead and, you know, basically disrupt the '26 elections, which I think he's made it clear he has every intention of doing now. So I think that this should be a five-alarm fire for everybody. I - people, I think, are starting to figure out that the '26 elections are very much at risk and that his intention is to prevent the Democrats from taking the House or the Senate and that, you know, we are there now. You know, people are always talking about when this happens or if that happens. We're there, and I really think it's time for people to start taking that seriously.GROSS: Just describe a little bit what nationalizing the elections would mean and what - like, asking Republican officials to oversee elections. First of all, the Constitution says that states regulate elections and oversee elections, right?KAGAN: Right. I mean, it is the state's prerogative to decide how the elections are going to be conducted and how the votes are counted and all that kind of stuff. Yeah.GROSS: And to have partisans overseeing it - like, how in the world can that be legal?KAGAN: It's not. It's not legal. We've moved out of the realm of legality. Everything now is about power. It's about pure power. And, you know, the fact that the Republican Party has become the party of dictatorship - I think people really do need to focus on that. There's so much focus on Trump. And Trump, of course, is the driving force behind this, although he has other people who are also major figures, like Stephen Miller and, I think, Russell Vought. But even to suggest that Republicans should be overseeing elections - I must say, I'm surprised even to hear that coming out of the mouth of Donald Trump. It's such a blatant declaration of dictatorship, a one-party dictatorship, that it - I have to say, I'm even a little bit surprised that he put it that way.GROSS: And meanwhile, in Fulton County, Georgia, the FBI has seized voting ballots and other documents related to voting. And Trump wants to do that in other states as well, including Minnesota, and this is to build a national voter file. What does that mean?KAGAN: Well, again, it's clear that he has no intention of allowing the elections to play out and allow a Democratic victory. And I think it's important to understand his motives here. He knows perfectly well that, in effect, his presidency will be greatly diminished once the Democrats take either one or both of the Houses. He himself is saying right now that he'll be impeached, and that is why he wants to prevent the Democrats from taking power. And he now has at his disposal a huge, powerful - literally, the forces of power. What they would call in another country the power ministries - he is in full control of that. And, you know, I can imagine any number of scenarios in which he uses that power.By the way, when he talks about the 2020 election being stolen from him, that's not just about 2020. That's about looking forward, too. He wants to set the predicate for the idea that elections are stolen, that he and the federal government and, I guess, the Republican Party have to step in. I can easily imagine them seizing the ballots in some of these districts that are heavily Democratic. That's not even counting the voter suppression that they will engage in in order to prevent nonwhite people from feeling like it's safe to vote. And if you put all that together, then you have the final end to American democracy. I think that's what we're staring at right now.GROSS: Do you think what's happening in Minnesota with ICE is, in part, a way to scare people away from voting?KAGAN: Yes. Absolutely, and I think it's been a big mistake. And I somewhat fault the media for basically treating this like it's an - and the Democratic Party, too, for that matter - treating this like it's an immigration and deportation and maybe even a crime issue, when it's clear and has been clear that the purpose of ICE is to create protests and riots of sufficient size to justify Trump, in his own mind, invoking the Insurrection Act and bringing in the regular military. It's clear that he wants to do that. And so Minnesota, in my view, has been a test run for the seizure of power, using these forces that he has brought under his control and created. This is not about immigration primarily. It's about white supremacy. It's about white Christian supremacy, but it's also about using the full force of the federal government effectively to nullify the voters' choices.GROSS: Can you just briefly list a few of the other actions Trump has taken that have led you to call him a dictator? First of all, just he personally - I think he really is a textbook definition of a megalomaniac. There is never enough power for him. He wants to have power over everybody, including the world, by the way, not just the United States. So there's the clear sense that you get from him that the Constitution means nothing to him, that elections mean nothing to him and that the only thing that he seeks is his own power - and wealth. But I think the power is more important. So there's the personality of Trump. But then, of course, there's all the things that he did in his first year, which we've sort of gotten used to.GROSS: First year of second term.KAGAN: Second term, first year, second - 2025, which is the remarkable - and I got to say, it will go down in history as really a remarkable destruction of the government that - his turning the Justice Department into his personal legal weapon, his turning the CIA into his personal organization, his using the FBI to go after enemies and solidify his position in power. These are all textbook actions of a dictator. He doesn't want to allow any pluralism in this country. He doesn't want to allow any dissent, you know, the way they talk about protesters as domestic terrorists. That's Stalin territory that you're in. So, I mean, it's almost too - there are too many things to list, it seems to me, that make him really not a would-be dictator, but really a dictator at this point.GROSS: There are certain personal characteristics, too, of Trump's that seem to fit with autocratic or dictators in other countries who have taken over. And I wonder if you think that narcissism, lack of empathy, lying, interested in money, corruption in the administration, transactional - are those, like, typical characteristics of people who become autocrats or dictators?KAGAN: They are. And obviously, there are parallels with other countries, but I think we need to recognize that this is very much an American - this is a homegrown dictatorship, if you will. I mean, the forces that are supporting Trump are very much an American phenomenon, this white Christian supremacy, that is - and the sort of status anxiety of white Christian and especially males. This is very much - it goes back, I would say, there have been - a significant portion of the American body politic has held these kinds of what I call antiliberal views, going back to the founding.And Trump is very much an American. I mean, if you look at sort of how he came to, you know, have this power, it was by being a television personality, a kind of a phony billionaire. I mean, he's very much an American phenomenon. So I'm always a little wary of bringing in the examples from other countries because, in a way, it makes us feel like, well, those are in other countries. It couldn't happen here. And I think the belief that it couldn't happen here has been a real handicap for us in trying to prevent him from getting to where he is now going.GROSS: Well, let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Robert Kagan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a contributing writer for The Atlantic and author of the book \"Rebellion: Donald Trump And The Antiliberal Tradition In America.\" We'll be right back after a break. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Robert Kagan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, an author, mostly on foreign policy, and a contributing writer for The Atlantic. His latest article is titled \"America Vs. The World.\" Our interview was recorded yesterday.You write about how Trumpism relates to racism and white Christian supremacy. So how do you define white Christian supremacy?KAGAN: Since the founding of the republic, there has always been a significant portion of the population that does not believe in the principles of the Declaration of Independence, does not believe that all men are created equal and does not believe that individual rights are more - you know, need to be protected from the state. Obviously, the slave-holding South did not believe in the fundamental principles of equality and the principles that are enunciated in the Declaration of Independence, and also the Reconstruction South. I mean, the Jim Crow South.You know, as late as the 1950s and '60s, the federal government had to send troops into the South in order to enforce desegregation. So I don't know where we think all those people went. I think, you know, because we've been living predominantly liberal America since World War II, I think we thought those people had sort of, you know, crawled under rocks and we'd never see them again. But they're alive and well and running the Republican Party right now.GROSS: How would what you describe as white Christian nationalism express itself during the writing of the Constitution? Now, we know that even, you know, Founding Fathers, like Thomas Jefferson, had slaves. So unless the enslaved people aren't really people, then all men are not created equal in the eyes of Founding Fathers, those who held slaves. But can you talk more about how you see white Christian nationalism expressing itself during the founding days and the writing of the Constitution?KAGAN: Well, obviously, the Constitution was a big contradiction because on the one hand - and by the way, the founders were aware of the contradiction in a way that I think subsequent generations maybe sort of decided to forget about the contradiction. I mean, Thomas Jefferson was aware that he was a slaveholder, and yet he was fighting for the rights of all human beings. And he hoped that slavery - he wasn't prepared to get rid of his own slaves because obviously that would be a great economic setback for him, but he was hopeful that at some point, slavery would wash out, that it would just cease to be a phenomenon in the United States.But the Constitution originally was a great compromise, a horrible compromise with slavery, which was a direct contradiction to the principles that undergirded the Constitution and were in the Bill of Rights, etc., etc. And that's why we had a civil war. But I think a lot of people may think that the Civil War sort of changed America so fundamentally that you could never, you know, return to that horrible compromise. And I think we've learned that that's not true, that there's this strain of people who regard themselves - you know, it's a question of, how do you define America? And there's always been a fight between those who define it as an idea, which is to say the idea of universal human rights, and those who wanted to define it and continue to want to define it as an ethnoreligious entity.People talk about, today, heritage Americans or - how long have your people been here? - etc., etc., which is very contrary to the founders' view but which nevertheless has been a very powerful force in American life. And, you know, now you hear it straight out of the mouths of JD Vance and Stephen Miller. It's part of the propaganda, recruitment propaganda of ICE, you know, where they're saying, come defend our culture. Come defend our civilization. And we know what they're talking about, and they know what we're - the recruits also know what we're talking about.GROSS: Before we move on to foreign policy, which is your real focus, I want to ask you what you're expecting now of the midterms and the presidential election.KAGAN: Well, in the midterms, I fully expect Trump to use all the various levers of power that he controls as president to make sure that the Democrats cannot take power either in the House or in the Senate. He will use ICE, in my opinion, to cause disturbances, to frighten away not illegal voters, who generally don't come to the polls, but legal voters who are nevertheless nonwhite and know that they can be scooped up and sent off to Texas, etc. - that he is perfectly capable of declaring a state of emergency over the elections or invoking the Insurrection Act, of going into heavily Democratic districts and seizing the ballot boxes, as the FBI just did in Fulton County, and then saying, we're counting the votes. We'll let you know how it turns out. But somehow or other, a Democratic House is never seated.And I think that that is, at this point, I would say, a likelihood. I don't know what Trump has to do other than stand on the roof of the White House, screaming that he has no intention of allowing a fair election in 2026, but that's basically where we are right now. And to me, the question is, who is going to stand up and prevent this from happening?GROSS: Do you think the courts will?KAGAN: I don't think the courts necessarily will. I mean, the various federal courts may, but the Supreme Court, I think, is - has demonstrated a willingness to let him do whatever he wants. And the minute a president moves into the national security realm and starts declaring national security reasons for why he has to do certain things, traditionally, the court has sort of backed off. I mean, the worst court decision of - certainly of the past 100 years was Korematsu, which was the internment of the Japanese, which the court felt like, well, the president's making a national security determination. What can we do? So, no, I don't think it'll be the courts.I would like to think that some Republicans - it only takes four in the Senate - might stand up for democracy and preserving the American system, but I actually have no optimistic sense about that. So in some respects, I suppose it's going to be left to the American people, and we've seen a lot of brave American people in Minneapolis and elsewhere. But that's a pretty thin reed for our democracy to be hanging on.GROSS: Do you think, if Trump does declare the Insurrection Act, that that would be the kind of, you know, emergency that would prevent the courts from stopping his action?KAGAN: I worry about that, yes. And again, it's not the courts. I'm sure there are plenty of courts who would say, you know, this is not appropriate. But if it gets to the Supreme Court, I'm afraid there are some members of the court who are entirely in favor of the Trump dictatorship and others who are, you know, Republicans and in any case not - have proven unwilling to stand in Trump's way.GROSS: OK. It's time for another break, so let me reintroduce you. If you're just joining us, my guest is Robert Kagan, a contributing writer for The Atlantic, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of the book \"Rebellion: Donald Trump And The Antiliberal Tradition In America.\" We'll be back after a short break. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF WAYNE HORVITZ & ZONY MASH'S \"THE GIFT\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Robert Kagan about why he thinks Trump is on his way to becoming a dictator based on Trump's foreign and domestic policies, his violations of laws and the Constitution and his constant desire for more money and power. Kagan is a contributing writer at The Atlantic, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a former longtime Washington Post columnist, a former Republican, and the author of many books, including his latest - \"Rebellion: Donald Trump And The Antiliberal Tradition In America.\" His latest article The Atlantic is titled \"America Vs. The World.\"So, let's talk about foreign policy, which is your area of expertise. Do you think that Trump has managed to end the NATO alliance without actually withdrawing from it, but by, like, insulting and defying NATO, wanting to buy Greenland, threatening Denmark and trying to make Canada the 51st state?KAGAN: Yes. I've been telling my European friends that they need to understand that NATO is over. I used to just focus on the fact that Trump certainly has no commitment to our Article 5 security commitment to the allies. He's made that clear on numerous occasions. But as you say, and let's be clear about what happened in Greenland, we just had a situation where a number of European powers, our allies, were talking about sending troops to deter a potential act of American territorial aggression against a NATO ally. That's not a thing that goes unremembered. And I think that Europeans today, some of them can't imagine separating themselves from the United States. But I think increasingly, we're seeing Europeans regarding the United States correctly as among their adversaries. Europe now faces a situation where they really have a predatory empire to their east in the form of Russia, and a predatory empire toward the west in the form of the United States. And that leaves them in a very perilous situation.GROSS: I want to quote you. You write, (reading) the Trump administration has told Europeans to be ready to take over their own defense by 2027 and suggests that allies and strategic partners, including Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, should pay the U.S. for protection. Trump has launched aggressive tariff wars against virtually all of America's allies. He has waged ideological and political warfare against European governments and explicitly threatened territorial aggression against two NATO allies - Canada and Denmark. If NATO ends because NATO literally ends or it just ends in the sense that it doesn't really function anymore without the U.S., what would the consequences be, do you think, for the world and for the U.S. in particular?KAGAN: Well, I think that, you know, it's been so long since we lived in a genuinely multipolar world that I don't think people are ready for what that actually means.GROSS: What do you mean by a multipolar world?KAGAN: A multipolar world is one that is not the world we've lived in since World War II. The world we've lived in since World War II has been one where a very large number of once great powers like Britain, which ruled much of the world at one time, like France, which had a huge empire, like Germany, which was so powerful that it almost conquered Europe twice. During this period of what we call the American order, those countries have been peaceful. They have relied on the United States to provide their basic security, which means that they have essentially given up great power ambitions, including the demand for spheres of influence, including the demand for control of resources. All of those things have essentially been provided to them in the American order. If the United States is no longer playing that role, then they have to start dealing with the world without that protection, which, to my mind, means they will have to rearm. And then we will have a situation as we did in say, the 1920s where you have multiple great powers, not just Russia and China, but also perhaps Germany, perhaps Japan, perhaps India, are all great powers, all demanding spheres of influence, all competing for resources. It's a much more combative, brutal world, really. And I - in the essay that you're quoting from, I go back and look at the 19th century 'cause that was a multipolar world, and you even hear some Trump supporters saying we could go back to something like that. And what people don't remember about the 19th century is that it was a century of almost constant warfare among great powers.Every multipolar world we've ever seen is one in which there are multiple conflicts among great powers. And so just imagine every decade, there is some kind of war involving Russia, China, Japan, Germany, the United States. That is, by the way, the normal world. The world we've been living in, where the United States plays this unusual role, has been an aberration. But normal is not good from the point of view of conflict and disruption and economic calamity and all the things that come with a much more competitive multipolar system.GROSS: I want to play an excerpt of a speech that Trump gave on January 21 in Davos. The World Economic Forum was held in Davos in January.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The United States is treated very unfairly by NATO. I want to tell you that. And when you think about it, nobody can dispute it. We give so much, and we get so little in return. And I've been a critic of NATO for many years. And yet, I've done more to help NATO than any other president by far, than any other person. You wouldn't have NATO if I didn't get involved in my first term. The war with Ukraine is an example. We are thousands of miles away, separated by a giant ocean. It's a war that should have never started, and it wouldn't have started if the 2020 U.S. presidential election weren't rigged. It was a rigged election. Everybody now knows that. They found out. People will soon be prosecuted for what they did. It's probably breaking news, but it should be. It was a rigged election. Can't have rigged elections. You need strong borders, strong elections and ideally, a good press. I always say it. Strong borders, strong elections, free, fair elections and a fair media.GROSS: What's your reaction to that?KAGAN: Well, that's sort of everything in a nutshell about Trump. First of all, his description of an ideal, I guess, America is one where he controls the press, he controls the elections and is, in effect, a dictatorship. And making up this nonsense about the 2020 elections is all pursuant to consolidating power in that way. But he also has got, you know, incredible delusions of grandeur on the world stage as well. He is the one who is, in fact, destroying NATO, and yet he says that, you know, he's the one who fixed it.I just think that when people heard that speech in Davos, when people in other countries heard that speech in Davos, I think they began to get a sense of just what we're dealing with here in the United States. And that's a big part of why you see countries like Canada now having to talk to China about trade deals, why everybody is scrambling to find alternative markets to the United States, which is not easy to do, and which is why you're going to see increasing anti-Americanism.And this is the thing Americans need to understand. Trump is under the illusion that America is so powerful that it doesn't matter what anybody else in the world thinks, and that really is a delusion. A lot of American power has derived from the fact that much of the rest of the world, not all - and I'm not saying that America's without flaws. It isn't. But much of the world has actually trusted the United States to hold to its basic bargain, which is to provide security without using its overwhelming power against its own allies. That trust is now gone.GROSS: Also the example that we just heard of the Trump speech in Davos. So he's talking about NATO and how they've been unfair to us. And then he transitions to, it was a rigged election. Everybody knows that. And I think it's an example of mixing personal grievance with world affairs.KAGAN: Yeah.GROSS: And what's your reaction to the way Trump does that?KAGAN: Well, again, there's nothing more important in Trump's world than Trump himself. And so everything is a function of him. And it would be one thing if he really were, let's say, an America First president in terms of foreign policy. It would be one thing if he really did intend to pull the United States back into the Western Hemisphere and let the rest of the world do whatever it's going to do. But, of course, that's not what he's doing because he is Donald Trump. He wants to be world emperor. He wants to be able to bomb Iran and bomb Syria and remove a dictator in Venezuela and change governments in Europe, etc. And so in a way, he's creating the worst of both worlds. It's really a recipe for foreign policy disaster.GROSS: So nobody in the U.S. has prevented Trump from insisting that he needs and will get Greenland and that he intends on annexing Canada. I think he still intends that. I don't think he's withdrawn that, has he?KAGAN: No. And I was sort of stunned, again, not to be critical of the American media, but when Trump said that he was, OK, maybe not going to invade Greenland, the media reported, OK, Trump rules out attack on Greenland. He hasn't ruled anything out, as you say. And Greenland has been an idee fixe for him for a long time, certainly going back to his first term. And I don't think we're done with his efforts to get Greenland. I think he thinks it's going to get on Mount Rushmore and that he'll be the great completer of American territorial acquisition. So I don't think he's given up on that at all. And, again, it's all about his glory. It is not about strategic issues, by the way. We could do anything we needed to do in Greenland with the full permission and cooperation of Denmark and NATO allies.It's his personal glory that he's seeking. And, again, this is true domestically and internationally. Everything is about Trump, his power, his glory. It's not about American interests, and it's not about the interests of American democracy.GROSS: Well, let's take another short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Robert Kagan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. He's an author and a contributing writer for The Atlantic. His latest article in The Atlantic is titled \"America Vs. The World.\"  We'll be back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview that I recorded yesterday with Robert Kagan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. He's an author and a contributing writer for The Atlantic. His latest article in The Atlantic is titled \"America Vs. The World.\"So you have been labeled in the past as a leader of the neoconservative movement. I know that's a word you don't particularly like. It's not a word that you coined. So what did people who called you a neoconservative mean? And how did you define yourself differently than the definition that was placed on you?KAGAN: Well, there's so many - different people mean different things by neoconservative. Let me just start by saying what it is that I would characterize myself as believing, which is I believe that the founders' system, that the principles of the Declaration of Independence, that the belief in universal individual rights and, in particular, the protection of those rights against the state, is one of the greatest developments in the history of humanity, and I believe it is the right way for human beings to live. I also believe that ideas alone don't succeed just because they're the better idea and that they require power behind them if they are to succeed and that the United States, for all the many mistakes it has made - and I'm a historian of American foreign policy, and I'm acutely aware of those mistakes. I'm aware of the weaknesses and foibles of the American people. But nevertheless, if you look at what the United States has done since World War II, in the 80 years since then, the United States managed, in its various peculiar ways, to create a world in which democracy has flourished, in which prosperity is at historic levels compared to the whole breadth of human history, and in which wars among the great powers have been absent for 80 years. And that's a huge accomplishment. And I believe that, again, whatever the flaws of the United States, the world is better off with this kind of American leadership than it would be with any of the actual alternatives. There are utopian ideals about what the world can look like. But in terms of the real world, a world in which power is critical, I think the United States has played that role. To me, if I had to say what neoconservatism is, it's that. It's the marriage of American power and liberal democratic ideals.GROSS: I want to quote something that you wrote.(Reading) Trump has managed in just one year to destroy the American order that was, and he has weakened Americans' ability to protect its interests in the world that will be. If Americans thought defending the liberal world order was too expensive, wait until they start paying for what comes next.What do you think is coming next?KAGAN: Contrary to what Trump seems to think, we have benefited enormously from the vast number of alliances and strategic partners that we've had over the world. In my article, I cite a Chinese strategic thinker named Yan Xuetong who himself wrote at - about a decade ago that the great advantage that the United States had over China was not its wealth and was not its military capability, both of which China was capable of catching up to. It was this vast alliance structure and these vast number of strategic partners, which numbered, when he was counting, something like 50 around the world, compared to China, who has basically no reliable allies in the world. And the same is true of Russia.That was an enormous advantage of the United States, and it was very much a source of American power above and beyond whatever our own material capabilities were. And if we move into a world where instead of having those allies, many of them become independent great powers with their own objectives that have nothing to do with us or are even hostile to us, which is possible, then on the one hand, we're living in a more dangerous world. And on the other hand, we have stripped ourselves of our strongest armor, in a way, by turning all of our allies against us.GROSS: One of the things that Trump seems to want is to say, hey, you take care of your territory. Other countries, you take care of yours. I'm interested - you know, Trump is interested - in the Americas, the Western Hemisphere, our part of the Western Hemisphere, that he's going to be the leader of that and ignore the people across the oceans. Does that sound like the right interpretation?KAGAN: Well, I mean, that is certainly what they have said. That's sort of what the national security strategy sounds like. And so that, if they were doing that, would be like, well, welcome back to America in the 19th - the late 19th century, you know? But in - but as I mentioned before, Trump's actual foreign policy is nothing like that. They are constantly sending administration officials to Europe, to the Munich Security Conference, to Davos, supporting opposition forces in Europe against the sitting governments. The Trump administration has been very active in supporting the AfD, which is a, you know, far-right, almost neo-Nazi party in Germany. They support the right wing in France. They support the right wing in U.K. in the form of Neil Farage.And so they are meddling in the affairs of Europe very, very substantially, and the tariffs are hardly minding our own business. He is attempting to wield power over every nation in the world using these tariffs. They're not about economics. They're about power. Meanwhile, he's removing governments in Venezuela. He's bombing Iran and talking about removing the government in Iran. My point is that, you know, there were - there was a school of foreign policy which, theoretically, Trump was heading toward called restraint. And these are people who think that America should not be so involved in the world. But Trump is the opposite of restrained. He is, you know, really quite deeply involved in the affairs of countries all over the world, and he enjoys that.GROSS: Well, let's take another short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Robert Kagan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. He's an author and a contributing writer for The Atlantic. His latest article in The Atlantic is titled \"America Vs. The World.\" We'll be back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF DON STIERNBERG'S \"FEVER\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Robert Kagan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, an author mostly on foreign policy and a contributing writer for The Atlantic. His latest article is titled \"America Vs. The World.\" Our interview was recorded yesterday.So this might be a depressing answer to this question. But, you know, Martin Luther King said, the arc of history is long, but it bends towards justice. I don't think you believe that.KAGAN: When Martin Luther King was saying those things, that did appear to be the story of the United States, right? I mean, we had moved from slavery to Jim Crow to the Civil Rights Movement. That was progress. Now, I happen to believe that that progress, especially for the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and '60s, was very much a consequence of actual events. It wasn't just the ideas. It was not just history bending in a certain direction. It was specifically the Great Depression and World War II, which basically vanquished a certain kind of antiliberal conservatism in the United States and led to 80 years of liberal ascendancy.And that's what gave us the idea, and which I also share, that America was about progressing toward the perfection of its original intent - you know, the sort of perfection of the principles of the Declaration of Independence in a society that was deeply flawed. But now we see that it isn't always progress. There can be major steps backward, and that's what we're living through right now.GROSS: In terms of the Civil Rights Movement - and it was also, like, very effective protests. It was television showing police fire-hosing...KAGAN: Yeah.GROSS: ...Protesters, dogs sicced on protesters. The whole world saw that.KAGAN: Yeah.GROSS: It was very hard to defend that. And you want to see Americans stand up for democracy. What actions would you like to see Americans take? How do individuals stand up for democracy?KAGAN: Well, I mean, obviously, we see very brave people on the streets of Minneapolis and elsewhere in the country, where they are facing down this brute squad known as ICE. But I also would like to talk about the elite a little bit in America. I mean, I would say the Democratic Party is not doing everything it needs to be doing, even in its own naked self-interest, at this point.The most shocking element of this has been, to me, the collapse of the elites - the universities that cut their deal with Trump, the legal firms that cut their deal with Trump. Corporate America has been absolutely shameful. We're so used to the idea that nobody in a position of actual power - whether you're a billionaire or a university president or a big law firm - we're so used to the idea these people just fold instead of standing up to Trump and showing the necessary courage. But that is what's needed. There is - we need to have courage and lack of selfishness up and down American society.And one of the things that I've noticed in watching all this is just how difficult it is for people, human beings, to recognize that they are in - suddenly in a radically new situation. The desire for normalcy is so powerful. And, you know, you look back on other times when democracies have been taken over by dictatorship, and you always say, how did they let that happen? As we're - as I'm living through it, I see how it happens. You know, we sort of discount all the things that are really quite different about the world and cling to normalcy as best we can. And I just think people need to understand we are not in Kansas anymore. We are living at the edge of the consolidation of dictatorship, and there's no more time for waiting.GROSS: Do you think America will ever return to what, like, you've described as normal? Or do you think when things change, assuming they change, that we'll return to something different, but not what we had in the past?KAGAN: Well, lots of people have been talking about this, and I think it's a very interesting question. You know, what the Trump administration has done to the federal bureaucracy and particularly, as I say, the power ministries - the FBI, the CIA and the Justice Department - is going to be very difficult to undo. I mean, are we going to - every time we have an election, are we going to fire everybody in the federal government because they were put in by a hostile force?I do think that everybody in the government who served the Trump administration will have to go if the Democrats are able to win in 2028, but that is a different America. I mean, that is not an America - the America that we've known for 80 years. It's more like the America of, like, the Andrew Jackson period and, in many ways, worse 'cause I don't think Andrew Jackson was actually a would-be tyrant. So I think it's going to be very hard to put the pieces back together. I - there are instances in history. I don't think, you know - things aren't necessarily over. But I do think it's very hard to go back to what we were after all the destruction that Trump has wreaked, both domestically and internationally.GROSS: Robert Kagan, thank you so much for talking with us.KAGAN: Well, thank you.GROSS: Robert Kagan is a contributing writer at The Atlantic and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

Paul Ingrassia, who was nominated to lead the Office of Special Counsel, had been scheduled to have his confirmation hearing this week.   On Monday, however, Politico reported on a text chat that showed him saying the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday should be \"tossed into the seventh circle of hell.\" Ingrassia also described himself in the chat as having \"a Nazi streak\" at times.   After the texts came to light, several Republican senators said they would not support his nomination. They included some of the most conservative and stalwart Trump allies in the Senate.   \n   \"I will be withdrawing myself from Thursday's HSGAC hearing to lead the Office of Special Counsel because unfortunately I do not have enough Republican votes at this time,\" Ingrassia posted in an online message. \"I appreciate the overwhelming support that I have received throughout the process and will continue to serve President Trump and the administration to Make America Great Again!\" HSGAC is the Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs.   \n   Asked for comment on Ingrassia withdrawing his name from consideration, the White House said simply, \"He is no longer the nominee.\" But Ingrassia's post came after Senate Majority Leader John Thune had said he hoped the White House would withdraw Ingrassia's nomination and several GOP senators said they would not support him.   \"I'm a no,\" said Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who sits on the committee that would've taken up Ingrassia's nomination. \"It never should have got this far.\"   Republicans have been able to muscle through the vast majority of Trump's nominees in roll call votes despite stiff Democratic opposition. But there have been sporadic instances when Republicans have pushed back, generally behind the scenes, showing there are limits to their support.   Most notably, Matt Gaetz withdrew as Trump's first choice for attorney general soon after being tabbed for the job. In May, Trump pulled his nomination of Ed Martin Jr. to be the top federal prosecutor for the nation's capital, bowing to bipartisan concerns about the conservative activist's modest legal experience and support for Jan. 6 rioters.   \n   Last month, the White House announced it would be withdrawing the nomination of E.J. Antoni to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Antoni was supposed to succeed a BLS director who was fired following a disappointing jobs report.   But Democrats weren't satisfied with Ingrassia's withdrawal, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., calling on the president to fire him from his current position as a White House liaison for the Department of Homeland Security.   \"This isn't anywhere near enough,\" Schumer said on social media.   According to texts viewed by Politico, Ingrassia told those in the chat that \"MLK Jr. was the 1960s George Floyd and his 'holiday' should be ended and tossed into the seventh circle of hell where it belongs.\"   Politico spoke to Ingrassia's lawyer, who said the text messages might have been manipulated or were missing context. The lawyer did not confirm the texts were authentic.   The Office of Special Counsel is an investigative and prosecutorial office that works to protect government employees and whistleblowers from retaliation for reporting wrongdoing. It's also responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act, which restricts the partisan political activities of government workers.   In May, Trump described Ingrassia in a social media post as a \"highly respected attorney, writer and Constitutional Scholar.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      Zohran Mamdani, age 34, is on track to topple Andrew Cuomo who's been Democratic Party royalty for decades. Analysts say Mamdani's hopeful appeals to young voters on social media shook up the race.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  One big question about the future of the Democratic Party comes down to age. A growing number of young Democrats, many of them left-leaning, are running for office, and they're hoping to topple a generation of older, more centrist Democrats. As NPR's Brian Mann reports, this generational battle is at the center of the race for New York City mayor.BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: Andrew Cuomo was Democratic Party royalty for decades. The son of party icon Mario Cuomo, he served in the Clinton administration before leading New York as the Democratic governor for a decade. Now 67, Cuomo says his deep resume makes him the perfect guy to lead New York City.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ANDREW CUOMO: This is no job for on-the-job training.MANN: Cuomo speaking there during last week's debate, where he described himself as a pro-business Democratic centrist. But he's running as an independent after being trounced in his party's primary by Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic socialist who serves in the state legislature.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ZOHRAN MAMDANI: What I don't have in experience, I make up for in integrity. And what you don't have in integrity, you could never make up for in experience.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yes.MANN: Mamdani, a relative unknown until this year, celebrated his 34th birthday last weekend. Despite his relatively thin track record, he leads this race by double digits. Andres Bernal, a political analyst at the City University of New York, thinks Mamdani was smart to offer big, progressive ideas - like freezing apartment rents and offering free city bus service - that appeal to young voters.ANDRES BERNAL: Be ambitious and look for fundamental changes that I think inspire a lot of people and are - is associated with Mamdani's youth.MANN: The latest poll by the AARP and Gotham Polling shows over half of Mamdani's support comes from young New Yorkers under age 50. For Cuomo, meanwhile, 76% of his support is over age 50. Bernal says one challenge for Cuomo is that he carries the kind of baggage - including a sexual misconduct scandal that forced him from office in 2021 - that many younger voters associate with the Democratic Party's older establishment.BERNAL: It's a revolving door with a lot of corporate America, with a lot of funders, lobbyists.MANN: But it's not only serious policy issues that set these men apart. It's also lived experience and communication style. Here's how the two candidates answered when asked whether they've bought marijuana in New York City's legal shops.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MAMDANI: (Laughter) I have purchased marijuana at a legal cannabis shop.UNIDENTIFIED MODERATOR: OK. Mr. Cuomo?CUOMO: No.MANN: This difference in tone and attitude is playing out starkly in social media, where Mamdani's upbeat campaign videos often go viral.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: He's building a movement that goes beyond what we just expect out of a regular politician.MANN: J.C. Polanco, a political analyst and professor at the University of Mount Saint Vincent in the Bronx, is critical of many of Mamdani's left-leaning policy ideas, but he says Mamdani's social media outreach to young voters is a game-changer.JC POLANCO: Zohran Mamdani is right now the epitome of what you're going to see every other candidate try to do. They're copying him. He has rewritten the book. I love his style. He's the happy warrior.MANN: During last week's debate, Cuomo said his campaign's social media messaging is getting better, but he acknowledged playing catch-up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CUOMO: I did not do enough on social media, which is a very effective medium now. I think the assemblyman did do a better job on TikTok and social media than I did during the campaign.MANN: With voting underway, Election Day is just two weeks away. If he holds onto his lead, Mamdani will represent one more big generational change - serving as the first Muslim mayor in a city that's home to the largest Jewish community outside Israel. Cuomo has attacked Mamdani repeatedly for criticizing Israel, but polls show most younger voters back Mamdani's position on the Gaza War and Palestinian rights.Brian Mann, NPR News, New York.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

Andrew Cuomo faced off in the first New York City mayoral debate of the general election, the generational battle within the Democratic Party was on full display.   Cuomo was long a member of Democratic royalty, leading New York as governor for nearly 11 years after serving in the Clinton administration.  His late father, Gov. Mario Cuomo, was a Democratic Party icon.    Again and again, Cuomo hammered the idea that his deep resume makes him uniquely qualified to lead America's biggest city.   \"This is no job for on-the-job training,\" Cuomo said during the Oct. 16 exchange, painting Mamdani as a political novice with left-leaning ideas outside the mainstream. \"He never has had a job. On his resume it said he interned for his mother. This is not a job for a first-timer.\"   \n   But Cuomo is running in this race as an independent after Mamdani, who turned 34 last weekend, trounced him during the Democratic Party primary. Mamdani was an unknown outside his state Assembly district until this year, but has led consistently in the general election by double-digit margins, according to polls.   \"What I don't have in experience, I make up for in integrity,\" Mamdani said during the debate. \"And what you don't have in integrity, you could never make up for in experience.\"   \n   That barb pointed to the downside of Cuomo's long track record in office: It comes with some gritty political baggage, including a sexual misconduct scandal that led Cuomo to resign as governor in 2021.    Cuomo has denied any wrongdoing. But Andres Bernal, a political analyst who lectures at the City University of New York, thinks many young voters look at Cuomo's history of controversy and are reminded of the Democratic Party establishment that has left them disillusioned.     \"It's a revolving door with a lot of corporate America, a lot of funders and lobbyists,\" he said.   Bernal says Mamdani overcame Cuomo's attacks over his relatively thin resume by offering big progressive ideas, like freezing apartment rents and offering free city bus service, that appeal to many young voters.     \n   \"Be ambitious and look for fundamental changes that I think inspire a lot of people and I think are associated with Mamdani's youth,\" Bernal said.   It seems to be working. The latest poll by AARP and Gotham Polling shows over half of Mamdani's support comes from young New Yorkers, under age 50. For Cuomo, meanwhile, 76% of his support is over age 50.    But it's not only serious policy issues that set these men apart. It's also lived experience and style. When asked during the debate whether they've bought marijuana in New York City's legal cannabis shops, Mamdani laughed and said yes.  Cuomo offered a terse no.    Their starkly different tones have played out in social media, where Cuomo offered conventional campaign ads, often attacking Mamdani. Mamdani's campaign, meanwhile, posts upbeat, often funny and hopeful videos that regularly go viral.     \n   \"Zohran Mamdani is right now the epitome of what you're going to see every other candidate trying to do,\" said J.C. Polanco, a political analyst and professor at the University of Mount St. Vincent in the Bronx.    Polanco is critical of many of Mamdani's left-leaning policy ideas. But he says Mamdani's use of social media to reach young voters is a game changer, allowing him to overcome his relative lack of experience.   \"He has rewritten the book. I love his style; he's a happy warrior,\" he said.   During last week's debate, Cuomo said his campaign's social media messaging has gotten better since he lost the Democratic primary, but he acknowledged playing catch-up.  \"I did not do enough on social media, which is a very effective medium now,\" he said.     While Cuomo and Mamdani have sparred, often bitterly, across this generational party divide, the Republican in the race, Curtis Sliwa, has suggested they're closer on policy issues than their campaign rhetoric suggests. \"We have the architect and the apprentice,\" Sliwa said during the debate.   \n   Early voting is now underway. If Mamdani holds onto his lead through Election Day on Nov. 4, he will represent one more big generational change, serving as the first Muslim mayor in a city that's home to the largest Jewish community outside Israel.   Cuomo has attacked Mamdani repeatedly for criticizing Israel, but that hasn't appeared to slow Mamdani's momentum. Mamdani has picked up some key endorsements from  Jewish leaders in the city and a New York Times-Siena poll last month found most young voters in New York City sympathize more with the Palestinians than with Israel over the war in Gaza.\n",

Politicians still use the phrase all the time — and perhaps none more so than President Trump.   Just this month at a Cabinet meeting, he used the phrase when he again recommended that pregnant women not take Tylenol.   \"There's something going on, and we have to address it. And so, I'm addressing it the best I can as a nondoctor, but I'm a man of common sense,\" he said.   He also used the term when he cast doubt on the monthly jobs report on CNBC in August: \"It's totally rigged. Smart people know it. People with common sense know it.\"   \n   The White House has also used it to explain the current government shutdown.   \"Not enough Democrats voted for this common sense, clean continuing resolution to keep the government open,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt recently told NPR's Morning Edition.   This isn't exactly new. \"Common sense\" is such a widely used political phrase that University of Pennsylvania history professor Sophia Rosenfeld wrote an entire book on it. And yet, she says, Trump's usage of it is unique.   \n   \"He uses it more than almost anybody else in American politics,\" she said. \"Although, of course, it has a really old origin story.\"   That goes back to Thomas Paine, in his 1776 pamphlet \"Common Sense,\" which made the case to the earliest Americans that British rule of the colonies was wrong. And in that, she says, Paine had hit upon the populist appeal of the phrase.   \"It invokes some kind of primordial basic sense of ordinary people, a kind of lived experience that should transcend what the official or elite position is on something and particularly should transcend book learning and school learning,\" she said.   And Trump often invokes that dichotomy of common sense vs. academic smarts.   Speaking to military leaders in Quantico, Va., last month, Trump differentiated his administration from Joe Biden's, saying that Biden was surrounded by \"radical left lunatics that are brilliant people but dumb as hell when it came to policy and common sense.\"   \n   The phrase appeals more to several demographics that strongly align with Trump, says Frank Luntz, a longtime Republican strategist.   \"Common sense is a higher priority to those who live in rural communities than those in the urban areas. Common sense does better among older voters than it does among younger voters,\" he said. \"And I think the reason why is that it reminds people of a more simple past.\"   And that understandably appeals to people who want to make America great again.   But Democrats use the phrase too. President Barack Obama tried to pass what he called \"common sense gun reform.\"   Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., used it this year on her Fighting Oligarchy Tour with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.   \"I believe that in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, if a person gets sick, they shouldn't go bankrupt. Common sense,\" she told a crowd at Arizona State University in March.   One way to look at \"common sense\" is as an attempt to signal that a policy isn't extreme and could have broad appeal.   But as Luntz points out, it can also be a cudgel, especially in Trump's hands.   \"For him, common sense has an even broader meaning,\" he said. \"It's not just that you're right for the right reasons. It's also that the other side is wrong for being ideological, for being political or being outside the mainstream.\"   Rosenfeld has a similar take.   \"It's also potentially rather demagogic,\" she says of the phrase. \"Common sense also suggests not that there's another side to it. The other side in a debate with common sense is nonsense.\"   And in that sense and others, common sense can be considered one of the most powerful pieces of rhetoric the MAGA movement has found.   To Rosenfeld, Trump especially uses the phrase to try to excuse norm-shattering behavior — like a September social media post that Chicago was \"about to find out why it's called the Department of War.\"   \n   Here's how Trump explained that to a reporter: \"We're going to clean up our cities. We're going to clean them up so they don't kill five people every weekend. That's not war — that's common sense.\"   \"Common sense\" gives the impression of timeworn policy ideas, even if the policy — mass deployment of the National Guard into U.S. cities — was previously unthinkable.\n",

Without a fix, many federal employees will not be getting paid this Friday, the first full paycheck they'll miss as a result of the shutdown. By law federal workers are supposed to get back pay once the shutdown ends, but the White House has tried to cast doubt on that.   Meanwhile, President Trump has tied the shutdown to his overall goal of shrinking the size of the government, laying off workers en masse while it continues — and promising more — while specifically targeting what he calls \"Democrat programs.\"    \n   Read the latest on a case brought by some fired federal workers to pause the latest wave of shutdown layoffs.   As the shutdown drags on, here's the latest on what we know.      Jump to state-specific impacts.      Why did the federal government shut down?    A partisan argument over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces led to the current shutdown. Some 24 million people — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans.     Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the heath care of undocumented immigrants. That is not true.   Democrats in the Senate refused to vote for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP spending and tax bill that passed over the summer.    NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports that some Democrats say Nov. 1 could be a key date in talks to loosen the current gridlock. That date marks the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the ACA, when most states will send notices to subscribers laying out the cost of coverage without subsidies.   \n    In Vermont, where notices started going out on Oct. 15, for example, some families are facing increases of $25,000, according to Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt.    Read more about more about the health care fight behind the shutdown here.    Plus, why Democrats are casting the government shutdown as a health care showdown.   — Selena Simmons-Duffin, NPR      Will the military get paid on Oct. 29?     The Trump administration earlier this month found unused research and development funds to pay active military members, according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly. So they didn't miss a full paycheck, but it only covered one pay cycle. That was on Oct. 15; troops get paid every other Wednesday.    Military families are already seeking additional assistance from food banks and other groups to help with paying bills.      Are government workers being laid off during the shutdown?   The Trump administration has been following through on threats to further slash the size of government during the shutdown, seeking to layoff roughly 4,000 workers earlier this month. Some workers are fighting back in court; the judge overseeing the case issued a temporary restraining order directing the Trump administration to pause reduction in force (RIF) efforts that affect certain unionized employees.   Read more about the case and how the Trump administration has reacted to the temporary court order        What about WIC and SNAP benefits?   Funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) food program was estimated to run out after about two weeks. But USDA has distributed money from the previous fiscal year, helping at least some states continue to fund the program. The White House has said it will use tariff revenue to keep WIC afloat, though has provided few details. Trump's budget proposal earlier this year had looked to cut WIC funding.    Beyond WIC, the country's much larger food aid program — the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (or SNAP, previously known as food stamps) — is funded through October.    \n   That's because the debit-like cards people use to buy food are loaded a month in advance. USDA earlier this month told state agencies to hold off paying for November benefits for lack of sufficient funding, \"until further notice.\"   — Jennifer Ludden, NPR   And what about school lunches?   Some state agencies say they may not have the funds to reimburse schools providing free and low-cost meals.   Diane Pratt-Heavner, a spokesperson for the School Nutrition Association, says some agencies have told her organization they don't have the money to pay schools back for meals during the shutdown.   \"There is a strong commitment on both sides of the aisle to make sure that kids have access to healthy meals at school, so we are hopeful that the administration and Congress will act before this becomes an issue.\"   According to Pratt-Heavner, USDA released funds to regional offices for meals served in October. But some states report they have yet to receive any money, she said. Before the shutdown, USDA released a contingency plan outlining funds states could tap into to cover any gaps. A USDA spokesman did not directly answer NPR when asked if the agency would advance funding to state agencies should the shutdown persist.    — Kadin Mills, NPR      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A United States Postal Service (USPS) mail box stands in Manhattan on Aug. 5, 2020 in New York City. Mail services will not be affected by the government shutdown.\n                \n                    Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   USPS is 'open for business as usual'   \"U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted in the event of a government shutdown,\" according to a statement by USPS. The postal service is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual.      IRS furloughs nearly half its staff   A contingency plan from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS' approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees were issued reduction in force, or RIF, notices on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9.   \n   The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year's tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data.    — Scott Horsley, Andrea Hsu and Stephen Fowler, NPR      Teachers and schools won't be directly impacted, but federal education functions might   Eighty-seven percent of Department of Education employees have been temporary furloughed, as detailed in agency shutdown contingency plans.    At the same time, the administration is trying to use a new round of layoffs to gut multiple offices inside the department, including the Office for Civil Rights and the office responsible for overseeing special education, according to multiple sources within the department.    This latest reduction-in-force (RIF) cut at least 121 staffers responsible for overseeing roughly $15 billion in special education funding and for making sure states provide special education services to the nation's more than 7.5 million children with disabilities. According to multiple sources, the special education office is now left with just a handful of top executives and support staff.    In addition, many Department of Education employees who were furloughed were surprised to see a message blaming Democrats for the government shutdown inserted into their out-of-office replies. A federal workers union is suing the Trump administration for inserting the language into employees' out-of-office email messages.   — Shannon Bond and Cory Turner, NPR   The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 2026 went live as scheduled at the start of October. As WPR's Corrinne Hess reports, the U.S. Department of Education says that student financial aid programs will continue, despite the shutdown.      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Greg Freeman, a National Park Service ranger closes the entrance gate due to the government shutdown at the Everglades National Park Shark Valley on Oct. 1 in Florida. Shark Valley remains open to visitors who park outside the entrance gate and walk in, although with limited staffing.\n                \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   National Parks are a mixed bag   Across the country, the National Park Service (NPS) have brought their operations to a halt. That includes the National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities. NPR's Alana Wise reports that the Smithsonian assured the public that animals would still be cared for during the zoo's closure. Animal cams are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown.   \n   As KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported, a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails \"will generally remain accessible to visitors\" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided.   Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services.   Salem will be open through Halloween thanks to community support    WBUR's Andrea Shea reports that local leaders in Salem, Mass., learned a National Park Service visitor center and its bathrooms would be closed during their busiest tourist season so they took action on a plan to keep them open.    Shea reports that NPS agreed to let Salem reopen the center if the community covered costs through Halloween weekend. Annie Harris — CEO of the non-profit Essex Heritage that helps staff and run the facility — sent out a flurry of emails including to the mayor. Within 48 hours businesses and non-profits raised $18,000 — keeping the center open until Nov. 2.      Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue   Social Security, VA and other benefits will continue.    But employees at Social Security field offices earlier this month said the government shutdown has left them unable to carry out an important service for some recipients. As NPR's Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These official letters act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits.    In an Oct. 21 email to users answering commonly asked questions about how shutdown impacts, SSA noted the online portal can still be used to access benefit verification letters.   As NPR's Scott Horsley reports some furloughed employees at the Labor Department are coming back to work, in order to complete the September inflation report, which is a key ingredient used to calculate the cost of living adjustment that Social Security recipients will receive next year. The report will come come out on Friday, nine days late.    \n   Read more on how a fight over health policy led to the government shutdown from NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin.      ICE will mostly continue uninterrupted   Immigration cases and enforcement are proceeding as usual during the government shutdown, with a few small exceptions. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the employees in the Office of Detention Oversight, which inspects immigration detention centers, is currently not working. \"We hope Democrats will open up the government swiftly so that this office can resume its work,\" McLaughlin said.   According to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, DHS law enforcement, including ICE agents, will be paid for work done during the shutdown.   \"More than 70,000 sworn law enforcement officers across DHS including those serving in CBP, ICE, Secret Service, TSA and other critical mission areas will be paid for all hours worked during the shutdown period,\" Noem posted on X on Thursday. \"By Wednesday, October 22, law enforcement officers will receive a \"super check\" – which covers the 4 days lost, their overtime, and their next pay period.\"   The U.S. Coast Guard, which is housed within DHS, will continue to be paid, according to a post earlier this week from Noem, from funds appropriated in the reconciliation bill earlier this year.   — Ximena Bustillo, NPR      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                An air traffic control tower at the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport on Oct. 1 in Austin, Texas is seen following the federal government shutdown.\n                \n                    Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   If you're flying soon …   Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees are considered \"essential workers\" and have to stay on the job.   Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages disrupt flights across the country.    Air traffic controllers helped to end the last government shutdown, and could help end this one as well. A \"slight increase\" in sick leave at two facilities on the East Coast threw some major airports into chaos.   Read more on what a shortage of air traffic controllers could do to bring an end to the shutdown from NPR's Joel Rose.      \n   The impact of the shutdown looks different in different parts of the country   Some states across the country are uniquely positioned to feel the impact of the government shutdown. Reporters from the NPR Network are digging into the ways the government shutdown is playing out in their region.   Here's what we know so far about how the shutdown is affecting specific communities across the country:      Alaska   The U.S. Transportation Department says it has secured funding to continue the Essential Air Service program, subsidizing routes to 65 Alaska communities and more than an additional 100 communities nationwide, through Nov. 2. [Alaska Public Media]About 15,000 federal employees live in Alaska, one of the highest percentages of federal employees when compared with other states. President Trump's threat that federal employees could receive termination notices increases the uncertainty around how this crucial workforce to Alaska's economy could be affected. [Alaska Public Media]   \n   For more on the impact in Alaska, head to Alaska Public Media.      Arizona   Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs said she would not spend state funds to keep Grand Canyon National Park open should the government shutdown. [KJZZ] Social services in Grand Canyon Village are gearing up to support non-essential employees at Grand Canyon National Park, including food pantry resources. [KNAU]Sen. Ruben Gallego said the shutdown would also not affect federal relief money to communities in the Miami-Globe area after torrential monsoon rains caused flash flooding in the region [KJZZ]Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport joined a handful of other airports across the country that have refused to display a video from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blaming Democrats for the government shutdown. [KJZZ]      California   The shutdown of the federal government has brought the full or partial closure of many National Park Service sites across California: Muir Woods is fully closed. Alcatraz Island is slated to stay open. Other sites like Point Reyes National Seashore and Fort Point have partial closures, with some parking lots blocked or bathrooms locked. Even some park staff said they didn't learn the plan until Sept. 30 — the afternoon before the government shut down. Yosemite is open, but with lots of changes for visitors. [KQED]      Colorado   Sites and lands in Colorado operated by the National Park Service are open, but \"some services may be limited or unavailable,\" according to the agency's website. [Colorado Public Radio]In Colorado, the federal government employs thousands of workers at climate or land-management agencies. An EPA spokesperson told CPR News that the agency is operating under its shutdown plan, which would furlough thousands of employees. [Colorado Public Radio]Unemployment claims from Colorado's federal workers are surging amid the U.S. government shutdown. Stephanie Rogers, a Colorado-based microbiologist with the Food and Drug Administration, told CPR she filed for unemployment the day after the shutdown started. [Colorado Public Radio]   \n      Connecticut   Connecticut will continue federally funded food assistance programs for state residents during the government shutdown, Gov. Ned Lamont said on Wednesday. But he said the state's reserve money for SNAP, the food assistance program for low-income families, will run out by the end of the month. [WSHU]Connecticut has a $2.5 billion budget surplus this year — its second largest in history. Advocates are asking Lamont to consider using it to help offset the federal shortfall. [WSHU]      Georgia   For federal workers living paycheck to paycheck, one option to get through being furloughed could be filing for unemployment insurance, Georgia Labor Commissioner Barbara Rivera Holmes said. The employees will have to pay the benefits back once the shutdown ends and they receive back pay, but the benefits can help them make ends meet while they are not being paid. [GPB]Georgia farmers could also face delays in block grant funding and commodity data they rely on during the time-sentitive season of planting and harvesting. [NPR]      Kansas   If the federal government shutdown continues, the Mid-America Regional Council said it may need to temporarily close Head Start centers serving more than 2,300 Kansas City children beginning Nov. 1. [KCUR]Kansas farmers face several uncertainties, as payments from some federal programs are in limbo. In addition, nearly half of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's employees will be furloughed, and many offices will be closed. [KCUR]During the last two shutdowns, the USDA did not publish its monthly crop reports. This comes at an inconvenient time as Midwest farmers are in harvest season. [KCUR]   For more on the impact in Kansas City, head to KCUR.      Louisiana   The National Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP, is managed by FEMA and provides flood insurance to those who don't have a private option. It has grown in size as most homeowner's insurance policies across the U.S. have dropped flood damage entirely. It covers nearly half a million Louisianans. Policyholders with expiring contracts could lose coverage and funds to pay claims have dropped $30 billion due to the shutdown. [WWNO/WRKF]   For more on the impact in Louisiana, head to WWNO/WRKF.      Illinois   Three workers who spoke with the Chicago Sun-Times said they haven't been furloughed, but they've dealt with uncertainties and fragmented coordination since the federal government shut down Oct. 1 on top of a year of uncertainty. [Chicago Public Media]      Maine   Even though much of the staff of Acadia National Park in Maine has been furloughed, it was a popular weekend at the park. [Maine Public]       Minnesota   Thousands of Minnesotans might not receive federal food aid benefits if the government shutdown continues into November, as federal officials have told states that funding for SNAP benefits is running out. [MPR News]      Missouri   Families enrolled in the Missouri WIC program — which provides supplemental food, nutrition education and support to low-income women and children — will not be immediately impacted by the shutdown. [St. Louis Public Radio]The Gateway Arch and Old Courthouse in downtown St. Louis are temporarily closed, with National Park Service work largely on hold. [St. Louis Public Radio]      New Hampshire   There are more than 5,000 civilian federal employees in New Hampshire, at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, the Manchester VA Medical Center, the White Mountain National Forest, the Berlin federal prison, the passport processing center at Pease and at other federal agencies. How the shutdown might affect them isn't entirely clear. [NHPR]The White Mountain National Forest will remain open, but some say earlier staff cuts are hampering critical activities. Firefighting and disaster response activities will also continue, according to federal officials. [NHPR]On Oct. 7, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., the veteran appropriator who has helped broker past bipartisan deals, told NPR, she has been working behind the scenes with senators from both parties to \"find common ground.\" [NPR]   For more on the impact in New Hampshire, head to NHPR.      North Dakota   The state-owned Bank of North Dakota is partnering with local banks and credit unions to provide short-term low interest loans to federal government employees and members of the armed services stationed in North Dakota, if they experience financial hardship because of the federal government shutdown. [Prairie Public]   For more on the impact in North Dakota, head to Prairie Public.      Oklahoma   With the federal government shut down, National Park rangers are not present at the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum. Victims, family members and first responders are stepping in to educate visitors on the location's story.⁠ [KOSU]      Oregon   The federal government program used to subsidize commercial flights in Pendleton got a last-minute reprieve from grinding to a halt due to the partial government shutdown. But as of Wednesday, immediate answers on how that might affect Eastern Oregon's only commercial airport are in short supply. The municipally operated Eastern Oregon Regional Airport in Pendleton holds the only Essential Air Service (EAS) contract in the state, a federal program that helps rural airports operate. [OPB]      Pennsylvania   Tens of thousands of Pennsylvania-based federal workers furloughed during the government shutdown may be eligible for unemployment compensation through the state Department of Labor & Industry. [WITF]      Tennessee   On Oct. 7, the FAA notified local officials in Nashville that flights in and out of Nashville International Airport (BNA) would be reduced Tuesday afternoon due to a shortage of air traffic controllers during the government shutdown. Nashville's airport was back to normal by Wednesday morning. [WLPN]      Texas   U.S. Customs and Border Protection employees who inspect cargo at the 32 other official ports of entry are among the essential federal workers who must remain on the job unpaid. The longer the shutdown lasts, the greater the risk of cargo backups at these Texas ports due to unpaid employees calling in sick. [Houston Public Media]      Utah   In Ogden, Utah, about 10 percent works for the IRS, and when federal workers stop getting paychecks, impacts are felt quickly and broadly. (KUER)      Washington   On Oct. 6, state officials say they have enough to cover WIC for the next two weeks. Seattle and King County have partnered to dedicate nearly $2 million to provide one-time vouchers to an estimated 30,000 clients in King County who rely on WIC. [KUOW]The Employment Security Department says the 80,000 federal workers in Washington State may qualify for unemployment benefits. [OPB]      Wyoming   On Oct. 3, Gov. Mark Gordon said Wyoming will cover gaps in funding to federally funded state employees who are in the state budget \"in the short-term.\" [Wyoming Public Media]   For more on the impact in Wyoming, head to Wyoming Public Media.

Today's top stories   Vice President JD Vance is in Israel, where he is set to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Gaza ceasefire has been in place for almost two weeks. Vance says the deal is continuing to progress despite the fighting between Israel and Hamas over the weekend. The vice president, along with several other U.S. officials in Israel, is working to get the two sides to take the next steps under the deal.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Vice President JD Vance gestures as he departs a press conference following a military briefing at the Civilian Military Coordination Center in southern Israel on Oct. 21. Vance is expected to meet top US Middle East envoys and military experts monitoring the fragile US-brokered ceasefire in Gaza.\n                \n                    Fadel Senna/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Fadel Senna/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 The next phase of the ceasefire poses challenges as Gaza doesn't have a government, and it isn't clear when it will have one, NPR's Greg Myre tells Up First. Vance says other things, like getting the people of Gaza food, medicine and security, should happen first. Other big issues that need to be addressed are the next phase's calls for Hamas to disarm, Israeli troops to pull back and international troops to take their place in Gaza as a stabilization force. To work on these priorities, U.S. troops built a civilian-military coordination center outside of Gaza for officials from the U.S. and other countries, as well as other organizations working in Gaza, so that they can synchronize efforts.   \n   Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries believes that public pressure will intensify on Republicans in the coming days to extend health insurance subsidies, which are a key sticking point in the shutdown fight. The federal government remains shut down after the Senate failed to pass a spending bill again on Monday. Congressional leaders continue to avoid negotiating an end to the shutdown. The White House has attempted to end the standoff between the two sides by threatening Democrats with more cuts to spending and the workforce.    🎧 President Trump has praised Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought for cutting \"Democrat priorities\" that the party will not get back. The president has repeatedly referred to \"Democrat programs,\" but NPR's Stephen Fowler says there are no such things, because the federal employees who process Social Security payments and handle taxes work in a nonpartisan manner. Vought has announced plans to cancel grants for energy projects in Democratic-led cities and states and other efforts to make Democrats feel the fiscal impact. The off-year elections are on Nov. 4, and they could reflect voter discontent with Republican governance, including the shutdown, Fowler says.   Images of an excavator demolishing the facade of the East Wing of the White House went viral this week. The construction marks the groundbreaking for the president's $250 million ballroom project. Trump has wanted to build the ballroom for more than a decade, but not everyone is pleased with the developments, and historic preservation groups are expressing concerns.    \n   🎧 The demolition has taken many people by surprise because Trump downplayed the impacts when he announced the project in July, says NPR's Tamara Keith. The National Capital Planning Commission would typically have a role in approving a project like this, but it is currently not operating due to the government shutdown. Trump says he is funding some of the ballroom project, and other donors include major corporations with business before the government, Keith says. Google is donating over $20 million to settle a civil suit that Trump filed. Watchdogs say this is one of many reasons the project is an ethical red flag.

She wrote about how the Democratic Party's internal dysfunction led to its downfall during the 2024 presidential election. Before her new book hit store shelves, Morning Edition host Michel Martin sat down with Jean-Pierre. During their conversation, Jean-Pierre reflected on her decision to leave the party she once represented and the scrutiny she faced in her role as press secretary. Watch their interview here.

So far, House leaders have not scheduled a vote. The Senate has. Senators today consider two health policy plans each aimed at reducing health care costs for those who buy their insurance on HealthCare.gov. In a moment, we will speak with one of the senators who will be voting Democrat Jeanne Shaheen. First, we have the facts.MARTIN: NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin is here to explain. Good morning, Selena.SELENA SIMMONS-DUFFIN, BYLINE: Good morning, Michel.MARTIN: So, Selena, you met somebody who illustrates the dilemma here for the vast majority of the 24 million people who get their health insurance through the exchange. Tell me about her.SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Yeah. Her name is Ellen Allen (ph). She lives near Charleston, West Virginia, and I first talked to her over the summer. She's 64 years old. She was raiding her retirement savings to prepare for a huge increase in her premium. And when I reached her yesterday, she told me she'd enrolled in a plan.ELLEN ALLEN: The bronze plan without vision and dental, with a monthly premium of $1,967.50SIMMONS-DUFFIN: So her premium for 2026 is four times this year's premium, nearly $1,500 more every single month for a plan that covers less.MARTIN: So that's going to happen unless Congress steps in and changes the law. So what could that look like?SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Senate Democrats are expected to vote on a bill today that would extend the enhanced subsidies that were bringing costs down for three years. The bill would also extend open enrollment until May and do several other things, like allowing automatic renewals and renewing funding for people who help you sign up. Republicans don't like this plan. They say it's too expensive. It's driving health care costs up. And they point to reports of fraud to say the whole system is flawed.MARTIN: So it seems like the Republicans took a while to coalesce around an alternative, but they did. What's their idea?SIMMONS-DUFFIN: This bill would not address those rising premium costs directly. It would instead put taxpayer dollars into health savings accounts for some enrollees - a thousand dollars a year for people under age 50 and $1,500 for people between 50 and 64. That money could not go towards premiums, but it could go to other kinds of health expenses like copays or over-the-counter medications, and it would also prohibit abortion coverage in Obamacare and prevent Medicaid from covering gender affirming care for transgender people of any age. Democrats don't like this bill at all, and neither does Ellen Allen.ALLEN: A thousand or $1,500. I mean, I understand that's not a monthly contribution.SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Correct.ALLEN: Yeah. That's nothing. That is - that's insulting. I mean, how stupid do they think the American people are?MARTIN: OK. That plan does seem to fit with what President Trump has said he wants, though - sending money to people, but not the insurance companies.SIMMONS-DUFFIN: True. But Republicans would be putting way less taxpayer money into it, about $10 billion into health savings accounts, versus approximately 35 billion towards enhanced subsidies. So it's not just a different delivery system. It's also a big funding cut.MARTIN: What are you expecting to happen today?SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Well, there is a super small Republican majority in the Senate, and these bills would need 60 votes to pass. Neither side is likely to reach that threshold, which is not good for people who are navigating open enrollment right now and were hoping for some relief. Polling suggests these enhanced subsidies are quite popular across party lines. So Congress may keep working on this. I do not think that these votes today are going to be the end of the story.MARTIN: That is NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin. Selena, thank you.SIMMONS-DUFFIN: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

Michel Martin speaks with an accessibility design expert about why fonts matter.   \n\n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  This is a story about a font, the style of a text that appears on a printed page or digital screen. The State Department's official font is the latest front in the Trump administration's war on diversity and inclusion efforts. Former Secretary of State Antony Blinken ordered official documents to be printed in Calibri. It's considered more reader-friendly. But according to Reuters and others, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the department's switch to this font was a wasteful diversity move. And Rubio has ordered a return to Times New Roman, which he said would, quote, \"restore decorum and professionalism to the department's written work,\" unquote. For more on this, we've called Professor Kristen Shinohara. She leads the Center for Accessibility and Inclusion Research Lab at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Good morning, Professor. Thanks so much for joining us.KRISTEN SHINOHARA: Good morning. Thank you so much for having me.MARTIN: What is the difference between Calibri and Times New Roman?SHINOHARA: Yeah. The main difference is the serif, which is the little flourish that's at the end of the text that can help you to tell the difference between letters like a capital I versus a lowercase L. Times New Roman has that serif and Calibri doesn't. This is the broader general differences between the two.MARTIN: And so why do people say that Calibri is more accessible? Like, what makes a font more accessible?SHINOHARA: Sure. Accessibility of a font really depends on legibility. So how can you tell the difference between those letters and how readable it is. So how generally it is easy to read it. It also includes things like font size, color, spacing between letters and lines. And this matters because it impacts the ability for people to be able to read and understand texts. This impact can be more severe for people with learning or reading disabilities like dyslexia or for people with low vision.MARTIN: So when deciding on a font type for a professional setting like, you know, the Department of State, are there certain criteria that are used to choose one font type over another?SHINOHARA: Generally, it's going to be those characteristics that I talked about, like font size and color and also spacing. So there are different things that people are considering about whether or not a text is easier to read or not and how much it might lend itself towards being or making that content more accessible to a general reading audience.MARTIN: So as we said that this decision by the Trump administration, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, reverses the change made by the former secretary of state. You know, that move in 2023 - I was looking this up - made headlines. Like, there was a whole - there were whole stories about people grumbling about it. Why do you think people get so worked up about a font?SHINOHARA: Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of personal attachment to certain kinds of fonts that people might use. But when we're thinking about changing fonts for accessibility, the broader goal is to make these technologies and user interfaces easier to use. And so switching might feel a little bit jarring, but ultimately, it's going to focus on making these more accessible for people with disabilities and for people to use in different contexts.MARTIN: And do you have an opinion about this? Do you have a personal opinion about this?SHINOHARA: I don't know if I have a personal opinion about fonts specifically. But I do think that generally, in my field, accessibility focuses towards making these things more usable for people with disabilities, with the additional benefit of other people without disabilities also finding things easier to read. So not following these recommendations can really make content difficult to understand for many people, and this ultimately risks excluding more people from accessing information.MARTIN: That is Kristen Shinohara. She's a professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Professor Shinohara, thanks so much for sharing these insights with us.SHINOHARA: Thank you so much for having me.(SOUNDBITE OF LUDLOW'S \"TIME NEW ROMAN (FULL BAND VERSION)\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio directed diplomats around the world to switch from Calibri to Times New Roman 14-point font in all official documents, starting on Wednesday, the State Department said in a statement to NPR. The difference between the two fonts comes down to a few finishing strokes.   \"Whether for internal memoranda, papers prepared for principals, or documents shared externally, consistent formatting strengthens credibility and supports a unified Department identity,\" the statement said.   \n   Times New Roman had been the State Department's official font for nearly two decades, from 2004 until 2023.   According to the Associated Press, Rubio said in a cable sent to U.S. embassies and consulates that the 2023 change, implemented by then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken, was part of misguided diversity, equity and inclusion policies.   Calibri is a sans serif font, meaning it doesn't have the decorative tops and tails at the ends of letters that serif fonts like Times New Roman do.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Times New Roman is a serif font, with decorative flourishes, while the sans-serif Calibri can be easier to read.\n                \n                    NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Those little flourishes can make the lettering harder to read, says Kristen Shinohara, who leads the Center for Accessibility and Inclusion Research at the Rochester Institute of Technology.   \"This impact can be more severe for people with learning or reading disabilities like dyslexia or for people with low vision,\" she told NPR's Morning Edition.   The Americans with Disabilities Act requires sans-serif fonts on physical signage and display screens because of their relative legibility. At the same time, serif fonts like Times New Roman remain the norm in print newspapers, books, legal documents and more.   \n   \"Times New Roman specifically, and serif fonts generally, are more formal and professional,\" the State Department statement said. It did not respond to NPR's questions about reduced accessibility.   Times New Roman was designed specifically for the British newspaper The Times in the 1920s and quickly became the favored typeface for many other publications. It was also the default font of Microsoft programs like Word beginning in the 1990s until it was replaced by Calibri — which was designed with screens in mind — in 2007.   \n   Microsoft replaced Calibri with a sans-serif font called Aptos in 2023. The company wrote in a blog post at the time that Aptos' designer, Steve Matteson, wanted the font to have \"the universal appeal of the late NPR newscaster Carl Kasell and the astute tone of The Late Show host Stephen Colbert.\"   Small lettering, bigger patterns   Rubio's memo describes the 2023 change to Calibri as \"another wasteful DEIA program\" and says it did not lead to a meaningful reduction in the department's accessibility-based document remediation cases, according to copies obtained by Reuters and The Associated Press.   The Trump administration has made no secret of its disdain for its predecessor's focus on diversity, equity and inclusion.   \n   Trump has issued numerous executive orders dismantling DEI initiatives in federal agencies, the foreign service, federal contracts and more. His administration put pressure on universities and public schools, threatening to withhold federal funding from those that have DEI programs, though a judge struck down some of those efforts in August. And growing anti-DEI backlash has also resulted in scores of private companies scaling back their own such initiatives.   During his tenure at the State Department, Rubio has already abolished offices and initiatives meant to foster inclusion and diversity, both in D.C. and abroad.   The State Department statement says the return to Times New Roman better aligns with Trump's \"One Voice for America's Foreign Relations\" directive from February, by underscoring its \"responsibility to present a unified, professional voice in all communications.\"   \n   It also fits into the Trump administration's broader fixation on aesthetics, from his gilded Oval Office redesign to his proposal of a classically-styled D.C. arch to mark the nation's 250th birthday to his August executive order mandating that new federal buildings prioritize classical and traditional architectural styles.   And well before the Trump administration started specifying federal agencies' fonts, it was restricting the words they could use.   The Health and Human Services Department removed entire webpages devoted to topics like LGBTQ health and HIV, while the Department of Energy instructed employees to avoid using terms including \"climate change\" and \"sustainable.\" Just this week, court filings emerged showing the administration's six-page list of words the federal Head Start programs cannot use, including \"disability,\" \"race\" and \"women.\"\n",

Then-candidate Donald Trump seized on the moment and vowed to lower prices for American consumers, beating his eventual Democratic rival Kamala Harris in part with a winning economic message.   Now it's President Trump who's trying to persuade the public that the state of the economy is sound, after prices rose 3% in the 12 months ending in September and with consumers spending less on big-ticket items.    Betsey Stevenson, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan, says making that argument could be a tall order in the face of rising costs for a number of goods and services.   \n   \"My personal takeaway from the experience we had [in 2024] was that you can't tell people that prices aren't up when they're up,\" she said.   \n   While the prices of some items such as gasoline have fallen on Trump's watch, the overall cost of living has continued to climb. For example, grocery costs are up 2.7% for the year ending in September and electricity costs have jumped more than 5%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.   \"Trump's claims about inflation are false,\" Stevenson said, \"and you can go to the grocery store and see it yourself.\"   But, in a wide-ranging speech to supporters on Tuesday, Trump both defended his administration's track record on the economy and said that talk of affordability was overblown. Trump told the crowd in Mount Pocono, Pa., that he believed the term \"affordability\" was a \"hoax\" perpetrated by Democrats. Trump's recent assertions dismissing inflation are not backed by official government economic data.   Consumers are feeling high prices firsthand   While it's true that inflation hit a 9% high during the summer of 2022 under the Biden administration, that was during the pandemic and it dropped significantly after that. Inflation dipped to an annual rate of 3% in January during Biden's final month in office, the same rate it was in September under Trump.   \n   Now many voters are questioning how well Trump is tackling the stubbornly high costs of everyday items. Some 57% of voters said in a Harvard CAPS/Harris poll released this week that Trump was \"losing the battle against inflation,\" while 68% of respondents to a AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll from October said the economy was poor or very poor.   Voters' souring attitudes on the Trump administration's handling of the economy come less than a year before the U.S. midterm elections, in which Republicans will aim to maintain their majorities in both houses of Congress. But in a warning sign for the GOP, November's odd-year races saw Democrats who campaigned on affordability win major contests in New York City, Virginia and New Jersey.   Political consultant and pollster Frank Luntz says Trump risks appearing out of touch if he continues to claim that affordability is a \"hoax\" when Americans feel like they're paying more — and actually do pay more.   \"When you talk about affordability, it is all perception,\" Luntz told NPR's Morning Edition. \"The greatest danger is if you tell people happy days are here again, and it's 1929,\" he added, referencing the beginning of the Great Depression.   \n   Luntz added that Trump blaming Biden for the failures of the economy may have worked during the campaign season and even for some time after.   \"That said, it's now a year since the election, and the public does expect this administration to take charge. At a certain point, they will not accept the blame game,\" he said.   Trump's tariffs are contributing to inflation   But getting inflation to slow down or prices to drop will be easier said than done for the Trump administration, which has embraced economic policies such as tariffs that force prices upward, according to Stevenson. Trump and other administration officials have argued that tariffs are necessary to correct past global trade policies that have been unfair to the U.S. and to bring back domestic manufacturing.   \n   Although tariffs are raising about $30 billion per month in revenue for U.S. coffers, the new import taxes levied by the Trump administration have increased prices on a number of items, from food to clothing to furniture.   \n   \"What I find surprising is that he's out there telling people: 'This isn't happening. This is a con job. There's no affordability problem,'\" Stevenson said. \"At the same time, he's pursuing policies that are purposefully restricting supply, which every person who has taken even an introductory economics course knows will push up prices.\"   Still, the administration has taken several steps recently to ease the negative effects of tariffs on U.S. consumers and producers. Last month, Trump scrapped the tariffs on certain products that aren't widely produced in the U.S., such as bananas and coffee. And on Monday the administration announced that it was making $12 billion in one-time payments to U.S. farmers to offset their rising business costs.\n",

Both parties are under pressure to address health care costs before the expiration of federal subsidies meant to lower the cost of premiums on ACA plans. Those subsidies expire at the end of 2025 and are expected to cause prices to skyrocket.   Both bills needed 60 votes to advance, but neither succeeded.    \n   The Republican-backed plan failed by a vote of 51 to 48. The measure, authored by Bill Cassidy, R-La., and Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, would have provided up to $1,500 a year in payments for health savings accounts for Americans earning less than 700% of the federal poverty level.   However the bill would not have extended the ACA tax credits and the money could not be used to pay for health care premiums. Deductibles for those plans average around $7,000, according to data from the health policy organization KFF.   Democrats rejected the bill arguing it did nothing to address health care premiums, and opposed restrictions in the bill on abortion and gender affirming care.   \"The Republican plan is a when you get sick, you go broke plan plain and simple,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, said ahead of the vote.    In a trade-off to reopen the government following the longest shutdown in U.S. history, Senate Republicans promised Democrats a vote on a bill of their choosing to extend the subsidies. Democrats proposed a three-year extension of existing federal subsidies, but that measure failed 51 to 48. Four Republicans joined with Democrats: Susan Collins of Maine, Missouri's Josh Hawley, and Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska.    Republicans have argued that extending the subsidies would allow what they describe as Obamacare \"waste, fraud and abuse\" to continue, while lining the pockets of insurance companies.   \n   \"There is nothing in their [Democrats] bill that stops billions of dollars in fraudulent spending,\" Cassidy said on the Senate floor Wednesday.   The failed votes on Thursday left the future of the ACA subsidies even further in doubt. GOP leaders in the House are signaling a potential vote in coming days on legislation to address health care costs, but the party has yet to coalesce behind a plan.    Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said that starting next week, the House would begin voting \"on bills that will focus on lowering premiums for 100% of Americans.\"    \"Let's see where Democrats stand when it's not just giving money to insurance companies and propping up failed Obamacare plans,\" Scalise said.    The fight over the subsidies has once again exposed a split inside the GOP over how to control rising healthcare costs — a debate that has snarled the party since the ACA first passed in 2010.   While some Republicans say they are prepared to watch the subsidies lapse, others have joined with Democrats to press for an extension. In the House, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., has partnered with Jared Golden, D-Maine, on a plan to extend the credits for two years while imposing new eligibility requirements. A separate plan from Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., and Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., would extend the subsidies for one year. The bill has more than a dozen Republican cosponsors.    Both proposals were filed through a rare legislative tactic known as a discharge petition — a workaround that lets members force a vote without the approval of leadership or committees if they can first secure 218 signatures in support.   For his part, President Trump has largely remained hands off. He has been sharply critical of the ACA subsidies, and while he has not endorsed a specific proposal he has voiced support for sending money directly to Americans to pay for care. \n",

Today's top stories   The Senate is set to vote today on two health policy plans — one from Democrats and one from Republicans — aimed at reducing costs for individuals purchasing health insurance on Healthcare.gov. Meanwhile, some House Republicans want to force a vote to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act, which are set to expire in less than three weeks. They warn that Republican leaders risk losing voters and the majority if they let the subsidies expire without a replacement.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The dome of the U.S. Capitol Building is visible on the Hill in Washington, DC.\n                \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Win McNamee/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Republicans hold a small Senate majority, and because the bills need 60 votes to pass, NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin tells Up First that neither option will likely move forward. This is unwelcome news for people who are currently navigating open enrollment and are hoping for some relief. Simmons-Duffin spoke with Ellen Allen of Charleston, W.Va., yesterday, who said she enrolled in a bronze plan without vision and dental coverage. This plan costs Allen a monthly premium of $1,967.50, which is four times this year's cost for a plan that covers less. Polling suggests that the enhanced subsidies are quite popular across party lines, according to Simmons-Duffin. She predicts it's unlikely the votes will be the end of the story, and that Congress may continue to work toward a solution.   \n   The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point yesterday in a 9-3 vote. The Fed made its decision in an effort to support the weakening job market. Stubborn inflation and delayed economic data complicated the decision-making process. The rate cut came as a relief to investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped nearly 500 points.    🎧 Fed policymakers say in updated forecasts that they expect to cut interest rates just once more in 2026. Inflation has come down significantly, but it still remains above the Fed's 2% target, according to NPR's Scott Horsley. The president's tariffs have pushed up the price of imported goods. Although Fed officials don't believe tariffs will have a long-lasting effect on inflation, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell says they are not taking any chances. Powell says the best way to help with affordability is not only to get inflation down but also to ensure a robust job market.   President Trump said yesterday that U.S. forces seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela. Attorney General Pam Bondi released a video showing what appear to be U.S. forces and the Coast Guard rappelling from a helicopter onto the tanker. Congress is demanding answers about U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats, particularly in regards to a Sept. 2 incident where the military killed two men who survived initial strikes. Adm. Alvin Holsey, who oversaw the strikes, is stepping down this week.    \n   🎧 Officials have not provided many details publicly about Holsey's departure, but it is unusual for a top commander to leave one year into a typical three-year assignment, Steve Walsh of NPR network station WHRO says. Holsey appeared in a closed-door meeting before lawmakers this week to address concerns about the ongoing boat strikes. Reports hint that he was diplomatic in his messaging, Walsh says. Meanwhile, lawmakers' concerns remain as they continue to demand video of the Sept. 2 strike and the administration's legal rationale for carrying out around 22 strikes on alleged drug boats, which have killed 87 people.   Today's listen   \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n   As 2025 winds down, it's time to crank up the jams and celebrate the year's top music. NPR's Music team got the party started by tackling the biggest question: What were the best albums of the year? While one album snagged the coveted spot of NPR Music's No. 1 album of 2025, the team didn't stop there.

But overhunting and habitat loss have led to their decline over the decades. Now, black bear sightings have increased in the state, and researchers believe their populations are growing elsewhere as well. While West Texas is celebrating the bears' return, their presence has posed challenges and concerns as they venture into neighborhoods, enter yards and threaten livestock and pets. Here's how some states are coping:    🐻 In states like Montana and Colorado, residents install bear-resistant dumpsters and trash bins. In some cases, they may use alarm systems or sprinklers to try to startle bears.🐻 Wildlife biologists stress that residents should remove food and anything that could attract hungry bears to their area.🐻 Biologists are also working to prepare people to live with black bears and educate them in the hope of reducing bear-human conflicts.   \n   3 things to know before you go   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Involution, an obscure term used in agricultural economics, leapt from the pages of academia into the Chinese meme world, then became part of Chinese government policymaking.\n                \n                    Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"Involution,\" an obscure term used in agricultural economics, is NPR's \"Word of the Week.\" Here's how it leaped from academia into Chinese meme culture — and how it ultimately influenced government policymaking.This week's Far-Flung Postcard series takes you to a food stand in the one-horse town of Marikavalasa in India, where working women go to enjoy a treat and unwind in the evening before returning to the grind.Sophie Kinsella, the author of the massively popular Shopaholic book series, has died at the age of 55.

Warner Brothers agreed to an $83 billion sale to Netflix, but that deal is not finalized. And now Paramount Skydance — owned by Larry Ellison, one of the world's richest people, and his son David Ellison, founder of Skydance Media — is pursuing the company through a hostile takeover.   Warren said Paramount Skydance's effort raises added concerns, given the Ellisons' ties to President Trump and foreign investors.   She warned the deal could leave \"one person who basically decides what movies are going to be made, what you're going to get to see on your streaming service, and how much you're going to have to pay for it.\" Warren also raised questions about whether news could be \"controlled by a political ally of the President.\"   \n   Listen to the full interview by clicking play on the blue box above.

The U.S. has built up the largest military presence in the region in decades and launched a series of deadly strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean. The campaign is facing growing scrutiny from Congress.   \"We've just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela, a large tanker, very large, largest one ever seized, actually,\" Trump told reporters at the White House, later adding that \"it was seized for a very good reason.\"   \n   Trump did not offer additional details. When asked what would happen to the oil aboard the tanker, Trump said, \"Well, we keep it, I guess.\"   The seizure was led by the U.S. Coast Guard and supported by the Navy, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official added that it was conducted under U.S. law enforcement authority.   Storming the oil tanker   The Coast Guard members were taken to the oil tanker by helicopter from the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, the official said. The Ford is in the Caribbean Sea after arriving last month in a major show of force, joining a fleet of other warships.   \n   Video posted to social media by Attorney General Pam Bondi shows people fast-roping from one of the helicopters involved in the operation as it hovers just feet from the deck.   The Coast Guard members can be seen later in the video moving throughout the superstructure of the ship with their weapons drawn.   Bondi wrote that \"for multiple years, the oil tanker has been sanctioned by the United States due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations.\"   \n   Venezuela's government said in a statement that the seizure \"constitutes a blatant theft and an act of international piracy.\"   \"Under these circumstances, the true reasons for the prolonged aggression against Venezuela have finally been revealed. … It has always been about our natural resources, our oil, our energy, the resources that belong exclusively to the Venezuelan people,\" the statement said.   Half of ship's oil is tied to Cuban importer   The U.S. official identified the seized tanker as the Skipper.   The ship departed Venezuela around Dec. 2 with about 2 million barrels of heavy crude, roughly half of it belonging to a Cuban state-run oil importer, according to documents from the state-owned company Petróleos de Venezuela S.A., commonly known as PDVSA, that were provided on the condition of anonymity because the person did not have permission to share them.   The Skipper was previously known as the M/T Adisa, according to ship tracking data. The Adisa was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2022 over accusations of belonging to a sophisticated network of shadow tankers that smuggled crude oil on behalf of Iran's Revolutionary Guard and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.   The network was reportedly run by a Switzerland-based Ukrainian oil trader, the U.S. Treasury Department said at the time.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                This image from video posted on Attorney General Pam Bondi's X account, and partially redacted by the source, shows an oil tanker being seized by U.S. forces off the coast of Venezuela, Wednesday, Dec. 10, 2025.\n                \n                    AP/Pentagon\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        AP/Pentagon\n    \n\n   \n   Hitting Venezuela's sanctioned oil business   Venezuela has the world's largest proven oil reserves and produces about 1 million barrels a day.   PDVSA is the backbone of the country's economy. Its reliance on intermediaries increased in 2020, when the first Trump administration expanded its maximum-pressure campaign on Venezuela with sanctions that threaten to lock out of the U.S. economy any individual or company that does business with Maduro's government. Longtime allies Russia and Iran, both also sanctioned, have helped Venezuela skirt restrictions.   The transactions usually involve a complex network of shadowy intermediaries. Many are shell companies, registered in jurisdictions known for secrecy. The buyers deploy so-called ghost tankers that hide their location and hand off their valuable cargoes in the middle of the ocean before they reach their final destination.   \n   Maduro did not address the seizure during a speech before a ruling-party organized demonstration in Caracas, Venezuela's capital. But he told supporters that the country is \"prepared to break the teeth of the North American empire if necessary.\"   Maduro has insisted the real purpose of the U.S. military operations is to force him from office.   Democrat says the move is about 'regime change'   Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the U.S. seizing the oil tanker cast doubt on the administration's stated reasons for the military buildup and boat strikes.   \"This shows that their whole cover story — that this is about interdicting drugs — is a big lie,\" the senator said. \"This is just one more piece of evidence that this is really about regime change — by force.\"   Vincent P. O'Hara, a naval historian and author of \"The Greatest Naval War Ever Fought,\" called the seizure \"very unusual\" and \"provocative.\" Noting that the action will probably deter other ships from the Venezuela coastline, he said, \"If you have no maritime traffic or access to that, then you have no economy.\"   \n   The seizure comes a day after the U.S. military flew a pair of fighter jets over the Gulf of Venezuela in what appeared to be the closest that warplanes had come to the South American country's airspace. Trump has said land attacks are coming soon but has not offered more details.   The Trump administration is facing increasing scrutiny from lawmakers over the boat strike campaign, which has killed at least 87 people in 22 known strikes since early September, including a follow-up strike that killed two survivors clinging to the wreckage of a boat after the first hit.   Some legal experts and Democrats say that action may have violated the laws governing the use of deadly military force.   \n   Lawmakers are demanding to get unedited video from the strikes, but Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told congressional leaders at a classified briefing Tuesday that he was still weighing whether to release it.   The Coast Guard referred a request for comment about the tanker seizure to the White House.\n",

This is shameful.\"   Homendy said the NTSB \"vehemently\" opposes a section in the massive National Defense Authorization Act that would roll back safety improvements that were recommended by the agency after the collision of a military Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines regional jet near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, killing 67 people.   After the crash, the Defense Department agreed to require military aircraft to broadcast their position using a technology known as ADS-B. But the NTSB warns the bill's language would create exemptions to the policy — in effect, recreating conditions that were in place at the time of the DCA collision, which was the nation's deadliest aviation disaster in more than 20 years.   \n   \"We should be working together in partnership to prevent the next accident, not inviting history to repeat itself by recreating the same conditions that were in place on January 29th,\" Homendy said.   Homendy laid out the NTSB's concerns in a letter to the chairman and ranking member of both the House Armed Services Committees and the Senate Committee on Armed Services. She said no legislators had approached her during the drafting of the NDAA, and she did not know who added the provision in question.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A crane removes airplane wreckage from the Potomac River, where American Airlines flight 5342 collided with a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter, near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Va., on February 3, 2025. All 67 people on both aircraft died.\n                \n                    Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   In a statement, the committee leaders defended the language in the bill.    \"We all care deeply about and are fully committed to ensuring aviation safety,\" said U.S. Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Ranking Member Jack Reed (D-RI), House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-AL) and Ranking Member Adam Smith (D-Wash.) in the statement.    \n   They say the bill would require any helicopter conducting training missions around Washington, D.C. would have to provide warning of its position to aircraft in the area (though it does not specifically require the use of ADS-B), and that the Secretary of a military department would need to receive concurrence from the Secretary of Transportation prior to waiving this requirement.   Still, some lawmakers on Capitol Hill share the NTSB's concerns.   \"As drafted, the NDAA protects the status quo, allowing military aircraft to keep flying in DC airspace under different rules and with outdated transmission requirements,\" said a joint statement from Senators Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), the leaders of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. \"This comes as Pentagon data shows a spike in military aircraft accidents since 2020. The families of the victims deserve accountability.\"   \n   The senators urged their colleagues in Congress to instead adopt the bipartisan ROTOR Act, which would require aircraft operators to equip their fleets with ADS-B technology and limit exemptions for military helicopters.   Family members of the victims of American Airlines Flight 5342 also expressed concern about the language in the NDAA.   \"The flying public and all those that utilize our airspace deserve better than what this bill provides,\" said Tim and Sheri Lilley, whose son, Sam, was the first officer of Flight 5342, in a statement. \"Congress now has a choice: strengthen this provision and protect the traveling public or leave in place the same vulnerabilities that have already cost too many people their lives.\"\n",

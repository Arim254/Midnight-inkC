The indictment alleges that, starting in 1999, the defendants partnered with international drug trafficking organizations to ultimately transport thousands of tons of cocaine into the United States.   Maduro and his wife \"will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,\" Bondi wrote in an earlier post on X.    \n   \n            Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, have been indicted in the Southern District of New York.  Nicolas Maduro has been charged with Narco-Terrorism Conspiracy, Cocaine Importation Conspiracy, Possession of Machineguns and Destructive Devices, and Conspiracy to Possess…— Attorney General Pamela Bondi (@AGPamBondi) January 3, 2026\n   \n   The new indictment adds to charges from the first Trump administration, when the U.S. Justice Department announced a federal indictment against Maduro in March 2020.    \n   That indictment alleged that Maduro was the leader of the Cartel de los Soles, and that he and other defendants took part in a narco-terrorism conspiracy with the Colombian guerrilla group known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).   Prosecutors said that the Cartel de los Soles was made up of high-ranking Venezuelan officials who abused the Venezuelan people and corrupted the nation's institutions to import large quantities of cocaine into the United States.   According to the 2020 indictment, Maduro helped manage and ultimately lead the Cartel de los Soles, which sought to get rich and flood the U.S. with cocaine, allegedly using the drug as a weapon against the United States.   Prosecutors said that Maduro helped negotiate multi-ton shipments of cocaine, and directed the Cartel de los Soles to provide military-grade weapons to FARC.    He also allegedly coordinated foreign affairs with Honduras and others to facilitate large-scale drug trafficking.   Maduro denied the charges and called for dialogue with the U.S., before being captured.   The current Trump administration has ramped up the pressure on Maduro over the past year. The U.S. raised the bounty for Maduro's arrest to $50 million, and designated the Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization.    \n   The new indictment released Saturday reiterates the older charges and also alleges that Maduro \"partnered\" with transnational criminal organizations including the Sinaloa Cartel, the Zetas and Tren de Aragua.   Both indictments charged officials including Diosdado Cabello, the interior minister, among the co-defendants. But the new indictment adds Maduro's wife, as well as his son, Nicolás Ernesto Maduro Guerra.   Separately, the International Criminal Court has been investigating the Venezuelan government for alleged torture, sexual violence and arbitrary detentions.   This is a developing story, which may be updated.\n",

President Trump said the U.S. will run Venezuela until a \"proper transition can take place,\" said he wasn't \"afraid of boots on the ground,\" and defended Saturday's military strikes that resulted in the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife.   \"We're there now, but we're going to stay until such time as the proper transition can take place,\" Trump told reporters from Mar a Lago. \"So we're going to stay until such time as we're going to run it, essentially, until such time as a proper transition can take place.\"   \n   Trump's remarks cap a dramatic few hours that began with reports of explosions in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, the scale of which became apparent only when the president said Maduro and his wife had been captured. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, are being brought by the USS Iwo Jima to New York where they'd stand trial.   Trump claimed that having the U.S. \"run\" Venezuela was in the U.S.' best interest.   \"We want to surround ourselves with good neighbors,\" he said. \"We want to surround ourselves with stability.\"   Trump said a group of people would step in to run Venezuela, including Secretary of State Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and added U.S. oil companies would have military back up as they move into the region.   \"We're not afraid of boots on the ground,\" he said. \"And we have to have, we had boots on the ground last night at a very high level. Actually, we're not afraid of it, we're we don't mind saying it, but we're going to make sure that that country is run properly. We're not doing this in vain.\"   Trump made clear he expects the U.S. to sell seized oil assets and said he expects money will both go to Venezuela as well as the U.S.    \n   \"We're going to be taking out a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground, and that wealth is going to the people of Venezuela, and people from outside of Venezuela that used to be in Venezuela, and it goes also to the United States of America in the form of reimbursement for the damages caused us by that country,\" Trump said.   Trump was vague on who would be running the country specifically, but said Rubio had spoken to the current vice president, Delcy Rodriguez.   \"We're designating various people, and we're going to let you know who those people are that would run Venezuela,\" he said. \"It's largely going to be for a period of time, the people that are standing right behind me. We're going to be running it.\"   He said U.S. oil companies would head to Venezuela to operate in their oil reserves, and the military is set to attack again if necessary to secure the effort.   \"We're going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country, and we are ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so,\" he said.   Watch President Trump's remarks   \n   Trump and other U.S. officials noted there were no fatalities in the operation.    Earlier Trump told Fox & Friends that he watched the \"extremely complex\" operation unfold \"like I was watching a television show.\"   Trump defended the operation, telling the network, \"You know what, we did a great job with stopping drugs from coming into this country, and nobody's been able to do it until we came along. But they should say, 'great job.' They could say, 'Oh, gee, maybe it's not constitutional.' You know, the same old stuff that we've been hearing for years and years and years.\"   Rubio told reporters the mission wasn't the kind you could notify lawmakers in advance. \"It endangers the mission,\" he said.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Daniel Estrin discusses the latest from the Trump administration with NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez.   \n\n    DANIEL ESTRIN, HOST:  President Trump says he will be making an address on the attack in Venezuela later this morning. We will bring you that as it happens. In the meantime, we have NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez. He has just got back from covering the president in Palm Beach, Florida. Good to speak with you, Franco.FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: Good to be here, Daniel.ESTRIN: Just bring us up to speed from your beat at the White House.ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, I think what we've heard so far, especially from Carrie, I mean, this really just follows such a major buildup in U.S. military power in the region. As we've been reporting, the U.S. has been building up, including an aircraft carrier, other warships, thousands of troops. And, you know, these, you know, this - attacks or these - you know, this buildup was first focused on alleged drug boats. But more recently, the U.S. actually seized an oil tanker, and then there was a land strike on a port in Venezuela. So the U.S. was already taking quite unprecedented action, but this is quite a new development.I mean, for U.S. special forces to go into another country's capital and capture the sitting leader, take him out and bring him to the United States - that's really quite staggering. You know, of course, as we just heard, the Venezuelan government is denouncing the strikes. And it's just bringing back such memories of the capture of Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega by the George H. W. Bush administration more than 30 years ago.ESTRIN: So what are we hearing so far this morning from the White House?ORDOÑEZ: Well, the president said the military operation was carried out in conjunction with U.S. law enforcement and that more details would be shared later at his 11 a.m. news conference, which he'll have at his Mar-a-Lago resort, his home. The White House has not responded to queries about where Maduro and his wife are being flown to, but Trump did call the strikes a brilliant operation in a brief interview with The New York Times. Senator Mike Lee actually said he spoke with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who told him that Maduro would stand trial on criminal charges in the U.S. and that the, quote, \"kinetic action\" that \"we saw tonight was deployed to\" actually protect \"those executing the arrest warrant.\" Lee also said that Rubio told him, and he posted this on social media, that he did not anticipate further action in Venezuela now that Maduro is in U.S. custody.ESTRIN: What exactly are the U.S. allegations against Maduro?ORDOÑEZ: Well, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Maduro and his wife have been indicted in the Southern District of New York on a variety of charges, including narcoterrorism. And he was actually - Maduro, that is - was indicted first six years ago, accused of narcoterrorism and weapons trafficking. And last summer, the Trump administration doubled the reward for information leading to Maduro's capture to $50 million.ESTRIN: OK. Maduro is known as a brutal dictator. He was alleged to have stolen the last election. Seems like a moment for many to celebrate. There is still a lot of concern as well, though.ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. For sure. I mean, for many people in Venezuela, this is going to be a moment to celebrate, but there is also a lot of uncertainty. I was speaking with Mark Feierstein, who advised multiple administrations on Latin America. He said Trump can claim victory for capturing someone indicted long ago. The question, though, is how much further is he willing to go?MARK FEIERSTEIN: There's a reason for caution 'cause there could be disappointment if the regime, you know, stays in power.ESTRIN: And what are we hearing from authorities in Caracas?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, as we just heard from Carrie, the Venezuelan vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, told state TV that she didn't know where Maduro was and was calling for a proof-of-life. There's a state of emergency as well that's been called.ESTRIN: What steps is the United States outlining now?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, I'm going to be watching the president's press conference later today to see what he has to say. Of course, what steps is the U.S. going to take to make sure the Venezuelan infrastructure doesn't crumble? I mean, it is really a delicate moment where we just don't know how things are going to turn out. I mean, in addition to where this leaves Venezuela, Daniel, there's also this big question about how Trump's own supporters are going to feel about this overseas act, such an aggressive act. I mean, Trump came to power with an America First agenda, and so far this term, his international focus has really alienated some of his supporters. So I expect we're going to be hearing a lot from Trump's supporters. And there's going to be a new debate among them, as well as the Republican Party, as well as Congress is coming back, so there's going to be a lot of questions about that as well.ESTRIN: OK. We'll leave it there for now. That's White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez. Thank you, Franco.ORDOÑEZ: Thank you, Daniel.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

President Trump announced early Saturday morning that Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores are on a U.S. Navy ship en route to New York, where they will face trial on drug, arms and conspiracy charges. Trump said the U.S. will \"run\" Venezuela until there is a \"safe, proper and judicious transition.\"   \n   The White House briefed some Congressional leadership after the operation began, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters, adding that Congress could not be notified in advance because it would have endangered the mission.   \n   \"Congress has a tendency to leak,\" Trump told reporters on Saturday. \"This would not be good.\"   Trump is scheduled to meet with all House Republicans on Tuesday at the Kennedy Center, according to a source familiar with the planning who was not authorized to speak on the record. Lawmakers from both parties have called for broader meetings and briefings.   Top Congressional Republicans praised Trump, even as they said some say they still have questions about how the operation unfolded and what will happen next.   \"President Trump's decisive action to disrupt the unacceptable status quo and apprehend Maduro, through the execution of a valid Department of Justice warrant, is an important first step to bring him to justice for the drug crimes for which he has been indicted in the United States,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune wrote in a statement.   \"I spoke to Secretary Rubio early this morning, and I look forward to receiving further briefings from the administration on this operation as part of its comprehensive counternarcotics strategy when the Senate returns to Washington next week,\" Thune wrote.   \n   Republicans respond   In recent months, some Congressional Republicans have expressed reservations about the Trump Administration's actions in Latin America. The Administration has carried out 35 strikes on alleged drug boats, killing at least 115 people since early September.   Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.), a member of the House Armed Services Committee, wrote in a statement that the operation will be positive for Venezuelans and the region.   \"My main concern now is that Russia will use this to justify their illegal and barbaric military actions against Ukraine, or China to justify an invasion of Taiwan,\" Bacon wrote. \"Freedom and rule of law were defended last night, but dictators will try to exploit this to rationalize their selfish objectives.\"   Early this morning, Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) initially expressed questions about the constitution justifications of acting without a declaration of war or authorization of force from Congress.   But Lee later said he spoke to Rubio who told him that, \"the kinetic action we saw tonight was deployed to protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant.\"   \"This action likely falls within the president's inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack,\" Lee wrote.   Democrats demand briefings and justification   But Congressional Democrats redoubled criticism of the Trump Administration's actions and questions about the legal authority to intervene without Congressional approval.   House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-NY, released a statement on Saturday calling for the House and Senate to be briefed \"immediately\" with \"compelling evidence to explain and justify this unauthorized use of military force should be presented forthwith.\"   \n   Jeffries called Maduro \"a criminal and authoritarian dictator\" and said he \"is not the legitimate head of government\" but said Trump had a constitutional responsibility to follow the law and \"has not sought congressional authorization for the use of military force and has failed to properly notify Congress in advance of the operation in Venezuela.\"   \"Pursuant to the Constitution, the framers gave Congress the sole power to declare war as the branch of government closest to the American people,\" Jeffries said.   \n   Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told NPR the strikes make clear that it is time for Congress to step in and exercise the branch's constitutional duties.   \"I think these strikes are clearly illegal,\" Kaine said Saturday in an interview on NPR's Weekend Edition. \"They have not been authorized by Congress. And the Constitution is clear that the U.S. doesn't engage in military action or war without a vote of Congress except in cases of imminent self-defense. The Constitution is absolutely clear on that.\"   Kaine also said he will call for a vote this week on his bipartisan resolution barring intervention in Venezuela without Congressional approval. A similar Senate resolution previously failed to attract enough Republican votes.   \"We can't, with a straight face, make the argument that we support the sovereignty of nations if we're willing to engage in a unilateral, presidentially declared war against Venezuela,\" Kaine said. \"And thus he is really undercutting US moral and stance for an international rule of law where nations can invade each other willy nilly just because a president decides it's a good idea to do so.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Daniel Estrin discusses the attack with career diplomat Todd Robinson, who served as acting U.S. ambassador to Venezuela during President Trump's first term.   \n\n    DANIEL ESTRIN, HOST:  The U.S. has captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro following strikes in Caracas early this morning. President Trump says Maduro and his wife were being flown out of the country. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a social media post that they would face justice in U.S. courts. We turn now to Todd Robinson. He's a career diplomat who served as acting U.S. ambassador to Venezuela during Trump's first term. Ambassador, good morning.TODD ROBINSON: Good morning.ESTRIN: What stands out to you from President Trump's announcement?ROBINSON: Well, I mean, it all stands out to me. This is virtually unprecedented. The idea that in our hemisphere, we would go into another country and arrest the leader of even if, you know, if we consider him illegitimate, still arrest the de facto leader of a country. Obviously, it doesn't happen every day. This is unprecedented, and I think there are a lot of legitimate questions about what comes next.ESTRIN: Well, do you support it?ROBINSON: Well, here's what I would say. I definitely support Maduro facing his own people for the crimes he committed in terms of holding power illegitimately. Whether or not it's up to the United States to make that happen, I think, is a different question.ESTRIN: Venezuela's vice president said this attack was a violation of international law. Does Trump have the legal authority to carry out this strike?ROBINSON: Yet again, another good question. I mean, you know, we saw the statement from Attorney General Bondi about - or I saw the post. I don't know if it's an official statement or not, but, you know, we saw what he's being charged with. That's U.S. domestic law. That's not international law. And I think there are legitimate questions about whether or not you can go into another country, into the country where the president is sitting and arrest them. You know, it's different from, say, if he had traveled to Turkey or Russia or something like that, and was caught in transit and/or given over by those authorities. I just don't know if they have legitimate authority, international - under international law.ESTRIN: OK. So I'm hearing a lot of questions you're posing about the legitimacy of what the United States has done. Let's look inside Venezuela. Are you concerned that there could be a power vacuum there now that Maduro has been deposed?ROBINSON: Absolutely. I mean, I don't - I'm not sure there's going to be a power vacuum. I think because so many of his cronies apparently were left behind, at least immediately, I envision one of them stepping up. You have the president of the Congress - or the vice president and president of the Congress, Delcy Rodríguez, still there. You have the head of the party, Diosdado Cabello, still there. You have the head of the military, Padrino, General Padrino, still there. All - any of those people could step up. Who you don't have there, funny enough, are the two people who legitimately might be able to take over. María Corina Machado is, I think, still outside of the country, and Edmundo González, I believe, is still out of the country. So again, you know, there are a lot of questions about what exactly is left behind now and, you know, what more the United States is willing to do to ensure that a potential legitimate person takes over.ESTRIN: So in the minute or so we have left, what do you think the priority now should be for the U.S. and for U.S. foreign policy towards Venezuela?ROBINSON: Well, I - number one, I mean, we have to be think - I hope they're thinking about what comes next because we just can't, you know, break things and then leave them in a broken state. But, number two, you know, what is the international community saying? Have we consulted our - with other leaders in the region and the other countries in the region? You know, are they supporting this? I mean, I just don't know, and you're seeing scattered statements from them now. So I guess we'll find out later - and we'll find out more later from the 11 a.m. press conference in Mar-a-Lago.ESTRIN: OK. We'll be listening. And thank you for joining us. That's Todd Robinson, former acting U.S. ambassador to Venezuela, during President Trump's first term. Thank you, ambassador.ROBINSON: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

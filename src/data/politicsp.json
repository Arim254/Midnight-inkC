The document shows how Smith during the course of a daylong deposition repeatedly defended the basis for pursuing indictments against Trump and vigorously rejected Republican suggestions that his investigations were politically motivated.   \n   \"The evidence here made clear that President Trump was by a large measure the most culpable and most responsible person in this conspiracy. These crimes were committed for his benefit. The attack that happened at the Capitol, part of this case, does not happen without him. The other co-conspirators were doing this for his benefit,\" Smith said, bristling at a question about whether his investigations were meant to prevent Trump from reclaiming the presidency in 2024.   \"So in terms of why we would pursue a case against him, I entirely disagree with any characterization that our work was in any way meant to hamper him in the presidential election,\" he added.   The Dec. 17 deposition was conducted privately despite Smith's request to testify publicly. The release of the transcript and video of the interview, so far Smith's only appearance on Capitol Hill since leaving his special counsel position last January, adds to the public understanding of the decision-making behind two of the most consequential Justice Department investigations in recent history.   Trump was indicted on charges of conspiring to undo the 2020 election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden, and of willfully retaining classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Both cases were abandoned after Trump's 2024 election win, with Smith citing Justice Department policy against the indictment of a sitting president.   \n   Smith repeatedly made clear his belief that the evidence gathered against Trump was strong enough to sustain a conviction. Part of the strength of the Jan. 6 case, Smith said, was the extent to which it relied on the testimony of Trump allies and supporters who cooperated with the investigation.   \"We had an elector in Pennsylvania who is a former congressman, who was going to be an elector for President Trump, who said that what they were trying to do was an attempt to overthrow the government and illegal,\" Smith said. \"Our case was built on, frankly, Republicans who put their allegiance to the country before the party.\"   Accounts from Republicans willing to stand up against the falsehood that the election had been stolen \"even though it could mean trouble for them\" created what Smith described as the \"most powerful\" evidence against Trump.   When it came to the Capitol riot itself, Smith said, the evidence showed that Trump \"caused it and that he exploited it and that it was foreseeable to him.\"   Asked whether there was evidence that Trump had instructed supporters to riot at the Capitol, Smith said that Trump in the weeks leading to the insurrection got \"people to believe fraud claims that weren't true.\"   \"He made false statements to state legislatures, to his supporters in all sorts of contexts and was aware in the days leading up to Jan. 6th that his supporters were angry when he invited them and then he directed them to the Capitol,\" Smith said.   \"Now, once they were at the Capitol and once the attack on the Capitol happened, he refused to stop it. He instead issued a tweet that without question in my mind endangered the life of his own vice president,\" he added. \"And when the violence was going on, he had to be pushed repeatedly by his staff members to do anything to quell it.\"   \n   Some of the deposition focused on Republican anger at revelations that the Smith team had obtained, and analyzed, phone records of GOP lawmakers who were in contact with Trump on Jan. 6. Smith defended the maneuver as lawful and by-the-book, and suggested that outrage over the tactic should be directed at Trump and not his team of prosecutors.   \n   \"Well, I think who should be accountable for this is Donald Trump. These records are people, in the case of the senators, Donald Trump directed his co-conspirators to call these people to further delay the proceedings. He chose to do that,\" Smith said. If Donald Trump had chosen to call a number of Democratic senators, we would have gotten toll records for Democratic senators.\"   The communications between Trump and Republican supporters in Congress were an important component of the case, Smith said. He cited an interview his office did with Mark Meadows in which Trump's former chief of staff referenced that Rep. Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican and current chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, had been in touch with the White House on the afternoon of the riot.   \"And what I recall was Meadows stating that 'I've never seen Jim Jordan scared of anything,' and the fact that we were in this different situation now where people were scared really made it clear that what was going on at the Capitol could not be mistaken for anything other than what it was,\" Smith said.   Smith was also asked whether his team evaluated former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson's explosive claim that Trump that grabbed at the steering wheel of the presidential SUV when the Secret Service refused to let him go to the Capitol after a rally at the Ellipse on Jan. 6, 2021.   Smith told lawmakers that investigators interviewed the officer who was in the car, \"who said that President Trump was very angry and wanted to go to the Capitol,\" but the officer's version of events \"was not the same as what Cassidy Hutchinson said she heard from somebody secondhand.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Michel Martin asks Democratic strategist Joel Payne what New York City's new democratic socialist mayor may signify for the Democratic party. Is his energy what the party needs?   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  With, as we just said, Zohran Mamdani now officially mayor of New York City, we wanted to ask what his ascent might mean for the Democratic Party beyond the city of New York. We called Joel Payne for his thoughts on this. He's a Democratic strategist who's worked with leaders and activists from different wings of the party and across the country. Joel Payne, welcome. Thanks for joining us, and Happy New Year.JOEL PAYNE: Happy New Year to you as well.MARTIN: So Mamdani won the Democratic primary in an overwhelmingly Democratic city, so we shouldn't be surprised that he won. But his platform is one of the things that got a lot of national attention - you know, free child care, free city buses, a rent freeze for some housing. Does his agenda have an appeal outside of New York City?PAYNE: Yeah. Michel, it's a good question. His platform makes sense for New York City. Those are parochial issues that matter - affordability issues focused on housing, focused on child care that might look different around the country for Democrats who may want to build off of what Zohran Mamdani is doing. The things that are going to be replicable outside of New York City is going to be the way he goes about his job, so moving fast, getting rid of some of the barriers. The types of folks who might oppose his agenda at the state level or at the federal level - either getting those folks on board or removing those obstacles. And also, not getting pulled into fights that don't really matter to the charter of why he was elected, people trying to focus him on things like foreign policy issues that really have nothing to do with why he was elected. Those are the things that if you're a Democrat around the country, you're going to want to watch how Mamdani goes about his work to see if you can replicate that.MARTIN: So what is somebody like you going to be paying attention to? And by somebody like you, I mean somebody who thinks about how Democrats can not just win elections but accomplish their goals, their policy goals.PAYNE: Yeah. I think people are going to be tempted to kind of view this as just a giant experiment of, hey, can somebody with this profile who speaks about himself in this way with this type of political coalition - can he be successful at actually governing, right? He's successful at campaigning and at holding that coalition together, but can he be successful at governing? And I imagine that there are folks in the Democratic Party, particularly in the establishment wing of the party, who are reticent about Mamdani, who are going to be watching to see, does this work at scale? There are many of us who believe that the ideas that Mamdani's espousing are popular and are populist and are, you know, kind of ways to reimagine what that Democratic coalition can look like. But I think there are a lot of skeptical folks who are going to be looking to see whether he can continue to be successful now that he's governing and not just campaigning.MARTIN: But when you consider the ideas - and, you know, again, we're sort of gliding past the whole demographic piece and how that played a role in how he was treated and how his opponents, you know, tried to run against him. So just sort of gliding past that for a minute. But when you're considering the ideas Mamdani ran on, you have to assume he'll have to make compromises somewhere. So is the test for him which compromises he makes or how he explains them?PAYNE: Yeah, I think you're laying that out the right way. The real test for Mamdani I don't think is going to come necessarily from his political opposition on the right. I think it's going to come from the people who he has allegiance to on the left. Are they going to give him the space to make either the types of compromises or to do the type of prioritization that you have to do when you are trying to be the administrator of a city like New York and trying to deal with the local politics that are at play in a state like New York State?MARTIN: So, you know, like his colleague Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who's a member of Congress, obviously, and who will be at his big ceremony today. Republicans have already started using Mamdani as a foil, but has the president undermined that tactic in some way? Remember that very warm welcome he gave him in the Oval Office? How do you think that plays going forward?PAYNE: Yeah. President Trump kind of gave the game away. I mean, one, President Trump was obviously charmed and somewhat impressed with Mamdani and his rise and his individual meeting with Mamdani. I think, you know, you've even seen Elise Stefanik, who was going to be the New York mayor's - or rather governor's candidate for Republicans, had already laid out this entire attack around Mamdani and actually could not, you know, be successful with that because of a lot of the things that Trump did to undercut that argument. And I think a lot of Republicans who planned to spend 2026 talking about Zohran Mamdani are going to have to rethink that now that Trump has intervened the way he has.MARTIN: That's Democratic strategist Joel Payne. Joel, thank you so much for joining us, and Happy New Year again.PAYNE: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"NYC\")INTERPOL: (Singing) New York cares. Got to be some more change in my life.

He went viral in late December for a video purportedly uncovering $110 million in alleged fraud by federally funded day care centers in Minnesota.\n                \n                    Adam Gray/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Adam Gray/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The Trump administration is freezing child care funding to the state of Minnesota in response to a viral video that purports to expose extensive fraud by federally funded day care centers.   Nick Shirley, a 23-year-old self-described \"independent YouTube journalist,\" posted the 42-minute video on X and YouTube the day after Christmas.   In it, he and an older man — identified only as \"David\" — visit various seemingly empty day care centers, bombarding Somali employees with questions and accusing them of not providing services to any children despite receiving public funds. The pair claim to have exposed over $110 million in fraud.   \n   Allegations of social services fraud in Minnesota have been the subject of federal investigations and mainstream media coverage for years.   In one high-profile example, more than 90 individuals have been charged since 2022 in the ongoing case of a Minnesota nonprofit that prosecutors say misappropriated some $250 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds intended to feed children in need, calling it \"the largest Covid-19 fraud scheme in the country.\"   And a federal prosecutor said earlier this month that half or more of the roughly $18 billion in federal funds that supported 14 Minnesota-run programs since 2018 may have been stolen.   However, Shirley's specific allegations have not been verified, with some challenging them in recent days. The manager of one Minnesota day care center has since said Shirley visited outside of its regular hours, while a CNN camera crew interviewing Shirley outside a different center filmed caregivers dropping off their kids in the background (he dismissed them as \"showing face\").   \n   \"How do I know that [the allegations are] true?\" Shirley responded when asked. \"Well, we showed you guys what was happening, and then you guys can go ahead and make your own analysis.\"   The lack of evidence hasn't stopped a number of prominent conservatives — including Elon Musk and key members of the Trump administration — from amplifying and acting on Shirley's claims. As of Wednesday, Shirley's video has over 131 million views on X and 2.5 million on YouTube.   Vice President Vance reposted Shirley's video the day after it went live, writing, \"This dude has done far more useful journalism than any of the winners of the 2024 [Pulitzer] prizes.\" (Those prizes went to journalists who covered a range of topics, from billionaires' influence over the Supreme Court to catastrophic flooding in California and missing Black girls and women in Chicago.)   \n   FBI Director Kash Patel also responded, writing on X that \"even before the public conversation escalated online, the FBI had surged personnel and investigative resources to Minnesota to dismantle large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programs.\"   \n   Shirley, suddenly in the national spotlight, has expressed concerns about his safety and is asking supporters to donate to his security, including by selling $50 sweatshirts on his website. And he's continued to criticize Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz and the mainstream media for their perceived inaction on the issue.   \"Mainstream media is more mad at me then they are at the FACT that billions of YOUR dollars are being used for fraudulent business,\" Shirley tweeted Wednesday. \"I am not an enemy of the people, they are. I'm with you, they are against you.\"   Shirley started out as a vlogger    Shirley has been making shock-value YouTube videos for years, starting with pranks before wading into political exposés.   The Utah native vlogged consistently throughout high school, amassing some 7,000 followers before graduating in 2020, according to a profile that year from local NBC affiliate KSL-TV.   \"Some people might not know who Nick Shirley is yet, but one day, they will,\" it reads.   One of his earliest stunts was flying to New York City at age 16 without telling his parents. They escalated from there: sneaking into influencer Jake Paul's wedding, tricking TikTokkers into auditioning for a fake Justin Bieber music video, riding a bike over a ramp lit on fire. He also filmed himself in the crowd outside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.   \n   Then came a hiatus: Shirley announced in December 2021 that he would be taking a two-year break from YouTube to serve on a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Santiago, Chile.   He returned to the platform in 2023 with a video interviewing undocumented immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona. From that point on, his work took on a decidedly political bent, with man-on-the-street style interviews focused on topics including illegal immigration, the 2024 election, President Trump's deployment of federal troops to blue cities and the ensuing protests against them.   \n   His two most-viewed videos are from this period, filmed from the El Salvadoran mega-prison housing deportees alleged to be gang members and another in Rio de Janeiro, titled \"I Infiltrated Rio Brazil's Most Dangerous Gang.\"   The description of his YouTube Channel — which has 1.29 million subscribers as of Wednesday — reads: \"Here to entertain and bring the truth to all.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Shirley speaks during a roundtable discussion at the White House in October attended by the president, administration officials and conservative influencers.\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   An \"independent journalist\" with an agenda   Shirley's rise to prominence hit a new milestone in October, when he was invited to participate in a White House roundtable about the \"antifa\" movement — the far-left ideology opposed to fascism, which Trump has designated a domestic terrorist organization.   \n   At the event, Shirley introduced himself as a \"100% independent YouTube journalist\" and said that while he's traveled to 15 countries for that work, \"the most dangerous place I've been has been here in the United States\" because of anti-Trump protests.   \n   According to recent research from the Harvard Kennedy School, the thousands of local protests during Trump's second term have yielded an \"extremely low number of injuries, property damage or arrests.\"   Shirley is part of a broader group of right-leaning journalists and political commentators who do not work for any particular outlet. The White House has embraced what it calls \"new media,\" giving them unprecedented levels of access at the same time as it places restrictions on established journalistic outlets.   \n   University of Minnesota media law professor Jane Kirtley told member station MPR News that individuals do not necessarily need a formal affiliation to do fine journalism. But she says many of today's news influencers prioritize fearmongering over fact-checking, something she says she observes in Shirley's reporting.   \"They have a narrative, and they do everything they can to advance that narrative, but they seem to spend little to no time looking for the other side of the story, and that's what good investigative journalism has to do,\" she added.\n",

U.S. Southern Command, which oversees South America, did not reveal where the attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday occurred. Previous attacks have been in the Caribbean Sea and in the eastern Pacific Ocean.   \n   A video of Tuesday's attack posted by Southern Command on social media shows three boats traveling in a close formation, which is unusual, and the military said they were in a convoy along known narco-trafficking routes and \"had transferred narcotics between the three vessels prior to the strikes.\" The military did not provide evidence to back up the claim.   The military said three people were killed when the first boat was struck, while people in the other two boats jumped overboard and distanced themselves from the vessels before they were attacked. Southern Command said it immediately notified the U.S. Coast Guard to activate search and rescue efforts.   \n   Southern Command's statement did not say whether those who jumped off the boats were rescued.   Calling in the Coast Guard is notable because the U.S. military drew heavy scrutiny after U.S. forces killed the survivors of an attack in early September with a follow-up strike to their disabled boat. Some Democratic lawmakers and legal experts said the military committed a crime, while the Trump administration and some Republican lawmakers say the follow-up strike was legal.   \n   U.S. forces attacked two more boats on Wednesday, killing five people who were allegedly smuggling drugs along known trafficking routes, Southern Command said in a separate statement. It did not provide evidence of the alleged trafficking or reveal the body of water in which the attacks occurred. Videos posted with the statement on social media showed a boat in the water and explosions.   The latest attacks bring the total number of known boat strikes to 35 and the number of people killed to at least 115 since early September, according to numbers announced by the Trump administration.   \n   President Trump has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States and asserted that the U.S. is engaged in an \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels.   Along with the strikes, the Trump administration has built up military forces in the region as part of an escalating pressure campaign on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who has been charged with narco-terrorism in the United States.   Meanwhile, the CIA was behind a drone strike last week at a docking area believed to have been used by Venezuelan drug cartels, according to two people familiar with details of the operation who requested anonymity to discuss the classified matter.   \n   It was the first known direct operation on Venezuelan soil since the U.S. began strikes in September, a significant escalation in the administration's pressure campaign on Maduro's government.\n",

Fallon/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Here at NPR, we like to ring in the new year by looking at new state laws taking effect on Jan. 1.   This year, states are enacting a slew of laws focused on wages, social media rules, restrictions on gender-affirming care, AI regulation and much more.   Here is a sampling of some of those changes, as reported by public media journalists across the country.   California rideshare drivers can unionize   Under a new law, California's 800,000 rideshare drivers have the right to unionize starting on Jan. 1. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom brokered the deal between organized labor and major rideshare companies, including Uber and Lyft.   \n   The rideshare giants supported the expansion of collective bargaining rights to their drivers in exchange for lawmakers agreeing to slash the companies' insurance costs for underinsured drivers.   After Massachusetts voters decided to do so in 2024, California became the second state to extend collective bargaining rights to rideshare drivers.   – Laura Fitzgerald, CapRadio   More paid time off in Colorado for parents of babies in the NICU   Colorado families whose babies spend time in the NICU will be able to take more paid leave this year. Colorado's paid family leave program already allows workers to take up to 12 weeks off from work to care for a new baby, or for a serious family health or personal issue, and receive most of their pay during that time.   Now, families whose babies require time in neonatal intensive care can apply for an additional 12 weeks of paid leave. Backers say this acknowledges the extra strain families are under when caring for preemies and other newborns with significant health problems.   Democratic State Sen. Jeff Bridges was one of the main sponsors and says he was inspired by his own personal experience. His newborn was in intensive care, which he says was \"terrifying and consuming.\"   Democrats passed the bill, mostly along party lines. Opponents say they worry about increased costs to businesses and workers who pay into the program.   \n   Illinois also has a new NICU law going into effect in June, but unlike Colorado, the time off is not required to be paid.   – Bente Birkeland, Colorado Public Radio   Social media time limits in Virginia    A new law in Virginia, which faces a legal challenge, is designed to limit social media use by those under 16 to one hour a day, unless a parent agrees to a longer period. NetChoice, a group representing social media services, claims the law violates the First Amendment. The law's author, Democratic State Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, argues it's a \"reasonable attempt to balance free speech with the safety and privacy of our children.\"   In legal filings, attorneys for NetChoice call the law the \"latest attempt in a long line of government efforts to restrict new forms of constitutionally protected expression based on concerns about their potential effects on minors.\" A preliminary injunction hearing is set for mid-January.   – Brad Kutner, WVTF   Eighteen states restrict SNAP money for candy, sodas    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Coca-Cola soft drinks are offered for sale at a grocery store on December 11, 2024 in Chicago. Changes to SNAP programs in 2026 in some states will prevent individuals from using benefits to buy soda or other sugary drinks or foods.\n                \n                    Scott Olson/Getty ImagesNorth America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Scott Olson/Getty ImagesNorth America\n    \n\n   \n   With permission from the Trump administration, 18 states will ban the purchase of candy, sodas, energy drinks or other items using federal dollars intended for low-income households.   The states, which include South Carolina, Florida, Hawaii, and Texas, received waivers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2025 that will allow them to restrict Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program dollars for items the states deem non-nutritious.   Citing adult and child obesity statistics, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said in December that the waiver will help create healthier outcomes and said the goal aligns with President Trump's push to restore SNAP to its \"true purpose – nutrition.\"   South Carolina will ban the purchase of candy, energy drinks, soft drinks, and other sweetened beverages using SNAP dollars.   Other states have narrower limits. Texas will prohibit SNAP funds for sweetened drinks and candy, and Virginia plans to bar SNAP dollars for certain \"sweetened beverages.\" All 18 states have a target implementation date of sometime this year.   \n   Among other things, critics of the waivers say they are skeptical the bans will improve people's health.   – Maayan Schechter, South Carolina Public Radio   Paid leave up to 20 weeks in Minnesota   Beginning this week, most Minnesota workers will have access to paid family and medical leave benefits. The state is launching a program that allows 12 weeks of paid family leave to care for a sick loved one or bond with a baby, as well as 12 weeks of medical leave to recover from illness or injury.    There's a cap of 20 weeks in a year if someone taps both. Those who take paid leave will receive partial pay and will have a guarantee that their position at work will be there when they return. Employers are also barred from retaliating against workers who take the paid time off.   The program is funded through a payroll tax split between employers and employees.   Some business groups tried to block the legislation, saying that if employees take significant time off, it could put more work on others.   Roughly three-quarters of Minnesota workers are expected to receive more paid leave benefits under the program than they had previously. Minnesota will be among 13 states to offer paid family and medical leave benefits.   – Dana Ferguson, Minnesota Public Radio   Illinois regulates AI, despite Trump's executive order   Starting this year, employers in Illinois are prohibited from using artificial intelligence in employment decisions – from making new hires to promoting or disciplining current employees – if the technology factors in demographic information, such as the person's race or ZIP code.   It's an amendment to the state's Human Rights Act and was passed by the legislature's Democratic supermajority. Democratic State Sen. Javier Cervantes sponsored the measure. As an artist, Cervantes says he has real concerns about how rapidly AI has progressed over the past few years.   \n   \"This is an unchecked technology,\" Cervantes says. \"We just have to get in front of it and do the best we can.\"   The new law comes on the heels of President Trump's executive order directing the U.S. Department of Justice to challenge states' AI laws deemed \"cumbersome.\" Cervantes says he's pretty certain the DOJ will take the state to court – as it has done in more than thirty suits so far – over the new law.   – Mawa Iqbal, WBEZ\n",

In a Truth Social post on Wednesday, Trump praised the deployments and claimed they have helped curtail crime.    \"Portland, Los Angeles, and Chicago were GONE if it weren't for the Federal Government stepping in,\" he said.   The deployments in Chicago and Portland were blocked by the courts. Guard members left California after a sharp rebuke from a U.S. District Court judge earlier this month. On Wednesday, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Trump administration must return control of the Guard to California Gov. Gavin Newsom.   \n   That decision came after the Supreme Court last week ruled against the administration's emergency appeal to deploy troops to Chicago. It was the first time the high court waded into the matter. While not precedent-setting, the ruling brought some clarity to Trump's presidential powers.   Trump had argued that the Guard was needed in the Democratically-led cities to quell crime and protect federal immigration officers and facilities. Democratic governors in those states staunchly opposed the deployments and federal judges were also wary of allowing the military to intervene in civilian matters.   \"This principle has been foundational to the safeguarding of our fundamental liberties under the Constitution,\" U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut wrote in her November ruling freezing Trump's deployment of troops to Portland, Ore.   Trump has also deployed National Guard troops to other U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C., where more than 2,000 members of the Guard  have been patrolling since August.   Those deployments have also faced legal challenges — earlier this month a federal appeals court ruled that troops can remain in the capital city while a panel of judges examines whether the deployment is legal.   A handful of Republican-led states have welcomed the Guard. In Tennessee, troops began patrolling in October. And moments after the Supreme Court ruling, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said 350 troops would deploy to New Orleans. National Guard members arrived in the city Tuesday, member station WWNO reported.   \n   In his Truth Social post on Wednesday, Trump promised \"We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again - Only a question of time!\"\n",

But earlier this week, a bipartisan group of senators worked to strike a compromise that could resurrect the enhanced ACA premium tax credits — potentially blunting the blow of rising monthly payments for Obamacare enrollees.    \"There's a number of Republican and Democratic senators who are seeing what a disaster this will be for families that they represent,\" Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., said on Morning Edition Thursday. \"That's the common ground here, and it's a doable thing.\"    \n   Welch said he joined a bipartisan call Tuesday — first reported by Punchbowl News — in which a handful of senators charted out a possible health care compromise.    \"We could extend the credits for a couple of years, we could reform it,\" Welch said of the call. \"You could put an income cap, you could have a copay, you could have penalties on insurers who commit fraud. You actually could introduce some cost saving reductions that have bipartisan support.\"   But according to Welch, this legislation is only doable with President Trump's blessing.    \"It would require that President Trump play a major role in this, because he has such influence over the Republican majority in the House and even in the Senate,\" Welch said.    Last fall, Republicans and Democrats fought bitterly over the Obamacare subsidy extension, causing a political standoff that led to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. Meanwhile, Trump has remained relatively hands-off, withholding his support for any health care legislation.    Despite these obstacles, Welch said he believes the jump in prices that people across the country now face will break the logjam in Congress.    \"A farmer in Vermont, their premium is going to go from $900 a month to $3,200, a month,\" Welch said. \"So they're going to really face sticker shock. There's going to be a secondary impact, because the hospitals, particularly in rural areas, are going to lose revenue.\"    \n   But even if the Senate advanced a compromise bill on the ACA, the House would also have to get behind it. And the lower chamber has its own bipartisan effort on an ACA subsidy extension.    Just before the recess began in mid-December, four House Republicans joined Democrats in signing a discharge petition on a three-year extension of the ACA subsidies — forcing a floor vote on the bill when the House returns.   \n   Hours after bucking House Speaker Mike Johnson and joining Democrats, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., told Morning Edition back in December that he thinks this vote will get even more Republican support.   \"I don't like the clean extension without any income cap,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"But given the choice between a clean three-year extension and letting them expire, that's not a hard choice for me. And I suspect many of my other colleagues are going to view it the same way.\"    Fitzpatrick and Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., have held meetings with moderate senators on legislative paths to extend the ACA subsidies, a source familiar with the talks but not authorized to speak publicly tells NPR.     The Senate returns on Jan. 5 and the House comes back to Capitol Hill on Jan. 6. \n",

Joining us to talk about this is Senator Peter Welch, a Democrat representing Vermont. He has been pushing to extend these health care tax credits. Welcome to the program, Senator Welch.PETER WELCH: Thank you.FADEL: We've reported pretty consistently that insurance premiums are expected to increase significantly. What other consequences can Americans expect from these subsidies ending?WELCH: Well, the most significant is anybody - a small business, a farmer - whether they're in a Republican or a Democratic district, is going to get hammered. So a farmer in Vermont, their premium is going to go from 900 a month to $3,200 a month. So they're going to really face sticker shock. There's going to be a secondary impact because the hospitals, particularly in rural areas, are going to lose revenue because folks are going to show up to get care and not have any way to pay for it. So there'll be a ripple effect here, both immediate on the families who have to make a tough call - do they try to scrape together the money that they don't have? - and then on the institutions in our rural communities that are so important to us.FADEL: Now, Vermont seems to be one of the states that will see the highest premium increases. What are your constituents saying to you?WELCH: They're really terrified. I mean, the affordability issues that every American is facing - with rising utility bills, health care bills are a big part of it, groceries - this is really one where, in addition to the expense, it imposes an immense amount of insecurity. You know, a mother that I was talking to, with two kids, said she doesn't know what to do. She feels totally irresponsible not to have health care, but it's totally impossible for her to afford it. So I think this is really tough. And frankly, it's not whether you're politically oriented towards Trump or the Democrats. It's really everybody trying to take care of their families. So this is really a bipartisan catastrophe in the making.FADEL: Now, speaking of that, it was reported a few days ago that a bipartisan group of senators met by phone to discuss health care negotiations. Were you part of that call?WELCH: Yes, I was. And there's a determination on both sides of the aisle to do every single thing we can to avoid this catastrophe. And there's some practical things we could do to make that happen. You know, we could extend the credits for a couple of years. We could reform it. You could put an income cap. You could have a copay. You could have penalties on insurers who commit fraud, or insurance agents. And you actually could introduce some cost-saving reductions that have bipartisan support, and if we were successful in that, it actually could bring down health care premiums by about 11%. So there's common ground here to do something that's beneficial to all Americans, so we're determined to keep trying.FADEL: And are you specifically pushing for this path we mentioned for this to change to get an extension of these subsidies passed retroactively?WELCH: Well, we would. What we would do is extend the open enrollment period, and we'd have to give folks an opportunity to take a look and see, if we get the credits extended, does it make sense for them to be able to get back on health care? So it would be, in effect, retroactive, but this is something that could be done. It would require that President Trump play a major role in this because he has such influence over the Republican majority in the House and even in the Senate. But where I have some optimism is that there's a number of Republican and Democratic senators who are seeing what a disaster this will be for families that they represent. That's the common ground here, and it's a doable thing. And the one thing that's totally unacceptable is that people who have no control over how these premiums have increased - and these are the families, the small businesses, the farmers - they should not be the ones that pay the price here.FADEL: Now, do you think there is enough support from your colleagues who are willing to shift their position in upcoming negotiations and pass a retroactive extension for these subsidies?WELCH: I do - in the Senate. I can speak for the Senate. But it really will require that President Trump weigh in. And one of the things that President Trump has indicated, according to my Republican colleagues, is that he wants to have some room in there for what's called an HSA, a health savings account. And one of the topics of discussion is whether we could give the insured, the person, an option to opt into that if they wish to. But we need President Trump, and I think he's the one who can make this happen.FADEL: And what possible path is there to get President Trump to the table?WELCH: Well, my Republican colleagues can be speaking to him, and some of them are. So that's really going to be the burden they bear. And my colleagues on the Republican side that are really intent on trying to get an extension are doing their best to engage with the president. But he'll be critical.FADEL: Senator Peter Welch of Vermont, thank you for your time and Happy New Year.WELCH: Leila, same to you. Thank you, and Happy New Year to America.FADEL: Happy New Year. We also reached out to multiple Republican lawmakers, and those invitations remain open.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      President Trump issues his first vetoes of his second term.   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  Yesterday, more than 11 months after being inaugurated, President Trump vetoed his first bills of this term. Both had passed Congress with broad bipartisan support. These were not divisive bills. So these vetoes pit the president against his fellow Republicans and raise the question of how far they might go to defy the president. NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben is here to walk us through details. Hey there.DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey there.KELLY: What did he veto?KURTZLEBEN: Well, the first is a bill that would have helped communities in southeastern Colorado pay for a conduit that would carry clean water. The bill would have done that by giving them more time to repay money without interest to the federal government. Now, that conduit is important because residents there have dealt with unsafe water. Some of the groundwater is tainted with toxic elements like radium. The other bill deals with Florida. It would have expanded the area reserved for the Miccosukee Tribe and required the secretary of the interior to help safeguard communities there from flooding.KELLY: OK. Let me take these one by one. The Colorado one, first, and this clean water conduit. Why did President Trump veto it?KURTZLEBEN: Well, his stated reason is that the bill would force federal taxpayers to foot the bill for a local water project that, as initially envisioned, would have been paid for by the local communities. He added in a statement that he's committed to ending, quote, \"the massive cost of taxpayer handouts.\" But it's important to get a sense of the scope here. Federal funding has paid for a large chunk of this project, but as our colleagues at Colorado Public Radio have pointed out, this particular bill would cost the federal government less than $500,000, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate, which, in terms of federal spending, is absolutely tiny.KELLY: May I ask about the language you just used? You just told us the president's stated reason for vetoing this. Is there a reason to think there are other motives in play?KURTZLEBEN: Well, Colorado Republican Representative Lauren Boebert has raised this possibility. In a statement, she said, quote, \"I sincerely hope this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation.\" She clashed with the president this year by pushing for the release of the Epstein files, but Trump has not explicitly linked that to his veto.But in addition, Trump, earlier this year, threatened what he called harsh measures if a woman named Tina Peters was not released from a Colorado prison. Peters was a county clerk in Mesa County, Colorado, and she is serving a nine-year sentence for helping someone get access to voting equipment after the 2020 election. So the whole case is tied to conspiracy theories about election fraud. Earlier this month, Trump said he was pardoning Peters, but presidential pardons apply to federal crimes. Peters was convicted at the state level, so she remains in prison. Now, again, Trump has not explicitly linked Peters to this veto, but this morning, he posted on social media that he wants Peters freed, so we know she's on his mind.KELLY: OK. Go to the other one, the Florida veto. What are the reasons, stated or otherwise, for that veto?KURTZLEBEN: Well, Trump was straightforward in saying this veto was in part about politics. He said in a statement that the Miccosukee Tribe, quote, \"has actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies.\" Now, that seems to refer to the tribe earlier this year joining a lawsuit against an immigration detention center the Trump administration created in Florida, the one the president calls Alligator Alcatraz. The tribe considers the land it's built on sacred.KELLY: To circle back to something I said at the outset, that both these bills, Florida and Colorado, they passed with the support of the president's GOP colleagues in Congress, right?KURTZLEBEN: Yes. In fact, they both passed the House and Senate without those person-by-person roll call votes. The bills just had so much support. They were able to pass via voice votes or unanimous consent. So now the question is whether Congress can or wants to override Trump's vetoes.KELLY: That's NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. Thank you, Danielle.KURTZLEBEN: Thank you.KELLY: And Happy New Year.KURTZLEBEN: You too.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The Democratic socialist opted to take the oath of office past midnight on New Year's Eve in the old City Hall subway station in Lower Manhattan, as an act meant to capture the spirit of the city's history of serving working people as he signals his incoming administration's civic priorities.   The subterranean site, which closed 80 years ago, is noted for its architectural grandeur with chandeliers, glass skylights and tiled vaulted tunnels.   \n   Mamdani told Streetsblog NYC, which first reported the news, that when the station first opened in 1904, \"it was a physical monument to a city that dared to be both beautiful and build great things that would transform working peoples' lives.\"   \"That ambition need not be a memory confined only to our past, nor must it be isolated only to the tunnels beneath City Hall: It will be the purpose of the administration fortunate enough to serve New Yorkers from the building above,\" Mamdani said in the statement to Streetsblog.   The small, underground ceremony's invitees included Mamdani's family and political ally New York Attorney General Letitia James, tapped to deliver the oath of office. A public inauguration in the afternoon has been planned to take place near City Hall, followed by a block party.   James said on social media that she was honored to swear in Mamdani at the historic subway station: \"Our subways connect us all, and they represent exactly what our next mayor is fighting for: a city every New Yorker can thrive in,\" she wrote.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Old City Hall Station, an abandoned subway terminal in Manhattan, features vaulted ceilings, brass chandeliers and skylights.\n                \n                    Felix Lipov/Alamy\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Felix Lipov/Alamy\n    \n\n   \n   A relic of civic innovation   Trains first departed the City Hall station on Oct. 27, 1904, as the first stop on the city's first subway line. It took passengers as far as the Bronx, the borough where Mamdani attended high school.   \n   When train cars got longer to make room for the city's growing ridership, they became incompatible with the platform's curved design, according to The New York Times. The city shut down the station in 1945 with service stopping for good that New Year's Eve.   What's now regarded as a relic of transit innovation was once hailed as \"an underground cathedral\" and \"the Mona Lisa of subway stations.\"   The station, designed by George Heins and Christopher LaFarge with Guastavino vaulted ceilings, features large brass light fixtures, glass skylights that look out to the park above, and green- and cream-colored tilework.   The public can still see the historic tunnels from a train car on Manhattan's 6 line, which has a turnaround point looping through the terminal, or on a guided tour with the New York Transit Museum.\n",

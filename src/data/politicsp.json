Whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen, but he knew nothing about it. And would you leave it at that? You don't have to embarrass our guest by asking a question.\"   The CIA concluded the crown prince approved the 2018 operation that killed and dismembered Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Turkey, but Salman maintained he had no knowledge of the attack, which he's called \"heinous\" and \"unjustifiable.\"   \n   On Tuesday, he said that his country has \"improved our system to be sure that nothing happened like that. And it's painful, and it's a huge mistake, and we are doing our best that this doesn't happen again.\"   Trump also dismissed questions about a conflict of interest regarding his family's business ties to Saudi Arabia while hosting Salman as president. He said that he has \"nothing to do\" with the family business and added that while he helped build a successful business, he \"decided to leave that success behind and make America very successful.\"   The two men touted a deal between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia that would bring hundreds of billions in investment into the United States in exchange for access to key military and technology assets for the Gulf nation.\n",

He was believed to have abused many minors before his death in 2019. The Justice Department said earlier this year there was nothing worth releasing. People who doubt this include Annie Farmer, one of Epstein's accusers, who spoke yesterday on NPR's MORNING EDITION.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)ANNIE FARMER: There's a piece about accountability, wanting people that not just participated in these crimes, but also that allowed them, that funded them, that looked the other way. I think there's a reckoning for all of that that needs to happen. And so this idea that, no, there's nothing more to see here, we don't buy it.MARTÍNEZ: NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt is with us. Barbara, so how does this congressional action work?BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Well, it would compel the Justice Department to release all unclassified files. So that's records, documents, communications, all investigation materials, essentially, within 30 days, and that includes documents related to Epstein's death. As a reminder, the administration has already released thousands of files to the House Oversight Committee, documents that also include names of other people connected to Epstein, but there are still more files that haven't been made public. And there's renewed interest in this. Democrats on the panel recently released emails where Epstein told a journalist that President Trump, quote, \"knew about the girls,\" unquote, seemingly referring to the people Epstein was allegedly trafficking. The president has previously said he had a falling out with Epstein many years ago, and he has not been tied to any wrongdoing.MARTÍNEZ: All right. So say this passes the House, the files still would have a few steps to go before they're made public.SPRUNT: That's right. And there are a few question marks here. What is the scope of what's in these files? We know that the measure gives some latitude to the Justice Department to withhold or redact portions of them, including documents that could jeopardize active investigations. So could that lead to delays? President Trump has already called for an investigation into Epstein's alleged ties to prominent Democrats, for example. And another big question mark is the Senate. Will leadership bring this for a vote in that chamber? I think if there's a lot of support from Republicans in the House, it ups the chances of this moving in the Senate.MARTÍNEZ: So after the House, after the Senate, then it goes to President Trump's desk.SPRUNT: That's right. And he has said that he would sign it if it comes to his desk. But an interesting element in this - he already has the authority to direct the Justice Department to release documents. He did that in other cases with documents related to the investigations of the assassinations of the Kennedys and Martin Luther King Jr., for example. But that's not what's happening here. Instead, the House is forcing a vote that would compel the administration to release the documents. Big difference.MARTÍNEZ: Wondering, Barbara, what you make of that reversal from President Trump on whether Republicans should back the measure or not.SPRUNT: Yeah. That was a major U-turn. I think it speaks to how important this issue is to the base. I think it's notable that there was a pressure campaign from the White House to convince key Republicans, including some of his most vocal supporters, no less, not to sign the petition to force a vote on this. That didn't work, and to me, it shows that this is an area where the president doesn't have a firm grip on the House. I think the writing was on the wall that a lot of Republican House members were prepared to vote yes for this, with or without the White House's blessing. So the president's about-face could be a way of giving in to, you know, giving the go-ahead to something that was already coming.MARTÍNEZ: That's NPR's Barbara Sprunt. Thanks a lot.SPRUNT: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

During the rare rehearing of a Louisiana redistricting case in October, the court's conservative majority appeared inclined to weaken the Voting Rights Act's Section 2 protections against racial discrimination in the political mapmaking process.   Such a ruling could spark a new wave of congressional redistricting, especially in the South, where voting is often racially polarized and Section 2 has long prevented the dilution of Black minority voters' collective power. Without the current Section 2 protections, Republican-led southern states may undo districts where Black voters have a realistic opportunity of electing their preferred candidates, who are usually Democrats.   \n   This redrawing could give the GOP a sizable boost, as the party seeks to keep control of the House of Representatives.   \n   When the Supreme Court would release its decision is crucial. Time is running out to redo maps, which have to be finalized ahead of a state's filing deadline for candidates seeking to run in a primary election for the midterms.   \"The earlier the decision comes, the more likely the decision is before the date for candidates to declare that they're going to be running, and the more time there is for legislatures to meet and consider maps and redraw their maps,\" says Nick Stephanopoulos, a professor specializing in election law at Harvard Law School.   The next batch of filing deadlines arrives in December. Still, Stephanopoulos notes these cut-off dates are \"just products of state law.\"   \"If a state legislature that's hellbent on gerrymandering wants to do so, it wouldn't be especially surprising if that same legislature delayed the filing deadline, potentially even change the date of the primary election, in order to give themselves enough time to gerrymander,\" Stephanopoulos says.      \n      Last month, Louisiana's Republican-controlled legislature shifted the state's election calendar, pushing its cutoff date for candidate declarations from January to February, and the spring primary from April to May.   The change could take advantage of a possible earlier-than-usual decision from the Supreme Court, which typically releases major rulings in June. Louisiana had asked the justices for a decision in the state's redistricting case early next year, given the calendar crunch.   In Alabama, which has a January deadline ahead of a May primary election, a Republican state lawmaker is proposing to allow a special primary to be held by August if a change to a voting map is \"made at a time too late to be accommodated during the normal primary election schedule.\"   There's no definitive list of districts protected by Section 2   Which other states may rush to respond to a weakening of redistricting requirements under the Voting Rights Act's Section 2 is hard to predict, says Michael Li, a redistricting expert at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's law school.   \n   To begin with, Li explains, there is no definitive list of Section 2 districts that could be affected by the Supreme Court's ruling because states usually don't explain their reasoning for drawing the boundaries of a voting district the way they do. To come up with a list, \"you'd have to go district by district and do a case-by-case assessment of whether there actually is Section 2 liability or not,\" Li says.   And some states may start claiming a district was drawn to get in line with Section 2 even if the law would not have required an opportunity district for racial minority voters.   \"It may just be an excuse to get rid of heavily minority districts even if there's not a legal obligation to do so,\" Li adds.   \n   On the other hand, some Republican-led states may want to try to keep Section 2 districts that are Democratic-leaning in place.   \"There are many places in the country where getting rid of Section 2 districts would make neighboring Republican districts much more competitive. And that may not be what Republicans want,\" Li says. \"It's more efficient for Republicans to have a heavily Black, and thus heavily Democratic, district to sop up as many of these high-turnout Black voters as possible.\"   Another wild card amid the ongoing mid-decade gerrymandering fight is how Democratic-led states would react in a redistricting world without Section 2's current requirements.   \"If blue states elsewhere observe Republicans massively gerrymandering, flipping 10 to 15 minority-opportunity districts and giving Republicans a big structural advantage in the battle for the U.S. House, I think there's going to be enormous pressure to respond to offset those gerrymanders in blue states,\" says Stephanopoulos at Harvard Law School. \"At this point, the only remaining way to do that is by weakening some of the districts that are now held by minority-preferred candidates in blue states.\"   \n   Edited by Benjamin Swasey\n",

That means that migrants' use of safety net programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or Medicare, could be considered when determining whether they should be granted further legal status, such as a green card.   Homeland Security Department officials released a new proposed regulation this week that's set to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday. It would rescind a Biden-era version of the public charge rule, and expand the scope of what public benefits may be considered by immigration officers, to any social or health services people may use.   \n   \"Rescission would restore broader discretion to evaluate all pertinent facts and align with long-standing policy that aliens in the United States should be self-reliant and government benefits should not incentivize immigration,\" the proposal states.   Advocates were quick to criticize the proposal, arguing its new broad scope is too vague and could disincentivize the use of the benefits by immigrants who need them and qualify for them.   \"This dangerous proposal puts the nation's health and economic wellbeing at risk,\" said Adriana Cadenas, executive director of the Protecting Immigrant Families Coalition. \"By creating chaos and confusion, it deters lawfully present immigrants and U.S. citizens from seeking health care and help they need and qualify for under federal law.\"   \n   Politics of social safety net programs   The proposed regulation from DHS comes as the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are making false statements of rampant fraud in immigrants' use of social safety net programs.   People without legal status do not have access to SNAP, the healthcare marketplace, Medicaid and other public benefits.   Still, Congress recently applied further restrictions stripping health coverage and SNAP access from a range of lawfully present immigrants including refugees, asylum seekers and those with other humanitarian protections. It also cut funding from states that use their own funds to provide health care regardless of citizenship status.   \n   The new rule proposed this week takes a broad approach that would also consider state-funded benefits in the review of immigrants' applications.   U.S. citizen children of noncitizens are still eligible for these programs.   \n   Executive order targeted benefits   In February, Trump issued an executive order to end \"all taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal aliens.\"   Trump's order is part of the administration's broader political messaging about Democrats and immigration. It came despite the lack of data to support the idea.   Only about 1% of over- or underpayments for SNAP were related to eligibility for citizenship. This data also does not indicate those without legal status were fraudulently using the program.   \n   Trump in his first term had expanded the scope of benefits that could count as a \"public charge\" on someone's immigration record, and therefore make it harder for them to receive permanent status.   Public health providers said the regulation at the time created a chilling effect on immigrants being afraid to seek benefits they might have access to. The effect was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, when advocates said immigrants feared seeking health resources, such as getting medical care or using a food bank, out of concern that they would be considered a public charge for doing so.   \n   In 2022, the Biden administration unveiled a new rule affecting immigrants and benefits that was similar to the regulation before Trump's 2019 revision. It meant that using benefits such as the SNAP, housing aid or transportation vouchers would not count against green card applicants.\n",

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R) speaks alongside President Trump at a campaign event  when he was a presidential candidate, in Rome, Georgia, on March 9, 2024.\n                \n                    Elijah Nouvelage/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Elijah Nouvelage/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   To the casual observer, President Trump's withdrawal of his political endorsement of Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, calling her a \"traitor\" after she questioned his opposition to releasing Justice Department files on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, may have come as a surprise.   He did reverse course Sunday night, calling on the House to pass a measure to release the files \"because we have nothing to hide.\"   \n   Greene has been one of Trump's most vocal defenders on Capitol Hill since joining the House in 2021. She has also recently apologized for \"toxic politics,\" warned Trump's attacks have jeopardized her family's safety and reiterated her support for Trump's presidency.   Speaking at a press conference with survivors of Epstein's alleged abuse Tuesday morning, Greene called the fallout \"one of the most destructive things\" for people who fought to hold a \"corrupt government accountable.\"   \"Watching this actually turn into a fight has ripped MAGA apart,\" she said. \"The only thing that will speak to the powerful, courageous women behind me is when action is actually taken to release these files, and the American people won't tolerate any other b*******.\"   \n   The public fight over the Epstein files is the culmination of months of criticism from some conservative that goes beyond just this one issue.    Other splits with Trump   Since Trump returned to office in January, there have been several moments in the background — and sometimes foreground — where some on the right say the president hasn't delivered on domestic priorities that \"Make America Great Again\" like he promised on the campaign trail.   For almost every instance, Greene has been there to articulate the disconnect.   \n   When the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear sites in June, Greene was among those who questioned how that fit with Trump's promise to end wars.   \"Six months in, Steve, and here we are turning back on the campaign promises and we bombed Iran on behalf of Israel,\" Greene said on Steve Bannon's War Room show.   As some Republicans expressed concern over humanitarian conditions caused by Israel's war in Gaza, Greene called Israel's actions \"genocide\" on social media.   In October, the Trump White House authorized a $20 billion currency swap with Argentina in an effort to stabilize the South American country's economy and suggested plans to increase Argentine beef imports.   U.S. cattle ranchers and a slew of Republican lawmakers pushed back to little avail.   \n   Speaking to Tucker Carlson last month, Greene said the money the administration is shepherding to Argentina is \"one of the grossest things\" she has ever seen and \"doesn't understand how that is America First.\"   \"It's honestly a punch in the gut to all of our American cattle ranchers and they are furious and rightfully so,\" Greene said.   Then there's Republican unease with things like mass deportations and tariffs, restricting tech visas and redistricting, as different pockets of the party's big tent object to key pieces of Trump's second-term agenda.   Marjorie Taylor Greene hasn't changed   Unlike others who have criticized Trump and moved away from the Republican Party, Greene is still one of the most conservative members of Congress and her clash with Trump does not change her ideological consistency.   Although her apology for prior toxicity, conflict with the president and appearances on forums like The View and CNN might seem to some like a pivot, Greene isn't actually changing anything about her conservative populist message — just noting ways that Republicans haven't lived up to her views.   \n   Over the last few weeks there were also signs that Trump would eventually lash out online and disown Greene politically.   \"I don't know what happened to Marjorie,\" Trump said. \"She's a nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think.\"   Some Republicans — including Greene — would argue that it's Trump who's lost his way.   \"I think that the American people deserve to be put first,\" she said on CNN Sunday. \"That's what 'Make America Great Again,' meant to me and I think that President Trump can do that if he refocuses his effort.\"   At last year's Republican National Convention, Greene called Trump the \"founding father\" of the \"America First\" movement. Now she's asserting that \"founding father\" does not equal sole arbiter of what the movement looks like moving forward.   \n   The president's changing hold over the GOP    Trump has dominated the Republican Party for a decade by creating a big tent of many different — and sometimes conflicting — ideological groups and getting them to agree to his views and priorities. That's starting to change, especially as he faces record unpopularity and continues to break with his base's ideas of conservatism.   Trump will not be on the ballot in next year's midterms, and it's not clear how much influence he will wield over who Republican primary voters pick in the 2028 presidential contest.   In what would always have been a question of what a post-Trump GOP looks like, Greene's criticism is forcing Republicans to confront that question much earlier than they had planned — and with much less certainty about the possible directions the party might go.\n",

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., joined all but one House Republican to vote to release the files following an unexpected blessing for the measure from President Trump on Sunday. Trump's support was a dramatic reversal on a measure that previously deeply divided the GOP and has caused immense fighting among some of Trump's most ardent supporters.   \n   The vote illustrates a rare win for Republicans willing to defy Trump, who has held a tight grip on the GOP-led Congress since his return to office. Republicans who supported the measure said their party needed to make good on a campaign promise to release the files.   The lone no vote came from Louisiana Republican Clay Higgins. In a post on social media, Higgins said the bill \"abandons 250 years of criminal justice procedure,\" and he warned of potential harm for \"witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc.\"    \"If enacted in its current form, this type of broad reveal of criminal investigative files, released to a rabid media, will absolutely result in innocent people being hurt,\" he wrote.    A vote that split Republicans for months   The bipartisan effort — led by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif. — was long fought by Trump and Republican leadership from reaching the House floor. As recently as last week, White House officials met with Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., about her support for releasing the files, but her position was unchanged after the meeting.   Ahead of Tuesday's vote, Massie said that although it took four months to force the vote through a process known as a discharge petition, he was confident it would draw near unanimous support.   \n   \"We fought the president, the attorney general, the FBI director, the speaker of the House and the vice president to get this win,\" Massie said. But \"they're on our side today ... they are finally on the side of justice.\"    Until his about face over the weekend, Trump spent months attacking Republicans for pushing the measure, including Massie and most recently Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. On Sunday, after it became clear a vote in the House was likely to succeed, Trump said Republicans should approve the bill.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., speaks alongside U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., during a news conference on the Epstein Files Transparency Act outside the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday.\n                \n                    Heather Diehl/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Heather Diehl/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Ahead of Tuesday's vote, survivors joined Massie, Greene and Khanna in front of the Capitol and shared harrowing stories of getting pulled into the sex trafficking network as minors, and their subsequent fight for justice. Several took aim at President Trump, saying he had politicized their fight.    One survivor, Jena-Lisa Jones, said watching their push for transparency turn political has been painful to watch.   \"We are hearing the administration say they intend to investigate various Democrats who were friends with Epstein. I beg you President Trump, please stop making this political. It is not about you,\" Jones told reporters. \"You are our president, please start acting like it ... I voted for you, but your behavior on this issue has been a national embarrassment.\"     \n   Greene also addressed the political fight over the Epstein files — and the president's criticism of her more specifically. She said her falling out with Trump \"has torn MAGA apart.\"    \"I was called a traitor by a man that I fought ... six years for, and I gave him my loyalty for free,\" she said. \"He called me a traitor for standing with these women and refusing to take my name off the discharge petition.\"    The path ahead in the Senate    The measure now goes to the Senate, where some lawmakers are pushing for amendments to put further guardrails around what information can be released. Massie and other supporters have urged the Senate not to \"muck up\" the bill and potentially water it down with changes.    \n   On Monday, Trump told reporters at the White House that the Senate can take up the bill as well, and that he would sign it if it passes. Trump does not need legislation in order to approve the files for release, but he told reporters that Congress \"can do whatever they want\" on the vote.   \"I'm all for it,\" Trump said from the Oval Office, but maintained it was a \"hoax\" that he didn't want to \"detract\" from his party's success.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump speaks with reporters from the Oval Office on Monday. Trump said he would sign a bill to release the Epstein files if it passes through Congress.\n                \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   His remarks came after a simple majority of House members signed onto what is known as a discharge petition — a workaround that forces votes without leadership or committee approval. Last week, the chamber's newest member, Rep. Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., became the decisive 218th signature on the petition.   \n   Grijalva's swearing in was delayed for seven weeks after her election, galvanizing Democrats who accused Johnson of stalling in order to put off the vote. The Speaker rejected that claim, saying her oath of office would not be taken until the government shutdown fight was resolved.    Tuesday's vote also comes after a wave of Epstein files were released last week by members on the Republican-led House Oversight Committee. Democrats first released a set of three emails, followed by thousands of pages of new files released by the panel's chairman, James Comer, R-Ky. The documents triggered new questions about the extent of Trump's relationship with the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender before his death in 2019.\n",

Many commenters, including some of Trump's own supporters, hated the idea. They complained that it would result in Americans being in debt for their entire adult lives, essentially renting from a bank. They complained that this type of mortgage would explode the amount of interest homeowners would have to pay over the lifetime of their loans. They complained that borrowers would be stuck paying interest-only payments for many years and be prevented from actually paying down their principal and building equity in their homes.   \n   \"It will ultimately reward the banks, mortgage lenders, and home builders while people pay far more in interest over time and die before they ever pay off their home,\" posted Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green (R-Ga.). \"In debt forever, in debt for life!\"   President Trump \"is creating generational debt,\" said Josh Johnson on The Daily Show. \"They're going to be fighting to get out of grandma's will. Grandkids will be like, 'I barely knew her!'\" (Side note: Josh Johnson is very funny. I'm a fan.)   The uproar over the 50-year mortgage idea reached such a high pitch that apparently the White House was furious with the administration official who pitched President Trump the idea, according to reporting from Politico.   Sure, it won't solve our housing affordability problem. But is a 50-year mortgage really such a crazy idea?   \"It's not quite as outlandish as it sounds,\" says John Campbell, an economist at Harvard University.   \"Honestly, I kind of think it's a fine idea,\" says Eric Zwick, an economist at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business. \"It's not obviously so different from a 30-year fixed mortgage.\"   The 50 vs The 30   First of all, the reality is most homeowners ditch their mortgage well before its end date. Some refinance. Others move.   \n   In America, unlike some other countries, including the UK, you can't take your mortgage with you if you sell your house. So when people sell their house and move, they end their mortgages.   The typical American homeowner spends less than 12 years in their home, according to a Redfin analysis of the U.S. Census data. That's actually high compared to recent history. Back in the early 2000s, Americans typically spent only about seven years in their houses.   \" Most people will not have that 50-year mortgage product for that length of time,\" says Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist of Redfin. \"I think in a world where this product exists, a lot of people might sign up for it initially and then try to refinance later.\"   In other words, the 50-year mortgage would not be a 50-year trap. It would basically serve as another option on the menu for homebuyers looking to finance their homes. And, because you have longer to pay off the loan, it comes with the benefit of having somewhat lower monthly payments. Maybe that could help some secure their dream house or reap the benefits of investing in the housing market.    \"I think affordability is a concern in the housing market,\" Zwick says. \"And one element is the down payment, but another element is the monthly payment. And a longer duration mortgage is gonna lower the monthly payment.\"   And, sure, there are real drawbacks to this sort of financing, including especially a much higher interest bill over the life of the loan and an extended period where homeowners aren't paying down their principal and building equity. But those same issues also arise with the 30-year fixed mortgage, albeit to a lesser degree.   And Americans apparently love the 30-year mortgage. More than 90% of American mortgage holders have one!   The American mortgage market is weird   The fact that so many American homeowners have long-term, fixed rate mortgages, and they're able to basically refinance pretty easily whenever they want, makes the U.S. mortgage market pretty weird compared to most other countries.   \n   We won't get into the complicated history here (we might actually do a Planet Money episode on this history in the future). But, for now, we'll say the 30-year mortgages date back to the Depression era. And they're fundamentally a creature of government intervention. The government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy mortgages from private lenders, allowing them to offload (and socialize) the risks associated with lending large sums of money for decades at fixed interest rates.   Without this intervention, the 30-year mortgage would probably not be so ubiquitous. I mean, think about it. Would you want to lend someone hundreds of thousands of dollars for decades and freeze the amount they will pay you for providing them with that money? What if they lose their jobs or die? What if interest rates skyrocket and you can find much more favorable terms for lending out that money? And then, to boot, if interest rates fall, the borrower can just walk away from that loan and get a new mortgage at any time when economic conditions are more favorable to them? I mean, yikes. No thanks.   A long time ago, Planet Money interviewed financial journalist Bethany McLean about 30-year fixed mortgages, and she described them as \"a financial Frankenstein's monster\" from the perspective of lenders.   Without an important role for the government in backing these loans, \"I don't think any rational bank would offer this product,\" says David Berger, an economist at Duke University.   \" You need the public sector to play an important role for really long duration mortgages to be viable in the financial system,\" says Joseph Gyourko, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.   It helps explain why this sort of mortgage system is so rare in the world.   The Pros of long-term, fixed-rate mortgages    There are some clear benefits of the weird mortgage system we have in the United States. One is lower monthly payments because homebuyers can pay off their loans over 30 years. Another is homebuyers are given an incredible ability to freeze their housing costs in stone and then refinance when it suits them.   \n   Several of the economists we spoke to had 30-year mortgages themselves, and they had refinanced when rates sank below 3 percent a few years ago. They were very nice people, but I hate them now. (I bought a house more recently and the mortgage rate is close to 7 percent).   Anyways, the ability to freeze rates and then refinance later if the opportunity arises is clearly a huge benefit to homebuyers. It offers predictability on your housing costs. And, especially nice, a fixed-rate mortgage basically shields you from inflation and its accompanying higher interest rates. Everything else may get more expensive, but your housing payment actually falls in real terms when there's inflation!   The Cons of long-term, fixed-rate mortgages   That said, as we already alluded to, both 30-year and hypothetical 50-year mortgages come with costs: they tend to have higher interest rates than adjustable rate mortgages and you have a longer period upfront paying interest and not actually paying down your loan much.   But there's more.   If the housing market gets dicey and prices start plummeting, having a large outstanding loan at a fixed interest rate can create serious problems. Gyourko, the economist at Wharton, says long-term, fixed-rate mortgages increase the probability that you can go underwater on your home, a situation where you owe more on your house than it's worth.   \" The borrower on a really long duration loan — 30 or 50 — does not build equity very quickly at all,\" Gyourko says. \" There's a risk that if there's a severe drop in house prices, you go underwater.\"   Going underwater is a nightmare. If you sell, it means the money you get won't cover your debt. It gets much harder to refinance, meaning you're stuck with a higher interest rate than you could otherwise get in a situation where the housing market tanks.   If you have a fixed-interest rate and the housing market tanks, \"your house price goes down and you're kind of stuck,\" says Berger, the economist at Duke. \"No one is gonna lend to you when you're underwater. If you had an adjustable rate, your rate would've just dropped automatically,\" and maybe that would help you make your housing payments and not lose your house.   \n   \"And are you more likely or less likely to be laid off if house prices drop a lot? Answer: more likely,\" Gyourko says. \"So you run that risk of those two events coinciding, and then you've lost a huge amount of your personal wealth.\"   Depending on the state of the economy, the direction of interest rates, and your financial circumstances, it might not make sense to fix your interest rate. Actually, that may be the case right now. Interest rates spiked in 2022 and 2023 and have already started to come down, and many expect them to go down further, especially if the economy enters a recession.   \" Right now, I think it does make more sense for people to get an adjustable rate mortgage,\" Fairweather, the chief economist at Redfin, says.   Adjustable-rate mortgages typically start with lower interest rates than fixed rate mortgages. Fairweather says you can think about the choice to buy a long-term, fixed-rate mortgage instead of an adjustable rate mortgage as effectively paying extra for insurance against future interest rate hikes. And, just like the standard advice for buying any other kind of insurance, \"you don't really want to get insurance if you can afford to self-insure,\" she says. In other words, if you think you could afford the possibility that interest rates spike in the near future, it probably makes sense to get an adjustable rate mortgage.   \" So if you get the adjustable rate mortgage, what I would advise is to make sure you have some room in your budget left over for when the mortgage rate resets potentially at a higher level so that you're not hit with costs that you aren't able to pay,\" Fairweather says. \"But if you could take that savings and you know, put it in your savings account, then you'll probably end up a-okay with an adjustable rate mortgage and actually save money compared to the fixed rate.\"   \n   Fixed-rate mortgages may distort our economy   But there are other, economy-wide issues with having so many mortgage-holders with long-term fixed rates.   One is that the government involvement in the housing market that makes our system of widespread 30-year mortgages possible can occasionally result in big problems for taxpayers, especially if regulators aren't vigilant in preventing shady loan practices. Just see what happened during the global financial crisis back in the late 2000s.   \"The worst possible situation is what happened in the global financial crisis when Fannie and Freddie were basically insolvent, were put on the treasury's balance sheet and to this day remain there,\" Gyourko says.   Another problem with America's weird system of ubiquitous fixed-rate mortgages is that it may weaken the Fed's ability to juice the economy or lower inflation when needed (aka conduct monetary policy).   That's because fixed-rate mortgage holders are shielded from interest rate changes. If everyone had an adjustable rate mortgage, the Fed could maybe more easily juice the economy by lowering people's monthly payments, nudging them to spend more in the economy. That said, if interest rates go low enough, it will induce many American homeowners to refinance, lower their payments, and potentially goad them to increase their spending and boost the economy.   In inflationary times though, when the Fed needs to bring down spending in the economy, the Fed's job may be tougher and more distortionary to the economy. If everyone were on adjustable rates, the Fed could just raise rates and, boom, homeowners would probably start spending less and inflation would come down. But most American homeowners are shielded from rate increases, so it's new homebuyers — often younger people — who feel more of the pain. Some argue that's unfair.   Speaking of unfairness, Harvard's John Campbell points out that maximizing your personal wealth in our weird mortgage system relies on considerable financial literacy, and populations that are poorer and less educated tend to be less financially literate. So this system results in greater inequality.   \n   \"A lot of people don't know when to refinance and they just don't do it,\" Campbell says. \"And there's some very troubling evidence that, in this country, black and Hispanic borrowers are much slower to refinance than white borrowers.\" The result, he says, is they tend to pay higher interest rates.   There's another problem with our system: lock in. This has been talked about in recent years. There are tons of homeowners out there who now have rock-bottom interest rates on their mortgages — like, ahem, many of the very financially literate economists I spoke to — and they're reluctant to move.   Lock-in may be one reason why American home prices have been stubbornly high over the past few years, even as interest rates have spiked. Other countries, where adjustable rate mortgages are more the norm, have seen their housing prices dip a lot more in recent years.   \" I think that their housing markets are more reactive to their overall economies,\" Fairweather says. \"So in other places where there's more adjustable rate mortgages, when interest rates go up, that means that homeowners have a reason to sell because their payments are going up. And if they can't afford them or they don't want to pay them, then they'll put their homes on the market.  In our housing market, that doesn't happen. There is this unequal treatment between first time home buyers and existing homeowners. And it really benefits long-term homeowners.\"   Even more, economists believe that the lock-in that fixed mortgages create is bad for the economy. Many people may be refusing jobs where they could be more productive because they don't want to move.   The real fix for housing affordability   So, yeah, many of the problems identified with the 50-year mortgage idea are also present with the 30-year mortgage.   The real motivation for this idea is to enable more Americans to buy houses. With high prices and higher interest rates than a few years ago, many Americans are priced out.   \n   The economists we spoke to all stressed that this new financial product will not solve the fundamental problem of housing affordability. To do that, we need to start building a lot more homes. Some even said that by juicing demand with this new financial product and not increasing supply, this proposal could actually make housing prices go higher, contributing to the problem.   \"Proposals to help home buyers — whether it's this 50-year mortgage or whether it's Kamala Harris's proposal in her presidential campaign to give money to first time homebuyers — the main beneficiaries are actually the people selling houses,\" Campbell says. \"Because given the supply, if you make it easier for buyers, they're bidding against each other for the same supply. The price is gonna go up. The winner is gonna be the person selling.\"   So, yeah, we need to build more homes. But, in that world, maybe a 50-year mortgage would have some benefits for some people. Of course, they will need to know the facts about this financial product and make sure it's the right product for them.   Berger, the economist at Duke, recommends that the government invest more in helping Americans become more financially literate about mortgages and provide better information about alternative financial options to the 30-year mortgage. This stuff is complicated!\n",

Today's top stories   President Trump will host Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) at the White House today. It's his first visit since the 2018 killing of Washington Post journalist and Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul, which led to global condemnation.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is pictured during a meeting with the US secretary of state at Al Salam Palace in the Red Sea port of Jeddah on June 24, 2019.\n                \n                    Jacquelyn Martin/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jacquelyn Martin/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 The two leaders have business and security deals to announce, NPR's Aya Batrawy tells Up First. The defense pact would give Saudi Arabia guarantees that the U.S. would use military measures if necessary. MBS also wants advanced F-35 jets that currently only Israel flies in the Middle East. The Saudis are also seeking U.S. civilian nuclear technology and advanced AI chips, and in exchange, the crown prince says he is prepared to invest $600 billion in the U.S.   The U.N. Security Council yesterday adopted a U.S.-drafted resolution endorsing Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza and authorizing an international stabilization force for the territory.    🎧 The Security Council resolution only alludes to a possible pathway to Palestinian statehood, Michele Kelemen reports. Russia's Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya, who abstained in the vote, emphasized that the resolution shouldn't serve as a cover for the U.S. and Israel in controlling Gaza, or signal the end of a two-state solution.   \n   The House of Representatives is expected to vote today on a measure to release documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. If it passes, it will then be sent to the Senate. Trump informed reporters yesterday that the Senate could take up the bill and he would sign it if it passes. The measure would compel the Justice Department to release all of its files on Epstein within 30 days.    🎧 NPR's Barbara Sprunt says an interesting element to this process is that Trump has the authority to direct the Justice Department to release documents. The president has done this in other cases with documents such as investigations into the assassinations of the Kennedys and Martin Luther King Jr.   In a Louisiana redistricting case, the Supreme Court's conservative majority seemed inclined to weaken Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act in an October rehearing. Section 2 protects against racial discrimination in the political mapmaking process. Depending on the timing, a ruling of this stature could allow states to redraw congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, particularly in Republican-led southern states, potentially diluting Black voters' chances to elect preferred candidates, usually Democrats.

    "body": "\n      NPR's A Martinez speaks with The Washington Post's Jason Rezaian, a former colleague of slain journalist Jamal Khashoggi, about the Saudi crown prince's White House visit.   \n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  For more on Trump's meeting today with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, we called up Jason Rezaian. He is the director of Press Freedom Initiatives at The Washington Post, the paper where Jamal Khashoggi was a columnist, when, according to a U.S. intelligence report, he was murdered in an operation approved by bin Salman. Jason, you wrote an opinion for The Washington Post, where you described this visit as a costly mistake. What is that cost?JASON REZAIAN: Think it's a mistake for the United States to greenlight the type of behavior that Mohammed bin Salman has been guilty of multiple times. It's a signal to friends and foes alike that you can literally get away with murder if you're the right kind of partner to the United States.MARTÍNEZ: Is it maybe more of a moral mistake as opposed to maybe a different kind of mistake because Saudi Arabia is so entrenched in world economics, in finance and considering what they produce for the world, that, you know, is it maybe more that than anything else?REZAIAN: I think, you know, first and foremost, yes, it's a moral mistake. But we are the United States of America. We are still the last time I checked the leading superpower, and Saudi Arabia is not on par with us. This is a client state. When you have that relationship with smaller countries, even if they possess massive amounts of critically important natural resources and maybe arguably, you know, the most important natural resource, they don't get to dictate the terms of the relationship. We've allowed that to happen in this case, and this young man, who has amassed incredible power in a short period of time and wielded it recklessly, irresponsibly and murderously, if our own intelligence community is to be believed, that's problematic, not just on a moral level, but on a strategic and geopolitical one as well.MARTÍNEZ: President Trump has not believed the United States intelligence in other cases, too. With Vladimir Putin is another example that stands out. When it comes to this particular relationship, is there any way that once President Trump is no longer in office, that the United States can maybe reset the relationship?REZAIAN: There was certainly an opportunity to reset it during the Biden administration, and President Biden chose not to do that. So I think, yes, there's always an opportunity to reset relations and change the course of relations with any country. But in the case of Saudi Arabia, that has not happened. And I and my colleagues at the Washington Post will continue to remind you that one of our colleagues in the not-so-distant past was murdered, and the U.S. intelligence community believes that he was murdered by order of Mohammed bin Salman. And that's not something that we can just kind of wipe under the rug or forget about.MARTÍNEZ: You met bin Salman when he talked with The Washington Post's editorial board. That was back in 2018, which was six months before the disappearance and murder of Khashoggi. What was your takeaway from him back then?REZAIAN: Well, it was an off-the-record setting, so I won't go into too many details, but, you know, I was struck by his lack of humility, his apparent willingness to lie about things that were easily debunkable and I think this potential for a lot of hubris, a lot of people in the room in Washington and in the United States were charmed by this young English speaking, affable prince. But none of those attributes can really undo the incredible damage that has been done on his watch.MARTÍNEZ: Now, you end your piece in The Washington Post by writing, quote, \"we will be dealing with this decision's fallout for a long time.\" How so?REZAIAN: Mohammed bin Salman is 40 years old. He got Saudi Arabia into a protracted conflict with Yemen that was not something that they got out of very easily. He's courted conflict with Iran, and every time comes to the United States, asking - begging for more help. If that's the kind of relationship this is going to be, we'll be cleaning up messes left and right for a long time because, in all likelihood, he'll be around for the better part of the next half century.MARTÍNEZ: Jason Rezaian is the director of Press Freedom Initiatives at The Washington Post and the paper's former correspondent in Tehran. Jason, thank you very much for your thoughts on this.REZAIAN: Thanks, A. I appreciate it.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

She's pictured at the girls' summer camp near her home where she works, in addition to other jobs.\n                \n                    Greta Rybus for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Greta Rybus for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   When Ashley Smith arrived to testify before the Maine Legislature during a committee hearing last spring, she was terrified. \"I was shaking like a leaf in the wind,\" she says.   She told lawmakers that she was there in support of Maine Family Planning, a 50-year-old network of reproductive health clinics where Smith is a patient.   State lawmakers were considering how to make up a funding shortfall from Washington, D.C. where Republicans in Congress aimed to cut off federal funding to clinics that provide abortion.   Smith told the committee that she doesn't have health insurance and that Maine Family Planning's nonprofit clinics were her only source of health care.   \n   \"In the last four years I've received care there, not once did I have an abortion,\" Smith testified. \"I did, however, have access to STD and STI (sexually transmitted disease and infection) testing, referrals for thyroid testing and blood panels, pap smears, breast examinations, referrals for mammograms, and a premenstrual dysphoric disorder diagnosis. The last two I listed saved my life,\" she said.   Smith, who's 36, says she was inspired to testify and write an op-ed, because she's worried about what would happen if Maine Family Planning had to close in the face of deep federal funding cuts. \"I can't imagine what would happen to our communities if we lost such a keystone — that's what really fueled my fire,\" she says.   Maine Family Planning did get a year of additional funding from the state, but it also lost Medicaid revenue for one year with the passage of President Trump's tax and spending bill — a 20% hit to the organization's funding.   \n   The \"defund\" effort beyond Planned Parenthood   In Maine, abortion is legal and widely supported by the electorate. In a poll released by the Pew Research Center this summer, 72% of Mainers say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. The state legislature has moved to expand access to abortion care since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade three years ago.   Now, the Trump administration and congressional Republicans are using federal funding as a lever to restrict abortion access in states, like Maine, where it is legal and protected by state law.   \n   Republicans and anti-abortion rights activists have long sought to end Medicaid dollars flowing to Planned Parenthood for any reason, arguing that federal reimbursement even for unrelated services indirectly supports abortion in clinics that specialize in reproductive health. In July, they were finally able to accomplish that goal.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Maine Family Planning operates 18 clinics around the state, including this one in Augusta, Maine. It provides primary care in addition to a full range of reproductive health care.\n                \n                    Greta Rybus for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Greta Rybus for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   The provision in the law blocks federal Medicaid funds from being paid to reproductive health nonprofits that receive more than $800,000 in Medicaid payments in a year. It took effect when the bill was signed by President Trump on July 4. (Republican senators changed the timeline from a decade to a single year of defunding to comply with Senate rules.)   Very few organizations fit the $800,000+ description. Planned Parenthood is one of them, another is Health Imperatives in Massachusetts, and so is Maine Family Planning.   \"Where am I going to go?\"   About half of Maine Family Planning's patients are on Medicaid. The organization is no longer reimbursed for their visits.   That's about $2 million gone, says George Hill, Maine Family Planning's president and CEO.   \"That's difficult. You have to make some difficult decisions,\" he says. \"Either you generate more revenue, or you cut costs.\"   \n   On Oct. 1, the organization let patients know they would be ending primary care services at the end of the month at three clinics in the far reaches of the state: Houlton, Presque Isle and Ellsworth. That change affected nearly 1,000 patients, including patients on Medicaid and those with private insurance.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                George Hill, Maine Family Planning's president and CEO has worked in health care for almost 40 years. \"We have a mission,\" explains Hill, \"to make sure that the full range of sexual and reproductive health care is available to as many patients as possible.\"\n                \n                    Selena Simmons-Duffin/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Selena Simmons-Duffin/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"The day that our portal message went out [to patients], the phones just started ringing off the hook,\" says clinical services director Melissa Gray. \"It was the same message over and over again: 'Where am I going to go? You folks have helped me with things that nobody else had helped me with, I never felt like you were judging me. I don't want a different provider, I want to keep seeing you.'   \n   \"It was really heartbreaking and a hard couple of days for staff,\" she says.   Gray and her team spent all of October trying to connect those patients to new doctors, and making sure they were set up with enough refills of medications to last them when there were long waits before they could be seen by the new practice. Maine has a health care provider shortage, which made that task harder, she says. \"There already weren't enough providers — we were getting new patient requests all the time,\" she says. \"Now there's less.\"   The goal of scaling back primary care was to try to preserve family planning for longer. All 18 of their family planning clinics around the state are still open. \"We have a mission,\" explains Hill. \"And our mission is to make sure that the full range of sexual and reproductive health care is available to as many patients as possible.\"   They're still seeing Medicaid patients for sexual and reproductive health without getting paid for it.   A stack of billing sheets, just in case   One of their clinics is in Thomaston, Maine, a small town along the coast. Vanessa Shields-Haas is the nurse practitioner there. The clinic is bright and friendly, with colorful \"condom art\" on a bulletin board in the waiting room.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The rotating seasonal scenes in the waiting room at the Maine Family Planning clinic in Thomaston are crafted from colored condoms.  \"I think they're fun,\" nurse practitioner Vanessa Shields-Haas says. \"Patients love them.\"\n                \n                    Selena Simmons-Duffin/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Selena Simmons-Duffin/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Shields-Haas is infuriated by the funding cuts to Maine Family Planning and what they mean for her patients.   \"A lot of my patients — maybe they're working at a hotel or they're waiting tables, they're serving lobster rolls to hungry tourists, starting oyster farms,\" she says. \"These are people that are working really hard.\"   She does a lot for them: fertility treatments, biopsies, prescription refills, even vasectomies. And she's continued to do all those things for her patients covered by Medicaid without getting reimbursed.   \"We haven't been turning them away,\" she says. \"I fill out the billing sheets and we stack them up in the event that we could be reimbursed possibly in the future.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Vanessa Shields-Haas has been providing medical care for patients covered by Medicaid without getting reimbursed. \"We haven't been turning them away,\" she says.\n                \n                    Selena Simmons-Duffin/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Selena Simmons-Duffin/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   She says patients are confused by what's happening, and many have sent her messages asking if they can still go to her for care. She assures them that they can, although she worries about the future.   \n   \"Unfortunately, decision-makers in Washington are having such a profound impact on what we can and can't do,\" she says. \"Not being able to be reimbursed for the visits is really crippling, financially.\"   A legal challenge   For George Hill, political interference in sexual and reproductive health care is nothing new. \"I've been in the field since 1987, so close to 40 years, [through] several different presidential administrations that have been hostile to the care that we now provide,\" he says. \"This is — by volume and velocity — probably the worst that we have seen.\"   Just weeks after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into law, Maine Family Planning filed a lawsuit to challenge the provision that blocks them from getting Medicaid funding.   \"The lawsuit was filed essentially because Maine Family Planning says this is unfair and it's wrong and it's unconstitutional to be singling out and targeting certain providers based on this animus against abortion,\" says Autumn Katz, interim director of litigation at the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represents the organization in its lawsuit.   \n   The federal government defended the provision in a court filing, arguing that it promotes Congress' \"goal of reducing abortion\" and suggesting Maine Family Planning could get its funding back if it stopped providing abortion.   (Planned Parenthood filed a separate lawsuit and was able to secure an injunction. In Maine, the injunction request was denied and so the provision is in effect while the lawsuit works its way through the courts.)   Another threat looms   Anti-abortion efforts at the federal level may not stop with the Medicaid law.   Another 20% of Maine Family Planning's budget comes from the federal government through Title X — a decades-old grant program that enables the clinics to see uninsured patients. In October, the Trump administration fired the whole team that works on that program. Those firings were reversed in mid-November as part of the deal to end the shutdown, but the administration could try to end the program in another way.   \n   Hill says he isn't sure what's going to happen next with the lawsuit and Medicaid, or Title X, but he says they're not giving up. The state law that patient Ashley Smith advocated for provides short term funding from the state to help fill the budget gap. Hill says they're exploring new potential partnerships and new ways to raise revenue they haven't tried before.   He quotes Rep. Pat Schroeder, the late Democratic lawmaker from Colorado: \"You can't roll up your sleeves and get to work if you're wringing your hands,\" he says. \"We're going to continue to do the work. We're not going to stop.\"\n",

The event brought together faith leaders, food bank workers and furloughed federal employees who demanded that the Trump administration release billions in emergency funds for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\n                \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Two federal judges ordered the Trump administration to use emergency funding to provide SNAP benefits for the 42 million people who rely on the program to feed their families.   But it was unclear hours after the rulings Friday afternoon how much assistance may be provided or when it might come.   U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston ruled the Trump administration has until Monday to decide whether to pay at least partial SNAP food benefits. She declined to issue a temporary restraining order to force the administration to act before the funds run out tomorrow, finding that resuming payments at some point can still avoid irreparable harm to SNAP recipients.   \n   In Rhode Island, U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. granted a temporary restraining order while saying ending SNAP payments would harm not only people, but also local economies. The judge said the Trump administration \"must distribute\" aid from emergency reserves as soon as possible. He also said it must submit a plan on how it would comply with his order, or \"at least an update,\" by noon on Monday, Ocean State Media reported.   It is not yet clear how the two court orders would impact the flow of benefits, which are set to run out Saturday.   Hours after the rulings, President Trump posted on social media that he has directed government lawyers to find a way to pay SNAP benefits. \"If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay,\" he wrote. However, it's not clear what sort of legal direction the administration was seeking.   The Trump administration had said it did not have enough money to pay November's SNAP benefits because of the government shutdown and that it lacked legal authority to use contingency funds set aside for emergencies.   \n   Talwani acknowledged her order would leave millions of people without assistance starting Saturday. She issued her decision in a case filed by two dozen Democratic-led states that sued over the administration's decision to suspend the nation's largest anti-hunger program for the first time in its history.   The judge said the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, must use emergency funds to keep SNAP going. She also said other money is legally available but left the decision of how much benefits to distribute up to the administration.   \n   In Rhode Island, McConnell issued his decision in a lawsuit filed by eight cities and nonprofit and business groups.   The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, helps 1 in 8 U.S. residents, who get an average of $186 a month.    Loading... \n",

He attended the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, addressed U.S. troops in Japan and met with China's President Xi Jinping in South Korea.   Here are five takeaways from the president's first visit to the region in his second term.   1. U.S.-China trade relations have mostly stabilized …   On the flight back to Washington after his meeting with Xi on Thursday, Trump said the tariff rate on Chinese exports would be lowered from 57% to 47%. The 10-point drop comes because Xi committed to trying to decrease the amount of fentanyl coming into the U.S. That issue has been a priority for Trump, who months ago put an extra 20% tariff on China because of fentanyl.   \n   Trump also said that China would resume buying soybeans from the U.S., which has been a major issue for American farmers since China had halted those purchases.   China also agreed to back off the extra limits it had put on rare earths exports, in exchange for the U.S. scaling back some of its own export restrictions. That agreement will hold for a year.   Those minerals are critical for the U.S. and other countries because they are used in military equipment and other technology.   2. But a finalized deal isn't done   \"It was an outstanding group of decisions I think that was made,\" Trump told reporters after his meeting with Xi. \"There wasn't too much left out there.\"   But he wasn't specific about what exactly is left for China and the U.S. to discuss.   Trump said he is scheduled to visit China next April, which will be followed by another meeting with Xi in either Washington or in Florida.   \n   Dennis Wilder, a former national security official and a professor at Georgetown University, said the meeting between Trump and Xi gave \"momentum\" for trade talks between the two countries to continue.   \"Both sides have not given up their trade weapons but merely have agreed to stop firing as long as both sides hold to the agreements,\" Wilder said.   3. Diplomacy = flattery   A charm offensive was on full display in Malaysia, Japan and Korea as leaders tried to cater to Trump ahead of trade talks and other negotiations. Trump's style of foreign relations is often rooted in personal relationships; heads of state, when visiting Washington, have tried to appease Trump to have a smoother relationship with the president.   \n   That strategy came forward in Asia, too. Nearly 100 dancers in Malaysia greeted Trump on the red carpet at his first stop. In Japan, Trump was gifted late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's golf clubs and the newly elected prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, announced that she was going to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Dancers perform as President Trump boards Air Force One at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang, Malaysia, as he departs for Japan on Monday.\n                \n                    Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Trump's arrival in South Korea was also full of fanfare — \"YMCA,\" a song that's played at Trump's rallies for nearly a decade, was performed on the tarmac in Busan when Air Force One landed. President Lee Jae Myung gave Trump a replica of a golden crown significant to Korea's history. Trump also got a gold medal and was awarded Korea's highest civilian honor.   4. Trump wants to be seen as a peacemaker   Trump has renamed the Department of Defense as the Department of War, he's deployed National Guard troops around different U.S. cities and in recent weeks, he has ordered strikes on a number of boats in the eastern Pacific allegedly carrying drugs.   But on this trip in Asia, Trump wanted to emphasize his role as a peacemaker.   His first stop in Malaysia at the ASEAN summit included presiding over the signing of a peace agreement between Cambodia and Thailand. A border dispute reignited between the two countries earlier this year, and Trump helped broker a ceasefire by threatening to increase tariffs.   In his remarks in Kuala Lumpur, Trump said he was in Scotland playing golf when he got on the phone with the leaders from Cambodia and Thailand, and Malaysia, who also helped broker peace.   \"You caused me very good entertainment. I could've had a lot of fun, but this is much more fun for me than anything,\" Trump said.   Even before the trip, Trump had been claiming his administration has ended eight global conflicts. Russia's war in Ukraine hasn't been one of them, which has frustrated Trump.   \n   But it's possible he adds another conflict to solve to his peacemaking list. Though he didn't meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un while in Asia, Trump left the door open for a future meeting and said his administration would work on tensions between North and South Korea, which never formally ended their war.   5. Trump's making deals abroad, but Congress is still at a standstill   Despite the dealmaking and peacemaking on the world's stage, Trump came home to a federal government that's still shut down, federal workers who aren't getting paid and critical programs like SNAP running out of funding. The president hasn't shown the same interest in making deals across the aisle with Democrats to reopen the government.   Instead, he returned to Washington on Thursday night and mused on Truth Social about using the \"nuclear option,\" which he said would be to get rid of the filibuster. That would allow Senate Republicans to pass a funding agreement with a simple majority, not a 60-vote majority that would require support from Democrats.   \"We are in power and if we did what we should be doing, it would IMMEDIATELY end this ridiculous, Country destroying 'SHUT DOWN',\" Trump said, adding that ending the filibuster would \"take advantage\" of Democrats. Democrats have refused to vote in favor of the agreement to temporarily fund the government unless it includes a measure that would extend the tax credit that lowers the cost of health insurance premiums, which is set to expire at the end of the year.\n",

    "body": "\n       Loading... \n   For many young voters, the future doesn't feel quite so bright. Gen Z and millennial Americans are feeling increasingly demoralized about their economic prospects, and some say their concerns have gone unaddressed by elected officials.   In communities of all kinds, voters in their 20s and 30s are confronting a financial reality of rising costs, mounting debt and minimal wage growth. But how is this changing their political views?   It's a question that NPR put to readers. We received more than 1,100 submissions from across the political spectrum from almost every state in the U.S.   \n   Many described a similar reality — one where economic worries loom large over their everyday lives and erode their faith in the ability of those in power. Taken together, their responses paint a portrait of a generation of voters discouraged by what they see in Washington and who increasingly feel as if they have no political home.   It is important to note that the responses are not from a representative sample of all young voters. But what readers shared helps highlight a steep challenge facing Democrats and Republicans alike as they work to win over these voters, who are collectively expected to make up more than half the electorate in 2028. Here is a snapshot of what readers shared.    These responses have been edited for clarity and length.   Young voters are united in disappointment    Many young Americans feel a collective sense of disillusionment in the political system, and respondents told NPR that their financial struggles are exacerbating that pain.   Recent polling seems to underscore the frustrations many shared with NPR. Just a fraction of young voters feel confident in government institutions, with less than 2 in 10 of those 18 to 29 years old saying they trust the federal government to do the right thing most or all of the time, according to the latest Harvard Youth Poll, from this spring. Similarly, only 16% of those under 30 believe democracy is working well for them, according to a report from the young voter research organization, CIRCLE.    Loading... \n   Their life goals are on hold — for some indefinitely    Young people shared that one of the biggest drivers feeding into their sense of political frustration is the struggle to get ahead financially or even just stay afloat.   When asked what economic success looks like for them, respondents didn't want lavish mansions or high-priced sports cars. Instead, their ambitions were more modest, often centering on the need for financial stability. Yet even that felt out of reach for many.   Young Americans said goals like owning a home, starting a family or pursuing a dream job feel increasingly like a luxury rather than an achievable milestone. Financial concerns are forcing them to reframe what's possible and sometimes choose one goal over another.    Loading... \n   Financial roadblocks standing in the way    Many are navigating a unique economic moment where both median home and rental prices, for example, have risen at a faster pace than wages for roughly two decades. People are also waiting longer to buy homes. The median age of a first-time homebuyer in 2024 stood at 38, 10 years older than in the early 1990s, according to the National Association of Realtors.   Debt is also a barrier. Despite collectively making up the largest share of the labor force and being on track to surpass older generations in educational attainment, Generation Z and millennials have higher rates of student loan debt and more mortgage debt.   Family planning looks different as well. People are deciding to have fewer children or not start a family. Last year, the U.S. fertility rate hit a record low, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.    Loading... \n   They watched their parents succeed, but struggle themselves   In the face of financial challenges, respondents say they're struggling to reach or build upon the lifestyle achieved by their parents and grandparents, making some feel less hopeful about the future.   Even with hard work and a degree, many readers said they have accomplished less than their parents had by the same age. This has led many to feel disillusioned with, even betrayed by, the very system that promised to set them up for success and stability.    Loading... \n   Despite losing faith in most politicians, populism resonates   Young Americans see very few politicians actively addressing their concerns around affordability, leading some to lose faith in the effectiveness of either major political party.   \"Over time, I've come to see our two-party system as two wings on the same bird,\" explained 27-year-old respondent Sophie Howard, from Davenport, Iowa.   When asked which politicians are speaking to their concerns, liberal-leaning respondents frequently highlighted progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Zohran Mamdani, the Democrats' nominee for mayor in New York City. Readers on the conservative side often coalesced around President Trump and Vice President Vance.   Many respondents returned to the same point: that they're most inspired by populist-style leaders who focus on disrupting the status quo. It's a message that young people say goes past political labels, pushing some to opposite poles on the ideological spectrum and leaving others feeling stuck in the middle.    Loading... \n",

    "body": "\n      With federal food benefits hanging in the balance, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are facing mounting pressure to end the government shutdown.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Tomorrow, things are going to get a lot worse for many Americans in the midst of this shutdown. SNAP food benefits will run out for about 42 million people.A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  Saturday's also when open enrollment begins on federal insurance exchanges, and premiums are expected to more than double on average. Democrats want to extend health care subsidies to keep those costs down. But Thursday, major airlines asked Congress to pass Republicans' stopgap funding plan. Here's United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SCOTT KIRBY: It's been 30 days and - well, I don't have a position on which partisan side and how things should be settled with health care. It has been 30 days. I also think it is time to pass a clean CR.MARTÍNEZ: The largest union for federal employees already made a similar call. So how long can Democrats continue to hold out?FADEL: NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt went to a town hall in Maryland last night to hear what Democratic Senator Angela Alsobrooks and her constituents had to say. Good morning, Barbara.BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Good morning.FADEL: First, I just want to know, are Democratic lawmakers are the only ones feeling pressure right now?SPRUNT: Well, you know, on Capitol Hill, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are talking a lot about the consequences of this shutdown - people going without pay, the impending loss of some nutrition assistance. But that hasn't translated to any concrete action. Both sides remain incredibly dug in. And so at this town hall last night, I asked the senator, so how does this end?ANGELA ALSOBROOKS: I think that the pain that has been allowed to grow impacts all of us. It's not just Democrats. Republicans are suffering too. And I think some of my colleagues will soon find out that their constituents are suffering as well, and that we ought to come together and negotiate.SPRUNT: So you just asked me about pressure. It seems like Democrats are banking on Republican constituents applying pressure to Republican lawmakers.FADEL: OK. So you're at this town hall. We heard unions already calling on Democrats to pass the continuing resolution from the Republicans and get it over with. Is that also the sentiment you heard from voters?SPRUNT: No. I mean, in fact, the people that I spoke with at this event told me they want Senate Democrats to hold that line when it comes to withholding their votes, hoping to get negotiations on health care. Here's Christina Thompson (ph), one of the attendees.CHRISTINA THOMPSON: I think they should hold out as long as possible. It's clear whose shutdown this is, you know? The Republicans hold all the leverage and all the cards, and if we back out now, then, you know, we're just showing again that the party has no backbone.FADEL: Now, this is on track to become the longest running government shutdown. The last long one was in 2019 for 34 days. What are some of the ways that make this shutdown feel different?SPRUNT: Well, Democrats have traditionally been hesitant to shut the government down, and we don't even have to cast too far back down on memory lane here.FADEL: Right.SPRUNT: Back in March, there was a sense that Democrats may hold out on supporting a bill that would fund the government. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ended up voting alongside Republicans. A shutdown was avoided. And I was with a lot of House Democrats at a retreat when he made that announcement signaling his support, and they were very upset about it. And their thinking was, as the party in the minority, they have very few opportunities to force a negotiation. And they viewed the shutdown as one of the only - if not the only - ways to influence the process. So that brings us to today. And since the shutdown began, we have seen Democrats really united. They are exerting this one leverage point, as they've called it. They don't appear to be backing down, and they seem to think that Republicans will take the blame, not them.FADEL: And what about Republicans? What's their response?SPRUNT: Their message has been, hey, we are holding votes to fund the government. Democrats aren't voting with us. If they care about things like funding nutrition aid and paying air traffic controllers, then they should vote with us. Here's Senate Majority Leader John Thune earlier this week.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN THUNE: This isn't a political game. These are real people's lives that we're talking about. And you all have just figured out 29 days in that, oh, there might be some consequences.SPRUNT: And we should say, the Senate has quite literally left the building. They've left for the weekend.FADEL: That's NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt. Thank you, Barbara.SPRUNT: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

That wouldn't be particularly notable, except there is a government shutdown that is creating more and more real-world consequences, including that impending lapse in SNAP benefits. This is not an isolated trip for the president. NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports Trump has spent nearly two weeks outside of Washington since the shutdown began October 1.TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: When President Trump arrived in Malaysia earlier this week, he was greeted by a brass band and dancers. Trump got in on it, too, as described in this color commentary that went out on the White House video feed.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: In rare, lighthearted moment, President Donald Trump has joined the Malaysian dancers, moving to the cheerful rhythm of the ensemble.KEITH: It was the start of a weeklong trip to Asia that included stops in three countries, but it also marked a significant break with how past presidents, including Trump himself, have approached government shutdowns. They have typically avoided the bad optics of skipping town during a crisis. In 1995, President Clinton canceled a trip to Japan during a shutdown. Republicans controlled Congress at the time. Leon Panetta was Clinton's chief of staff.LEON PANETTA: We spent a number of days in the Oval Office basically negotiating with both Speaker Gingrich and majority leader Bob Dole because the last thing we wanted to do was to have the government shut down.KEITH: During the 2013 shutdown, then-President Obama canceled a four-nation Asia trip. And in 2019, President Trump had a trip planned to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If the shutdown continues, I won't go.KEITH: The shutdown continued, and he didn't go. That shutdown lasted 35 days, the longest on record. An NPR analysis finds that during that period, Trump only left Washington for six days, and there were no visits to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.This time is quite different. During the monthlong shutdown, Trump has gone to Florida twice, golfed at his club in Virginia,and visited the Middle East and Asia - 13 days on the road so far with more to come. The White House position on negotiating is different now, too. Vice President Vance spoke to the press yesterday.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JD VANCE: We're not going to give in on policy demands under the threat of hostage taking.KEITH: He said Republicans won't negotiate with Democrats until they vote to reopen the government. The GOP-controlled House of Representatives has been gone all month. The Senate voted 13 times on the same funding bill and failed each time without enough Democratic support. Democrats say they want to negotiate. Doug Heye was a House Republican aid during the 2013 government shutdown, and he doesn't fault the president for leaving now.DOUG HEYE: Whether he's going to events in foreign countries or just sort of living life, none of that interferes with what the core argument is, which is Republicans saying, we've done our job - Democrats, step up and do yours. To do anything different would actually cut against their own messaging.KEITH: But Leon Panetta, who served in Congress and multiple Democratic administrations, sees it differently.PANETTA: They're basically walking away from the very responsibility that they should be exercising as elected officials. I mean, that's what's depressing about all of this.KEITH: White House spokesperson Anna Kelly defended the president's travel, saying he secured massive investments in the U.S. economy.

It requires 60 votes in a full Senate to overcome a filibuster, giving Democrats a check on the 53-seat Republican majority that led to the start of the Oct. 1 shutdown when the new fiscal year began.   Trump's call to terminate the filibuster could alter the ways the Senate and congressional dealmaking operate, with the president saying in his post that he gave a \"great deal\" of thought to the choice on his flight back from Asia on Thursday.   \n   Trump spent the past week with foreign leaders in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, finishing his tour by meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.   The president declared the trip a success because of a trade truce with China and foreign investment planned for American industries, but he said one question kept coming up during his time there about why did \"powerful Republicans allow\" the Democrats to shut down parts of the government.   His call to end the filibuster came at a moment when certain senators and House Speaker Mike Johnson believed it was time for the government shutdown to come to an end. It's unclear if lawmakers will follow Trump's lead, rather than finding ways to negotiate with Democrats.   \n   From coast to coast, fallout from the dysfunction of a shuttered federal government is hitting home: Alaskans are stockpiling moose, caribou and fish for winter, even before SNAP food aid is scheduled to shut off. Mainers are filling up their home-heating oil tanks, but waiting on the federal subsidies that are nowhere in sight.   Flights are being delayed with holiday travel around the corner. Workers are going without paychecks. And Americans are getting a first glimpse of the skyrocketing health care insurance costs that are at the center of the stalemate on Capitol Hill.   \n   \"People are stressing,\" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, as food options in her state grow scarce.   \"We are well past time to have this behind us.\"   While quiet talks are underway, particularly among bipartisan senators, the shutdown is not expected to end before Saturday's deadline when Americans' deep food insecurity — one in eight people depend on the government to have enough to eat — could become starkly apparent if federal SNAP funds run dry.   Money for military, but not food aid   The White House has moved money around to ensure the military is paid, but refuses to tap funds for food aid. In fact, Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" signed into law this summer, delivered the most substantial cut ever to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, projected to result in some 2.4 million people off the program.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Vice President JD Vance speaks to the media alongside Sean O'Brien, President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, from left, Chris Sununu, president & CEO of Airlines for America, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, and aviation industry representatives, about the impact of the government shutdown on the aviation industry, outside of the West Wing of the White House, Thursday, Oct. 30, 2025, in Washington.\n                \n                    Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n    \n\n   \n   At the same time, many Americans who purchase their own health insurance through the federal and state marketplaces, with open enrollment also beginning Saturday, are experiencing sticker shock as premium prices jump.   \"We are holding food over the heads of poor people so that we can take away their health care,\" said Rev. Ryan Stoess, during a prayer with religious leaders at the U.S. Capitol.   \"God help us,\" he said, \"when the cruelty is the point.\"   Deadlines shift to next week   The House remains closed down under Johnson for the past month. Senators are preparing to depart Thursday for the long weekend. Trump returns late Thursday after a whirlwind tour of Asia.   That means the shutdown, in its 30th day, appears likely to stretch into another week if the filibuster remains. If the shutdown continues, it could become the longest in history, surpassing the 35-day lapse that ended in 2019, during Trump's first term, over his demands to build the U.S.-Mexico border wall.   \n   The next inflection point comes after Tuesday's off-year elections — the New York City mayor's race, as well as elections in Virginia and New Jersey that will determine those states' governors. Many expect that once those winners and losers are declared, and the Democrats and Republicans assess their political standing with the voters, they might be ready to hunker down for a deal.   \"I hope that it frees people up to move forward with opening the government,\" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.   GOP cut SNAP in Trump's big bill   The Republicans, who have majority control of Congress, find themselves in an unusual position, defending the furloughed federal workers and shuttered programs they have long sought to cut — including most recently with nearly $1 trillion in reductions in Trump's big tax breaks and spending bill.   Medicaid, the health care program, and SNAP food aid, suffered sizable blows this summer, in part by imposing new work requirements. For SNAP recipients, many of whom were already required to work, the new requirements extend to older Americans up to age 64 and parents of older school-age children.   House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Republicans now \"have the nerve\" to suggest it's a political strategy to withhold food aid.   \"We are trying to lift up the quality of life for the American people,\" Jeffries of New York said about his party.   \"The American people understand that there's a Republican health care crisis,\" he said. \"The American people understand Republicans enacted the largest cut to nutritional assistance in American history when they cut $186 billion from their one, big, ugly bill.\"   During the summer debate over Trump's big bill, Johnson and other Republicans railed against what they characterized as lazy Americans, riding what the House speaker calls the \"gravy train\" of government benefits.   The speaker spoke about able-bodied young men playing video games while receiving Medicaid health care benefits and insisted the new work requirements for the aid programs would weed out what they called \"waste, fraud and abuse.\"   \n   \"What we're talking about, again, is able-bodied workers, many of whom are refusing to work because they're gaming the system,\" Johnson said in spring on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"   \"And when we make them work, it'll be better for everybody, a win-win-win for all,\" he said.   What remains out of reach, for now, is any relief from the new health care prices, posted this week, that are expected to put insurance out of reach for many Americans when federal subsidies that help offset those costs are set to expire at the end of the year.   Democrats have been holding out for negotiations with Trump and the Republicans to keep those subsidies in place. Republicans say they can address the issue later, once the government reopens.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's A Martinez speaks to Democratic Gov. Matt Meyer of Delaware, who declared a state of emergency to temporarily fund SNAP benefits for his state's recipients of the federal food aid.   \n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  Some governors are using state funds to try and close the federal gap in food assistance. In Delaware, Democratic Governor Matt Meyer declared a state of emergency to temporarily replace SNAP benefits with money from the state. Governor, about 11% of Delaware's residents receive SNAP benefits. Will they all be covered, at least for the time being?MATT MEYER: Yes, they will. One in 9 Delawarians rely on SNAP - 119,000 people. Two-thirds of them are families with children. Thirty-six percent are family members who are seniors - or have family members who are seniors or with disabilities.MARTÍNEZ: And for how long will they be covered for in Delaware?MEYER: Well, you know, I made a promise to our people that we're going to do everything we can, look at our budget and move money around to feed our people as long as we can. Normally, SNAP assistance is provided one time on a monthly basis. A card is loaded electronically. We're going to do that weekly, just looking at what the federal government is doing. We don't believe this is a state financial responsibility, but as a governor, we need to stand up and lead in this time and make sure in one of the wealthiest countries in the world our people literally don't go hungry.MARTÍNEZ: Do you think Delaware will be OK at least through November?MEYER: We will definitely be OK through November. To be honest, there's a...MARTÍNEZ: OK.MEYER: ...Parking lot project where - that's in our budget to build a parking lot - $20 million that will get us enough money to get through November. We're willing to shift money around, put that parking lot project on delay, and we're looking at other things too if necessary.MARTÍNEZ: Now, SNAP's a federal program. So how do you direct state money to SNAP residents? Don't you need approval from lawmakers to do that?MEYER: Yeah. It's a great question that's much more complicated behind the scenes than I have time to explain. But putting money on a card that's sort of federally designated is not easy. We're technically not doing it under the SNAP program. We're originating a new program during the state emergency that effectively fills the card with resources based on state rules. So we're trying to make it as simple as possible for SNAP users, for mostly working Americans who are struggling in this time to have money on their cards. So Delawarians with SNAP cards, they're not going to see any difference from October to November except that their benefits will be received on a weekly basis and not once on a monthly basis.MARTÍNEZ: Would that money - would that state money be money that you'd want replenished by the federal government? Is that something that you would want to do?MEYER: I think it's a federal responsibility. For 86 years, since the food stamp program was created in 1939, this has been a federal responsibility. So, yes. I think we're one of 25 states. We have a fantastic attorney general, Kathy Jennings, who was among those who sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture, saying, you have the money to pay this. And if and when federal money does come, either through this discretionary fund at the federal level or through later refunding, we're going to use that money and use it to fill our state coffers.MARTÍNEZ: The USDA says it can't legally use contingency funds to cover regular SNAP benefits. What's your response to that?MEYER: Well, we'll see what the court says.MARTÍNEZ: OK.MEYER: I think it's - I have a legal background, and I think there have been several times before when this administration, you know, in my nine months in office, have said things with a hundred percent certainty that turned out not to be legally accurate. So we're a country of law, and we'll see what the judges say.MARTÍNEZ: Governor, do you feel that the state of Delaware is being let down by the federal government? Not necessarily just the administration, but Congress - the House, the Senate and the White House put together right now.MEYER: It's not lost on me that on the same day I declared a state of emergency, something no governor in our state's history - the First State - no governor has ever had to do. Nvidia surpassed $5 trillion in market capitalization. We are a rich country at a time when stock markets are hitting records. This is a total failure of leadership. And I'm hoping - I've also made it very clear to the people of Delaware, to state legislators, other elected officials that this is probably not the first chip to fall. There's more coming.I recognize that this stalemate in Washington is largely about health care. And right now, lawmakers could decide to end the shutdown and fund programs like SNAP so governors like myself don't have this problem. But then we're going to have another huge problem that health care premiums will be doubling for millions of Americans. So these are all self-inflicted crises. And in a wealthy country like ours, we got to find a better way.MARTÍNEZ: Just a few moments left, Governor. How do you square that with your constituents when they ask you, like, why is this happening? What do you tell them?MEYER: Well, first of all, I tell my constituents you're going to eat. You're going to have food benefits that we've had for as long as the SNAP program has existed. So I tell them my job and our job as state leaders is to protect you. In terms of what's going on in Washington, listen, there's a Republican executive. There's a Republican president, President Trump. There's a Republican legislature. The courts - Supreme Court is largely controlled by the Republican Party. This is the direction the country's going in now. It's not the direction that I want it to go in. I appreciate that Democratic legislators are fighting, and we got to fight. But while we're fighting, we got to make sure people can eat.MARTÍNEZ: That's Democratic Governor Matt Meyer of Delaware. Governor, thank you.MEYER: Thanks so much.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Many federal workers have missed paychecks, including air traffic controllers, who are working unpaid.    Meanwhile, uncertainty remains for tens of millions of people who rely on federal food and nutrition benefits like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, previously known as food stamps. The benefits had been set to expire on Saturday due to the government shutdown. Two federal judges on Friday ordered the Trump administration to use emergency funding to provide the benefits.

A partisan argument over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces led to the current shutdown. Some 24 million people — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans.    Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the health care of undocumented immigrants. That is not true.   Democrats in the Senate refused to vote for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP spending and tax bill that passed over the summer.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), joined by House Minority Whip Katherine Clark (D-Mass.)

Plus, why Democrats are casting the government shutdown as a health care showdown.   — Selena Simmons-Duffin, NPR      What about WIC and SNAP benefits?   There are no SNAP food benefits available for millions of people as of Nov. 1. It's the first time the country's largest anti-hunger program has been suspended since it began six decades ago.    On Friday, two federal judges said this pause is likely unlawful, and the Trump administration must use emergency funds to keep the program going. But it's not clear exactly how or when that may happen.   $5.5 billion in emergency funds also falls short of SNAP's November budget, which is $9 billion. That means even if the administration restarts funding, people may not get the full amount of food assistance they are eligible for. Cities and states across the country are tapping emergency funds and ramping up food donations to help the 42 million SNAP recipients.   A separate nutrition program is also at risk. The Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) provides nutrition education, breastfeeding support, and other healthcare screenings for 7 million people.   Last month the Trump administration shifted $300 million to keep WIC going a few more weeks. Some states are now using emergency funds to keep clinics open and benefits available, but the National WIC Association says those funds are running out quickly.   — Jennifer Ludden, NPR   Read more on the impact of this potential lapse across the country, here. — and you can read more here about how food banks are bracing for it       What about Head Start?   Beginning Nov. 1, more than 65,000 children will be at risk of losing access to Head Start, the federal early-learning program for low-income families. That's because federal funding for individual Head Start programs cannot be disbursed while the government is shut down.   \n   Among the states hit hardest by this Nov. 1 deadline: Florida, Georgia, Missouri and Ohio.   Nationally, Head Start serves roughly 750,000 infants, toddlers and preschool-age children, providing not just childcare and early learning but also free meals, health screenings and family support.   Local Head Start programs are funded annually, though at different times of the year. Some programs get their money on Oct. 1, others on Nov. 1 and so on. If the shutdown lasts until December, says Tommy Sheridan of the National Head Start Association, still more programs would see their funding run out.   Without federal funding, Sheridan says, some programs will have to close immediately. Others have the resources to stay open at least another week, in hopes that politicians in Washington can resolve their differences.   — Cory Turner and Kadin Mills, NPR      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                People receive food for furloughed federal workers at No Limits Outreach Ministries on Oct. 21, 2025 in Hyattsville, Md.

Of those, roughly half are furloughed, which means they are not working and not getting paid, but expect to return to work once the federal shutdown is over.   The other half have been deemed essential and so are continuing to work.   By law federal workers are supposed to get back pay once the shutdown ends, but the White House has tried to cast doubt on that.   The Senate has failed to advance a pair of competing measures to pay at least some federal employees during the government shutdown.    The Trump administration has managed to move money around to ensure that some people get paid, including active duty military and law enforcement officers with the Department of Homeland Security.   Many other federal workers are also still getting paid as usual during the shutdown. Salaries for some federal employees, including the vast majority of those at the Department of Veterans Affairs, do not come out of appropriations that Congress must approve every year.   \n   Are government workers being laid off during the shutdown?   The Trump administration has been following through on threats to further slash the size of government during the shutdown, seeking to layoff roughly 4,000 workers earlier this month.   Some unions that represent workers are fighting back in court;  the federal judge overseeing the case on Tuesday indefinitely halted the Trump administration's shutdown layoffs, noting human toll. The order applies to federal employees in programs or offices where the plaintiff unions have members or bargaining units.      How is the shutdown impacting active duty military?    The White House has identified additional funding for the latest round of military paychecks despite the shutdown, according to a spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget. The spokesperson says that the agency is using around $5 billion from a military housing fund, a military research and development fund and a Defense Department account used for building ships. NPR asked if part of the money is also coming from a $130 million donation made by a billionaire Trump ally, but the OMB did not respond.   The Trump administration earlier this month found unused research and development funds to pay many active military members so they wouldn't miss a full paycheck earlier this month, according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly.    Military families are already seeking additional assistance from food banks and other groups to help with paying bills.      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A United States Postal Service (USPS) mail box stands in Manhattan on Aug. 5, 2020 in New York City.

The postal service is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual.      IRS furloughs nearly half its staff   A contingency plan from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS' approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees were issued reduction in force, or RIF, notices on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9.   \n   The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year's tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data.   — Scott Horsley, Andrea Hsu and Stephen Fowler, NPR      National Nuclear Security Administration furloughs 1,400 employees   On Oct. 20, the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the nation's nuclear weapons, said it is furloughing approximately 1,400 employees. The agency is responsible for overseeing thousands of warheads that are not currently deployed on missiles, bombers and submarines.   According to an Energy Department spokesperson, the furloughs are due to the \"Democrat shutdown.\"   Roughly 400 employees remain on the job providing security and safety oversight. And the office responsible for moving nuclear weapons around the country remains funded until next week.   — Geoff Brumfiel, NPR   In addition, Nevada Public Radio is reporting more than 1,000 nuclear contractors in Nevada could receive notices by the end of the month, because their work relies on the federal government remaining open.      Teachers and schools won't be directly impacted, but federal education functions might   Eighty-seven percent of Department of Education employees have been temporary furloughed, as detailed in agency shutdown contingency plans.   At the same time, the administration is trying to use a new round of layoffs to gut multiple offices inside the department, including the Office for Civil Rights and the office responsible for overseeing special education, according to multiple sources within the department.   This latest reduction-in-force (RIF) cut at least 121 staffers responsible for overseeing roughly $15 billion in special education funding and for making sure states provide special education services to the nation's more than 7.5 million children with disabilities. The courts have halted those layoffs. If they're ultimately allowed to go through, multiple sources told NPR the special education office would be left with just a handful of top executives and support staff.   \n   In addition, many Department of Education employees who were furloughed were surprised to see a message blaming Democrats for the government shutdown inserted into their out-of-office replies. A federal workers union is suing the Trump administration for inserting the language into employees' out-of-office email messages.   — Shannon Bond and Cory Turner, NPR   The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 2026 went live as scheduled at the start of October. As WPR's Corrinne Hess reports, the U.S. Department of Education says that student financial aid programs will continue, despite the shutdown.      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Greg Freeman, a National Park Service ranger closes the entrance gate due to the government shutdown at the Everglades National Park Shark Valley on Oct. 1 in Florida.

That includes the National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities. NPR's Alana Wise reports that the Smithsonian assured the public that animals would still be cared for during the zoo's closure. Animal cams are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown.   As KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported, a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails \"will generally remain accessible to visitors\" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided.   Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services.   The Salem, Mass. visitor center will be open through Halloween thanks to community support   WBUR's Andrea Shea reports that local leaders in Salem, Mass., learned a National Park Service visitor center and its bathrooms would be closed during their busiest tourist season so they took action on a plan to keep them open.   Shea reports that NPS agreed to let Salem reopen the center if the community covered costs through Halloween weekend. Annie Harris — CEO of the non-profit Essex Heritage that helps staff and run the facility — sent out a flurry of emails including to the mayor. Within 48 hours businesses and non-profits raised $18,000 — keeping the center open until Nov. 2.   \n      Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue   Social Security, VA and other benefits will continue.   But employees at Social Security field offices earlier this month said the government shutdown has left them unable to carry out an important service for some recipients. As NPR's Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These official letters act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits.   In an Oct. 21 email to users answering commonly asked questions about how shutdown impacts, SSA noted the online portal can still be used to access benefit verification letters.   Some furloughed employees at the Labor Department were brought back to work, in order to complete the September inflation report, which is a key ingredient used to calculate the cost of living adjustment that Social Security recipients will receive next year. Last week, the SSA said the payments to recipients will increase by 2.8% next year, or an increase of about $56 per month starting in January.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the employees in the Office of Detention Oversight, which inspects immigration detention centers, is currently not working. \"We hope Democrats will open up the government swiftly so that this office can resume its work,\" McLaughlin said.   According to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, DHS law enforcement, including ICE agents, will be paid for work done during the shutdown.   \"More than 70,000 sworn law enforcement officers across DHS including those serving in CBP, ICE, Secret Service, TSA and other critical mission areas will be paid for all hours worked during the shutdown period,\" Noem posted on X last week. \"By Wednesday, October 22, law enforcement officers will receive a \"super check\" — which covers the 4 days lost, their overtime, and their next pay period.\"   \n   The U.S. Coast Guard, which is housed within DHS, will continue to be paid, according to Noem; funds will be appropriated in the reconciliation bill earlier this year.   — Ximena Bustillo, NPR      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                An air traffic control tower at the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport on Oct. 1 in Austin, Texas is seen following the federal government shutdown.\n                \n                    Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   If you're flying soon …   Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees are considered \"essential workers\" and have to stay on the job.

[KQED]Well over 1 million people in L.A. County get food benefits from CalFresh — the state's implementation of the federally funded SNAP program. The other major SoCal counties — San Bernardino, Riverside and Orange — each have more than 300,000 people on CalFresh, according to state data. [LAist]The shutdown of the federal government has brought the full or partial closure of many National Park Service sites across California: Muir Woods is fully closed. Alcatraz Island is slated to stay open. Other sites like Point Reyes National Seashore and Fort Point have partial closures, with some parking lots blocked or bathrooms locked. Even some park staff said they didn't learn the plan until Sept. 30 — the afternoon before the government shut down. Yosemite is open, but with lots of changes for visitors. [KQED]      Colorado   Sites and lands in Colorado operated by the National Park Service are open, but \"some services may be limited or unavailable,\" according to the agency's website. [Colorado Public Radio]In Colorado, the federal government employs thousands of workers at climate or land-management agencies.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Scott Detrow speaks with Sen. Lisa Murkowski about the possible loss of SNAP benefits due to the shutdown.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  Tomorrow - November 1 - is the day that federal food assistance will be drastically cut or reduced for tens of millions of people across the United States. The loss of SNAP benefits would be just the latest casualty of a federal government shutdown that has now gone on for a month.Senate Democrats and the Trump administration remain dug in, and as federal workers go without paychecks and now people will begin to go without critical food assistance, there's been some talk from some lawmakers about more narrowly targeted bills to keep specific parts of government funding flowing. Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski has been part of those talks as well as others, as she often is, and joins us now. Hi, Senator.LISA MURKOWSKI: Hey. How are you this afternoon?DETROW: Let's start with this. SNAP is a broad program. Something like 66,000 Alaskans rely on it. What are you telling your constituents about what to expect and why those benefits are going away?MURKOWSKI: Well, everyone has been watching the news of this prolonged shutdown. They see these looming deadlines. It has been well advertised that SNAP benefits would run out at the end of this month. And so my effort has been, let's get this government open. Let's make sure that not only SNAP benefits are paid, but that our military are paid, our Coast Guard are paid, our federal workers, our air traffic controllers.But we are sitting here on the day before these benefits are due to be paid out, and we're told by the secretary that the well is dry. So it is, I think, a dire situation. You mentioned the number in Alaska. Over 66,000 Alaskans rely on SNAP benefits. Around the country, it's over 12% of the population that rely on SNAP benefits.DETROW: Yep.MURKOWSKI: Forty-one million people - this is significant, and this is real harm to real people.DETROW: I want to talk about the more narrow bills to just fund SNAP, the broader state of negotiations. But first, I want to ask this - and this is tied to a federal court case that is being decided right now - this question of whether the U.S. Department of Agriculture could be funding SNAP right now with contingency funding. We have seen the Trump administration move money to keep paying members of the military, for instance. First of all, do you believe the administration has the power to keep SNAP going through the weekend?MURKOWSKI: Well, they do have contingency funds, and we have asked very specifically about the ability to spend those contingency funds to help pay out SNAP benefits or at least partial. Again, we have seen coming out of the USDA and the secretary of agriculture the statement that that will not be forthcoming.I have seen different statements indicating that these contingency funds need to be reserved for disasters. We just had a disaster in Alaska. And so for those SNAP recipients in Alaska who have suffered this disaster, yeah, we want to make sure that they have some level of assistance or relief there.But I do think it is - it's important to recognize that just this afternoon, the courts did come out with a ruling ordering the Trump administration to pay for food stamps during this shutdown, saying that they must distribute aid using what they're calling a set of emergency funds. I don't know what that is and where that might come from.DETROW: And my understanding is at minimum, that wouldn't begin until Monday. So I think either way, we're looking...MURKOWSKI: Yeah.DETROW: ...At the weekend without these benefits.MURKOWSKI: Well, and keep in mind that when you have a lapse in programs, oftentimes you will see a gap there. This is why I felt it was so important that we not get into this place in the first place...DETROW: Well...MURKOWSKI: ...Not be in a situation where we were actually going to see these benefits not be able to be paid out and these individuals left hanging and wondering how they're going to feed their family.DETROW: Let's just zoom out then for a moment because the Trump White House is not negotiating. Senate Democrats are saying that they will not take any vote to reopen the government until there's a guarantee on extending these health care credits. You are one of the, you know, at times it seems like dwindling members of the Senate who are having conversations on both sides of the aisle. Do you see any clear path forward, or even beginning of a path forward, at this point in time?MURKOWSKI: Yes. Yes. And it's not as if we're just now starting to define a path. There has been a good number of folks on both sides of the aisle that have engaged in good, constructive dialogue about the ways that we get through this shutdown, what it's going to look like. There are good, constructive conversations that are happening. They have been proceeding. They are occurring now. And...DETROW: Is there a most likely path? I know negotiations can change quickly, but is there a most likely path? Is it a short-term spending bill? Is it a guarantee of a future vote? Like, what do you think is the most likely way to...MURKOWSKI: I...DETROW: ...Get moving again?MURKOWSKI: I think you're going to see an effort to ensure that we start moving on our appropriations bills that we have already moved through the full committee. Keep in mind, we wouldn't be talking about a SNAP issue if we had been able to enact the agriculture appropriations bill into law. It's already moved through the committee. It just needs to be conferenced, and this wouldn't be an issue at all. So whether it is funding for the military, let's get the defense appropriations bill through. If it's funding for air traffic controllers, let's get the appropriations bill through.So I hope you're going to see a path where we are advancing our appropriations bills through the process here in the Senate, through the conference that we will have with the House - an opportunity for us to address, as the Senate, the ACA premium tax credits and the expiration that we see on that at the end of this year. And so that is obviously part of the mix.The bill that we have been voting on from the House is an extension through the 21 of November. That's not going to be sufficient time for us. So how far do we move that towards the end of the year is another subject of debate. But there's...DETROW: What's your confidence level this is done by the next first of the month, December 1?MURKOWSKI: My confidence level on this - that it is done by December 1 - is very high.DETROW: All right. That is Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Thank you so much.MURKOWSKI: OK, thanks so much, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Today's top stories   Tomorrow, many Americans will feel the impact of the government shutdown as SNAP food benefits will run out for about 42 million people. Saturday also marks the start of enrollment on federal insurance exchanges, and premiums are expected to more than double on average. Democrats say they'll vote to reopen the government if Congress extends health care subsidies to help manage the rising costs. Yesterday, major airlines asked Congress to pass the Republicans' stopgap funding plan as air traffic controllers continue to work without pay.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The air traffic control tower is seen at Orlando International Airport in Orlando, Florida early morning on Oct. 31. Flights at Orlando International Airport faced major delays on Oct. 30, after the Federal Aviation Administration said the airport had no certified air-traffic controllers in its tower, forcing arrivals to be halted or severely delayed amid the ongoing US government shutdown.\n                \n                    Miguel J.

Rodriguez Carrillo/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Democrats have traditionally been hesitant to shut down the government, but don't appear to be backing down, NPR's Barbara Sprunt tells Up First. Democrats seem to think Republicans will take the blame for the shutdown and not them. They are hoping public pressure will build on the GOP over the expected rise in costs of health insurance premiums. Republicans say they are holding votes to fund the government and if Democrats care about funding nutrition aid and paying air traffic controllers, they would vote with them.   \n   SNAP benefits have never been cut off due to a shutdown, and now a federal judge is stepping in to decide whether to order the Trump administration to find ways to get people money to buy food. The Agriculture Department posted on its website that \"the well has run dry\" and stated in a memo that it doesn't have sufficient funds for SNAP benefits for next month and cannot legally use contingency funds. Democratic governors and attorneys general from about two dozen states sued, arguing that SNAP is an entitlement that cannot be simply cut off.    🎧 Even if the ruling comes soon, there will still be a delay in states receiving the funds they need, according to NPR's Jennifer Ludden. This is because the federal government sends funding to the states before the first of the month, and then it takes days to get it onto the debit-like cards that people use. An added complication is that the full SNAP funding for November is approximately $9 billion, but the administration reports that there is only about $5.5 billion in the contingency fund. Recalculating for partial payments could take weeks, resulting in people not only having to wait but also getting less money.   \n   President Trump announced yesterday that the U.S. would resume testing nuclear weapons for the first time in decades. Some experts believe that this decision would be a major escalation and could disrupt the nuclear balance of power.    🎧 The world's major nuclear powers have observed a testing moratorium since the 1990s as a goodwill gesture for stability after the Cold War, says NPR's Geoff Brumfiel. The U.S. embarked on a program that utilizes science to ensure weapons function effectively without requiring testing. Much of that science happens in the same tunnels in the desert outside of Las Vegas where the government used to conduct nuclear testing. The U.S. has a significant technological advantage over Russia and China regarding nuclear weapons, but if those countries resume testing, they could narrow that gap, says Jon Wolfsthal at the Federation of American Scientists. There are also environmental concerns that even if radiation is contained underground, the shaking would be enough to damage buildings near the site.

In April, researchers released results from a study involving over 300 individuals age 50 and older who were genetically predisposed to Alzheimer's disease. The overall findings indicated that those who received the drug did not perform better than those given a placebo. However, in September, a further analysis of a subgroup of 125 participants revealed mild benefits for those who had only mild memory issues at the start of their treatment with the drug.    💊 By one measure, the drug slowed cognitive decline by 52% in people with mild cognitive impairment. It is challenging, however, to assess the true impact of ALZ-801 due to the small sample size in the mild cognitive impairment group.💊 ALZ-801 could get special consideration from the Food and Drug Administration due to its potential advantages over the two drugs already on the market. The drug can be taken at home and does not cause swelling or bleeding in the brain, which often comes with monoclonal antibody treatment.💊 More evidence of the drug's effectiveness is expected to come from people who have continued to take the medicine after the initial 18-month study period ended, says David Watson, a co-author of the new study.   \n   Read more about the new findings about the Alzheimer's pill.

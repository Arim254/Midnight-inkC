    "body": "\n      In recent elections, some Latino voters are shifting away from the Republican Party. Those votes helped flip seats in Virginia and could be an important factor in next year's midterm elections.   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger is not the only Democrat who flipped a seat in Virginia's elections this year. Democrats also won in other local elections, including by big margins in areas with significant numbers of Latino voters. Now, that's a big change from the 2024 presidential election, when those same parts of Virginia shifted slightly toward Republicans. Margaret Barthel of member station WAMU reports on what's behind those changing margins.MARGARET BARTHEL, BYLINE: Virginia's House of Delegates District 22 is about an hour west of D.C., where suburban sprawl gives way to farms. It's a political battleground. President Trump won it in 2016 and lost it to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris in 2024 by about a single point.Last month, though, the margin between the political parties looked different. Delegate-elect Elizabeth Guzman, a Democrat, won the seat by 10 percentage points, ousting incumbent Republican Ian Lovejoy, a moderate conservative. Guzman thinks part of the reason for her win is the district's Latino voters - some of whom supported President Trump just last year - are now wary of giving their vote to a GOP candidate again. That's something she heard out door-knocking.ELIZABETH GUZMAN: The first thing, they would look at me, it's like, you a Republican or Democrat? And I said, I'm a Democrat. OK, because we don't want to vote for any more Republicans anymore. They betrayed us and we are not happy.BARTHEL: Data shows 14% of the population here identifies as Hispanic. The shifting opinion Guzman heard on the campaign trail is reflective of what happened in other major races in November, and it comes at a moment when 70% of Latinos disapprove of the job Trump is doing. That's according to a recent Pew Research poll.GUZMAN: No. 1, we are under attack here.BARTHEL: Guzman, who is a social worker in her day job, says the Trump administration's aggressive approach to immigration enforcement is causing widespread fear where she lives, including in her own family. She said she'd made sure that her kids had real IDs to prove that they are citizens if they get stopped by ICE. Republicans ignore those worries at their own peril, she says.GUZMAN: Our president is hurting the country and is hurting us. And none of them wanted to recognize that.BARTHEL: In neighboring Loudoun County, voter Jose Ramiro Cruz has similar concerns.JOSE RAMIRO CRUZ: I am really upset about the label that we Latinos have been given in terms of being criminals or being, you know, uneducated and all that.BARTHEL: Cruz said he volunteered this year for Democrats because of his anger at Republicans for that rhetoric. He's also worried about the economy. Marvin Hernandez managed the Virginia campaign for CASA in Action, a progressive national political group that organizes Black and Latino voters.MARVIN HERNANDEZ: We came across some voters that they said, they stated - right? - I voted for Trump 'cause I thought that the economy will improve. But that hasn't changed.BARTHEL: Hernandez said CASA in Action and other Democratic-aligned groups capitalized on voter frustrations with Trump, spending money on Spanish-language ads. Srilekha Palle, a conservative political consultant in Northern Virginia, admits that investment paid off.SRILEKHA PALLE: I think what Democrats does well is they would go to, let's say, Telemundo and advertise like there is no other day. Republicans will not even have one ad in there.BARTHEL: She says her own party missed an opportunity to emphasize Virginia's economic strength under a Republican governor. Sam Shirazi, a Virginia political analyst, points out Democrats' focus on affordability as the core of their campaign comes just a year after Republicans did the same thing to win the presidential race.SAM SHIRAZI: We're kind of entering an era where perhaps some of those voters will go back and forth and they aren't necessarily loyal to either party.BARTHEL: But for now, Shirazi said the swing left among Latino voters in Virginia is a warning sign for Republicans in the midterms next year.For NPR News, I'm Margaret Barthel in Arlington, Virginia.(SOUNDBITE OF TENDAI SONG, \"TIME IN OUR LIVES\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Mary Louise Kelly talks to Virginia's Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger about her priorities and being the first woman to lead the Commonwealth.   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  At 12 noon on Saturday, January 17, Abigail Spanberger will be sworn in as governor of Virginia. In our current era of division, when it can feel hard to get people to agree on anything - and that is before you mention politics - Spanberger won by a double-digit margin. She'll be the first woman to lead the commonwealth, the first mom, and the first Virginia governor to have served as a CIA officer. She joins me now from her transition offices in Virginia. Governor-elect Spanberger, welcome.ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: Thank you so much for having me. I really appreciate it.KELLY: So the last time I interviewed you - I just went and looked - was 2021. Joe Biden was in the White House. You and your fellow Democrats controlled the House...SPANBERGER: Yeah.KELLY: ...Thin margin, but you were in the majority. Y'all were still struggling to advance his agenda, and I remember asking you a pretty blunt question - what do Democrats stand for? How would you answer that question today?SPANBERGER: I'm curious to know how I answered it back then, but I know that...KELLY: Back then, you told me (laughter) - I'm paraphrasing - but you said Democrats need to quit arguing on TV. And then you said, and we need...SPANBERGER: Oh, yeah, that sounds like me (laughter).KELLY: ...We need to do a better job of saying, this is what we're working toward.SPANBERGER: Yeah, so...KELLY: What are you working toward in 2025?SPANBERGER: What I'm working towards - I mean, I think this is the most central thing. What I'm working towards is delivering a Virginia that is ultimately more affordable. It's contending with the issues that matter to voters, to Virginians, to small businesses, to small business owners, to family farmers, to communities across our commonwealth. You know, we - like so many places across the country - are impacted by, you know, worry about affordability, housing supply that is causing costs to go up for families to rent a home, to buy a home. Here in Virginia, the cost of buying a house has gone up 18% over the last four years, 14% over the last four years to rent a home. And that has a real impact.And so what I am for is contending with and making progress on - and, you know, frankly, also being honest with voters and with Virginians - we cannot fix every problem. There's no kind of one single lever to pull. If there were, we would have pulled it a while ago. But we need someone who's relentless in bringing together members of our state legislature to pass bills that are going to move us in the right direction, to having an administration where every secretariat is focused on, you know, improving the lives of Virginians and creating opportunity and ultimately, day in and day out, focusing on delivering.KELLY: Just to push you on this, and I know you don't...SPANBERGER: Sure.KELLY: ...Speak for the Democratic Party, but you have served at senior levels in the federal - in Washington and now about to be in Virginia. Has your party figured out what you stand for, as opposed to standing against a lot of President Trump's agenda?SPANBERGER: So this is where I will say, whether people have figured it out or not doesn't matter as much as whether the voters - the people of the country or of individual states - think that we have, right? I mean, I'm a Democrat 'cause I think our policies are better at getting at the issues that matter most to people, helping people, creating opportunity, but...KELLY: But you're speaking to a messaging challenge.SPANBERGER: Yeah. And so if people don't realize it, don't feel it, don't know it, across the country, then I think it's up to every person in elected office or seeking elected office to make clear what they are for. And I do think that there is a lot of room for improvement in many places across the country, without question.KELLY: I mentioned, Abigail Spanberger, you're the first woman to be elected governor of Virginia. For years, every time I interview a woman who's the first woman to hold a position, I ask about it, and I always think I so look forward to when I get to stop asking this question because we've reached a...SPANBERGER: Yeah.KELLY: ...Day when it's utterly normal for women to be amply represented in positions of leadership. Are we close? How far off is that day?SPANBERGER: I think it's closer than it was. It's closer than it was two months ago, I'll say that.KELLY: (Laughter) Right.SPANBERGER: You know? And I think it's every bit of progress because every example of leadership and of what, you know, different styles can be, who can be in positions of leadership, every example that, you know, that the next generation sees is helpful. And, you know, I would note not only certainly was I elected but we elected a woman as our lieutenant governor. We flipped 13 seats in the General Assembly. The majority of them were also women candidates who flipped those seats.And so I think what's exciting for me is to hear from people who say things like, you know, I brought my daughter here. I brought my granddaughter here so that they can see you speak. Or, you know, yesterday, there was a teenage girl who said, oh, my goodness, my grandpa loves you. I was at an event. And I think that we are much, much closer, and we get ever closer to having, you know, those very boring and very normal interviews that you look forward to having with just yet another woman governor...KELLY: Yet another woman governor...SPANBERGER: ...Or yet another...KELLY: ...How boring is that?SPANBERGER: ...Woman.KELLY: Do you spend...SPANBERGER: Exactly.KELLY: ...Much time thinking about it?SPANBERGER: I actually find it really, really heavy to think about. So the short answer is, I don't spend that much time thinking about it because then it leads me to the next place of, well, then how do I ensure that everything I do is setting a good example? From, of course, the good policies I put forth, but the way I give a speech, to the way I present myself, to the way I, you know, speak about every aspect of what led me here, or who I am, or what I want to achieve.But I do recognize the example and the permission structure. There was a group of teenagers I saw yesterday, which is why I have multiple teenage girls on my mind, and another one said to me, she said, I'm going to follow in your footsteps, and I'm going to be president, she said. And so I looked at her. I said, OK, well, remind me your name. And she said her name, and I said, OK, well, I'll remember that for when I'm bubbling you in...KELLY: (Laughter).SPANBERGER: ...On my presidential ballot, right?KELLY: Yeah.SPANBERGER: And I don't know that she would have had that same conversation with, you know, a man who happened to be the governor-elect.KELLY: Abigail Spanberger - Democrat, former member of Congress, former CIA officer and now governor-elect of Virginia - thank you.SPANBERGER: Thank you for having me.KELLY: And you can hear our full conversation on next week's episode of our national security podcast Sources & Methods. We'll include that other piece of her resume, the ex-CIA piece.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)SPANBERGER: I loved it. I was a case officer. I was undercover my whole time at the agency. I later got my employment declassified.KELLY: That episode with governor-elect Spanberger drops on Monday. You'll find it wherever you get your podcasts.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

A small group of Republicans joined with Democrats to force a vote on that issue. In a few minutes, we will hear from one of those Republicans, as well as one of the Democrats who is trying to work for a bipartisan fix. But first?MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  More than 20 million Americans rely on the subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the month. In a rebuke of party leadership, a handful of Republicans joined Democrats to force a vote at some point on a three-year extension of those subsidies.FADEL: Joining us to talk through this is NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt. Hi, Barbara.BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Hi, Leila.FADEL: OK, so Republicans have been promising for weeks that they have plans to fix the health care system. But it doesn't sound like they agree on what exactly that entails. What happened this week?SPRUNT: Well, centrist Republicans have been pushing for leadership to let them have an amendment vote to extend those subsidies. And there was a lot of back-and-forth on this. And leadership ultimately said, nope, you're not getting it. So the group of swing district Republicans had a choice, which was either go home for the holidays with no vote on the amendment that they had wanted to bring or vote alongside Democrats who launched what's known as a discharge petition, which can bypass leadership and force a vote, in this case, on extending the subsidies for three years. And that's exactly what this small group of Republicans did.FADEL: And who were they?SPRUNT: Well, the group is three congressmen from Pennsylvania - Brian Fitzpatrick, Rob Bresnahan and Ryan Mackenzie - along with Mike Lawler of New York. Worth noting, these are competitive districts. They'll be important next year in the midterms as we figure out who's going to control the House.FADEL: Yeah.SPRUNT: And these four votes were critical because they got Democrats to the magic 218 number of signatures that's required to force a vote.FADEL: What's the timeline for this forced vote?SPRUNT: Well, under House rules, there's a waiting period. The speaker could choose to move the vote sooner, as soon as today. But if he doesn't, the vote wouldn't happen until next month because lawmakers are leaving at the end of this week for the holidays. And then of course, the bigger picture, we have to consider what kind of future this could have in the Senate. Just last week, four Republican senators voted to advance a three-year extension. It did not clear the 60-vote threshold that it needs to pass there. So what I'm watching is, come January, does that shift?FADEL: Does all of this say something bigger about the Republican Party here?SPRUNT: I think so. I mean, I think if you didn't already know that the midterms were next year, this would be a clue. Members are acutely aware of what's important to their constituents, to their district, and in this case, concern about what these premiums will look like for folks back home if the subsidies are not extended. And so there is, I think, a disconnect between what this group feels will be a big issue for their voters and how they want to address it versus how leadership is approaching it.FADEL: And what does that mean for House Speaker Mike Johnson?SPRUNT: Well, it means more headaches, something that he's used to this year trying to unite a conference that has a very narrow majority. And what that has led to lately has been these discharge petitions. Last month, we had a similar situation where a handful of Republicans rebelled against leadership. Sound familiar? Teamed up with Democrats to force a vote, in that case, on releasing the Epstein files. So I think this is just another example of the growing willingness of the conference to buck leadership on issues that matter to them and their constituents.FADEL: NPR's Barbara Sprunt.

    "body": "\n      In a primetime address Wednesday, President Trump said the nation is on the brink of an economic boom and claimed prices are falling quickly, even as affordability remains a top concern for voters.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  In a defensive and boastful address to the nation Wednesday night, President Trump insisted that the U.S. is poised for an economic boom and said that high prices are falling.MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  He blamed his predecessor and immigrants for many of the country's problems. The speech comes as a majority of voters say they are not feeling the economic relief Trump promised in his campaign and touted in his speech. Recent polling shows Trump's rating on the economy is historically low and high prices remain a top concern.FADEL: With us to talk this through is NPR White House correspondent Deepa Shivaram. Hi, Deepa.DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning.FADEL: OK. So what did the president say to try to counter how Americans are feeling about high costs?SHIVARAM: Well, his message overall is essentially telling people to just hang on and wait. He says costs of goods like gas are going down, and he said the administration is, quote, \"making progress\" on lowering other costs, but \"it's not done yet.\"(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You will see in your wallets and bank accounts in the new year, after years of record-setting falling incomes, our policies are boosting take-home pay at a historic pace.SHIVARAM: In other words, the policies that he passed this year will have benefits next year, things like the big tax cut bill, which includes things like no taxes on tips or overtime. He also said families will see a larger tax refund next year. He also touted what he said was an $18 trillion investment in the U.S. from foreign countries. Though his own White House website puts that tally at a little more than half of that.FADEL: I mean, the message to tell Americans, oh, you can't feel it but just have patience. The economy is pretty good. I mean, that's something that we heard from the Biden administration. That's what they tried to do, and that didn't really work, right?SHIVARAM: Yeah. It's a familiar message - right? - telling people that they will feel it in their pocketbooks just later is a complicated place for Trump to be in heading into a midterms year. A recent poll from NPR-PBS News-Marist just said that 36% of Americans approve of Trump's handling of the economy. That's a new low. So he's clearly trying to turn some of these feelings around. He did announce a few new things last night. One is an initiative of paying service members a check of $1,776. The other plan is to come next year on lowering the cost of housing. And I will say just one other major part of his speech was talking about immigration. That's long been an issue he falls back on when other things aren't going well. He tried to tie bad economic feelings to illegal immigration. He said migrants were the reason housing costs have gone up, but of course, housing prices fluctuate based on a number of factors and can't be pinned down to just blaming immigrants.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: The worst thing that the Biden administration did to our country is the invasion at the border. The last administration and their allies in Congress brought in millions and millions of migrants and gave them taxpayer-funded housing, while your rent and housing costs skyrocketed.SHIVARAM: So that message of attacking immigrants and Democrats, you know, that's something we've heard from Trump again and again, and it's possible that stays part of his economic messaging.FADEL: I mean, on that note, why don't we take a step back here and talk about his overall address last night? It comes at a time the president is seeing lower approval ratings, a lot of criticism over Venezuela, his reaction to the killing of filmmaker and actor Rob Reiner, the issue of affordability. What was his big message to Americans?SHIVARAM: Yeah. I mean, this sounded like a pretty typical Trump address in a lot of ways. It was a long list of everything he seems to think his accomplishments are, all of that tacked together, everything from claiming that he's ended eight wars this year to showing off tariff policy. He ended his remarks saying that the country is doing better than ever, which is a definite contrast to polling that shows that Americans are worried about the future and the direction of the country. His response to things when, you know, they aren't going in his favor is usually to dig his heels in deeper. So as all of these criticisms, like you mentioned, of his rhetoric in these recent weeks have ramped up and his approval numbers fall, he's trying to paint a different picture of the last 11 months, saying that they have just been stellar and that only he could bring about what he says is a strong nation.FADEL: That's NPR's Deepa Shivaram. Thank you, Deepa.SHIVARAM: Thanks.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Hours before the House passed a narrow GOP health care bill that would not extend the subsidies if signed into law, the quartet joined with Democrats to force leadership to schedule a vote on a three-year extension on health care insurance subsidies.   The move made by moderates from competitive districts — Representatives Rob Bresnahan Jr., Brian Fitzpatrick and Ryan Mackenzie of Pennsylvania, alongside Mike Lawler of New York — means the House is likely to vote on reviving the subsidies in early January.   \n   Fitzpatrick and Democrat Tom Suozzi of New York co-chair the House Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan group that tries to craft policy solutions and legislative agreements across party lines.   The two spoke with NPR's Michel Martin about why House Speaker Mike Johnson resisted a vote to extend health care subsidies, how they plan to compromise on the bill with the Senate, and what they fear might happen to millions of Americans if Congress cannot find a solution on this issue.

A deal to sell the American part of the company to a group of U.S. investors was signed on Dec. 18.\n                \n                    Patrick T.

Fallon/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   TikTok has signed a deal to spin-off its U.S. operations to a group controlled by mostly American investors, including software giant Oracle, a company run by billionaire Trump ally Larry Ellison.   TikTok's hyper-engaging algorithm and the massive amount of data the app has collected on millions of Americans is set to be overseen by the new U.S. firm. According to the agreement, TikTok's U.S. algorithm will be retrained with only Americans' data. Content moderation rules around what is permitted and what is not will be set by the new  investor-controlled entity.   Yet the underlying algorithm will still be owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, with the blessing of American auditors, according to an internal TikTok memo reviewed by NPR and two sources familiar with the deal who were not authorized to speak publicly.   \n   \"With an American majority running the content moderation, concerns about foreign propaganda seem to have been alleviated,\" said Anupam Chander, a professor of law and technology at Georgetown University who studies the regulation of new technology. \"But it is possible that the American TikTok might end up censoring or hiding speech that is permissible on the global TikTok platform. I would hope that the U.S. content moderation team would allow speech that the American owners might dislike.\"   \n   Under the terms of the sale, half of the new entity that will control the American version of TikTok will be owned by a consortium of investors including Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake and United Arab Emirates state-backed investment firm MGX. Those three will control 45% of the new U.S. TikTok entity.   Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX did not return requests for comment.   About a third of the newly-formed TikTok operation will be held by existing investors of ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of the video app. And around 20% will be kept by ByteDance.   A seven-member board of directors, most being American, will oversee the new entity, according to the memo, which was first reported by Axios.   The deal caps more than five years of mounting pressure from Washington, where bipartisan concerns about TikTok's ties to China prompted Congress to pass a law in 2024 that would have banned the app unless it was sold.   \n   The law was upheld by the Supreme Court in January. For months, TikTok was technically operating in violation of federal law, but Trump issued a flurry of executive actions to delay enforcement of the law that would have banned the popular video app.   Jim Secreto, former Treasury official who worked on TikTok policy during the Biden administration, said the deal signed on Thuesday does not completely sever ties with ByteDance, something the law Congress passed was intended to set into motion.   \"The law requires a clean break from ByteDance. This structure doesn't meet that standard,\" Secreto said. \"It looks more like a franchise deal that leaves TikTok's core technology in China than a true divestment. By sidestepping the guardrails Congress set, the national security concerns around covert data access and manipulation of the algorithm remain unresolved.\"   The White House declined to comment.   TikTok has an estimated 2 billion users globally, and less than 10% of its worldwide users are based in the U.S.   A new U.S. entity overseeing the American version creates a curious situation for the viral video app: One version of the service will be under the direction of an American-backed company, with additional checks and balances on content flows and data security while a second version of the app, wholly operated by ByteDance, will be available to the rest of the world.   The deal delivers a major win for Larry Ellison, expanding his family's grip on more corners of American media and entertainment.   \n   Ellison is a major backer of Paramount Skydance, a deal that was completed this year.   His son, David Ellison, who is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, has made a hostile bid to take over Warner Bros. Discovery, just as streaming giant Netflix has made its own bid, which top officials at Warner have endorsed.\n",

    "body": "\n      President Trump used a primetime address Wednesday to celebrate his achievements since returning to office. Did his words do enough to ease the economic anxieties being felt by many Americans?   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  President Trump sought to use his address to the nation last night to deliver something like his own year in review. Here he was at the start of his speech.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Eleven months ago, I inherited a mess, and I'm fixing it.MARTIN: The speech went on for roughly 20 minutes. It included, as we said, blame for Democrats and immigrants and promises for the future ahead of next year's midterm elections. The question is, did he do enough to ease the economic anxieties many Americans say they're feeling? Joining us to talk about this is senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro. Domenico, good morning.DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning.MARTIN: Also with us, White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben. Hello to you, Danielle.DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning.MARTIN: And I'm going to start with you. What stood out to you from this address?KURTZLEBEN: Well, one, this is not a president who seemed to be feeling people's pain. We all know cost of living is a huge worry for lots of people right now, and yet the tone we got here was angry. He really seemed to be shouting a lot of the time. And also, he just repeated his standby line that we all know by now - that any economic problems you are having are former President Joe Biden's fault. But also, my administration is unbelievably successful, which brings me to point No. 2 here, which is that Trump's approval is below 40%. His approval on the economy has slid. That shows something's not working, whether it's policy or communication or both. But amid all of that, did he turn over a new leaf? No.MARTIN: What about you, Domenico? What stood out to you?MONTANARO: Well, I mean, it was just a very defensive speech. I mean, he was basically saying the economy's fine, and if it's not, then it's the Democrats' and immigrants' fault. You know, went back to really familiar culture war talking points. But it's really removed from the reality of how people say they're feeling. You know, Deepa talked about the NPR/PBS News/Marist poll with him at 36% on his economic handling. Polls are showing that the economy really is his now, that people think that he can't continue to blame President Biden or anything else and that it's falling squarely on him. And Republicans and his base may be continuing to show support for him, but majorities of everyone else are not.MARTIN: So the president painted a picture of an economy in rebound. Danielle, how does that square with the economic data that we have been getting?KURTZLEBEN: Well, Trump brought out some familiar data points if you listen to the administration these days. He said that gas prices have fallen and wages are outstripping inflation. And both of those things are true, by the way. He is cherry-picking data here, as White Houses often do. And in the process, he's omitting a lot. For example, yeah, gas prices are down, but energy prices - a lot of Americans are seeing their electricity, natural gas bills going up. And yeah, wages are going up, but for one thing, that's not new under Trump. That was happening for a bit before he took office. And also, there's some recent evidence that that wage growth is more for higher-income people than everyone else. And finally, people are feeling bad and worried right now. And so you have to wonder if any amount of pointing to wage growth percentages is going to make people feel better.MARTIN: And, Domenico, what about - say more about that, about how voters are experiencing this economy.MONTANARO: You know, what Trump said last night is not reflective of how people are feeling. I mean, in our survey, 70% said that their expenses are either matching or exceeding their income. A quarter of people said that they're month to month, not making ends meet. That's tens of millions of people, and the remarks displayed little empathy for those very real situations from the president. Throughout this year, voters have punished Republicans for it - special elections, the elections in November. Democrats have outpaced 2024 performances by double digits. And those are real warning signs for Republicans coming up ahead of the next year's midterms.MARTIN: You know, the tone of the speech also revealed a lot about Trump's take on history. In addition to the speech, we're learning how he's viewing past presidents. The White House unveiled plaques near the Oval Office yesterday that actually mock some of his recent Democratic predecessors. What is he saying about them?KURTZLEBEN: Well, like you said, it's mocking. These plaques are insulting, which means they're pretty normal for Trump. Sometimes they're flat-out petty. On Bill Clinton's plaque, Trump notes that Hillary Clinton lost to Trump in 2016. And already, the Biden picture there was of an autopen, and this plaque talks about what it calls Biden's severe mental decline. But also, let's zoom out. This is yet another embellishment that Trump has added to the White House. In addition to the Rose Garden being remodeled, everything is covered in gold these days. Also, you may have heard, the East Wing is gone. So if you're an American paying even a moderate amount of attention here, it might strike you that he's paying attention to the White House renovations and maybe not as much as you'd like to the economy.MARTIN: Let's go to one topic that we did not hear a lot of specifics about last night, and that is health care. Did the president miss an opportunity by not offering more of a plan?KURTZLEBEN: I think you could say that. And it's not that he might have given you a whole bunch of specifics on a plan last night, but he also just didn't offer any reassurance that, yes, we get this. Yes, we need to get this done. We hear you. Instead, he really just insisted Democrats are the problem and had some vague talk about giving money to consumers.MARTIN: Domenico?MONTANARO: Yeah. And, you know, all the while here, there's a very real cliff when you're talking about health care with these Affordable Care Act subsidies that are expiring, you know, and that's going to lead to spiking premiums and many dropping coverage. Republicans have been unable or unwilling to compromise with Democrats or even get on the same page with themselves between the House and Senate to pass a bill that fixes that immediate reality for people.MARTIN: So let's look ahead to 2026. Danielle, what's the message that this White House wants to get across ahead of the midterm elections?KURTZLEBEN: Well, they're really trying to focus on the economy right now. And on the economy, they're saying, hey, things are great. But they're also trying to say, hey, things are going to improve. And one thing they're focusing on is tax refunds from the Big Beautiful Bill that passed this past year - that people are going to get refunds from those next year. Also, the White House keeps promising that tariffs are sooner or later here going to really show people effects in terms of new factories, new jobs. All that said, they keep hammering this message that Biden is still the problem, and I don't know how far into next year you can ride that.MARTIN: Domenico, final thought?MONTANARO: Yeah. And it's a lot of vague promises. Sound very reminiscent of what we hear from Trump all the time - going to be fixed on Day 1 or coming in two weeks. But what I'm hearing from a lot of moderate Republicans is a very different tone. They don't talk about these vague promises. When they're in their swing districts and then now when they're going on TV, you're hearing them talk about, you know, wanting to pass these subsidies and figure out other real tangible solutions because they're hearing it from their constituents back home. And they are on the front lines of those swing districts that potentially be the places where Republicans might wind up losing in next year's elections.MARTIN: That is senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro and White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben. Thank you both.MONTANARO: You're welcome.KURTZLEBEN: Of course. Thanks, Michel.(SOUNDBITE OF AERIAL M'S \"SKRAG THEME\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The Senate voted 67-30 on Wednesday to confirm Isaacman along bipartisan lines. All 30 senators who voted against him were Democrats.   The 42-year-old e-commerce mogul has flown to space twice on private missions — both in partnership with Elon Musk's SpaceX — and in 2024 became the first civilian to walk in space. Isaacman has no federal government experience.   \n   Isaacman was among President Trump's first picks for his second administration: Trump announced his nomination in December 2024, well before his inauguration, and formalized it after taking office in January.   \"Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social at the time.   Isaacman made it as far as a three-hour Senate subcommittee hearing in April, where he downplayed his connections to Musk but declined to answer when asked whether Musk was in the room when Trump offered him the role. Isaacman also expressed support for lunar and Mars missions, saying he believed NASA had the budget to do both.   While NASA is focused on its Artemis mission to return Americans to the moon for the first time since the early 1970s, the second Trump administration has concerned some with its seeming preoccupation with Mars exploration — a riskier and more divisive concept that just so happens to be a longtime dream of Trump's onetime ally, Musk.   \n   But Isaacman didn't get the chance to answer questions about any of that in front of the full Senate, because Trump withdrew his nomination in late May — the same week Musk left his role in the administration.   Trump said the decision followed a \"thorough review\" of Isaacman's \"prior associations,\" and later explicitly blamed his donations to Democratic causes. Public filings show that Isaacman has contributed to candidates and political action committees of both parties over the years, but since 2016 has supported more Democrats.   \n   Isaacman has described himself as \"relatively apolitical\" and a \"right-leaning moderate,\" and noted that his campaign donations were public long before Trump nominated him — suggesting that wasn't the only reason for the reversal. In June, Isaacman said being considered to lead NASA was \"truly the honor of a lifetime.\"   \"Even knowing the outcome, I would do it all over again,\" Isaacman wrote in a letter to investors.   And that's what ended up happening — only the second time, it worked.   Isaacman takes the helm at a turbulent time for NASA   In early November, Trump nominated Isaacman again, without acknowledging the turmoil that had unfolded along the way.   At his confirmation hearing in early December, Isaacman once again denied that his connections to Musk posed a conflict of interest. The nominee explained that his spaceflights were operated by SpaceX because the company is the only option for sending Americans to space since NASA retired its space shuttle program in 2011.   \n   \"In that respect, my relationship [to Musk] is no different than that of NASA,\" he said, adding that \"there are no pictures of us at dinner, at a bar, on an airplane, or on a yacht because they don't exist.\"   Isaacman takes the helm of an agency that has been grappling with a lack of permanent leadership, downsizing, competitive pressure (particularly from China) and significant funding cuts — with threats of more to come.   The administration's 2026 budget proposes a historic 24% cut to overall NASA funding, which would slash its workforce by about a third and spell the end of 41 science projects.   In recent months, protesters have descended on Capitol Hill to lobby against the proposed budget cuts. Among them was beloved \"Science Guy\" Bill Nye, the CEO of the nonprofit Planetary Society, who also attended Isaacman's December hearing in a show of support for the nominee. The House and Senate both reject the deepest proposed cuts, but differ in how much funding they think its science budget should get.   \n   A 62-page draft agenda named \"Project Athena,\" which Isaacman defended after it leaked in May, offers clues as to how Isaacman seeks to run NASA: primarily, more like a business.   Its priorities include reorganization \"aimed at reducing layers of bureaucracy,\" putting more astronauts in space more often, playing a larger role in certifying commercial space missions and partnering with industries like biotech and pharma to \"figure out how to extract more value from space than we put in.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Jared Isaacman — pictured before he led the first all-civilian spaceflight in 2021 — has worked closely with Elon Musk's company SpaceX.\n                \n                    Patrick T.

Fallon/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Isaacman's background is in e-commerce and private spaceflight   Isaacman traces his interest in space back to his childhood, when he was inspired by a picture book in his school library.   \n   \"I told my kindergarten teacher I was going to go to space someday,\" he recalled in 2021.   But first, he made it as an entrepreneur. He founded the payment processing firm now known as Shift4 Payments as a teenager out of his parents' New Jersey basement in 1991. The company, which went public in 2020, says it processes payments for 1 in 3 restaurants and 40% of hotels across the U.S.   Isaacman dropped out of high school to pursue his business, but later earned his GED and a bachelor's degree in aeronautics from Embry‑Riddle Aeronautical University. He is a licensed pilot with over 7,000 flight hours, according to his Polaris bio.   He also co-founded a civilian aerobatic display team called the Black Diamond Jet Team, as well as Draken International, which provides tactical fighter aircraft to customers including the military and defense industries. He sold a majority share of it to the investment firm Blackstone Group in 2019 for a reported nine-figure sum.   Forbes values Isaacman's current net worth at $1.2 billion. That fortune has allowed him to pursue his astronaut ambitions, as well as support STEM-related causes (he and his wife have pledged to donate the majority of their wealth to charity).   \n   Isaacman funded and commanded the first all-civilian orbital flight in 2021 — which raised over $240 million for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital — as well as the 2024 Polaris Dawn mission, in which he and crewmate Sarah Gillis became the first civilians to conduct a spacewalk.   Upon his return, Isaacman told NPR's All Things Considered that while Earth looked beautiful from afar, \"looking out into the darkness of space, it was a very unwelcoming feeling that this is a threatening environment for humans.\"   \"We certainly didn't evolve to be here, and if we want to be here, we're going to have to work really hard in order to kind of open up this last frontier,\" he added. \"That was kind of one of the big takeaways I had.\"\n",

Today's top stories   President Trump insisted that the U.S. is poised for an economic boom during a prime-time address to the nation yesterday. He said that high prices are decreasing and attributed many of the country's problems to his predecessors and immigrants. This message comes as Trump's rating on the economy is historically low, and high prices remain a top concern, according to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump addresses the nation from the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Dec. 17, 2025.\n                \n                    Doug Mills/Pool/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Doug Mills/Pool/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 The president essentially asked people to wait because his policies, which he passed this year, will have benefits in the new year, NPR's Deepa Shivaram tells Up First. Trump said families will see a larger tax refund next year. He also announced an initiative that would pay service members $1,776 and an upcoming plan to help lower the cost of housing. Shivaram said that overall, it sounded like a pretty typical Trump address, which included a long list of everything he sees as his accomplishments, all tacked together.   The House of Representatives voted yesterday on a Republican-led health care plan that did not include extending enhanced health care subsidies. Over 20 million Americans rely on the subsidies that are set to expire at the end of this month. Several Republicans went against party leadership and joined Democrats to force a vote on a three-year extension of the subsidies.    \n   🎧 The House speaker now has a decision to make on whether to move the vote sooner, NPR's Barbara Sprunt says. If the vote doesn't happen by the end of this week, it won't take place until next year, as lawmakers are leaving for the holidays. Sprunt says some Republicans could be shifting their stance on these subsidies because next year is a midterm year. Lawmakers recognize what is important to their constituents — in this case, the impact of expiring subsidies on insurance premiums.   Trump has ordered a ban on all sanctioned oil tankers traveling to and from Venezuela. This threat of a partial blockade escalates the administration's pressure campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. It also sparks the question of whether the two countries are inching closer to direct military conflict.    🎧 A full blockage is considered an act of war, but the Trump administration appears to be targeting only tankers already on the sanctions list, according to NPR's Greg Myre. For years, the U.S. has been sanctioning \"ghost ships,\" which are tankers that attempt to disguise their identities and locations in an effort to evade U.S. and Western sanctions. This latest move could prove to be a major blow to Venezuela, as the country is heavily dependent on oil exports. A fully loaded large tanker carries over $100 million worth of oil. If the U.S. seizes a number of ships, it could possibly scare away non-sanctioned tankers who may decide it's not worth the risk.   \n   Deep dive   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Ailsa Ostovitz, left, and her mother, Stephanie Rizk, at their home in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C.

The teachers did so despite numerous studies highlighting that these tools lack reliability. Popular detectors like Turnitin, GPTZero and Copyleaks misidentified some things as AI that weren't, and vice versa, according to findings by Mike Perkins, a leading researcher on academic integrity and AI at British University Vietnam. Their accuracy rates plummet even further when users manipulate the AI test to appear more human. Despite these challenges, NPR found that school districts across the U.S. spend thousands of dollars on these tools.    ➡️ John Grady, a language and literature teacher, uses AI detection tools as a starting point to initiate conversations with students about AI use.➡️ Grady says he scans all essays with GPTZero, and if the tool flags a 50% likelihood of AI use, he digs deeper by using revision history tools to measure writing time and edit counts. If a student submits work with few edits and minimal time writing, he will conduct a check-in.➡️ High school student Zi Shi, whose first language is Mandarin, fears that AI software will flag his work due to his writing style and his limited English vocabulary.

On Cyber Monday, consumers financed a record $1 billion in online purchases through this payment option, according to Adobe Analytics data. Adobe projects that by the end of the season, that figure will jump to $20.2 billion, up 11% from last year. BNPL allows shoppers to purchase goods instantly through lenders like Afterpay and Klarna, and pay them back over time. However, like any form of credit, it comes with drawbacks. Finance experts shared with Life Kit tips on how to use BNPL responsibly. Here is some of the guidance provided to help you protect yourself from risk:    \n   💲 If you already have credit card debt or cannot afford to cover the payments, be wary of using BNPL.💲 Try to only take these loans from one lender, so all your payment plans are in one place, allowing you to better keep track of payments.💲 Avoid impulse buying just because BNPL is an option. One way to avoid buyer's remorse is to imagine talking with your future self, who is looking at all those bills.   If you are curious to learn more about how BNPL loans work, check out these six pros and cons.

In 2025, Goggin quit her job, while Stainnak was fired.\n                \n                    Maansi Srivastava and Tristan Spinski for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Maansi Srivastava and Tristan Spinski for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Liz Goggin recently had an encounter that reminded her of why she once cherished being a federal employee.   She had taken her kids out for ice cream and stopped to chat with a man who was blowing balloons and selling them for a couple of bucks. She quickly learned he was a veteran, struggling with housing issues along with serious health issues — some psychological.   In the past, she would have found a way to bring him into the Veterans Health Administration, where she had worked for a decade, providing therapy and connecting veterans with a range of services available to them.   \n   Then she remembered, she doesn't do that anymore. Goggin had quit her job as a clinical social worker in June after twice being rejected for the \"Fork in the Road\" buyout offer.   She gave the man some pointers on how to navigate the VA. It was all she could do in her new life outside of government.   \"I had this real feeling of sadness,\" she says. \"It definitely sat with me.\"   An exodus of 317,000 federal workers   Just one year ago, being a federal employee was a very different proposition: It meant job security with solid benefits, for the most part, and the chance to serve the American people. Then in January, President Trump returned to the White House and scrambled those assumptions.   Month after month of firings, buyout offers and heightened uncertainty for the federal workforce has led to a mass exodus.   By the end of 2025, some 317,000 federal employees will be out of the government, according to the Office of Personnel Management. Tens of thousands were fired. Far more retired or resigned, many out of fear they would lose their jobs if they stuck around. Others, like Goggin, say the working conditions became untenable.   \"Things felt really hard,\" says Goggin, pointing to new demands that seemed to come out of nowhere: A mandate that employees send their supervisors five bullet points of what they accomplished that week. A directive to report any anti-Christian bias they observed in their co-workers.   \n   \"In my whole time at the VA, I did not see any anti-Christian bias,\" she says. \"To be clear, that was not even remotely an issue.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Goggin described morale at the VA as \"very low\" before she left her job.\n                \n                    Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Trump's crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion had also left Goggin and her co-workers unsure of what was still OK to discuss. Could they focus support groups around their clients' experiences with racism? Could they talk among themselves about their own implicit bias?   \"It was a deluge of things,\" says Goggin. \"Morale was very low.\"   Tossed out and still struggling   For other federal workers, leaving the government was not a choice.   Hours after his inauguration, Trump signed an executive order cracking down on DEI throughout the government, calling it illegal and immoral.   Mahri Stainnak, who was based in Maine, was put on leave the next day and fired soon after.   Stainnak's work with the Office of Personnel Management's DEI office had included introducing people from different backgrounds to careers in the federal workforce.   \"Veterans, people with disabilities, recent graduates including from minority-serving institutions,\" Stainnak recalls proudly.   Stainnak, who uses they/them pronouns, had actually moved to a new role just before Trump's return to the White House, and still they were fired. Today, they are still struggling to find full-time work.   \"It's an incredibly difficult job market right now,\" Stainnak says. \"Each application, each interview, the stakes feel so high.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Mahri Stainnak worked in the Office of Personnel Management's DEI office under former President Biden but had moved to a new role just before Trump's return to the White House. Still, Stainnak was fired.\n                \n                    Tristan Spinski for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Tristan Spinski for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Once the main breadwinner for their family, Stainnak says they've been forced to make difficult decisions.   \"When I lost my job, I lost our family dental insurance,\" says Stainnak. \"So do we take our toddler to the dentist and pay out of pocket, or is that an expense that we choose to cut?\"   Stainnak is now part of a class-action lawsuit alleging that the Trump administration illegally discriminated against potentially thousands of federal employees who worked in DEI roles before they were fired.   \n   Those Stainnak knows personally are all people of color, women, or members of the LGBTQ+ community.   The lawsuit alleges that Trump and others in his administration targeted the employees because of their actual or perceived political beliefs, their advocacy on behalf of members of protected groups, or their race or gender.   \"It's not OK for the Trump administration to target us because of who we are and what they think we believe,\" Stainnak says.   The Trump administration has not yet filed a response to the legal complaint, and the White House declined to answer a question from NPR about the lawsuit. In his January executive order, Trump asserted that DEI efforts under former President Joe Biden amounted to \"immense public waste and shameful discrimination.\"   Saving the country vs. \"burning the whole house down\"   Throughout the year, Trump has celebrated the disruption he's brought to the government after vowing for years to \"drain the swamp.\"   \"After a lifetime of unelected bureaucrats stealing your paychecks, attacking your values and trampling your freedoms, we are stopping their gravy train, ending their power trip,\" he told a cheering crowd at a rally in Michigan in late April.   Trump insists he is saving the country from waste, fraud and abuse.   Max Stier could not disagree more.   \"They are burning the whole house down,\" says Stier, founding president of the Partnership for Public Service.   For more than two decades, the nonprofit has worked across both Democratic and Republican administrations, helping to guide presidential transitions, conducting leadership training, and proposing ways to make the government function better.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Max Stier, founding president of the Partnership for Public Service, worries that Trump is taking the country back to a patronage system that last existed in the 1800s.\n                \n                    Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Now, Stier warns, by getting rid of institutions and people he doesn't care for, Trump is turning back the clock to the 1800s, when the government served the private interests of those in power, not the public good.   \"It's been 140 years since our country had something remotely close to this experience,\" he says.   \n   In response, White House assistant press secretary Liz Huston wrote: \"President Trump's only motivation as the President of the United States is improving the lives of the American people and making our country greater than ever before.\"   She added that in less than a year in office, Trump has made \"significant progress\" in making the government more efficient, pointing to Trump's plans to overhaul the nation's air traffic control system and a sharp decrease in the number of veterans awaiting benefits, among other achievements.   Stier says he recognizes that there are some good things happening, and they should be embraced. But the problem is scale.   \"If they figure out a way to better paint one of the rooms, that's great. But burning the house down is so overwhelming that it's difficult to pay a lot of attention to that,\" he says.   A golden opportunity lost   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Keri Murphy was fired as part of the Trump administration's chaotic purge of probationary employees, mostly newer hires.\n                \n                    Via Keri Murphy\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Via Keri Murphy\n    \n\n   \n   Like Goggin, Keri Murphy often finds herself grappling with sadness.    Back in the summer of 2024, Murphy had been thrilled to land an administrative job at the Commerce Department.   \"Outside of being called a mom, it was the best title I've ever been given — being a federal employee and civil servant,\" she says.   Nowadays, she struggles to remember why she was so proud.   Starting in March, Murphy was swept up in the Trump administration's chaotic purge of probationary employees, mostly newer hires. Many of them were told they were being fired because of poor performance, even though it wasn't true.   \"I had just received an award,\" she says, \"for outstanding performance.\"   She'd been laid off before. But this was a new experience.   Lawsuits ensued. Murphy was temporarily reinstated under court order, then fired again when an appeals court overruled that order. A different court issued a final judgment this fall, finding the mass firing of probationary employees was illegal. But the judge did not order workers reinstated, saying too much water had passed under the bridge. The decision left Murphy deeply disappointed.   \n   \"We're still drowning in that same water,\" she says.   A few weeks ago, Murphy started a new job, one she thinks is a good fit. But the pay is about half of what she was making in the government, and there are no benefits.   \"So that's why I don't know if this will work,\" she says.   Thriving but wistful   After deciding she was done with the VA, Goggin, the clinical social worker, made a profile on Psychology Today, found an office in a quiet commercial strip near her home and began providing therapy to private clients.   It's clear the skills and expertise she brought to the government are in high demand outside government too.   Six months after walking away from her job, Goggin is busy — perhaps too busy. In addition to seeing private clients, she runs a weekly support group at a substance use recovery program. She likes the work and the flexibility that comes with being self-employed. But leaving the VA was hard, she says.   \"I think of those people that I worked with, and what I learned from them, and how meaningful it felt over the years — and intense. I mean, that's the word I'd use,\" she says.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Goggin says she enjoys the flexibility that comes with being self-employed but misses the intensity of working with veterans.\n                \n                    Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Even with a thriving private practice, Goggin can picture herself returning to the VA someday. She still finds herself checking the government's hiring portal, USAJobs, just to see what's available.   \"It's this weird habit that I have,\" she says.   Murphy says she too would consider going back to the government, despite all she's been through.   \"It's crazy. I would love to,\" she says. \"Just not under this administration.\"\n",

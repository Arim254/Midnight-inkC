    "body": "\n      Prominent conservatives are engaged in a battle over how to respond to antisemitism in their ranks.   \n\n    AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:  This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Ayesha Rascoe. Good morning. There's been fallout from right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson's long and friendly interview with far-right influencer Nick Fuentes last week.(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE TUCKER CARLSON SHOW\")TUCKER CARLSON: Nick Fuentes, thank you for doing this.NICK FUENTES: Yeah, thank you for having me.CARLSON: I've wanted to meet you. I've heard about you.FUENTES: I've heard about you, so...CARLSON: Well, thank you.RASCOE: Fuentes has built an online following promoting many white nationalist and extremist ideas, including Holocaust denial. He's also used violent and degrading rhetoric about women. And a heads up - you'll hear an example of that in this story. As NPR's Sarah McCammon reports, prominent conservatives are now wrestling with how to respond to antisemitism in their ranks.SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Nick Fuentes has suggested that a lot of women want to be raped, claimed that Jim Crow segregation laws were better for Black Americans and expressed admiration for Hitler, among other things. Those kinds of statements have mostly kept Fuentes on the fringes of the conservative movement. But in an episode of \"The Tucker Carlson Show\" published on October 27, Carlson sat down with Fuentes for a friendly conversation that lasted more than two hours. In one exchange, Fuentes invoked an old antisemitic trope, suggesting that Jewish loyalty to Israel and other Jews is standing in the way of a unified American society.(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE TUCKER CARLSON SHOW\")FUENTES: I would say, though, that the main challenge to that, a big challenge to that is organized Jewry in America. I don't think...MCCAMMON: Fuentes then listed several influential Jewish Americans that he claimed were not capable of fostering national unity.(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE TUCKER CARLSON SHOW\")FUENTES: I see Jewishness as the common denominator. And you're right...MCCAMMON: Within days, the interview sparked a backlash among some on the right.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LINDSEY GRAHAM: But I just want to make it really clear, I'm in the Hitler-sucks wing of the Republican Party (laughter).MCCAMMON: That's South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham at the Republican Jewish Coalition meeting in Las Vegas last weekend, where several speakers called out rising antisemitism. But another prominent conservative, Kevin Roberts, the head of the influential think tank The Heritage Foundation, defended Tucker Carlson.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KEVIN ROBERTS: Who remains, and as I have said before, always will be a close friend of the Heritage Foundation - the venomous coalition attacking him are sowing division. Their attempt to cancel him will fail.MCCAMMON: In that video, posted to X on October 30, Roberts also said conservatives should feel free to critique Israel despite pressure from what he described as the globalist class. That sparked backlash from some Heritage staff and allies, including Rabbi Yaakov Menken, with the Coalition for Jewish Values.YAAKOV MENKEN: Obviously, if you want to deride the U.N. as a collection of globalists, that's fine. But if you want to refer to unnamed globalists protesting against antisemitism, hmm, who do I imagine that's talking about?MCCAMMON: Menken was part of a task force Heritage convened to fight antisemitism. Several members, including Menken's organization, ultimately stepped down from the task force in response to Roberts' handling of the situation. On Wednesday, Roberts met with Heritage staff to address the ongoing fallout.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ROBERTS: I didn't know much about this Fuentes guy. I still don't, which underscores the mistake.MCCAMMON: In a video of the meeting published online, senior research fellow Robert Rector said conservatives should learn lessons from when the movement pushed out some of its most extreme voices.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ROBERT RECTOR: You say, oh, we don't cancel. We do cancel. Did we cancel David Duke? Yes. Did we cancel the John Birch Society? Yes - OK? - because they were harmful because if they're in your movement, you look like clowns.MCCAMMON: Rector said he was disturbed both by what he heard from Fuentes and by what he described as Tucker Carlson's failure to ask probing questions. Roberts responded to concerns from Rector and others with this.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ROBERTS: That evil person, Fuentes - although I still have hope for his soul - has an audience of several million people, and at least some of that audience might be open to be converted.MCCAMMON: That evening, Roberts released another video statement, apologizing for his earlier choice of words and also referring to, quote, \"my friend, Tucker Carlson.\" Shortly after, leaders of the antisemitism task force announced they were disaffiliating from Heritage.For his part, Carlson sat down for an interview Thursday with Megyn Kelly, another former Fox News host turned podcaster. Kelly rattled off what she described as a long list of very vile past statements from Fuentes.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MEGYN KELLY: So what do you say to those people saying, why didn't you raise any of that?CARLSON: You know, do your own interview the way that you want to do it. You're not my editor. Buzz off. I mean, I don't know. You want to go yell at Nick Fuentes, I'll give you his cell. Call him.RASCOE: We're now going to bring back in Sarah McCammon. You laid out what's happened in the last couple of weeks. But this isn't the first time that Republicans have had this fight, right?MCCAMMON: Right. President Trump's critics point to a long history of actions and statements that they say have encouraged extremists, like three years ago, when, after facing blowback for dining with Nick Fuentes at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, Trump said on Truth Social that he didn't know Fuentes before hosting him. More recently, Trump's choice of a nominee for the Office of Special Counsel, who had a history of sending white supremacist texts, also caused concern. That nominee withdrew. And, Ayesha, this comes after a scandal involving antisemitic and racist messages exchanged by some Young Republicans.RASCOE: This is all happening at a time when there are rising reports of antisemitic incidents and violence. What are you hearing from Jewish leaders about how this fits into that larger pattern?MCCAMMON: There is a lot of concern about what they're hearing across the political spectrum. But when it comes to Trump, Sam Markstein, with the Republican Jewish Coalition, pointed to his support for Israel and described Trump as the best friend that the Jewish community has ever had in the White House. Now, Amy Spitalnick at the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, which is a progressive group, says this is coming to a head on the right because the optics are just so bad.AMY SPITALNICK: I appreciate the voices who are speaking out right now, but it needs to go hand in hand with the moral clarity and courage to name this normalization of antisemitism wherever it exists within their own party, just as each of us have an obligation to do it in whatever spaces and political arenas we operate in.MCCAMMON: And she says she's concerned about antisemitism across the political spectrum. And if conservatives are truly committed to stamping it out within their ranks, she says they need to hold their movement accountable for the people that they put in leadership.RASCOE: That's NPR's Sarah McCammon. Thank you so much.MCCAMMON: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

We also look ahead to what's next in the shutdown.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  The U.S. government shutdown is entering its 39th day. Yes, it is the longest in U.S. history. And this week, Democrats won solid victories in the New Jersey and Virginia governors races, among many others. NPR senior political contributor Ron Elving joins us from Milwaukee. Ron, thanks so much for being with us.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.SIMON: How do you read what you think a lot of voters were saying?ELVING: The common message was that they wanted to see more positive change in their own personal circumstances - more focus on prices and jobs and economic futures. And the message was quite clear across state lines in voting groups, not just New York, New Jersey, California and Virginia, but in less-noticed races in Pennsylvania, Georgia and even Mississippi. And yes, blue cities and blue states were voting blue, but voting groups that had been trending for Trump and the Republican Party in those states stopped trending that way - younger voters, noncollege voters, Hispanics and other people of color.So we have reached the first turning point in Trump's second term. And this is no longer the summer of Trump carrying all before him, testing the limits of his office, with no one to oppose him. Voters have now weighed in. The courts are pushing back. There are internal divisions within the Trump coalition, and even some of his supporters in Congress are looking for room to maneuver. So Republicans need to decide how they run and win without Trump on the ballot to bring out his portion of the electorate.SIMON: In the end, is it the economy, the economy, the economy that counts?ELVING: We don't have the usual government numbers because of the shutdown, but we have private agencies measuring people losing their jobs, and some of their reports suggest we are nearing recession-level job losses. The University of Michigan consumer confidence gauge, which is a national measure, is nearing a low point. And then there's the new buzzword of the year, affordability. A Washington Post/ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted in late October found that 7 out of 10 Americans say their grocery costs have gone up over the past year, and 6 out of 10 say the same for their utility prices. The president, though, sees things his own way. Here he is talking to reporters about a Walmart Thanksgiving bundle and seeming to equate a certain holiday special with the state of the economy.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Walmart just announced it two days ago - 25% cheaper. This year will be cheaper to have Thanksgiving than it was a year ago under sleepy Joe Biden.ELVING: What the president doesn't mention is that the Walmart Thanksgiving special has significantly fewer items in it this year. More of them are store brand, not name-brand items, meaning they tend to cost less. It's a classic case of shrinkflation where the product gets smaller.SIMON: So after this weekend, the shutdown will be 40 days and 40 nights, the longest in history - getting longer. What are you watching for in the coming days?ELVING: It's going to get still worse. People are going to have trouble getting those food stamps because, with courts trying to restore full benefits and the administration saying it will comply even as it appeals that decision to the Supreme Court, all of the confusion will take time to sort out. The air traffic control system was already stretched dangerously thin before this, so we're seeing some airports in chaos, and there have been a thousand flights canceled.It's hard to imagine the Republicans in Congress making a deal at this point without Trump driving the bargain, and it's hard to imagine getting it done without the House coming back into town, in Washington, into official session. And right now, Speaker Mike Johnson is still refusing to do that, mindful no doubt that it would mean swearing in a new Democratic member who was elected six weeks ago, making it quite likely that the House would vote to release the Jeffrey Epstein files that Johnson has been blocking.SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving. Very good to talk to you, my friend. Talk to you next week. Take care.ELVING: Thank you, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      The elections were voters' chance to weigh in a year after President Trump's election. Now Republicans and Democrats are reflecting on where they are and what they need to do to win in the future.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  The elections this week were the first time that voters got to register how they're feeling a year after President Trump's election. And the answer was clear. They are not happy with the party in power. Now both Republicans and Democrats are reflecting on where they are and what they need to do to win in the future. NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro and senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith are reflecting on that, too, and they're here to talk about it. Hi there.TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hello.DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Great to be with you.SUMMERS: So guys, Democrats had a huge week, big wins for mayor in New York City, governor in New Jersey, as well as in Virginia. How are they feeling going forward?KEITH: Democrats got their groove back, at least a little bit, after last year's bruising losses. They spent months in the political wilderness, but now they feel like they have a road map out. Just listen to Democratic National Committee chairman Ken Martin in a call earlier this week.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KEN MARTIN: Make no mistake, the Democratic Party is back. The Democratic Party is a party of affordability, and the Democratic Party is full steam ahead to take back Congress next year.KEITH: Winning is one heck of a drug.MONTANARO: Yeah, and this is a lesson, like, that they learned from the 2024 election. You know, a lot of people felt like it was too esoteric, focused in many respects on Trump and democracy. You know, Kamala Harris says the Democratic candidate tried on the economy and inflation, but it's a lot harder to win and make the focus on affordability when you're in charge and people are upset about the state of the cost of living. And it's a message that Democrats are coalescing around now, no matter who that candidate is.SUMMERS: And there was a lot of ideological diversity among the Democratic Party candidates who won. How's the party handling that?KEITH: Yeah, it's easy to look at the election of Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York City and moderates Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill in Virginia and New Jersey and say, wow, this party is split between progressives and moderates, but there is actually a through line, which Martin referenced. It's that affordability thing.And there's an analogy here to 2006, when Democrats were still licking their wounds from George W. Bush's reelection, and voters were in a foul mood. Democrats coalesced behind a clear and simple message. John Lawrence was chief of staff to Nancy Pelosi, who became speaker of the House after that election. And he says Democrats need to do the same thing now, and he even has some hope that they will.JOHN LAWRENCE: For all the focus on Mamdani, if you listen to Spanberger or Sherrill's acceptance speeches, they're all talking the same language. I mean, they're not talking about free buses or rent control, but that doesn't matter. They're talking about affordability.KEITH: He says Democrats just need to stick with this affordability message going into the midterms - cost of living, groceries, power bills, housing costs - and not let themselves get distracted by social issues or climate change or the democracy stuff.SUMMERS: Right. But as you guys well know, President Trump in his campaign - he specifically promised he would fix the economy. He claims now that he has, but that's not what voters are saying they feel. So what does this mean for Republicans?MONTANARO: Yeah. I mean, Trump won in 2024 because of the cost of living, and he promised to fix it, but what he qualifies as a great economy isn't resonating with voters, and that was clearly the case in these off-year elections. For Trump, it's all about things like the stock market and gas prices, but those are not everything, and his tariffs have actively made things more expensive.SUMMERS: Is the White House acknowledging that, though?KEITH: One of the president's top political advisers said this week that Trump will be pivoting to talk more about the cost of living, but he's been talking about it a lot this week, actually, as if it isn't a real problem.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't want to hear about the affordability because right now, we're much less. If you look at energy, we're getting close to $2-a-gallon gasoline.KEITH: That was Trump last night at a dinner for Central Asian leaders, and he really seemed to dismiss the concern about the cost of living as a messaging problem.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: The affordability is much better with the Republicans. The only problem is the Republicans don't talk about it, and Republicans should start talking about it and use their heads because we have great numbers. We have great - and they're going to only get better.KEITH: He says the numbers are going to get better because his tariff policies will ultimately improve the U.S. economy, though that's really not clear at this point. Right now, Trump is facing some of the same issues that President Biden did, which is that you can't credibly tell people that the economic fundamentals are strong and inflation is slowing down if, out in their real lives, they are experiencing sticker shock.SUMMERS: Right, and when we get to the midterms, Republicans will still be in charge. President Trump himself won't be on the ballot, though. So what dynamic does this create for Republican candidates?MONTANARO: Yeah, I mean, no matter what they do, Republicans are going to be tied to Trump. But in those swing districts, they're going to likely have to try - if the affordability environment doesn't change - to try to distance themselves somewhat from Trump. Here's Republican strategist Mike DuHaime, a former political director at the Republican National Committee, making that point.MIKE DUHAIME: Especially in the blue and purple states, there has to be some differentiation from Trump. Doesn't mean you have to completely distance yourself, but there has to be something where you show some level of independence and some level of individuality.MONTANARO: And another part of the problem here for Republicans is that they can't actually be Donald Trump.DUHAIME: Most candidates have to realize, like, you're not Donald Trump. You were not on \"The Apprentice\" for 10 years. You were not a star on the WWE. Your name is not on buildings.MONTANARO: So it's really an era we're in of the celebrity politician, but it's also an era of anger at whoever's in charge. You know, again, 2006 was a marker for the beginning of this trend. You know, consider that 6 of the last 7 midterm elections have had presidents with approval ratings under 50%, and we're moving toward that again with Trump.KEITH: Yeah, this is a problem that Democrats had when President Obama was in office. He was a turnout machine but only when he was on the ballot. And the party had major losses at the state and even local level during his presidency. Right now, Democrats do not have an obvious leader. That will likely be decided by the presidential primary over the next 2 1/2 years, and it's not clear what a post-Trump Republican party looks like either because he has demanded absolute loyalty and fealty from members of his party.MONTANARO: Right now, in this era of anger and skepticism at presidents, being out of power gives the advantage to Democrats heading into next year's midterms.SUMMERS: NPR's Domenico Montanaro and Tamara Keith, thanks to both of you.KEITH: You're welcome.MONTANARO: You got it.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration violated the First Amendment rights of Education Department employees when it replaced their personalized out-of-office notifications with partisan language.\n                \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Win McNamee/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration violated the First Amendment rights of Education Department employees when it replaced their personalized out-of-office e-mail notifications with partisan language blaming Democrats for the government shutdown.   \n   \"When government employees enter public service, they do not sign away their First Amendment rights,\" U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper wrote in his decision on Friday, \"and they certainly do not sign up to be a billboard for any given administration's partisan views.\"   The lawsuit was brought by the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE).   \"This ridiculous ploy by the Trump administration was a clear violation of the First Amendment rights of the workers at the Education Department,\" said Rachel Gittleman, the president of AFGE Local 252, which represents many Education Department workers, in a statement. She added it is \"one of the many ways the Department's leadership has threatened, harassed and demoralized these hardworking public servants in the last 10 months.\"   \n   Cooper ordered the department to restore union members' personalized out-of-office email notices immediately. If that could not be done, he warned, then the department would be required to remove the partisan language from all employees' accounts, union member or not.   \n   According to court records, in the run-up to the government shutdown, Education Department employees were told to create an out-of-office message for their government email accounts to be used while workers were furloughed. The department even gave employees boilerplate language they could adapt that simply said:   \"We are unable to respond to your request due to a lapse in appropriations for the Department of Education. We will respond to your request when appropriations are enacted. Thank you.\"   But, on the shutdown's first day, the department's deputy chief of staff for operations overrode staffers' personal messages and replaced them with this partisan autoreply:   \"Thank you for contacting me. On September 19, 2025, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5371, a clean continuing resolution. Unfortunately, Democrat Senators are blocking passage of H.R. 5371 in the Senate which has led to a lapse in appropriations. Due to the lapse in appropriations I am currently in furlough status. I will respond to emails once government functions resume.\"   \n   While the message was written in the first person, multiple employees told NPR they did not write it and were not told it would replace the out-of-office messages they had written.   \n   At the time, Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications, said in a statement to NPR: \"The email reminds those who reach out to Department of Education employees that we cannot respond because Senate Democrats are refusing to vote for a clean CR and fund the government. Where's the lie?\"   In his decision, Cooper lambasted the department for \"turning its own workforce into political spokespeople through their official email accounts. The Department may have added insult to injury, but it also overplayed its hand.\"   The department did not respond to an NPR request to comment on the ruling.   \"Nonpartisanship is the foundation of the federal civil-service system,\" Cooper wrote, a principle that Congress enshrined in the Hatch Act.   That law, passed in 1939, was intended to protect public employees from political pressure and, according to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, \"to ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion.\"\n",

How are higher prices changing the way you live? Fill out this form to share your story with NPR.      What's the item?   Furniture   How has the price changed since before the pandemic?   The price of bedroom furniture rose 11% since February 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The price of living room, kitchen and dining room furniture rose 25%.   \n   Loading...\n   Why has the price gone up?    Like all industries, furniture makers and sellers are dealing with higher expenses: utilities, insurance, wages. Big cost spikes came during the pandemic, when shoppers raced to buy desks for home offices and patio sets, and shipping costs soared.   But if you ask furniture industry insiders, the first thing they'll reply is that the price of furniture has actually grown slower than overall inflation, which has risen nearly 26% since February 2020.    Then, the experts will note that prices are down from their peak in 2022. And then — like David Koehler did — they'll deliver the popular adage:   \"You could buy a $399 sofa in 1984, and you could still buy a $399 sofa today,\" says Koehler, who runs the Delaware chain Johnny Janosik Furniture.   Of course, not everyone wants a $399 sofa, but the fact that it still exists makes furniture different from other big-ticket items, like cars or appliances.   Overseas competition has kept prices lower    Setting aside high-end woodwork and heirloom craftsmanship, sellers of mass market furniture feel intense pressure to keep prices down.   \"The barriers to entry are very, very low, and the furniture business is incredibly fragmented,\" says Bill McLoughlin, editor in chief of Furniture Today, a trade publication.   \n   Besides, furniture sellers compete not just with second-hand goods, but with any expensive plans you may have, say, for a trip or home repairs.   \n   And the race for cheapest prices has moved a lot of the industry abroad.   \"Manufacturing follows low-cost labor. That has been true for 60 years,\" says McLoughlin. \"Because labor is such a large component of the cost of a product.\"   American wages tend to be a lot higher than those overseas, on top of the bigger costs of U.S. environmental standards. So even at domestic furniture-making hubs in Mississippi or North Carolina, many components — fabrics, handles and electronics, like the power button for your recliner — still ship from abroad, mainly China.   Enter: tariffs    During his first term, President Trump's tariffs made it pricier to ship furniture from China, so a lot of manufacturing moved out — though not to America, but to Vietnam.   This year, Trump raised tariffs on imports from almost all countries. And he's set new double-digit tariffs specifically for kitchen cabinets, vanities and upholstered furniture.   The furniture giant Ashley Furniture in June raised the price of the majority of its products as a result of tariffs. The Home Furnishings Association, an industry trade group, has warned of cumulative cost increases for both retailers and shoppers.   What are people doing about it?   As importing furniture becomes pricier, American-made furniture may start looking more attractive in comparison. But seller Koehler worries about how shoppers will react.   \"The consumer, when we get feedback, they say, 'We would love to buy American,'\" he says. \"But when they vote with their dollars and see, this item is $500 and that item is $1,200, they say, 'I think I can only afford the $500.' So they end up buying an imported item anyway, just because there is such a difference in price.\"   \n   Many shoppers find themselves in the same spot as Erin Cummins in Connecticut: watching their spending rise on other, more critical costs, such as health insurance, or car insurance, or groceries.   \"Every time we're having company over, I look at that furniture and I'm going, 'I really need to replace that,'\" says Cummins, whose threadbare couches have been well-loved by three dogs and three children. \"I have priced it out a bit, but every time I do, I get sticker shock and walk away.\"   \n   Cummins says at this point, the cost of new furniture displeases her more than the state of what she already owns, and her couches — still standing, even if covered by a blanket — feel more stable than her budget.\n",

    "body": "\n      It's the 40th day of the government shutdown and stressors are evident from food banks to airports.  After last week's election day wins for Democrats, is any resolution in sight?   \n\n    AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:  Forty days into a record-breaking government shutdown, and the consequences are becoming more severe. Some food banks are scrambling to serve unpaid federal workers and people who rely on SNAP benefits, while there's a big legal fight going on over those benefits. The Federal Aviation Administration has begun reducing air traffic, and key economic data is not being released by the federal government. Joining me now is NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Good morning, Tam.TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning, Ayesha.RASCOE: So let's start briefly with SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. What's the latest on that?KEITH: Yeah. SNAP is the nation's largest anti-hunger program, but funding ran out more than a week ago. The Trump administration's position is that it can't tap reserve funds as has been done in past shutdowns. So there's been a flurry of legal action, and as a result, some payments have gone out. On Friday, the Trump administration appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court and got a temporary stay, all of which is to say that there are millions of people in this country whose ability to buy food is in limbo, and the cleanest solution would be to end the government shutdown, but that is easier said than done.RASCOE: OK. Well, let's talk about the economic data blackout. What do we know about the state of the U.S. economy without a monthly jobs report or information about retail sales?KEITH: Yeah. Friday marked the second month without that all-important jobs report. The last report from August showed anemic job growth and the unemployment rate ticking up. What we did get this week was some private data, which provides an incomplete but concerning picture. A report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas tallied 153,000 job cuts in October and hiring at its lowest point in 14 years. And consumer confidence, measured by the University of Michigan, took a hit too, with the shutdown dragging on and inflation worries growing. In addition to there being economic consequences, there are real political consequences too when people don't feel good about the state of the economy.RASCOE: But, Tam, we've been told for over a year now that President Trump was elected because Americans were very unhappy about the economy, and it seems like you're telling me they're still unhappy. The state of the economy proved to be a winning issue for Democrats in last week's election. What's the message now from the White House?KEITH: A top Trump political adviser acknowledged during a Politico podcast interview that the president needs to pivot to affordability. And in just the past few days, the president has been talking about it a lot, which is a change from before the election. And he keeps getting asked about people's concerns about the cost of living. As that has happened, he's been getting pretty defensive. On Thursday, he even said he didn't want to talk about affordability, which led to this on Friday.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The fake news yesterday, they talked about that. They said, oh, I don't want to talk about affordability. The reason I don't want to talk about affordability is because everybody knows that it's far less expensive under Trump than it was under sleepy Joe Biden.KEITH: Egg prices are down from the peaks they hit early in the Trump administration. Gas prices are down somewhat, though not as cheap as the president has been claiming. Beef prices are up, so Trump said he's ordering an investigation into meat packers. But at least in part because of Trump's tariffs policy, inflation has been persistent this year.The reality is, presidents don't have that many levers to juice the economy or bring prices down. Promising to fix the economy is a great campaign message, but it is harder to deliver on. Just this morning, President Trump posted that we are the richest and most respected country in the world. He said 401(k)s are the highest ever. But voters are getting daily reminders of how their own personal economy is doing.RASCOE: OK. Does that mean that there's more pressure to end this shutdown standoff?KEITH: The pressure points keep growing, but so far, this shutdown has been immune to all kinds of pressure. Senate Democrats offered to vote for a government funding bill if it includes a one-year extension of health care tax subsidies that are expiring and giving people major sticker shock. That was rejected immediately by Republicans. Meantime, President Trump has been in Florida this weekend, posting on social media a lot of all-caps ideas that so far have been nonstarters, like terminating the filibuster in the Senate and addressing the health insurance cliff by giving people money directly.RASCOE: That's NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith.

You're reading the Up First newsletter. Subscribe here to get it delivered to your inbox, and listen to the Up First podcast for all the news you need to start your day.   Today's top stories   Beginning today, the Federal Aviation Administration will reduce air traffic by 10% at many of the busiest airports. This move is intended to help keep the nation's airspace safe as the agency deals with a shortage of air traffic controllers and the government shutdown. Airlines have started canceling flights in order to comply with the FAA's orders.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                People take photos as a plane lands at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on Nov. 6, 2025, in Los Angeles, California. The FAA will be reducing flights by 10% in 40 major airports around the country, including LAX, beginning tomorrow amid air traffic control staffing shortages due to the federal government shutdown.\n                \n                    Mario Tama/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mario Tama/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 The shutdown is taking a toll on air traffic controllers, who are required to work without pay. NPR's Joel Rose tells Up First that there is some speculation that the reduction in air traffic is mostly a PR or political move related to ending the shutdown. The air traffic control system was functioning fairly well during the shutdown until this past weekend, when staffing shortages occurred at dozens of facilities simultaneously. Travelers have expressed concern over what could happen if their flights are canceled due to the FAA's change.   The Trump administration is appealing a court decision ordering it to restore full funding for SNAP benefits by today. The government previously stated it would restore partial benefits in response to an earlier decision. In a new decision made yesterday, U.S. District Judge John McConnell Jr. in Rhode Island ruled that the government failed to consider the harm to individuals who rely on those benefits.    \n   🎧 The emergency fund to keep SNAP going was only enough to make partial benefit payments, resulting in McConnell saying the administration would need to tap into money from customs revenue. The deadline the judge set is for the government to distribute the money to states, but even if it manages that, NPR's Tovia Smith says it is hard to imagine funds could reach individuals that fast. The administration previously stated that reducing benefits is a complicated process that could take weeks to months, and it is unclear whether that process now needs to be undone.   President Trump's allies are raising concerns that he is spending too much time focused on the rest of the world and not enough on domestic issues. The president has been nurturing international relations, from currently hosting Prime Minister Viktor Orbán of Hungary at the White House to a dinner last night with leaders from Central Asia. Earlier, he also threatened strikes against Nigeria. These actions occurred during the same week that the government shutdown became the longest in history.    🎧 The election results have also pointed to Trump possibly losing his edge on the economy.

Among Trump's allies, Vice President JD Vance stated that Republicans need to focus on what is happening on the home front while commenting on the Democratic victories at the ballot box. The White House informed Ordoñez that there will be more of an economic focus on the U.S., pointing to yesterday's announcement of lower prices on obesity drugs.   \n   Deep dive   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Alexis Blake inside her car at her apartment's parking garage on August, 8th, 2025.

After examining data from Quadrant Information Services, startling differences in auto insurance rates were found between drivers with poor credit and those with excellent credit, often resulting in thousands of dollars in annual premiums.   🚗 Insurance companies and industry groups defended the use of credit history to help set premiums. They say it is a powerful indicator of whether a driver will have an insured loss.🚗 Consumer advocates point out that credit scores are consistently lower for lower-income Americans and people of color.🚗 Will Guzzardi, a Democratic lawmaker representing mostly Latino Chicagoans in the Illinois state legislature, has been working on car insurance fairness for about two years. His efforts include introducing a bill that would have required insurers to prove that their practices don't harm any policyholders based on race, gender, or other factors.

That support is deeply rooted in their evangelical faith, he said. But recently, Lahmeyer has noticed the conversation around Israel is changing quite a bit — particularly online.   \n   \"Some very influential leaders, all of whom I like — Tucker Carlson, Candace Owens, Marjorie Taylor Greene — have taken a very controversial stance in regards to the nation of Israel,\" he said.   Last week, Carlson hosted a prominent white nationalist named Nick Fuentes on his show. Although Carlson disagreed with Fuentes on his most antisemitic statements, such as American Jews are more faithful to Israel than they are to the United States, he did broadly align with Fuentes on his views about the country itself.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                White nationalist Nick Fuentes recently appeared on Tucker Carlson's podcast where he promoted antisemitic ideas. While Carlson disagreed on many topics, he said that America's support for Israel needed to be questioned: \"We get nothing out of it, I completely agree with you there,\" Carlson told Fuentes.\n                \n                    Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n    \n\n   \n   \"I've always thought it's great to criticize and question our relationship with Israel because it's insane and it hurts us. We get nothing out of it, I completely agree with you there,\" Carlson said.   Opposition to Israel on the right isn't new, but younger conservatives appear to be rapidly moving away from supporting the close U.S. relationship with the country. Among several polls, one from the Pew Research Center out earlier this year showed that conservatives under 50 were increasingly skeptical of Israel. Over the past three years, the group's negative views of the country jumped from 35% to 50%.   Loading...\n   The stakes for Israel are enormous. If skepticism starts spreading from conservative influencers to elected officials, it could threaten billions in military and foreign aid that Israel receives each year from the U.S.    For more than a decade, the majority of its political support in America has come from Christian conservatives, said Daniel Hummel, a historian at the University of Wisconsin, Madison who's studied Christian support for Israel. Today, with many on the left angry over the war in Gaza, their backing is more important than ever.   \"They're the last bastion of organized, large-scale national support for Israel,\" he said.   Biblical roots   Christian support for Israel is rooted in the Bible itself. Many evangelical Christians believe that the promises God made to the Jewish people in the Old Testament still hold, Lahmeyer said.   \"God's made a covenant with the Jewish people and he's not going to break that covenant,\" he said.   Evangelicals see support of the modern state of Israel as a way of honoring that divine will. \"If God says, 'This land belongs to you eternally,' then it belongs to you eternally — because God's the creator, he's the owner,\" Lahmeyer said.   \n   Many also believe the return of the Jewish people to Israel is a prerequisite for the second coming of Christ, he added.   From a modern standpoint, Hummel says, Christian support for the state of Israel has been growing in fits and starts since the nation was founded in 1948. The famous evangelical pastor Billy Graham visited Israel in the 1960s. By the 1980s and 1990s many large Christian groups, like the Moral Majority and the Christian Coalition, were supporting Israel.   \n   Evangelical support for Israel grew vastly in the years following the 9/11 terror attacks, Hummel said. Particularly in 2006, support for the country took off with the formation of a group known as Christians United For Israel (CUFI). The group became a single-issue lobby that claimed support from millions of American evangelicals, Hummel said. CUFI has been a staunch advocate for Israel and some of its most expansionist policies — such as settlements in the West Bank. (CUFI did not respond to NPR's request for an interview for this story.)   Because of their biblical beliefs about Israel, Hummel said, evangelical backers, known as Christian Zionists, have become central to American support. The backing of Christian Zionists kept growing, even as traditional supporters on the American left grew increasingly skeptical of Israel's policies in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                New housing projects are seen in the West Bank Israeli settlement of Givat Ze'ev,  June 18, 2023. Evangelical Christians have supported the expansion of Israeli settlements.\n                \n                    Ohad Zwigenberg/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Ohad Zwigenberg/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Today Christian Zionists \"are really valuable to Israel,\" he said. \"They tend to say, 'We think Israel knows its interests best… and we just want to support what they decide.'\"   Cracks over Gaza   But Israel's war in Gaza has challenged that view. \"Over the last two years, there has been this kind of gnawing away of support of Israel among evangelical Christians,\" Lahmeyer said.   The polls support that observation, said Shibley Telhami, the Anwar Sadat Professor for Peace and Development at the University of Maryland, who tracks public opinion about Israel. He says that since the war in Gaza, support has plummeted among young conservatives.   \n   Telhami's own work shows that today, only 32% of evangelicals aged 18-34 sympathize with Israel over the Palestinians — that's more than 30 points lower than the older generation. Support more broadly from Republicans in the same age range is only 24%.   Loading...\n   Telhami believes that shift in sentiment has emboldened longtime opponents to Israel on the right.   In addition to Tucker Carlson, prominent Republican influencers like Candace Owens and Stephen Bannon have publicly criticized Israel recently.   Many of these personalities never supported Israel, and they sense that now is the moment to speak up, said Curt Mills, editor of the American Conservative Magazine, which opposes Israeli policies and was founded by Pat Buchanan – a Christian conservative, former presidential hopeful and political commentator.   \n   \"Tucker and Bannon are political operators and in a lot of ways true believers, but they are also very effective businessmen and they would not be doing these programs if nobody gave a hoot,\" he said. \"There's an audience for this, people are frustrated, people are angry and they have reason to be.\"   In addition to anger over the way Israel has conducted its war in Gaza, Mills says many conservatives want America to avoid becoming entangled in new wars, particularly in the Middle East. And they worry Trump is allowing Israel to drive military decisions. That anxiety grew after America bombed Iranian nuclear sites earlier this year.   \"They are using Donald Trump's presidency like a rented car. The Israelis, the Israeli lobby, the Netanyahu Government, the neoconservatives in his ranks,\" he said.   Resurgent antisemitism   A desire for American isolationism and outrage over how Israel has conducted the war have driven some to speak up. But other influencers are using the war as an opportunity to peddle antisemitic conspiracies.   One example came last month, when podcaster Candace Owens discussed a meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a group of U.S. social media influencers:   \n   \"Two years ago, the mere idea that you might share a perspective that Jews are controlling the media, that would be considered antisemitic. You would be called a Jew hater. Fast forward to 2025, and Bibi Netanyahu is now hosting an on-camera meeting,\" she said.   The idea that \"Jews control the media\" is a long-held antisemitic trope. Owens has made other antisemitic remarks in the past, though she has repeatedly said that she does not hate Jewish people.   White nationalist Nick Fuentes used his appearance on Carlson's show to promote numerous antisemitic ideas: including that he believed Jews naturally dislike Europeans and that Jewish people prevent America from unifying around a common vision for itself.   \"The main challenge to that, a big challenge to [unifying the country] is organized Jewry in America,\" he told Carlson.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee (Center) tours the fifth-century Church of St George in the Palestinian Christian village of Taybeh, northeast of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, on July 19, 2025. Huckabee and others in the Trump Administration continue to be highly supportive of Israel.\n                \n                    JAAFAR ASHTIYEH/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        JAAFAR ASHTIYEH/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Hummel points out that much of this antisemitism is entangled in a theological divide over Israel. Many conservative opponents to Israel are Catholic or non-evangelical Protestants, he said. Those individuals do not necessarily share the view that the Jewish people still share a sacred covenant with God. And some, like Fuentes, are resurfacing centuries-old Christian conspiracy theories about the Jewish people.   Telhami says that it remains to be seen what all this actually means for the relationship between America and Israel. The Trump administration continues to be broadly supportive, and the U.S. ambassador to Israel is Mike Huckabee — a devout evangelical Christian.   \"The question of course is whether the shift in public opinion in-and-of-itself would lead to a shift in policy. And that's not a straightforward line,\" Telhami said.   But he added, it is clear that on the American right, support for Israel is no longer the given it once was.\n",

Clary/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The Trump administration is reducing air traffic at 40 of the nation's busiest airports, starting Friday and ramping up over the next week.   The Federal Aviation Administration says the move aims to reduce pressure on air traffic controllers. As federal employees, they have been working without pay for over a month due to the government shutdown, now the longest in U.S. history with no end in sight.   \n   Delays and disruptions have already hit airports across the country as a result of escalating staffing shortages. The new flight restrictions add another layer of uncertainty and stress for travelers.   \"It does have the potential to be quite disruptive, even though the vast majority of flights are still going to operate as scheduled,\" says Nick Ewen, senior editorial director of The Points Guy travel website.   The cancellations on Friday represent about a 4% reduction in flights. That number is expected to ramp up to the FAA-required 10% — or some 4,400 fights daily — by next Friday if the shutdown continues.   \n   Major U.S. airlines say they are trying to minimize disruptions and are granting customers extra flexibility to change or refund their tickets during this period — even if their flight isn't canceled. The key word is \"flexibility,\" Ewen says.   \"Travelers that are flying this weekend into next week, they have to be flexible and ready to pivot if things go wrong,\" he says.   Here's what to know if that applies to you.   Which flights could be affected?    Ewen says the likelihood of a flight getting canceled comes down to factors such as the size of the plane, how full it is and what route it is flying.   \"The airlines are really trying to focus on those flights that are going to be least disruptive, where there are … alternatives to get affected customers to their final destination,\" he adds.   United, Delta and Alaska airlines, for instance, say their international flights will not be affected.   United also says it is not canceling any flights operating between its seven hub airports, in Newark, N.J., Chicago, Houston, Denver, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and San Francisco.   \n   Some airlines have already posted flight changes through the weekend, and others into next week. They all say they are working to alert passengers on affected flights with as much notice as possible, directly through booking contact information as well as through their apps and websites.   Ewen says anyone planning to travel should download their airline's app days in advance, and make sure notifications are enabled so travelers will, ideally, know about any changes before they actually get to the airport.   \n   \"If you do go to the airport, remember that a little kindness goes a long way,\" he adds. \"Screaming at a gate agent, yelling at a customer service agent is not going to increase the likelihood of you getting rebooked.\"   What if your flight gets canceled?    Ewen advises passengers to try to rebook their flight as soon as possible, either through the airline's app or website, by phone or in-person if they're already at the airport.   \"If you're on a plane with 100 passengers that gets canceled, that's 100 people that have to be accommodated,\" Ewen says. \"So if you can be among the first five to get accommodated, that's going to be ideally a better situation than someone who's the 95th customer.\"   Airlines including Alaska, Southwest and JetBlue say that in most cases, customers on canceled flights will be automatically rebooked on the next available flight, though they can still cancel for a refund.   Under Department of Transportation rules, customers on significantly delayed or canceled flights who choose not to accept an airline's rebooking option are entitled to a full refund, regardless of how restrictive their original ticket was.   \n   That still applies here, Ewen says. On top of that, many airlines are giving customers more options by allowing them to cancel or rebook their flights without change fees.   American Airlines is waiving change fees, refunding affected passengers — in any fare class — if their flight is canceled or they choose not to fly. Delta is similarly letting all customers change or cancel their flights for free in affected markets. United also says it will refund those who cancel flights, and waive change fees (and in some cases, fare differences) for those who rebook.   The specifics of these waivers are likely to evolve in the coming days, Ewen says.   \"The best thing to do is if you are flying on a particular airline, look at that airline's website, read through the details of the policy that they have and know that it could change,\" he says. \"So even if your flight is not eligible today, it could be later today, or it could be tomorrow, or it could be on Monday.\"   \n   Should you change your plans proactively?   With so much up in the air, some passengers may be wondering if it's worth flying at all.   Ewen says if your plans are flexible, it may be worth rescheduling — both to remove some of the potential risk and add some \"slack back to the system\" by opening up seats for other people. The same is true for those who may be able to travel by car or train instead.   \"Everyone has their own definition of how important it is to take the trip that they have booked,\" he says. \"But if you are truly flexible and you're like, 'Yeah, no, I can do this some other time,' it could be a good idea to go ahead and make that decision to cancel.\"   What about booking upcoming travel?    Thanksgiving travel — which can be a headache any year — is one big question mark as the shutdown stretches on.   \n   At the moment, Ewen says, it's still \"safe-ish.\" He says people who've already booked Thanksgiving flights shouldn't rush to cancel them just yet, and those hoping to make plans can still proceed with caution.   \"If someone has not booked Thanksgiving travel yet and they have to take a flight, I would say go ahead and try to lock those plans in now, and maybe consider either adding travel insurance on top of that or potentially booking a fully refundable ticket in case there are going to be delays or cancellations.\"   Mark Friedlander, a spokesperson for the nonprofit Insurance Information Institute, recommends people shop around for travel insurance policies beyond what airlines offer at checkout, noting that sites like Squaremouth make it easy to compare options.   He says standard policies typically start at between 4% and 10% of the cost of a prepaid, nonrefundable trip — and while you don't necessarily have to buy them the same day you book your flight, it's cheaper to do so sooner than later.   \n   There is one catch: Most standard policies have a \"known event clause\" for things like natural disasters or political crises, Friedlander says. So the travel insurance you buy while the shutdown is already happening is not likely to cover any disruptions caused by it. That's why airlines' extra flexible policies are \"good news for all consumers,\" he says.   Ewen of The Points Guy says the longer the shutdown continues, the longer it could take crews and planes to get back on track — all the more reason airlines and passengers alike are hoping for a resolution soon.   \n   \"Right now, we're in a little bit of a travel lull before that Thanksgiving rush,\" he says. \"So if we can get things dealt with, hopefully we'll be able to avoid some of the major issues during Thanksgiving week. But again, that just remains to be seen.\"\n",

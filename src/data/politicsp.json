The State Department announced the sales late Wednesday during a nationally televised address by President Donald Trump, who made scant mention of foreign policy issues and did not speak about China or Taiwan at all. U.S.-Chinese tensions have ebbed and flowed during Trump's second term, largely over trade and tariffs but also over China's increasing aggressiveness toward Taiwan, which Beijing has said must reunify with the mainland.   \n   The eight arms sales agreements announced Wednesday cover 82 high-mobility artillery rocket systems, or HIMARS, and 420 Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS — similar to what the U.S. had been providing Ukraine during the Biden administration to defend itself from Russia — worth more than $4 billion. They also include 60 self-propelled howitzer systems and related equipment worth more than $4 billion and drones valued at more than $1 billion.   Other sales in the package include military software valued at more than $1 billion, Javelin and TOW missiles worth more than $700 million, helicopter spare parts worth $96 million and refurbishment kits for Harpoon missiles worth $91 million.   In separate but nearly identical statements, the State Department said the sales serve \"U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.\"   \"The proposed sale(s) will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,\" the statements said.   Under federal law, the U.S. is obligated to assist Taiwan with its self-defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China, which has vowed to take Taiwan by force, if necessary.   Taiwan's Defense Ministry in a statement Thursday expressed gratitude to the U.S. over the arms sale, which it said would help Taiwan maintain \"sufficient self-defense capabilities\" and bring strong deterrent capabilities. Taiwan's bolstering of its defense \"is the foundation for maintaining regional peace and stability,\" the ministry said.   \n   Taiwan's Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung similarly thanked the U.S. for its \"long-term support for regional security and Taiwan's self-defense capabilities,\" which he said are key for deterring a conflict in the Taiwan Strait, the body of water separating Taiwan from China's mainland.   The arms sales comes as Taiwan's government has pledged to raise defense spending to 3.3% of the island's gross domestic product next year and to reach 5% by 2030. The boost came after Trump and the Pentagon requested that Taiwan spend as much as 10% of its GDP on its defense, a percentage well above what the U.S. or any of its major allies spend on defense. The demand has faced pushback from Taiwan's opposition KMT party and some of its population.   Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te last month announced a special $40 billion budget for arms purchases, including to build an air defense system with high-level detection and interception capabilities called Taiwan Dome. The budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033.   The U.S. boost in military assistance to Taiwan was previewed in legislation adopted by Congress that Trump is expected to sign shortly.   Last week, the Chinese embassy in Washington denounced the legislation, known as the National Defense Authorization Act, saying it unfairly targeted China as an aggressor.   \"The bill has kept playing up the 'China threat' narrative, trumpeting for military support to Taiwan, abusing state power to go after Chinese economic development, limiting trade, economic and people-to-people exchanges between China and the U.S., undermining China's sovereignty, security and development interests and disrupting efforts of the two sides in stabilizing bilateral relations,\" Beijing's embassy in Washington said after the legislation passed the House.   \"China strongly deplores and firmly opposes this,\" it said.   The U.S. Senate passed the bill Wednesday.\n",

In a statement posted on X, Bongino thanked President Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel \"for the opportunity to serve with purpose.\"   Bongino was an unusual pick for the No. 2 post at the FBI, a critical job overseeing the bureau's day-to-day affairs traditionally held by a career agent. Neither Bongino nor his boss, Patel, had any previous experience at the FBI.   Bongino did have previous law enforcement experience, as a police officer and later as a Secret Service agent, as well as a long history of vocal support for Trump.   \n   Bongino made his name over the past decade as a pro-Trump, far-right podcaster who pushed conspiracy theories, including some involving the FBI. He had been critical of the bureau, embracing the narrative that it had been \"weaponized\" against conservatives and even calling its agents \"thugs.\"   His tenure at the bureau was at times tumultuous, including a clash with Justice Department leadership over the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.   But it also involved the arrest earlier this month of the man authorities say is responsible for placing two pipe bombs near the Democratic and Republican committee headquarters, hours before the assault on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.   In an unusual arrangement, Bongino has had a co-deputy director since this summer when the Trump administration tapped Andrew Bailey, a former attorney general of Missouri, to serve alongside Bongino in the No. 2 job.   President Trump praised Bongino in brief remarks to reporters before he announced he was stepping down.\"Dan did a great job,\" Trump said. \"I think he wants to go back to his show.\"\n",

Today's top stories   President Trump insisted that the U.S. is poised for an economic boom during a prime-time address to the nation yesterday. He said that high prices are decreasing and attributed many of the country's problems to his predecessors and immigrants. This message comes as Trump's rating on the economy is historically low, and high prices remain a top concern, according to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump addresses the nation from the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Dec. 17, 2025.\n                \n                    Doug Mills/Pool/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Doug Mills/Pool/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 The president essentially asked people to wait because his policies, which he passed this year, will have benefits in the new year, NPR's Deepa Shivaram tells Up First. Trump said families will see a larger tax refund next year. He also announced an initiative that would pay service members $1,776 and an upcoming plan to help lower the cost of housing. Shivaram said that overall, it sounded like a pretty typical Trump address, which included a long list of everything he sees as his accomplishments, all tacked together.   The House of Representatives voted yesterday on a Republican-led health care plan that did not include extending enhanced health care subsidies. Over 20 million Americans rely on the subsidies that are set to expire at the end of this month. Several Republicans went against party leadership and joined Democrats to force a vote on a three-year extension of the subsidies.    \n   🎧 The House speaker now has a decision to make on whether to move the vote sooner, NPR's Barbara Sprunt says. If the vote doesn't happen by the end of this week, it won't take place until next year, as lawmakers are leaving for the holidays. Sprunt says some Republicans could be shifting their stance on these subsidies because next year is a midterm year. Lawmakers recognize what is important to their constituents — in this case, the impact of expiring subsidies on insurance premiums.   Trump has ordered a ban on all sanctioned oil tankers traveling to and from Venezuela. This threat of a partial blockade escalates the administration's pressure campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. It also sparks the question of whether the two countries are inching closer to direct military conflict.    🎧 A full blockage is considered an act of war, but the Trump administration appears to be targeting only tankers already on the sanctions list, according to NPR's Greg Myre. For years, the U.S. has been sanctioning \"ghost ships,\" which are tankers that attempt to disguise their identities and locations in an effort to evade U.S. and Western sanctions. This latest move could prove to be a major blow to Venezuela, as the country is heavily dependent on oil exports. A fully loaded large tanker carries over $100 million worth of oil. If the U.S. seizes a number of ships, it could possibly scare away non-sanctioned tankers who may decide it's not worth the risk.   \n   Deep dive   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Ailsa Ostovitz, left, and her mother, Stephanie Rizk, at their home in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C.

The teachers did so despite numerous studies highlighting that these tools lack reliability. Popular detectors like Turnitin, GPTZero and Copyleaks misidentified some things as AI that weren't, and vice versa, according to findings by Mike Perkins, a leading researcher on academic integrity and AI at British University Vietnam. Their accuracy rates plummet even further when users manipulate the AI test to appear more human. Despite these challenges, NPR found that school districts across the U.S. spend thousands of dollars on these tools.    ➡️ John Grady, a language and literature teacher, uses AI detection tools as a starting point to initiate conversations with students about AI use.➡️ Grady says he scans all essays with GPTZero, and if the tool flags a 50% likelihood of AI use, he digs deeper by using revision history tools to measure writing time and edit counts. If a student submits work with few edits and minimal time writing, he will conduct a check-in.➡️ High school student Zi Shi, whose first language is Mandarin, fears that AI software will flag his work due to his writing style and his limited English vocabulary.

On Cyber Monday, consumers financed a record $1 billion in online purchases through this payment option, according to Adobe Analytics data. Adobe projects that by the end of the season, that figure will jump to $20.2 billion, up 11% from last year. BNPL allows shoppers to purchase goods instantly through lenders like Afterpay and Klarna, and pay them back over time. However, like any form of credit, it comes with drawbacks. Finance experts shared with Life Kit tips on how to use BNPL responsibly. Here is some of the guidance provided to help you protect yourself from risk:    \n   💲 If you already have credit card debt or cannot afford to cover the payments, be wary of using BNPL.💲 Try to only take these loans from one lender, so all your payment plans are in one place, allowing you to better keep track of payments.💲 Avoid impulse buying just because BNPL is an option. One way to avoid buyer's remorse is to imagine talking with your future self, who is looking at all those bills.   If you are curious to learn more about how BNPL loans work, check out these six pros and cons.

In 2025, Goggin quit her job, while Stainnak was fired.\n                \n                    Maansi Srivastava and Tristan Spinski for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Maansi Srivastava and Tristan Spinski for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Liz Goggin recently had an encounter that reminded her of why she once cherished being a federal employee.   She had taken her kids out for ice cream and stopped to chat with a man who was blowing balloons and selling them for a couple of bucks. She quickly learned he was a veteran, struggling with housing issues along with serious health issues — some psychological.   In the past, she would have found a way to bring him into the Veterans Health Administration, where she had worked for a decade, providing therapy and connecting veterans with a range of services available to them.   \n   Then she remembered, she doesn't do that anymore. Goggin had quit her job as a clinical social worker in June after twice being rejected for the \"Fork in the Road\" buyout offer.   She gave the man some pointers on how to navigate the VA. It was all she could do in her new life outside of government.   \"I had this real feeling of sadness,\" she says. \"It definitely sat with me.\"   An exodus of 317,000 federal workers   Just one year ago, being a federal employee was a very different proposition: It meant job security with solid benefits, for the most part, and the chance to serve the American people. Then in January, President Trump returned to the White House and scrambled those assumptions.   Month after month of firings, buyout offers and heightened uncertainty for the federal workforce has led to a mass exodus.   By the end of 2025, some 317,000 federal employees will be out of the government, according to the Office of Personnel Management. Tens of thousands were fired. Far more retired or resigned, many out of fear they would lose their jobs if they stuck around. Others, like Goggin, say the working conditions became untenable.   \"Things felt really hard,\" says Goggin, pointing to new demands that seemed to come out of nowhere: A mandate that employees send their supervisors five bullet points of what they accomplished that week. A directive to report any anti-Christian bias they observed in their co-workers.   \n   \"In my whole time at the VA, I did not see any anti-Christian bias,\" she says. \"To be clear, that was not even remotely an issue.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Goggin described morale at the VA as \"very low\" before she left her job.\n                \n                    Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Trump's crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion had also left Goggin and her co-workers unsure of what was still OK to discuss. Could they focus support groups around their clients' experiences with racism? Could they talk among themselves about their own implicit bias?   \"It was a deluge of things,\" says Goggin. \"Morale was very low.\"   Tossed out and still struggling   For other federal workers, leaving the government was not a choice.   Hours after his inauguration, Trump signed an executive order cracking down on DEI throughout the government, calling it illegal and immoral.   Mahri Stainnak, who was based in Maine, was put on leave the next day and fired soon after.   Stainnak's work with the Office of Personnel Management's DEI office had included introducing people from different backgrounds to careers in the federal workforce.   \"Veterans, people with disabilities, recent graduates including from minority-serving institutions,\" Stainnak recalls proudly.   Stainnak, who uses they/them pronouns, had actually moved to a new role just before Trump's return to the White House, and still they were fired. Today, they are still struggling to find full-time work.   \"It's an incredibly difficult job market right now,\" Stainnak says. \"Each application, each interview, the stakes feel so high.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Mahri Stainnak worked in the Office of Personnel Management's DEI office under former President Biden but had moved to a new role just before Trump's return to the White House. Still, Stainnak was fired.\n                \n                    Tristan Spinski for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Tristan Spinski for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Once the main breadwinner for their family, Stainnak says they've been forced to make difficult decisions.   \"When I lost my job, I lost our family dental insurance,\" says Stainnak. \"So do we take our toddler to the dentist and pay out of pocket, or is that an expense that we choose to cut?\"   Stainnak is now part of a class-action lawsuit alleging that the Trump administration illegally discriminated against potentially thousands of federal employees who worked in DEI roles before they were fired.   \n   Those Stainnak knows personally are all people of color, women, or members of the LGBTQ+ community.   The lawsuit alleges that Trump and others in his administration targeted the employees because of their actual or perceived political beliefs, their advocacy on behalf of members of protected groups, or their race or gender.   \"It's not OK for the Trump administration to target us because of who we are and what they think we believe,\" Stainnak says.   The Trump administration has not yet filed a response to the legal complaint, and the White House declined to answer a question from NPR about the lawsuit. In his January executive order, Trump asserted that DEI efforts under former President Joe Biden amounted to \"immense public waste and shameful discrimination.\"   Saving the country vs. \"burning the whole house down\"   Throughout the year, Trump has celebrated the disruption he's brought to the government after vowing for years to \"drain the swamp.\"   \"After a lifetime of unelected bureaucrats stealing your paychecks, attacking your values and trampling your freedoms, we are stopping their gravy train, ending their power trip,\" he told a cheering crowd at a rally in Michigan in late April.   Trump insists he is saving the country from waste, fraud and abuse.   Max Stier could not disagree more.   \"They are burning the whole house down,\" says Stier, founding president of the Partnership for Public Service.   For more than two decades, the nonprofit has worked across both Democratic and Republican administrations, helping to guide presidential transitions, conducting leadership training, and proposing ways to make the government function better.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Max Stier, founding president of the Partnership for Public Service, worries that Trump is taking the country back to a patronage system that last existed in the 1800s.\n                \n                    Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Now, Stier warns, by getting rid of institutions and people he doesn't care for, Trump is turning back the clock to the 1800s, when the government served the private interests of those in power, not the public good.   \"It's been 140 years since our country had something remotely close to this experience,\" he says.   \n   In response, White House assistant press secretary Liz Huston wrote: \"President Trump's only motivation as the President of the United States is improving the lives of the American people and making our country greater than ever before.\"   She added that in less than a year in office, Trump has made \"significant progress\" in making the government more efficient, pointing to Trump's plans to overhaul the nation's air traffic control system and a sharp decrease in the number of veterans awaiting benefits, among other achievements.   Stier says he recognizes that there are some good things happening, and they should be embraced. But the problem is scale.   \"If they figure out a way to better paint one of the rooms, that's great. But burning the house down is so overwhelming that it's difficult to pay a lot of attention to that,\" he says.   A golden opportunity lost   Like Goggin, Keri Murphy often finds herself grappling with sadness.    Back in the summer of 2024, Murphy had been thrilled to land an administrative job at the Commerce Department.   \"Outside of being called a mom, it was the best title I've ever been given — being a federal employee and civil servant,\" she says.   Nowadays, she struggles to remember why she was so proud.   Starting in March, Murphy was swept up in the Trump administration's chaotic purge of probationary employees, mostly newer hires. Many of them were told they were being fired because of poor performance, even though it wasn't true.   \"I had just received an award,\" she says, \"for outstanding performance.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Keri Murphy had just landed an administrative job with the Commerce Department in the summer of 2024. She was fired as part of the Trump administration's chaotic purge of probationary employees, mostly newer hires.\n                \n                    Via Keri Murphy\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Via Keri Murphy\n    \n\n   \n   She'd been laid off before. But this was a new experience.   Lawsuits ensued. Murphy was temporarily reinstated under court order, then fired again when an appeals court overruled that order. A different court issued a final judgment this fall, finding the mass firing of probationary employees was illegal. But the judge did not order workers reinstated, saying too much water had passed under the bridge. The decision left Murphy deeply disappointed.   \"We're still drowning in that same water,\" she says.   \n   A few weeks ago, Murphy started a new job, one she thinks is a good fit. But the pay is about half of what she was making in the government, and there are no benefits.   \"So that's why I don't know if this will work,\" she says.   Thriving but wistful   After deciding she was done with the VA, Goggin, the clinical social worker, made a profile on Psychology Today, found an office in a quiet commercial strip near her home and began providing therapy to private clients.   It's clear the skills and expertise she brought to the government are in high demand outside government too.   Six months after walking away from her job, Goggin is busy — perhaps too busy. In addition to seeing private clients, she runs a weekly support group at a substance use recovery program. She likes the work and the flexibility that comes with being self-employed. But leaving the VA was hard, she says.   \"I think of those people that I worked with, and what I learned from them, and how meaningful it felt over the years — and intense. I mean, that's the word I'd use,\" she says.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Goggin says she enjoys the flexibility that comes with being self-employed but misses the intensity of working with veterans.\n                \n                    Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Even with a thriving private practice, Goggin can picture herself returning to the VA someday. She still finds herself checking the government's hiring portal, USAJobs, just to see what's available.   \"It's this weird habit that I have,\" she says.   Murphy says she too would consider going back to the government, despite all she's been through.   \"It's crazy. I would love to,\" she says. \"Just not under this administration.\"\n",

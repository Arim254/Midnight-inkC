    "body": "<div>\n      <p>A pair of Senate Democrats is responding to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/30/g-s1-91091/trump-bombing-drug-boats-terror\" target=\"_blank\"><u>a series of unprecedented U.S. military strikes on alleged drug traffickers at sea</u></a> ordered by President Trump with a plan to force a Senate vote on a war powers resolution blocking the escalated action by the commander in chief.</p>   <p>Sens. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., are pushing for the vote despite tough odds for passage as support among Republicans appears limited so far. They argue the White House has not provided evidence to justify the attacks, which they believe are illegal and unconstitutional. </p>   <p>The two Democrats also say<strong> </strong>it's clear Congress has not authorized the use of such force.</p>   <p>\"The resolution would stop this blowing up of ships,\" Schiff told reporters in the Capitol ahead of the vote. \"It would also address the administrations' threat that they're going to go potentially beyond blowing up ships at sea to attacking targets on land in Venezuela or elsewhere.\"</p>   <p>Last month, Trump ordered three U.S. military strikes on boats after administration officials suspected them as carrying members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang smuggling drug shipments from Venezuela. So far 21 people have been killed, but their identities have yet to be shared.</p>   \n   <p>Venezuelan officials say at least some of those killed were not gang members, creating <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/05/nx-s1-5529382/rubio-warns-cartels-as-u-s-strike-on-venezuelan-boat-raises-regional-unease\" target=\"_blank\"><u>a new unease in the region</u></a>. But the Trump<strong> </strong>administration insists the strikes were entirely legal, arguing narco-traffickers are now military threats and not law enforcement threats.</p>   <p>The move has upended the U.S. drug interdiction program, where the Coast Guard traditionally intercepts vessels at sea, confiscates illegal drugs and takes suspected drug traffickers into custody to face criminal charges.</p>   <p>Kaine said more than two dozen congressional Democrats wrote the Trump administration demanding answers to a series of questions regarding the legal basis for the strike, but have yet to get a response weeks later. Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said one closed door briefing has been held for senators so far, but that brought little clarity.</p>   <p>\"A room full of people from the administration,\" Kaine told reporters. Yet \"no information about why attacking rather than interdicting.\"</p>   <p>Kaine and Schiff worry that the military strikes could lead the U.S. unexpectedly and unintentionally into war.</p>   <p>It's unclear many Republicans will join Democrats in the effort, with a vote expected in the coming day. However, Schiff and Kaine said they could bring the resolution up again if it doesn't pass on the first try.</p>   \n   <p>It appears at least <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/14/nx-s1-5535624/congress-worries-u-s-strike-on-venezuelan-boat-signals-trumps-expanded-war-powers\" target=\"_blank\"><u>one Republican, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.</u></a>, who has long pushed war powers limits, is on board. Many others, such as <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/14/nx-s1-5535624/congress-worries-u-s-strike-on-venezuelan-boat-signals-trumps-expanded-war-powers\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have defended the administration's actions</u></a>, arguing the rules of engagement have shifted.</p>   <p>However, Schiff and Kaine say without the identities of those killed, it's possible the U.S. got it wrong or may in the future.</p>   <p>\"I have no idea precisely the identities of who was on these ships, or even whether the administration knows their identities, and that's a real problem,\" Schiff said. \"Are they killing people who were not engaged in trafficking? I just don't know the answer to that question.\"</p>   <p>Kaine says that fuels a new wave of questions.</p>   <p>\"The suspicious mind in me says it's because there aren't good answers,\" he said.<br /></p>\n</div>",

That's the latest milestone in its massive ongoing rally, with prices rising more than 50% just this year.</p>   <p>The precious metal is usually seen as a \"safe haven\" investment, especially when more mainstream assets seem risky. The soaring demand for its perceived safety coincides with President Trump's dramatic and often erratic economic policies, including <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/transcripts/nx-s1-5559644\" target=\"_blank\">upending global trade</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5546737/federal-reserve-lowers-rates-but-less-than-trump-wants\" target=\"_blank\">threatening the independence</a> of the Federal Reserve.</p>   <p>On the surface, Wall Street seems to have mostly <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/27/nx-s1-5476238/trump-stocks-market-economy-tariffs-businesses\" target=\"_blank\">shrugged off</a> this spring's worries about Trump's policies. In recent weeks, the major U.S. stock market indices have hit record high after record high.</p>   \n   <p>But at the same time, the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/07/nx-s1-5455867/trump-dollar-value-debt-currency\" target=\"_blank\">value of the U.S. dollar</a> has fallen about 10%. That threatens both the stability of the global economy, since the dollar undergirds so much of its financial system, and the United States' long-established dominance as the world's economic superpower.</p>   <p>\"Gold usually rises when the dollar is weak,\" says Jose Rasco, chief investment officer for HSBC Americas.</p>   <p>\"Given all the uncertainty around policy, people said, 'We're not sure about the dollar' … and the dollar has depreciated as a result,\" he added.</p>   \n   <p>Now gold is having its hottest year in <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/gold-price-rising-61bc0b52?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAjkkoi2BpknO3ZOMaUwwi6vmt7lj-z1Tl4_NDR6--08ACeCcWHG1pJkzJZKzo8%3D&gaa_ts=68e6775c&gaa_sig=FKzg7UrdbCjUFUreTRv-s-N_TeN2TfQE836TGp3Yih__yjBdrC5noEUbfhBrpUdwF3gypMAwk-M-XD_QjUkuIQ%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\">nearly half a century</a> — since the global energy and inflation crises of 1979.</p>   <p>And it's showing no signs of stopping: This week, analysts at Goldman Sachs <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-sp-500-nasdaq-10-07-2025/card/goldman-sachs-sees-gold-hitting-4-900-by-late-next-year-5C5R6Hg99KpPEwFAIp9A?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAgYIFR5-kM9iOVkfCkdM9sDgwXTZeP07lbLG1HVcYzDeoqvm6RVAFg2ozqQHNI%3D&gaa_ts=68e68059&gaa_sig=FCbcMigVK9TkvA6mr3zN6qfUDTBHvX80kHaT7dpJD0R8l16yk-7jIrPcnEHWilk1tUGcv9JxIS-O9L8K8GgBqw%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\">predicted</a> that the price of gold would hit $4,900 by the end of 2026.</p>   <p>Daan Struyven, Goldman's co-head of commodities research, co-authored that report. He tells NPR that he wouldn't be surprised if gold beats his high expectations (or has what he calls \"upside risk\").</p>   <p>\"While our price forecast is quite elevated, we actually see some upside risk to that high price target,\" Struyven says</p>   <h3>Gold may be known as a \"safe haven\" — but there are risks, and costs, to buying it</h3>   <p>Gold has long enjoyed a reputation for offering safety in what's known as the \"fear trade.\" As a glittering precious metal that can be held (and hoarded!), gold offers the appearance of safety and solidity next to stocks and other (often less-material) financial instruments.</p>   \n   <p>\"When it seems like the world is going to hell in a handbasket, gold usually appreciates,\" Lee Baker, a certified financial planner who is the founder and CEO of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/01/nx-s1-5347985/gold-prices-record-highs-tariffs-trump\" target=\"_blank\">told NPR this spring</a>.</p>   <p>But he warns there can be downsides to buying and owning gold — even in times of crisis. For example, unlike stocks or bonds, gold doesn't pay any dividends or interest. So the only way to make money from this investment is to buy some, and then hope to sell it after the price goes up.</p>   \n   <p>There are also physical and logistical challenges to investing in gold — especially for people who want to buy the real thing. For example, buyers need to consider how to store it — and whether to pay for the security and insurance required to keep precious metals in their homes.</p>   <p>For those who are gold-curious but perhaps not ready to adopt a doomsday-prepper lifestyle, Baker notes that it's possible to invest in gold-backed funds that don't require physical ownership of precious metals.</p>   <p>More broadly, he says the current gold frenzy highlights a larger lesson about investing in more than just one asset class, such as stocks.</p>   <p>\"Your mama told you not to put all your eggs in one basket. It applies to investing as well,\" he says. \"Diversification matters.\"<br /></p>\n</div>",

But for the most part, we're going to take care of our people. There are some people that really don't deserve to be taken care of, and we will take care of them in a different way.\"</p>   \n   <p>When pressed on the legality of such a move, Trump said, \"What the law says is correct, and I follow the law.\"</p>   \n   <p>Trump was responding to questions about a draft memo from the Office of Management and Budget, which was first reported by Axios and confirmed by a senior White House official not authorized to discuss the memo, which has not been publicly circulated.</p>   <p>The fight over federal worker pay is the latest salvo in the Trump administration's efforts to force Democrats to vote for a clean continuing resolution and drop their demands to extend health care subsidies for millions of Americans.</p>   <p>The memo's legal argument contradicts <a href=\"https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/reference-materials/special-instructions-for-agencies-affected-by-a-possible-lapse-in-appropriations-starting-on-10-1-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">guidance issued by the Office of Personnel Management</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/1341\" target=\"_blank\">wording of a 2019 law</a> signed by Trump during his first term that explicitly guarantees that federal workers \"shall be paid\" when a shutdown ends, whether they were furloughed or continued working.</p>   <p>The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, a bipartisan law enacted after the record 35-day shutdown in 2018, added language to the Antideficiency Act that automatically applies back pay to federal employees for \"any lapse in appropriations that begins on or after December 22, 2018.\"</p>   <p>Previously, Congress had to approve retroactive funding after a shutdown with new legislation.</p>   \n   <p>The White House memo notes a clause in the text that says workers shall be paid \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates, and subject to the enactment of appropriations Acts ending the lapse\" and argues that this means congressional action is required to enact back pay.</p>   \n   <p>Guidance published by the Office of Management and Budget on Sept. 30 did include a reference to the law's automatic restoration of pay.</p>   <p>\"The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-1) provides that upon enactment of appropriations to end a lapse, both furloughed and excepted employees will be paid retroactively as soon as possible after the lapse ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates,\" the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20251002174206/https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Frequently-Asked-Questions-During-a-Lapse-in-Appropriations.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Sept. 30 memo reads</a>. \"Additional guidance for agencies on implementing Public Law 116-1 and treatment of pay and leave is available from OPM.\"</p>   <p>A <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Frequently-Asked-Questions-During-a-Lapse-in-Appropriations.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">version updated on Oct. 3</a> removes those paragraphs.</p>   <p>The draft memo is the latest in a multipronged pressure campaign from the White House seeking to punish Democrats during the shutdown, including efforts to cancel grant funding for energy projects and hold up transportation funding in states that did not vote for Trump in 2024. The administration has also threatened widespread reduction-in-force efforts at federal agencies, which have so far not materialized.</p>   \n   <h3>Congress responds</h3>   <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters that while he isn't extensively familiar with the plan and hasn't discussed it with the White House, it is possible there may be a legal justification for the draft. </p>   <p>\"There are legal analysts who think that is not something the government should do,\" Johnson said. \"If that is true, that should turn up the urgency and the necessity of the Democrats doing the right thing here.\"</p>   <p>The top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., argued that any interpretation to withhold back pay was \"lawless.\" </p>   \n   <p>\"They're plotting to try and rob furloughed federal workers of back pay at the end of this shutdown,\" Murray said in remarks on the Senate floor. \"This flies in the face of the plain text of the law, which could not be more clear.\"</p>   <p>Loading...</p>\n   <p><em>Deepa Shivaram contributed to this report. </em></p>\n</div>",

Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, says he is \"sick and tired\" of the current federal shutdown and placed blame on both Republicans and Democrats for how negotiations play out during federal shutdowns.</p>   <p>In an interview with <em>Morning Edition</em>, Johnson said shutdowns are often a good excuse for the \"uniparty\" — a collection of both Republicans and Democrats \"that are happy to mortgage our children's future\" — to spend more federal money.</p>   <p>\"It's often said 'show me a member of Congress who ever lost because he spent too much money.' That's our problem,\" Johnson continued. \"And the other problem is the American public, by and large, loves free federal money.\"</p>   \n   <p>With the Senate unable to pass either of two dueling continuing resolution spending proposals, most of the federal government remains shut down.</p>   <p>Republicans want a clean spending bill that would fund the government for seven weeks. Democrats insist that any measure <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/02/nx-s1-5559810/shutdown-aca-health-care-premium-subsidies\" target=\"_blank\">should extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies</a> — which are used by over 20 million people to make their health insurance more affordable. Those subsidies will expire at the end of the year. Democrats also want to reverse cuts to health spending made by President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act and limit the president's ability to withhold funds appropriated by Congress.</p>   \n   <p>Johnson blamed the high costs of health care on the \"faulty design of Obamacare\" and said Democrats should be willing to work with Republicans to fix \"their horrible health bill.\" President Trump in his first term — with Republicans in control of both houses — did not repeal and replace Obamacare as he pledged to do during the 2016 campaign.</p>   <p>Negotiations like the one happening now over health care, Johnson said, can be avoided with his proposed <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/2806\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Eliminate Shutdowns Act</u></a> — a piece of legislation that would fund the federal government at the previous year's spending levels in the event Congress fails to approve a spending resolution for a new fiscal year.</p>   \n   <p>Speaking to NPR's Michel Martin, Johnson discussed the nature of shutdowns and efforts by Republicans to address health care costs.</p>   <p><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>      <h3>Interview highlights</h3>   <p><strong>Michel Martin: </strong>We're hearing that there's no movement between the leadership over the past week on ending the shutdown. But how about senator to senator, person to person? Is there anything going on there?</p>   <p><strong>Sen. Ron Johnson: </strong>Well, let me just ask, do you enjoy covering this issue? I'm sick and tired of these shutdown showdowns. Last fiscal year — I don't know how many cliffs we came to — it took us six months to just do a continuing resolution. This is a ridiculous situation we're in. So I proposed the Eliminate Shutdown Act. So all this does is it would establish a 14-day rolling continuing appropriations where you haven't funded the department or all the government. It doesn't shut it down. If you haven't appropriated for a government agency, you just fund it at last year's levels. It would give the appropriators time. You know, you find the areas of agreement. You know, we passed some appropriation bills prior to the end of the fiscal year in the Senate. So, again, this doesn't have to happen at all. This is ridiculous.</p>   <p><strong>Martin: </strong>So you made this proposal. It would continue the current funding levels in two-week increments, as you just said, when there's no actual funding bill in place. It would seem there'd be something for both sides in this. It would keep spending at its current level. It would give people an opportunity to negotiate. Your proposal didn't go forward. Why do you think that is?</p>   <p><strong>Johnson: </strong>Because it doesn't spend enough. Spending at last year's levels just is not enough for the uniparty, certainly not enough for Democrats and our own appropriators. Again, it seems dysfunctional, but understand: this process of shutdown showdowns — this is a well-honed process for mortgaging our children's future.</p>   \n   <p><strong>Martin: </strong>But it would seem that there's something in it for both sides. And because some Republicans did vote with the Democrats, would that suggest that there's something in it for both sides? These shutdowns have some appeal for both sides.</p>   <p><strong>Johnson: </strong>Yeah, absolutely. That's what I'm saying. The uniparty loves the shutdown showdown because it backs us up to these deadlines. The first one is going to be Thanksgiving. We won't come to an agreement by then. So then the next will be Christmas Eve. And then that gives your appropriaters enough time, a few people, to write a couple thousand-page bill, drop it on our desks and say, take it or leave it. And unfortunately enough people take it. And that's why we're $37 trillion in debt, facing another $26 trillion of deficits over the next 10 years. So it's completely unsustainable.</p>   <p><strong>Martin: </strong>So at the center of this current argument is health care. Democrats say they want to extend the subsidies that help people buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. In your state, a little over 313,000 people bought their health insurance through this ACA marketplace in 2025. What are you telling those folks whose costs are set to increase?</p>   <p><strong>Johnson: </strong>Well, I like<em> The Washington Post </em>headline yesterday saying the truth is the Affordable Care Act was never affordable. The reason the insurance rates are skyrocketing is because of the faulty design of Obamacare. I think Republicans would be happy to help Democrats fix their horrible health care bill. It wasn't affordable. It didn't protect patients. You couldn't keep your doctor. You weren't able to keep your insurance. It's been an utter failure. Free government money, free health insurance — that's always going to be popular.</p>   <p><em>Editor's note: </em>The Washington Post<em> editorial board </em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/10/05/government-shutdown-aca-subsidies-debt/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><u>published an opinion piece</u></em></a><em> Oct. 5 in which it claimed \"The real problem is that the Affordable Care Act was never actually affordable.\"</em></p>   <p><strong>Martin: </strong>President Trump in his first term had both the House and the Senate and Republicans as a group did not fix this problem. So why is it fair to blame Democrats for this now?</p>   \n   <p><strong>Johnson: </strong>I was highly critical of our failed effort back then. I always kept saying, rather than talking about \"repeal, replace,\" you got to talk about repairing the damage done by Obamacare and transition to a system that actually works. The main problem with Obamacare is it forced the very small percentage of Americans that buy their policies on individual policy to cover the entire cost of covering people with preexisting conditions. They got rid of high-risk pools that worked, could have been tweaked, you know, that actually covered those people. And again, Democrats' entire focus on this was going to a single-payer system.</p>   <p><strong>Martin: </strong>But President Trump and the Republicans control both branches of Congress now and the White House now. What are your plans to fix this now?</p>   <p><strong>Johnson: </strong>So we're actually working with health care experts and we're looking at the faulty design of Obamacare and looking at how we can fix it now. Will Democrats actually do it? I doubt it. Their idea of fixing anything is to just throw more money at it, which is what they're trying to do with these temporary, pandemic-enhanced subsidies, which again, it's just driving health care costs higher.</p>   <p><strong>Martin: </strong>Well, speaking of money, President Trump is suggesting that at least some furloughed federal workers might not be paid once the government reopens. Do you think that's fair?</p>   <p><strong>Johnson: </strong>Again, I think shutdowns are stupid and we can avoid this whole thing. Wouldn't even be an issue if Democrats just vote for this continuing resolution. Or even better yet, we passed the Eliminate Shutdown Act and we'll never have to have this conversation again, Michel. And I like talking to you. I hate this conversation. This is ridiculous. We're in this situation. We can eliminate this for all time. But the big spenders, the appropriators, the Union Party loves this process because this is how exactly they've mortgaged our children's future. This is why we're $37 trillion in debt. That's the big picture.</p>   \n   <p><strong>Martin: </strong>The president is threatening to lay off the furloughed federal workers. What are your thoughts on that? I know that the federal workforce is not a big part of Wisconsin's workforce, but what are your thoughts about that? Do you think that's fair?</p>   <p><strong>Johnson: </strong>Well, first of all, when you have a bankrupt entity, everybody gets laid off or when you have a company that's in real trouble, you have to start laying off just to get the company to survive. So that's what happens in the private sector. I don't know why the public sector employee should be immune to that exact same process. We need to start trimming the size of government, the size, scope and cost of it, because again, we are mortgageing our future, devaluing our dollar and that's why people can't afford things. But the shutdown showdowns, this is a distraction to the massive problem we have with $37 trillion in debt.<br /></p>   \n   <p><em>This digital article was edited by Treye Green.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>Millions of dollars have been spent on ads for and against California's Proposition 50, a November ballot measure that would redraw congressional maps to favor Democrats.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>A MARTÍNEZ, HOST: </p><p> More than $100 million have flowed into campaigns over California's Proposition 50. The November ballot measure asked California voters to approve new congressional districts that favor Democrats. It's in response to Republican-led gerrymandering efforts in Texas and other states, following demands from President Trump. From member station KQED, Guy Marzorati has more on what's become an expensive fight on California's airwaves.</p><p>GUY MARZORATI, BYLINE: Governor Gavin Newsom has raised over $90 million in support of Proposition 50. Marva Diaz, publisher of the California Target Book, a nonpartisan election guide, says much of that money has come from the usual suspects of California Democratic fundraising.</p><p>MARVA DIAZ: So you see the Nurses Association, SEIU, lots of labor money, lots of high Democratic donors pitching in.</p><p>MARZORATI: But there's also big money from outside of the state supporting Newsom's push to pick up five congressional seats for Democrats. Prop 50's top funders include a group working to elect Democrats to Congress and an organization run by mega-donor George Soros. The Prop 50 campaign has also raised millions in small-dollar donations from residents in all 50 states.</p><p>DIAZ: I think it speaks to how important this is to the Democratic Party.</p><p>MARZORATI: Prop 50 would temporarily set aside a congressional map drawn by a citizens' commission created by California voters, but Newsom has focused his campaign squarely on President Trump.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>GAVIN NEWSOM: Wake up to what Donald Trump is doing.</p><p>MARZORATI: The Yes on 50 campaign has ads criticizing Trump for cracking down on free speech and failing to lower costs.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>NEWSOM: On November 4, you have the power to stand up to Trump.</p><p>MARZORATI: One word not mentioned in those ads? Redistricting. While the Yes side is focusing on the national stakes, the campaign against Prop 50 is defending the work of the independent redistricting commission...</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR: That spent thousands of hours meeting with California citizens to create fair election districts.</p><p>MARZORATI: That shouldn't be a surprise. The No campaign's top funder is Republican donor Charles Munger Jr., who bankrolled the ballot measure to create the commission back in 2008.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR: Prop 50 destroys this good work.</p><p>MARZORATI: Despite donations from national House Republicans and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, the No side has raised less than half of what the Yes on 50 campaign has brought in. While Newsom is clearly the face of the Proposition 50 campaign, opponents are hoping for a boost from another familiar voice to Californians.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER: This is why it is important for you to vote no on Proposition 50.</p><p>MARZORATI: Arnold Schwarzenegger, the state's former Republican governor, championed the creation of independent redistricting in the state.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>SCHWARZENEGGER: Democracy. We got to protect it, and we got to go and fight for it.</p><p>MARZORATI: When he spoke out against Prop 50 in an event last month at the University of Southern California, the No campaign was there to film it and quickly turn it into an ad. Marva Diaz - again, the publisher of the California Target Book - says Schwarzenegger can be an important voice in opposition, especially for swing voters.</p><p>DIAZ: Him coming out saying two wrongs don't make a right is really a powerful message.</p><p>MARZORATI: But Diaz says Schwarzenegger has resisted taking a more active role against Proposition 50, perhaps feeling the campaign has become too partisan.</p><p>DIAZ: I don't think he wants to be associated with Trump.</p><p>MARZORATI: Still, with voting underway, Californians should get used to seeing lots of Schwarzenegger and Newsom on their TV screens.</p><p>For NPR News, I'm Guy Marzorati in San Jose.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF EAGLES SONG, \"HOTEL CALIFORNIA\")</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.

Republicans continue to say they'll talk when the government is back open. Meanwhile, President Trump is saying this about Democrats.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You want to know the truth? This is like a kamikaze attack. They almost - you know, they have nothing to lose.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: NPR's Domenico Montanaro is looking at whether there's any way out of this shutdown. So, Domenico, with President Trump talking like that, how do the two sides even get to talking?</p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Yeah. I mean, Trump shows no signs of budging here. I mean, aside from his language about Democrats, he and his budget office director are threatening permanent layoffs of some federal workers, even floating the possibility that the government might not give back pay to some furloughed workers. That's something that's in pretty hot dispute right now. And they're moving to cut off funding from blue states for various projects. You know, Trump has been trying to give the impression that congressional leaders are talking, but there's really no indication that that's even happening right now. So it looks more like a game of chicken, with the administration feeling like it can weather this politically and lay the blame at - on Democrats squarely.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: All right. So how are congressional leaders responding to that?</p><p>MONTANARO: Well, on the Republican side, you know, they're calling Democrats' demands too much. Here's House Speaker Mike Johnson.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>MIKE JOHNSON: It is a wild wish list, a big government liberal nonsense that we can't do.</p><p>MONTANARO: You know, Republicans keep saying that they want to reopen the government and then negotiate, but calling what Democrats want big government liberal nonsense makes a lot of Democrats skeptical that Republicans really want to negotiate at all. What he seems to be hoping for here - Johnson - is really cracks among Democrats.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: So is there any evidence that that even exists?</p><p>MONTANARO: To an extent. I mean, we've seen a few who caucus with the Democrats who have been voting with Republicans to reopen the government - senators Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Angus King, an independent from Maine. But that hasn't been growing. You know, largely, Democrats are sticking together because they feel like they have an advantage on health care. Unlike a decade ago, you know, the Affordable Care Act is actually really popular now, and Democratic leaders want to drill home the point that they're in favor of extending ACA subsidies, and Republicans are not. Here's Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer yesterday.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>CHUCK SCHUMER: The bottom line is very simple. We want them extended. They don't want them extended.</p><p>MONTANARO: And we saw House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries even go so far this week as to challenge Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson to a televised debate on the House floor. Johnson turned that down, needless to say, calling it, quote, \"pathetic and a publicity stunt.\"</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: Are there any signs to kind of indicate which side appears to have the advantage when it comes to convincing voters that they're right or wrong?</p><p>MONTANARO: Yeah. It's tricky because polling has found Republicans getting more of the blame, but not near a majority, and there are a lot of undecideds. Shutdowns usually don't go well for the side looking to add things that are not in a bill, like Democrats are doing here. 2019 shutdown, for example, Trump made it about funding for the border wall, and eventually, with 50 plus percent blaming him and air traffic controllers calling out sick, he agreed to a short-term reopening of the government.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: So, Domenico, you look at this all the time. Any way out of this shutdown?</p><p>MONTANARO: You know, I - basically, I see three scenarios here. First, enough moderate Democratic senators crossover, which could happen if public pressure becomes too much. Second, Republicans overstep, go too far with these firings and other efforts, get more of the blame for things like airport delays and feel pressured to negotiate now. Or third, both parties reach a temporary deal and commit to negotiate on these subsidies. But it's going to come down to politics and the messaging that wins out.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Thanks a lot.</p><p>MONTANARO: You got it.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>NPR's Juana Summers speaks with Illinois Democrat Gov. JB Pritzker about President Trump's efforts to deploy the national guard in Chicago.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: </p><p> The clock is ticking for Chicago and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker. President Trump has deployed the National Guard to the country's third largest city, and he says they will begin operations no later than Wednesday. Pritzker, a Democrat, has called President Trump's efforts a, quote, \"invasion.\" And along with Chicago's Mayor Brandon Johnson, he is fighting the administration's efforts in the courts. Governor JB Pritzker joins me now. Welcome back to the program.</p><p>JB PRITZKER: Thank you very much, Juana.</p><p>SUMMERS: Thanks for being here. Governor, we're speaking on Tuesday morning, and the Trump administration has said that troops will be on the ground no later than tomorrow. You have filed suit against this move, but the judge declined to block the deployment. There will not be a hearing until Thursday morning. So I just want to start by asking you, how are you preparing for the fact that the National Guard could well be on the streets of Chicago as this lawsuit is playing out?</p><p>PRITZKER: Well, let me be clear. The judge is actually deciding this on Thursday and hasn't declined anything. She's literally reading the filings and demanded that the federal government submit something by Wednesday so that she could make a ruling potentially on Thursday. We don't know how she will rule, but certainly, based on the precedent of what occurred down in Oregon, we believe that we'll get the rule that we want.</p><p>Remember that we are seeing National Guard troops coming from Texas now. We have our own National Guard that have been federalized, and the Texas National Guard were already federalized, so that's why they were able to move quickly. And they've already started arriving, not in Chicago, but in Joliet, at a federal facility there. The federal judge, though, warned the federal lawyers that it wouldn't be a good idea for them to deploy them until there is a ruling.</p><p>SUMMERS: Your state's attorney general has argued that the deployment of the military to Illinois is unlawful, unconstitutional, no matter where these forces come from, but the Trump administration, for its part, says that it is deploying troops to assist federal agents with immigration enforcement. So have officers been able to carry out ICE enforcement duties without support of local law enforcement?</p><p>PRITZKER: They have. And they are carrying out those duties. I will say that they are doing them - they're carrying it out in an extremely aggressive fashion that borders on breaking the law - federal law and state law. But ICE agents and Customs and Border Patrol are on the ground, and they have been effectuating their plan. The thing is, they're using literally people's skin color as a way to determine whether they're going to stop people and ask them for their papers. Now, think about that. I don't walk around with papers to prove that I'm a U.S. citizen. I bet you don't either. Most people don't. But they're demanding that, if you happen to have, you know, something other than white skin, you better have something to prove it or you're going to get detained or arrested.</p><p>SUMMERS: Governor, President Trump said on Monday that at the moment, he hasn't planned to but that if governors like yourself and the courts do not cooperate with his administration's efforts, that he would consider invoking the Insurrection Act, which would give him broad latitude to use the guard or active-duty troops for law enforcement in Chicago not limited to protecting federal agents. How serious of a threat is that?</p><p>PRITZKER: Well, remember, the Insurrection Act has the name insurrection in it for a reason. It's only something that you can effectuate if there is an insurrection, a foreign invasion, a true national emergency. That doesn't exist here, and it doesn't exist in Portland. It didn't exist in Washington, D.C., or in Los Angeles. So I realize that President Trump, who does no reading and doesn't understand anything, you know, uses the words Insurrection Act like he understands it but he doesn't.</p><p>SUMMERS: The president might disagree with your characterization there. He has argued that it is emergency. He has described...</p><p>PRITZKER: Yeah, but...</p><p>SUMMERS: ...That there - it looks like war in some of these cities.</p><p>PRITZKER: Yeah, but he's the one that's causing that situation. That is to say, it's ICE and CBP that have been launching grenades with tear gas, that have been pelting people with, you know, plastic or rubber bullets. They're the ones that are creating mayhem on the ground, specifically because they want to claim that there's some sort of emergency. There isn't. This is occurring in a two-block area of a suburb of Chicago, Broadview.</p><p>So, you know, yes, they can take their own video of an incident that occurs, you know, in that two-block area and make it seem like that's all of Chicago. That's not even in the city of Chicago. In fact, our crime rate has been dropping and dropping - you know, half the homicide rate that it was a few years ago, double-digit declines each year now. Donald Trump just - he honestly doesn't read. He doesn't understand what's going on in the cities. He just has some notion in his head. There's some sort of dementia going on, and he just keeps repeating things from years gone by.</p><p>SUMMERS: Governor, as I listen to you talk about the Insurrection Act or the restraining order that your state has filed, it sounds to me like you're in many ways relying on how things have been in the past. And if there's one thing we've seen, it's that the courts have appeared quite willing to increase the power of the president. Are you concerned about where all of this could be going?</p><p>PRITZKER: Sure. And I think we have to rely on the courts and get rulings that are - you know, uphold the Constitution and the law. Unfortunately, we have a system in which the supremacy clause says that the federal government's laws essentially override state laws if they're in direct contravention and also there's immunity for federal agents from the federal government for much of their activity. So we don't do that on the ground. We don't hold everybody immune. Sometimes we do in certain things. But what we can't do is just sit idly by while these things are occurring.</p><p>And that's why we've called on people to take action, like creating evidence for our court cases by pulling out their iPhones and their Android phones and filming everything. We wouldn't even know about the alderman who was detained by ICE for simply standing and asking them questions. She was truly docile in the entire matter. It's on film. We wouldn't know about that if someone hadn't pulled out their phone to take video of it. And we need to find ways to hold them responsible - private organizations, private legal organizations, like the ACLU, are doing that now, and to the extent that states and local governments can do so, we are.</p><p>SUMMERS: Governor JB Pritzker, Democrat of Illinois, thank you so much for speaking with us.</p><p>PRITZKER: Thanks, Juana.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi faced questions about her leadership of the Justice Department at a Senate hearing.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: </p><p> Attorney General Pam Bondi was on Capitol Hill today testifying before Senate lawmakers. It was a combative hearing. Bondi defended her leadership at the Justice Department and she dismissed allegations that she has weaponized the DOJ to go after President Trump's perceived enemies. NPR justice correspondent Ryan Lucas was watching. He is with us now. Hi, Ryan.</p><p>RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Hi there.</p><p>KELLY: Start with the Democrats on the panel. What were they focused on today?</p><p>LUCAS: Well, they certainly had a lot of items to choose from, but they really did zero in on what they say - and many DOJ veterans and legal observers say - has been the department's weaponization under Bondi to target Trump's political foes. The top Democrat on the committee is Illinois' Dick Durbin. Here's how he kind of summed up the Democrats' view on her leadership.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>DICK DURBIN: The attorney general has systematically weaponized our nation's leading law enforcement agency to protect President Trump and his allies and attack his opponents and, sadly, the American people.</p><p>LUCAS: And as Exhibit A, Democrats point to the recent indictment of former FBI Director James Comey just days after the president demanded publicly that the DOJ prosecute Comey and other prominent Trump critics.</p><p>KELLY: Well, and Comey has been indicted, of course, and is not the only person the president has said should be prosecuted.</p><p>LUCAS: That's right. Two other people, notably, that the president publicly demanded by name in a social media post that the DOJ go after were New York Attorney General Letitia James and California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff, who's a member of the committee that Bondi was actually testifying for today.</p><p>KELLY: Which makes for some interesting dynamics, which I hope we're going to get to. But let me ask you first, this allegation that Bondi has weaponized the department, when that was put to her directly, how did she respond?</p><p>LUCAS: Well, look, she was specifically asked about a promise that she made at her confirmation hearing that she would maintain the Justice Department's traditional independence from the White House and keep politics out of investigations and prosecutions. Here's what she said.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>PAM BONDI: I absolutely have upheld that commitment, Senator. I pledged that I would end the weaponization, also, of the Justice Department and that America would once again have a one-tier system of justice for all. And that is what we are doing in this country.</p><p>LUCAS: Now, Democrats also tried to press her on her handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. They tried to press her on the firing of career prosecutors and FBI officials for working in Capitol riot cases or on investigations into Trump. They tried to get answers about the department's decision to drop an investigation into Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, for allegedly taking a $50,000 cash bribe from an undercover FBI agent. She refused to provide answers. In many cases, she tried to deflect, actually, by going after Democratic senators themselves. Here's an exchange with California's Adam Schiff, who said that Bondi was personally attacking Democrats instead of answering questions.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>BONDI: Personal attacks? You've been attacking...</p><p>ADAM SCHIFF: So...</p><p>BONDI: ...My FBI director.</p><p>SCHIFF: ...So - but...</p><p>BONDI: You've been attacking my office.</p><p>SCHIFF: ...But we...</p><p>BONDI: You've been attacking...</p><p>SCHIFF: But what we're interested in...</p><p>BONDI: ...Border czar.</p><p>SCHIFF: ...What we're interested in is the answer to these oversight questions.</p><p>BONDI: What you're...</p><p>SCHIFF: So you were asked...</p><p>BONDI: No. Oversight?</p><p>SCHIFF: ...You were asked by my colleague...</p><p>BONDI: You want your five minutes of fame...</p><p>SCHIFF: ...You were asked by my colleague...</p><p>BONDI: ...Attacking good people.</p><p>SCHIFF: Regular order, Madam Chair, so I can ask a question.</p><p>LUCAS: So this was a combative hearing at times, and that exchange gives you a bit of a taste of what it was like.</p><p>KELLY: It does, indeed. OK, so that's what Democrats had on their mind. What about Republican members of this committee?</p><p>LUCAS: Well, look, there was a huge partisan divide on this. It was like two entirely separate hearings. Republicans expressed their support for Bondi, the enormous change that she's brought to the Justice Department. They argue that the department was weaponized under the Biden administration to go after Trump and conservatives more broadly. That includes information made public this week by the panel's top Republican that the FBI, back in 2023, analyzed the phone records of more than a half dozen Republican lawmakers as part of the investigation into Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. They say Bondi is ending that weaponization.</p><p>So despite concerns from legal observers and department veterans about the direction that the department is taking, Bondi has the political sort (ph) of Republicans and the president to continue what she's doing.</p><p>KELLY: Thank you, Ryan.</p><p>LUCAS: Thank you.</p><p>KELLY: NPR's Ryan Lucas.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.

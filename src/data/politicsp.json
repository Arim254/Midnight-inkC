President Trump has been texting world leaders, and they have been texting him.MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  In one message, Trump told Norway's prime minister that he's trying to seize Greenland in part because he did not receive a Nobel Peace Prize. That was Trump's explanation for shaking the most important U.S. alliance and disrupting the world order. Overnight, Trump shared messages he received. One comes from France's president, who tries flattery on Trump but then raises the issue of Greenland and proposes to discuss it over dinner.INSKEEP: Now, world leaders meet face-to-face at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben is covering all this. Danielle, good morning.DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning.INSKEEP: What's the U.S. delegation doing in Europe?KURTZLEBEN: Well, today, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will be speaking in Davos, then Trump is scheduled to talk on Wednesday. And then on Thursday, there's what the White House is calling a charter announcement for the Board of Peace that Trump created to oversee reconstruction in Gaza after the conflict he's been trying to end between Israel and Hamas. In terms of substance, we don't know much yet. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett has suggested that Trump will unveil a new housing policy. Beyond that, we know he likes to talk about tariffs. And days ago, he threatened to tariff goods from eight European countries until the U.S. has a deal to acquire Greenland.INSKEEP: OK. Thank you for raising that. For those who didn't follow the news over the holiday, what were these threats about tariffs?KURTZLEBEN: Well, Trump posted that he's going to impose 10% tariffs on those eight countries starting on February 1, then raise it to 25% in June - that is, until a Greenland deal happens. Now, we don't really know details here. I've asked the White House, for example, what law would even authorize this, and I haven't received word yet. But those European countries, meanwhile, they're all NATO members, and they've all said they stand in full solidarity with fellow NATO member Denmark, as well as with Greenland, which is part of the kingdom of Denmark.INSKEEP: And Trump has certainly drawn all attention to himself once again with these threats, including personal messages with world leaders. What are these text messages?KURTZLEBEN: Well, maybe most famously over the weekend, Trump texted the Norwegian prime minister that because Trump didn't get the Nobel Peace Prize, he no longer feels the need to think, quote, \"purely of peace,\" adding that the U.S. should have total control over Greenland. Now, of course, the Norwegian government does not decide who gets that prize. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly elaborated to NPR that Greenland is important for national security and that Trump thinks, quote, \"Greenlanders would be better served if protected by the United States.\" That's, of course, certainly not how everyone sees it. In that overnight message from French President Emmanuel Macron that you mentioned, he said at one point, I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland.INSKEEP: A fascinating message also mixed in some flattery. You're doing a great job in Syria.KURTZLEBEN: Right.INSKEEP: Let's get together for dinner. But this is not the only thing Trump is doing on the world stage. There's also that Board of Peace you mentioned, which is what?KURTZLEBEN: Well, that is something that Trump laid out when he talked about how he wants to solve the conflict between Israel and Hamas. And that announcement - that charter announcement that the White House talked about is happening on Thursday. We've learned more about that charter recently. According to a copy obtained by NPR, permanent seats will cost nations a billion dollars each, and Trump is set to be the permanent chair. And as our colleague Daniel Estrin has reported, the charter says there's a need for a more effective international peace-building body, which makes some fear that the board is attempting to create a rival to the U.N. So we're keeping a close eye on that. Russia says Trump has asked President Vladimir Putin to sign on as part of the board. So it's unclear what he'll do and what traditional U.S. allies will do.INSKEEP: OK. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. Thanks so much - really appreciate it.KURTZLEBEN: Of course.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

Tim Walz, expanding the agency's probe alleging that Minnesota officials conspired to impede law enforcement amid the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.   Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her have also been subpoenaed. NPR has not yet confirmed reports that other state and local leaders have also been issued subpoenas.   Frey's subpoena requires him to appear in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis on Feb. 3. The mayor accused the federal government of weaponizing its power to intimidate local leaders.   \n   \"We shouldn't have to live in a country where people fear that federal law enforcement will be used to play politics or crack down on local voices they disagree with,\" he said in a statement.   Earlier Tuesday, U.S. Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino appeared with ICE leader Marcos Charles in a news briefing criticizing Minnesota leaders and defending the work of immigration officers.    \"They're everyday people doing a very hard job, trying to enforce the immigration laws in an environment where local and state politicians have been spreading rhetoric that dehumanizes these officers and agents,\" Charles said.     Protesters in Minnesota have roiled against Immigration and Customs Enforcement after one of its agents shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Macklin Good earlier this month.   \"Less than two weeks ago, federal agents shot and killed a Minnesotan in broad daylight,\" Ellison said in a statement. \"Now, instead of seriously investigating the killing of Renee Good, Trump is weaponizing the justice system against any leader who dares stand up to him.\"   During a White House press briefing Tuesday, President Trump discussed ICE tactics and Good's shooting.    \"They're going to make mistakes. Sometimes ICE is going to be too rough with somebody, or, you know, they're dealing with rough people,\" Trump said. \"Are they going to make a mistake sometimes? It can happen. I feel terribly. I felt horribly when I was told that the young woman who was, who had the tragedy. It's a tragedy. It's a horrible thing.\"   \n   Ellison said the DOJ is asking for records and documents related to his office's work regarding federal immigration enforcement. He pointed out that this action comes shortly after his office sued the Trump administration over ICE's tactics in the region.   \"Let's be clear about why this is happening: Donald Trump is coming after the people of Minnesota and I'm standing in his way,\" Ellison said. \"I will not be intimidated, and I will not stop working to protect Minnesotans from Trump's campaign of retaliation and revenge.\"   NPR has reached out to the White House for comment on the DOJ subpoenas, but has not yet received a response\n",

    "body": "\n      With troops standing by for Minnesota and an escalating campaign for Greenland, NPR's Michel Martin asks former Trump official Miles Taylor if this is a presidency without guardrails.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  President Trump's aggressive moves on Greenland and immigration, among other things, has even some of his supporters questioning his priorities and tactics. So we've called someone who got a close-up view of President Trump in his first term to ask whether something has changed. Miles Taylor was chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security. He wrote anonymously about resisting some of Trump's impulses from the inside. That's before he revealed himself and backed Joe Biden for president.He has since become a target. President Trump yanked his security clearance and told DHS to investigate him. He now leads a nonprofit called DEFIANCE.org that helps people push back against the administration. He's with us now. Good morning, Miles. Thanks much for joining us.MILES TAYLOR: Good morning, Michel. How are you?MARTIN: Good. So let me start with Greenland. Trump did talk about this in his first term. But during your time in the administration, was this seen as a serious discussion? I guess what I'm wondering is, is there something different now?TAYLOR: Well, here's the thing. I mean, Donald Trump always says controversial things. And then aides come out and say that he's joking, but they're not usually jokes. These are trial balloons. And if there's too much blowback, he'll wait until a period where he can move something forward. And if there's not, he'll move forward on the controversial idea anyway and people will see it's not a joke. Greenland was one of those things.When we first heard about it, I will tell you, 2017 was the first time I heard President Trump say he wanted Greenland. And he proposed swapping it for Puerto Rico because he didn't like spending hurricane recovery money there and he wanted to get rid of Puerto Rico. And we said, Mr. President, there are 3.5 million Americans who live in Puerto Rico. And he dismissed the idea until 2018, when he brought it up again. That's when, Michel, I was worried this was one of those things, that if he didn't have sensible people around him, he would try to do in a second term. He was hell-bent on getting the island.MARTIN: Then to another point, the immigration move. Now, the president has always taken a hard line against immigration. I mean, that's been clear. But a U.S. official told NPR the president has put active-duty troops on standby for a possible deployment to Minneapolis. And he's threatened to use the Insurrection Act to put down protests there. And, you know, obviously, sort of there are some issues being mixed there. But this big surge of agents into these mainly Democratic-led cities to kind of support these immigration moves, even some of his supporters have questioned this. Is there something different about this?TAYLOR: Well, look, I will go back to the joke schema. I mean, in, you know, the past 10 years, Donald Trump has joked about locking up his political opponents. He has joked about deploying troops to U.S. cities. He joked about not conceding the election in 2020. And we learned the hard way that these things weren't jokes. And any time he was talked down off the ledge, it was because of sensible folks around him who tried to keep him from going that direction.Another thing he pushed for in the first term was invocation of the Insurrection Act. I remember, on the eve of the State of the Union in 2019, I got tipped off by aides at the White House that the president was thinking about slipping language into his speech to invoke that act. Of course, this was disturbing because we didn't think any circumstances in the United States justified that there was an invasion or a rebellion. So we rushed to the White House, met the president in the map room where he was practicing the speech and convinced him to drop those lines out of the speech.But again, keep in mind, this is something he has wanted to do since the first term. He saw the Insurrection Act - this is his words - as his, quote, \"magical authorities.\" He saw it as the apex of his power. And he has been looking for an excuse to implement it. The only difference is, in the second term, he's brought on people who are willing to carry out those orders.MARTIN: So your - in your view, the president hasn't changed. It's the people around him that have changed. And they are unwilling or uninterested in tempering some of these impulses.TAYLOR: You know, Susie Wiles said something revealing a month ago about the president's mindset. She said that he had an alcoholic's personality. But Donald Trump, of course, is a teetotaler. He doesn't drink. What I would say, and I don't mean this facetiously, the man is drunk on power. He is addicted to, he is deeply attracted to, demonstrations of power. And you can imagine that the greatest demonstration of his power domestically would be to send American troops into cities to enforce his edicts.It is something he has, again, talked about for nearly 10 years. And he sees the opportunity to do it with limited to no pushback inside of his administration. The question will be, will the Article III courts do something about it? And I strongly suspect that this will be challenged, if he does it, almost immediately by the state of Minnesota, if not other states.MARTIN: Let me ask you about something else. And this is a difficult thing to talk about because when you're ever talking about people's personal behavior, you know, this always raises questions of, you know, whose standards are we applying here? Who says or who cares? But the president's use of profanity.I mean, he went to this auto plant the other day. He made this obscene gesture at a heckler who yelled something at him that he didn't like and was - seemed to have been heard to utter an epithet. You know, again, his staff continues to defend this, but it does seem that he is more unfiltered. We heard him uttering expletives in public comments much more frequently than I think we did in the first term. And I just wonder if you have noticed that yourself and what you make of it.TAYLOR: Look, I'm not a doctor. But I think, observing this man from afar, you can conclude he is unwell. He is irascible. He is angry. He is quick to impulsive remarks and judgments, not that this was incredibly different from the first term. But it's, you know, a Donald Trump more unhinged than I think people saw in the first administration. And, you know, you're seeing that, as if there was any filter before, now it seems to be gone.MARTIN: Well, again, I'm not a doctor either. Neither are you. You certainly haven't examined him in any professional capacity here. But I guess it makes me wonder whether, did he use that kind of language in private before in the first term? We just are now being exposed to it publicly because perhaps he just feels more comfortable in doing so? I mean, we know that - we know, like, from the Nixon tapes that, you know, people sometimes talk that way in private. And they forget, perhaps, that other people are listening.TAYLOR: Yeah. I mean, I think...MARTIN: But I'm just wondering if you - if it's as you said before, which is that this is the behavior that was the before behavior, and now we're just seeing more of it. Or has something substantively changed?TAYLOR: Well, I'll give you two direct examples on that, Michel, is, you know, when he said s-hole countries in the first term, that was something he continued to repeat in private, even after aides denied that the president had called third world countries s-hole countries. He continued to say that in meetings. Or a second example would be Somalis. He called the Somali people, Somali Americans, garbage in private. He referred to them derisively. I don't know what the president's biases are towards people from Somalia. But these are things he said in the first term in private in the Oval Office. And in a second term, he's now said those things publicly and almost proudly. And that says to me that he's let that filter drop.MARTIN: That's Miles Taylor. He's former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security. He now runs a group called DEFIANCE.org. Thanks so much for joining us.TAYLOR: Thanks, Michel.MARTIN: We reached out to the White House for comment on Miles Taylor. As you might imagine, they replied by insulting both his work and him personally. Their statement ended with, quote, \"no one should believe anything he says,\" unquote.(SOUNDBITE OF THIS TOWN NEEDS GUNS' \"ELK\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      President Trump held court with reporters for more than 90 minutes marking the first year anniversary of his second term.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  Today marks the one-year anniversary of President Trump's return to office. He marked the occasion by making a surprise appearance at the White House press briefing. Trump spoke for 80 minutes before taking a question. And for a president who knows how to make news, he made surprisingly little even with a room full of reporters.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Wow, that's a big crowd.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: It's a lot of people. I think it's, like, a record.DETROW: This all occurred just before Trump heads to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where Europeans are frantically trying to head off conflict over Trump's insistence that the U.S. takes over Greenland from Denmark. NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith is here to break it down. Hey, Tam.TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hi, Scott.DETROW: A lot of words from President Trump today. What should we take from it?KEITH: President Trump came into the room carrying a large document titled 365 Wins In 365 Days. But what he delivered was not a concise recitation of wins. Instead, it was a low-energy and very long monologue where he complained that his message just isn't getting through to people.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Maybe I have the bad public relations people, but we're not getting it across.KEITH: In fact, he said that's why he was doing this press conference. Like so many presidents before him, he thinks that he is his own best messenger.DETROW: And like so many presidents before, I mean, seems frustrated with how the message is getting out. So I'm curious, do you think this message got through today?KEITH: Yeah, he certainly held the cable airwaves for a long time, nearly two hours. But he said so much about so many things, repeating the same jokes and falsehoods that he comes back to again and again, that it would be hard to pick out what his precise point was. For quite a while, he was up there just holding pieces of paper with pictures of criminals he says have been arrested in the immigration raids in Minnesota. At one point, he even had an extended back and forth with himself about the ferocity of a binder clip.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: And this is something - oh, I'm glad my finger wasn't in that sucker. That could have done some damage, but you know what? I wouldn't have shown the pain.KEITH: It was just Trump unfiltered.DETROW: I mean, this comes at a time where there's a lot of major issues that Trump is facing. He took questions for 25 minutes. Did he get pressed on any of these issues, like Greenland or tariffs?KEITH: He did. And as he often does, he left his options open. His answers on questions about NATO, Iran, Panama and Greenland were all a little, like, trying to pin down Jell-O. Here's what he said when he was asked about how far he would go to get Greenland.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: I think that we will work something out where NATO is going to be very happy and where we're going to be very happy. But we need it for security purposes. We need it for national security and even world security.KEITH: You know, in the middle of the night last night, Trump was on a social media tear where, among other things, he boosted the idea that NATO is the real problem, not Russia and China. He didn't bring any of that same inflammatory language or energy to the briefing room. And when asked about his relationship with European leaders Emmanuel Macron of France and Keir Starmer of the U.K., both of whom were quite pointed in their criticism of him, Trump said they are friends.DETROW: Tam, Trump talks to the press a lot. What was different about today?KEITH: You know, in the second Trump era, the briefing room is now packed not just with mainstream journalists from the nation's largest news organizations, but also with influencers who make no secret of how much they love the president. At one point, he was asked if God would be happy with his first year in office. He said, yes, he thinks, quote, \"God is very proud of the job I've done.\" So this press conference definitely covered it all.DETROW: NPR's Tamara Keith, thanks so much.KEITH: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

    "body": "\n         Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer says her swing state is preparing for Trump administration efforts to disrupt voting in 2026 and 2028.   In an NPR interview, Whitmer did not accuse the administration of specific plans to interfere. But, she said, \"it would be a mistake to assume that they're not going to\" and said Democrats are preparing through \"tabletop\" exercises.   The governor sat down with me for the video interview on Thursday during her visit to the Detroit Auto Show, pulling up a chair next to a red Cadillac Escalade. The show is at Huntington Place, the same convention center that was a ballot-counting site in 2020, when pro-Trump protesters banged on windows and tried to stop the count.   \n   Whitmer is beginning her eighth and final year as governor. She is term limited and not currently a candidate for anything, though she is often mentioned as a presidential or vice presidential contender. She has made no public moves toward running in 2028, though as the vice chair of the Democratic Governors Association, she says she is focused on electing other Democrats.   You can watch the full video interview. Below are highlights:   Democratic governors are preparing for further election disruptions    Asked whether she assumed that pro-Trump forces would attempt to interfere with ballot counting, Whitmer said, \"It would be a mistake to assume that they're not going to. So I don't know precisely what it is that they might come up with. But we've got smart, sophisticated, savvy people around the tabletop that we will continue to get prepared.\"   Asked about fears that Trump's immigration crackdown — deploying thousands of federal personnel into American cities — would become a tool for controlling elections, Whitmer said, \"I don't think it's paranoia to have that concern.\"   She said Democratic governors are discussing how to respond and are performing \"tabletop\" exercises, though she gave few specifics. \"There are important reasons that I'm not going to go into a whole lot more detail,\" Whitmer said.   \n   She says Trump's tariffs have \"taken a terrible toll\"   Whitmer used that alliterative phrase during a speech at the Detroit Auto Show. She said U.S. auto manufacturing depended on parts and materials sourced from around the world, especially Canada. U.S. automakers have said tariffs cost them billions of dollars in 2025.   The United Auto Workers union has spoken favorably of tariffs, expressing hope that they would return manufacturing jobs to the United States. Whitmer conceded that \"some of the leadership says they like tariffs,\" but \"we are seeing a contraction of U.S. manufacturing. That's job losses. And ultimately, their rank-and-file members have got to be able to afford to take care of their families.\" Asked how she might persuade union leaders, she said, \"I'm not working to persuade them to change their mind. I'm doing what I know to be the right thing to do for the Michigan economy, for the United States economy.\"   She is trying to understand Democrats' loss of support among men in 2024   Her state of the state speech in 2025 warned of \"a generation of men falling behind their fathers and their grandfathers.\"   Asked to explain her thinking, she said, \"When we look at the efforts that we undertook to make college or skill sets more affordable, women were signing up 2-to-1,\" compared with men. She added, \"When we announced opportunities that bring down the cost of a first home payment, women were signing up 2-to-1 for men. We were not reaching men.\"   Asked about analysts who argue that many men are demoralized or disconnected, she said, \"I'm listening to all, probably a lot, of the same podcasts that you are to understand what can we do. How do we bridge this gap? It is real. And I think that's the first step.\"   She says America is ready to elect a woman president   Last year, former first lady Michelle Obama said to voters at a public event, \"You are not ready\" to elect a woman, judging by the 2024 election results.   \n   \"I love Michelle Obama,\" Whitmer said. \"So the last thing I want to do is disagree with her. But, you know, I think America is ready for a woman president.\" She said Kamala Harris' defeat in 2024 was not \"just gender\" but a variety of factors. \"We have not had a woman president yet. I think we will at some point in the near future,\" Whitmer said.\n",

Russia, Belarus, Slovenia, Thailand and the European Union's executive arm also were among the latest to receive invitations.   It's unclear how many leaders have been asked to join the board, and the large number of invitations being sent out, including to countries that don't get along, has raised questions about the board's mandate and decision-making processes. Also unknown is Israel's potential role on a board in charge of implementing the ceasefire agreement that directly involves them.   \n   A Trump reference in the invitation letters saying that the body would \"embark on a bold new approach to resolving global conflict\" suggested it could act as a rival to the U.N. Security Council, the most powerful body of the global organization created in the wake of World War II.   France, though, does not plan to join the Board of Peace \"at this stage\" despite receiving an invitation, a French official close to President Emmanuel Macron said Monday. The issue is raising questions, particularly with regard to respect for the principles and structure of the United Nations, said the official, speaking anonymously in line with the French presidency's customary practices.   Told late Monday that Macron was unlikely to join, Trump said, \"Well, nobody wants him because he's going to be out of office very soon.\"   \"I'll put a 200% tariff on his wines and champagnes and he'll join,\" Trump told reporters in Florida before a flight back to Washington. \"But he doesn't have to join.\"   Morocco's King Mohammed VI accepted a spot Monday, becoming the first Arab leader and at least the fifth world leader to join. Vietnam, Kazakhstan, Hungary and Argentina also have signed on.   Russian President Vladimir Putin received the invitation, and the Kremlin is now \"studying the details\" and will seek clarity of \"all the nuances\" in contacts with the U.S., said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Trump confirmed Monday night that Putin had been invited.   \n   Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko is ready to take part, according to the country's Foreign Ministry. The Thai Foreign Ministry said it was invited and reviewing the details.   European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill said that Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the commission, would be speaking to other EU leaders about Gaza. Gill didn't say whether its invitation had been accepted, but that the commission wants \"to contribute to a comprehensive plan to end the Gaza conflict.\"   Israel's objections to the board   Israeli far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich on Monday dismissed the Board of Peace as a raw deal for Israel and called for its dissolution.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Donald Trump speaks to reporters before boarding Air Force One at Palm Beach International Airport, Monday, Jan. 19, 2026, in West Palm Beach, Fla.\n                \n                    Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n    \n\n   \n   \"It is time to explain to the president that his plan is bad for the State of Israel and to cancel it,\" Smotrich said. \"Gaza is ours, its future will affect our future more than anyone else's. We will take responsibility for what happens there, impose military administration, and complete the mission.\"   Smotrich, a hard-liner who opposed the Gaza ceasefire, even suggested that Israel renew a full-scale offensive on the territory to destroy Hamas if it doesn't abide by a \"short ultimatum for real disarmament and exile.\"   Netanyahu said later on Monday that while there are differences with the U.S. about the composition of the advisory committee accompanying the next phase in Gaza, it would not harm his relationship with Trump.   \"There will not be Turkish soldiers and Qatari soldiers in the (Gaza) Strip,\" he said.   Netanyahu's office earlier said the formation of an executive board that will work to carry out the vision of the Board of Peace wasn't coordinated with the Israeli government and \"is contrary to its policy\" without clarifying its objections. Turkey, a key regional rival, is among those invited to join the committee.   The final list   The U.S. is expected to announce its official list of members in the coming days, likely during the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland.   \n   Board members will oversee an executive committee that will be in charge of implementing the tough second phase of the Gaza peace plan that includes the deployment of an international security force, disarmament of Hamas and reconstruction of the war-devastated territory.   A $1 billion contribution secures permanent membership on the board, with the money going to rebuild Gaza, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity about the charter as he wasn't permitted to speak publicly about details of the board, which hasn't been made public. A three-year appointment has no contribution requirement.   According to the World Bank's Gaza and West Bank Interim Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (IRDNA) report released last year, it'll take $53 billion to rebuild the strip.   British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Monday the United Kingdom is talking to allies about the Board of Peace.   Running Gaza   Egypt's top diplomat on Monday met with the leader of the newly appointed committee of Palestinian technocrats who will be running Gaza's day-to-day affairs during the second phase.   Foreign Minister Bader Abdelatty met with Ali Shaath, a Palestinian engineer and former official with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, who was named last week as chief commissioner of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza.   Abdelatty expressed the Egyptian government's \"complete support\" of the committee and affirmed its role in running Gaza's daily affairs until the Palestinian Authority takes over the territory, said a statement from the Egyptian ministry.   Gaza humanitarian situation still fragile   The U.N. World Food Program on Monday said it has \"significantly expanded\" its operations across Gaza 100 days into the ceasefire, reaching more than a million people each month with hot meals and food parcels. But it warned the situation remains \"extremely fragile.\"   It noted that malnutrition has been prevented for 200,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women, as well as children under 5.   \n   Still, the most recent Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis in December indicated that 77% the population is facing crisis-level food insecurity.   Israeli forces move into Hebron   Israeli military and security forces launched what they called a large-scale counterterrorism operation in the West Bank city of Hebron to dismantle \"terrorist infrastructure, eliminating illegal weapons possession and strengthening security.\"   The Israeli military said Monday the operation is expected to continue for several days. Israeli armored vehicles and soldiers patrolled city streets and put up barriers where operations were being conducted.   Hebron Mayor Khaled Dudin said Israeli forces targeted the area that's home to 80,000 people because it obstructs the construction of additional Israeli settlements.   Three Palestinians killed   Israeli forces on Monday killed three Palestinians, including a teenager, in southern Gaza, hospital authorities said.   Two men crossed into Israeli-controlled areas east of Khan Younis before being shot dead, while 17-year-old Hussein Tawfiq Abu Sabalah was shot and killed in the Muwasi area of Rafah, according to the Nasser hospital. It wasn't immediately clear whether the teen had crossed into or came close to the Israeli-controlled area.   More than 460 people were killed by Israeli fire and their bodies brought to hospitals since the ceasefire went into effect just over three months ago, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.   The ministry, which is part of the Hamas-led government, maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts.\n",

But I won't do that,\" he said during his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.   \"That's probably the biggest statement I made because people thought I would use force, but I don't have to use force, I don't want to use force. I won't use force,\" he said.   Trump said U.S. ownership of Greenland is necessary for national security and that \"who the hell wants to defend a license agreement or release, which is a large piece of ice in the middle of the ocean.\"   \n   \"So we want a piece of ice for world protection, and they won't give it. We've never asked for anything else, and we could have kept that piece of land, and we didn't. So they have a choice. You can say yes and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no and we will remember,\" Trump said.   Trump's push to acquire Greenland has turned to antagonism toward allies in recent days   Just two weeks ago, President Trump posted on social media that he'd address affordability when he spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos.   But his belligerent foreign policy is once again overshadowing his attempts at a cohesive economic message. Trump's aggressive push to acquire Greenland has turned to open antagonism toward allies in recent days, becoming a central focus of this year's forum.    Just days before the forum began, Trump on social media threatened to tariff goods from eight European nations and NATO members until they support a U.S. deal to purchase Greenland.   Those countries responded with a statement saying that they stand in solidarity with Denmark and Greenland, which is an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark.   Over the weekend, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr also revealed a text conversation in which Trump said that not receiving the Nobel Peace Prize – which the Norwegian government does not confer – is influencing his decision to pursue Greenland.   \n   It also became clear in recent days that other world leaders were seeking to dissuade Trump from attempting to take over Greenland, when Trump Monday night posted screenshots of text messages from NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and French President Emmanuel Macron.   Rutte began his message with flattery, praising Trump's recent strikes in Syria. Rutte added, \"I am committed to finding a way forward on Greenland.\"   Macron, for his part, was harsher: \"I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland,\" he wrote, but added that he wanted to get dinner after Davos.   And Trump on Tuesday reposted a social media message that cast the U.N. and NATO as the \"real threat\" to the U.S., as opposed to China and Russia.   All of this buildup has brought American foreign policy to center stage at Davos. When Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent took the stage with Fox Business's Maria Bartiromo yesterday, her first question was about Greenland: \"How do you justify taking over a country when in fact Denmark and Greenland have said they're not interested?\"   \"Greenland's becoming more and more attractive for foreign conquest, and he very strongly believes that it must be part of the US to prevent a conflict,\" Bessent said as part of his answer.   Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday delivered a forceful speech that, without mentioning Trump explicitly, argued that his policies are leading to the breakdown of the international order.   \"Let me be direct: We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition,\" Carney said. \"Great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons, tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited.\"   \"We stand firmly with Greenland and Denmark and fully support their unique right to determine Greenland's future. Our commitment to NATO's Article 5 is unwavering,\" he later added. \"Canada strongly opposes tariffs over Greenland.\"   \n   But Trump, speaking at length with reporters Tuesday, seemed to step off the gas slightly when it came to his harsh rhetoric. Asked about how his push for Greenland could result in breaking up NATO, Trump seemed to demur.   \"Something's going to happen that's going to be very good for everybody,\" he said.   The foreign policy Trump is bringing to Davos goes beyond Greenland. On Thursday, he will participate in what the White House is calling a Board of Peace Charter Announcement.   The \"Board of Peace\" is being created as part of Trump's 20-point plan to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas and has come under sharp criticism. A copy of the charter obtained by NPR said that countries that want permanent membership will have to pay $1 billion, and that Donald Trump is the permanent chair, even after he's president. The charter also says that the world needs a more effective international peace-building body – which may signal the board is hoping to act as a rival to the U.N.   The board's membership is still unsettled, but Trump said he has asked President Vladimir Putin to take part. Meanwhile, Macron has said he will not join the board.   Trump told reporters this week that his main message in Davos will be \"how well the United States is doing.\" Economic advisor Kevin Hassett has said the president will also be revealing a new housing policy.   \n",

One of President Trump's top lieutenants, Gor had been in charge of selecting staff to serve in Trump's second-term White House. Now he was getting a promotion.   Jeanine Pirro, the former Fox News personality-turned-U.S. attorney, offered praise for Gor's loyalty, then turned to Trump.   \"There is in this room, a group of people who love you, who believe in you, and who are so proud to be in this Oval Office,\" she said.   \n   That lovefest reflects a real change from Trump's first term, with its rival power centers and steady flow of staff shakeups and firings by tweet. One year into this second Trump presidency, high level staff and Cabinet turnover is significantly lower than it was during the same period in 2017. That's according to a new analysis from Brookings Institution visiting fellow Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, shared exclusively with NPR.   In 2017, Trump oversaw turnover in two Cabinet positions and 35% of senior staff posts. This time around, there's been no turnover at the Cabinet level, and senior staff turnover is at 29%. To keep consistency across administrations, for the Cabinet Tenpas only counts officials in the presidential line of succession.   \"For the other six presidents before President Trump, the average [high level staff] turnover in that first year is typically around 10%, so he's much higher than the average, but I will say it is less than his first term by a good margin,\" Tenpas said in an interview with NPR.   \n   Tenpas also documents the nature of the departures. In the first term, there were a lot of people unceremoniously shown the door by a president whose TV tagline was \"you're fired.\" This time, it has mostly been promotions, such as Gor becoming an ambassador.   \"There are far fewer resignations under pressure in this first year, 2025, than there were in 2017,\" said Tenpas.   In 2017, high-profile aides including chief of staff Reince Priebus, chief strategist Steve Bannon, White House press secretary Sean Spicer, communications director Michael Dubke and the famously 11-day-serving White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci all exited, often with an announcement by tweet.   The people leaving their jobs this time around aren't household names, says Tenpas, further dialing down the personnel drama.   \"You know, I would call these positions influential, but they just weren't public figures, they weren't press secretaries. They weren't chiefs of staff,\" she said.   People who served in the first Trump administration say this time is different, with Trump learning from his first presidency that he prefers loyalists. He has surrounded himself with aides who more closely align with him personally and with his political agenda.   \n   Gone are the big names he brought on because people suggested he should. Now, loyalty is the coin of the realm.   \"I do think that … if you look at what is the core of the stability, it was the emphasis that they put on loyalty in hiring, and that has then subsequently paved the way for less infighting and less drama and a lower rate than in 2017,\" said Tenpas.   A large share of the departures so far this term were on the National Security Council staff, including national security adviser Mike Waltz, who became U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He had been responsible for what was known as Signal-gate, the first major scandal of the term, when he inadvertently added a journalist to a group chat where secret plans for airstrikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen were discussed. But he wasn't fired. He was promoted to a position requiring Senate confirmation.   When Waltz left as national security adviser, he was replaced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who added another job to an already long list of assignments from Trump. It was supposed to be temporary, but it's been more than eight months.   The high-level NSC staff departures Tenpas tracked reflect a much larger shedding of staff assigned to the National Security Council.   A White House official not authorized to speak on the record tells NPR there has been a significant reduction in NSC staffing over the past year to create a more top-down foreign policy process.   The official called it a rightsizing — a strategic choice rather than White House intrigue.   This Brookings data does not capture firings and upheaval among career officials in other areas of the Trump administration, such as at the State Department, Justice Department or the Defense Department, all of which have seen significant turnover.\n",

But ICE's budget has skyrocketed during President Trump's second term, becoming the highest-funded U.S. law enforcement agency, with $85 billion now at its disposal.   The windfall is thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, enacted last July. After hovering around the $10 billion mark for years, ICE's budget suddenly benefited from a meteoric spike.   \"With this new bill and other appropriations, it's larger than the annual budget of all other federal law enforcement agencies combined,\" said Lauren-Brooke Eisen, senior director of the justice program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan policy institute.   \n   ICE is now the lead agency in President's Trump immigration crackdown, sending thousands of agents into U.S. communities. As its funding and profile has grown as part of those efforts, ICE has come under increasing criticism for its officers' actions, from masked agents randomly stopping, questioning, and detaining people and thrusting them into unmarked vehicles to the recent killing of Renee Macklin Good in Minneapolis.   \n   A cycle of more migrants, more money and a larger ICE mission   ICE's sudden growth spurt follows roughly two decades of relatively modest funding since 2003, when the agency was created by merging the U.S. Customs Service with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. In 2015, for instance, Congress approved a budget of around $5.96 billion, which was nearly $1 billion less than then-President Barack Obama had requested.   \n   In 2019, during the first Trump administration, border control officer's encounters with migrants attempting authorized entry to the U.S. spiked. Those numbers then plummeted as the COVID-19 pandemic prompted invocation of the Title 42 public health law, allowing CBP to expel migrants more quickly, with restricted pathways to asylum.   Encounters rose sharply under former President Joe Biden and soared above 3.2 million in 2023, when Biden lifted Title 42. By late 2024, fewer migrants were arriving at the border, due to U.S. asylum limits and Mexico bolstering enforcement.   When Trump returned to the White House in 2025, he sought to empower immigration authorities to quickly remove migrants and announced a crackdown led by ICE.   \n   Under the 2025 law, ICE has a $75 billion supplement that it can take as long as four years to spend, along with its base budget of around $10 billion. If the agency spends that money at a steady pace and current funding levels continue, it would have nearly $29 billion on hand each year. That essentially triples ICE's total budget from recent years.   To give that large number a sense of scale, consider that the Trump administration's 2026 appropriations request for the entire Justice Department, including the FBI, stands at a little over $35 billion.   \n   The Trump administration has set lofty goals for ICE, aiming to deport 1 million people each year. And the One Big Beautiful Bill Act also allocates $45 billion for ICE to expand its immigration detention system — Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last June that the agency will be able to hold up to 100,000 people in custody daily. By comparison, the federal Bureau of Prisons currently holds over 153,000 inmates.   As of Nov. 30, 65,735 people were held in immigration detention, according to the data tracking project Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.   With those metrics in mind, ICE went on a hiring spree in 2025, fueled by its bigger budget. In just one year, the agency says, it \"more than doubled our officers and agents from 10,000 to 22,000.\" (The Office of Personnel Management, which tracks federal workforce statistics, is only updated through Nov. 30 and does not reflect any hiring made by the DHS in the last quarter of the year.)   According to the DHS, ICE received 220,000 applications in 2025, thanks in part to a generous incentive package with perks like a signing bonus of up to $50,000, disbursed over the course of a five-year commitment, and up to $60,000 in student loan repayment.   ICE is still on that hiring spree, looking to hire deportation officers in at least 25 cities around the U.S., according to a job listing on the USA Jobs website that will remain active through the end of September. The starting salary for an ICE deportation officer in the Enforcement and Removal Operations division, or ERO, ranges from $51,632 up to $84,277.   \n   The dramatic growth came in the same year that the Trump administration sharply reduced the number of federal workers, firing thousands of employees and inviting many more to resign.   What else will the new funds be spent on?    With base level funding for DHS and ICE due to expire at the end of January, Democrats in Congress are calling for changes to how ICE operates. It comes after a year in which deaths of people in ICE custody spiked to the highest levels in decades, with ICE reporting seven deaths in December, and three more in 2026, as of Jan. 16.   ICE's increased budget makes sense to Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the right-wing Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group advocating for lower levels of immigration. He says the funding boost \" is directly commensurate with the size of the task the agency is addressing.\"   \n   \"ICE exists to find and remove people who are in the country illegally,\" Mehlman said, referring to a category that grew when the Trump administration stripped legal status from 1.6 million immigrants in 2025.   The focus of the new spending reflects President Trump's emphasis on arrests and removals, said Margy O'Herron, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center's liberty and national security program who worked at the DOJ in the Biden administration.   O'Herron said she agrees with the idea that, for years, a reasonable case could be made that DHS agencies such as ICE and CBP needed more money. But other parts of the immigration system aren't getting as much help, she said.   \"All of the money is going to enforcement to arrest, to detain and to deport,\" she said. \"It's not going to things like immigration hearings or immigration judges, to conduct additional review of whether or not somebody should be in the country. And that is a real problem for the system.\"\n",

Today's top stories   President Trump plans to focus on affordability today in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. But his foreign policy — specifically, Trump's desire to acquire Greenland — and his threats of tariffs on eight European countries if he doesn't get his way are overshadowing the summit. When the president takes the stage, world leaders will be paying close attention to signs of where this confrontation with allies goes next.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                This photograph, taken on Jan. 20, 2026, shows the logo of the World Economic Forum in the Alpine resort of Davos.

She adds that, for his second term, Trump is pursuing a belligerent foreign policy that alienates allies and lacks domestic popularity. Kurtzleben says these actions, along with his aggressive tactics in Minnesota, are drawing attention away from the domestic economy, which Trump wants to focus on.   The Justice Department has issued grand jury subpoenas to multiple government officials in Minnesota, including Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. The agency is alleging that state officials conspired to impede law enforcement amid the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.    \n   🎧 Minnesota officials suggest the subpoenas do not faze them, says NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán. They say that these actions are an intimidation tactic by the administration that is weaponizing the DOJ. Officials say they pushed back against the administration's immigration crackdown because of what they say are the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency's illegal actions in their state. This includes ICE agents intimidating the people who follow them to alert neighbors to their presence. Day-to-day lives in Minnesota continue to be impacted as dozens of doctors in the state say patients are avoiding the medical care they may need because they fear ICE.   The U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments today regarding Trump's efforts to break with 112 years of law by firing Lisa Cook. Cook is a member of the Federal Reserve's governing board, appointed by former President Joe Biden.    🎧 The president's lawyers are expected to tell the Supreme Court that he is not looking for a free pass to fire Cook, but instead fired her for cause, says NPR's Nina Totenberg. The administration claims she committed mortgage fraud when she obtained loans on two different properties because she listed two homes as her primary residences, but at different times. Cook denies any wrongdoing. The Trump administration argues the court cannot review a president's decision to fire a Fed board member once he determines he has cause. This caveat would essentially grant him unrestricted power to purge the Fed and install personal picks, Totenberg says.   \n   Today's listen   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Boundaries, bodies, and better sex in 2026\n                \n                    Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   What does sexual safety look like these days?

One year in, gasoline prices are down about 20%, but electricity prices are going up. The Trump administration has also invested in nuclear power, which could help reduce costs in the long term. Take a look at how he has delivered on his goals:    ➡️ Presidents don't decide gas prices. The cost of crude oil is the biggest factor. A global oversupply of oil largely drove cheaper crude oil prices this past year.➡️ Electricity prices are increasing due to three primary reasons: an aging power grid, the cost of natural disasters and higher fuel costs, says Charles Hua, who runs the national energy consumer education nonprofit Powerlines.➡️ The administration has ended federal tax credits for large solar and wind projects, which provide more cost-competitive energy than natural gas, nuclear and coal projects.   3 things to know before you go   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A general view of the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 10, 2026.

In April, the White House announced it was withholding some $790 million in federal funds from Northwestern while the government investigated the claims. University interim President Henry Bienen said in a statement to university personnel that \"the payment is not an admission of guilt,\" according to the school newspaper The Daily Northwestern.   Earlier this month, Cornell reached a deal requiring the university to pay $60 million to unfreeze $250 million withheld by the Trump administration over alleged civil rights violations. The private Ivy League university said the settlement did not come \"at the cost of compromising our values or independence.\"   Per the agreement, Northwestern will pay out the $75 million over time through 2028 and \"shall maintain clear policies and procedures relating to demonstrations, protests, displays, and other expressive activities, as well as implement mandatory antisemitism training for all students, faculty, and staff,\" according to the DOJ.   Education Secretary Linda McMahon called the settlement \"a huge win\" for higher education.   \"The deal cements policy changes that 'will protect students and other members of the campus from harassment and discrimination,' and it recommits the school to merit-based hiring and admissions,\" she said in a statement.   \n   \"The reforms reflect bold leadership at Northwestern, and they are a roadmap for institutional leaders around the country that will help rebuild public trust in our colleges and universities,\" she added.   An explainer posted to the university's website said that the school decided to negotiate an agreement rather than take a chance in court, calling the cost of a legal fight \"too high and the risks too grave.\"   Northwestern's Bienen said in a video statement that the school would retain its academic freedom and autonomy from the federal government.   \"There were several red lines that I, the board of Trustees and university leadership refused to cross. I would not have signed anything that would have given the federal government any say in who we hire, what they teach, who we admit or what they study,\" Bienen said.   \"Put simply, Northwestern runs Northwestern.\"\n",

The extended rant came in the wake of the Wednesday shooting of two National Guard members who were deployed to patrol Washington, D.C. under Trump's orders, one of whom died shortly before the president spoke to U.S. troops by video on Thursday evening.   A 29-year-old Afghan national who worked with the CIA during the Afghanistan War is facing charges for the shooting. The suspect emigrated as part of a program to resettle those who has helped American troops after U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.   \n   \"Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation,\" Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. \"Other than that, HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL, except those that hate, steal, murder, and destroy everything that America stands for — You won't be here for long!\"   Trump's threat to stop immigration would be a serious blow to a nation that has long defined itself as welcoming immigrants.   Elected on a promise to crack down on illegal migration, Trump's raids and deportations have disrupted communities across the U.S. as construction sites and schools have been targets. The prospect of more deportations could be economically dangerous as America's foreign-born workers account for nearly 31 million jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.   The president said on Truth Social that \"most\" foreign-born U.S. residents \"are on welfare, from failed nations, or from prisons, mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels\" as he blamed them for crime across the country that is predominantly committed by U.S. citizens.   The perception that immigration breeds crime \"continues to falter under the weight of the evidence,\" according to a review of academic literature last year in the Annual Review of Criminology.   \"With few exceptions, studies conducted at both the aggregate and individual levels demonstrate that high concentrations of immigrants are not associated with increased levels of crime and delinquency across neighborhoods and cities in the United States,\" it said.   \n   A study by economists initially released in 2023 found immigrants are 60% less likely to be incarcerated than people born in the U.S. Immigrants have been imprisoned at lower rates for 150 years, the study found, adding to past research undermining Trump's claims.   But Trump seemed to have little interest in a policy debate in his unusually lengthy social media post, which the White House, on its own rapid response social media account, called \"one of the most important messages ever released by President Trump.\"   Trump claimed immigrants from Somalia are \"completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota\" as he used a dated slur for intellectually disabled people to demean that state's governor, Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee last year, calling him \"seriously retarded.\"   Trump has ramped up his rhetoric since the shooting. On Wednesday night, Trump called for the reinvestigation of all Afghan refugees who had entered under the Biden administration.   \n   On Thursday, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, said the agency would take additional steps to screen people from 19 \"high-risk\" countries \"to the maximum degree possible.\"   Edlow didn't name the countries. But in June, the administration banned travel to the U.S. by citizens of 12 countries and restricted access from seven others, citing national security concerns.\n",

Here is what we know.   D.C. police heighten security measures for troops   Federal authorities and the Metropolitan Police Department confirmed Saturday that every group of National Guards patrolling the city will be accompanied by at least one D.C. police officer, though details were scant. (The development was first reported by The Washington Post.)   \n   According to a police official who spoke to NPR on condition of anonymity, because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, the officers are to draw overtime pay so that they won't be diverted from current policing assignments.   The order does not apply to areas which the police department does not patrol, such as the national monuments, the U.S. Capitol, or D.C. transit locations, which are policed by other law enforcement agencies.      National Guard member Sarah Beckstrom remembered   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Community members prepare a portrait of West Virginia National Guard Specialist Sarah Beckstrom for a vigil in her honor at the town hall on Friday in Webster Springs, W.Va.\n                \n                    Jeff Swensen/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jeff Swensen/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Sarah Beckstrom, 20, of Summersville, W.Va., joined the service in 2023. Beckstrom's father, Gary, called her his \"baby girl\" and said she had \"passed to glory\" in a Facebook post on Thursday.   West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey on Friday called for residents to hold a moment of silence for the two victims of the shooting, as both were deployed as part of that state's National Guard.   Morrisey said in a statement Friday that Beckstrom had made the \"ultimate sacrifice\" in service to her state and the nation. He added that both Beckstrom and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, had stepped forward and volunteered for the mission in D.C.   Morrisey also said that Wolfe remains in \"very critical condition.\"   \n   \"These two West Virginia heroes were serving our country and protecting our nation's capital when they were maliciously attacked,\" Morrisey said. \"Their courage and commitment to duty represent the very best of our state.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A small memorial of flowers and an American flag has been set up outside the Farragut West Metro station in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Andrew Leyden/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Leyden/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The suspect is now facing a charge of first-degree murder   Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national who allegedly shot the National Guard members, is now facing a first-degree murder charge.   U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro said during an interview with Fox News on Friday that the charges against Lakanwal have been upgraded to first-degree murder and that there are \"many more charges to come.\"   \n   Lakanwal, who was 5 years old when the war in Afghanistan started, immigrated to the U.S. in 2021 when U.S. troops withdrew from Afghanistan and the Taliban toppled its government. Lakanwal worked with an elite counterterrorism unit, which was operated by the CIA, according to AfghanEvac, a nonprofit run by U.S. veterans and others who served in Afghanistan. The organization has said specialized units like this one were used to carry out extremely violent clandestine missions.   According to CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Lakanwal was able to resettle in the U.S. with his family because of the work he did on behalf of American intelligence.   Officials are looking for leads in the U.S. and abroad as there is yet no definitive motive for the shooting.   The Trump administration is pausing all asylum decisions   The administration is dramatically tightening its controversial immigration policies.   \n   President Trump posted on Truth Social that he will \"permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover.\"   U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Director Joseph Edlow also posted on X, that the agency has \"halted all asylum decisions until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.   \"The safety of the American people always comes first,\" Edlow wrote.

Twenty-year-old Sarah Beckstrom has died. Twenty-four-year-old Andrew Wolfe is in critical condition. The suspect in custody is an Afghan national who entered the U.S. through Operation Allies Welcome. In 2021, his application for asylum was approved under the Trump administration. President Trump has called for several measures, like a permanent pause on migration from, quote, \"all third world countries\" and denaturalizing those who, quote, \"undermine domestic tranquility.\" NPR's Ron Elving joins us. Ron, thanks for being with us.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.SIMON: Those would be sweeping changes. Can the president really do that?ELVING: The president can say what he wants to say. He can make everyone respond to whatever he's proposing. He can steer the conversation and, to some degree, control the agenda. He can also issue, as we know, his executive orders and make elements of the executive branch do things. But the scale of these threats and the use of terms, such as permanent pause or third world countries or disturbing domestic tranquility - let's just say there would be a lot to work out in the enforcement. And that's assuming any such effort survived in federal courts.Now, Trump did attempt something like this with his so-called Muslim ban early in his first term. That caused great confusion and disruption and court resistance until, finally, a third revision got the blessing of the Supreme Court on a 5-4 vote.SIMON: How popular are President Trump's immigration policies with Americans right now?ELVING: They have been popular. Immigration has been his best issue with voters this year, but his approval numbers on immigration have fallen lately, along with his polls in general. There's been less attention paid to the southern border in the media and lots of negative notice given to ICE raids and deportations.Now this tragic National Guard story could turn things around again, like in 2015. You may remember it was exactly 10 years ago this time of year that Trump, then just a candidate for the Republican nomination, proposed a ban on all Muslims entering the U.S. That, too, is in response to a shocking gun crime that was attributed to immigrants. And lo and behold, that posting on Twitter boosted Trump back to the lead in major polls of Republicans who were seeking the White House in that cycle. It's possible Trump has not forgotten how all that played out for him back then.SIMON: Another critical question of the week, what is the status of that 28-point plan the U.S. presented to Ukraine with a Thanksgiving deadline?ELVING: The plan was close to a set of proposals from a Russian diplomat named Dmitriev. What that plan gave Russia was parts of eastern Ukraine that the Russian army has occupied but also other parts that they have not. Now, that's a big deal. It's largely what the war has been about. So Ukraine has parried that thrust for now, and the question is whether the Russians can live with something less.Putin made it clear on Friday that he expects to gain a lot of territory in this deal, and he scoffed at suggestions that Trump's negotiator, Steve Witkoff, had been coaching the Russians or helping them deal with Trump. And, of course, not helping this process is that Andrii Yermak, a top negotiator and one of the most powerful men in Ukraine, resigned yesterday in the wake of a major corruption scandal.SIMON: Ron, what are you watching for in Congress between now and the holidays?ELVING: The biggest thing right now is health care - what to do about expiring subsidies for health insurance under Obamacare that are going to cause enormous spikes in what people have to pay and cost some people their insurance. That was the issue in the shutdown this fall, and it has not been resolved. Last week, Trump said those subsidies might just have to be extended for a time, maybe just long enough to get past the 2026 midterm elections. That would be politically expedient. But many House Republicans are digging in their heels - do not want to be seen as bailing out Obamacare, even if temporarily. And without a resolution on this issue, we may well be right back in government shutdown early next year.SIMON: Ron Elving, thanks so much.ELVING: Thank you, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "\n      Maryland is one of the most heavily leaning Democratic states in the nation and it's one of the few that could redistrict to help their party win Congress by countering Republicans. However, so far, the idea hasn't been well-receive.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  As President Trump pushes Republican-led states to redraw their district maps for next year's congressional elections, Democrats are looking at where they might counter with their own redistricting. In Maryland, the Democratic governor has created a commission to consider redistricting and making recommendations, but only one of the state's eight House members is a Republican. WYPR's Sarah Petrowich reports there are people in both parties who don't want to go after that seat.SARAH PETROWICH, BYLINE: With a Democratic governor and party control in both chambers of the state Legislature, Maryland is one of the bluest states in the country, and it's one of just a handful of blue states that could redistrict before the midterms. Governor Wes Moore created a commission on the idea, and it's drawn big online crowds. There were the expected objections from Republicans. One was Barbara Lafferty (ph), from the district with the state's only Republican U.S. House member.BARBARA LAFFERTY: If you take away that one congressional seat, for me, I have no voice.PETROWICH: Democrats lined up to support redistricting, arguing it's a way to push back against the Trump administration. But even some Democrats have doubts. Barbara Osborn Kreamer, a former legislator, said she hopes to just vote out the Republican, Representative Andy Harris, without a new map.BARBARA OSBORN KREAMER: Personally, it's an outrage to be represented by Andy Harris at this time, but we are working very hard in Hartford County to increase our base of volunteers, increase our activism.PETROWICH: In all, Maryland's House delegation has seven Democrats and one Republican. Lawmakers actually drew an 8-0 map a few years ago, but it was blocked by the courts. Then they quickly drew the current map without much public input. Governor Moore says he wants to hear from the public now, though he hasn't explicitly called for redistricting. But another leading Democrat, Senate president Bill Ferguson, said in an interview with WYPR in Baltimore, that a new map could die in the court again, and the current one is good enough.BILL FERGUSON: We are sending, from my perspective, seven Democrats to Washington to fight on behalf of Marylanders, and I think that's an important feature of where we are.PETROWICH: In an interview, the Republican Congressman Andy Harris said he opposes mid-decade redistricting and warns that if Democrats overreach, they could end up losing ground.ANDY HARRIS: Not only could a new map be thrown out now, but the current map could be adjudicated by the court as one that is unduly partisan and force it to be redrawn to have two or three Republicans in Congress from Maryland.PETROWICH: Across the country, it's unclear which party will win the redistricting battle, especially as court challenges are pending. Texas Republicans were quick to answer Trump's call for redistricting, and California Democrats were quick to counter it. But some other states have been more hesitant, like Maryland. John Willis teaches public policy at the University of Baltimore and is a former Democratic secretary of state in Maryland. He says it makes sense for Democrats here to keep their options open as a deterrent to Republicans elsewhere.JOHN WILLIS: Why not be part of the conversation and tell the other states on the other side that if you're going to go to extreme lengths, you know, maybe we will, too. That's - it's an OK thing to say.PETROWICH: But he noted that trying to redraw one district could make the others more competitive.WILLIS: There are often unintended consequences. The public may, in fact, you know, vote differently than you think they will.PETROWICH: The governor's Redistricting Advisory Commission has at least one more meeting on the calendar. Moore could call on lawmakers to consider redistricting before the end of the year or when they meet as scheduled in January.For NPR News, in Baltimore, I'm Sarah Petrowich.(SOUNDBITE OF PAVEL DOVGAL'S \"NIBIRU\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

But it would challenge the governor-elect's bipartisan image and anger Republicans.   \n\n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  In most states, the state legislature controls the congressional district map, and in the redistricting scramble that President Trump set off ahead of next year's midterms, Republicans control more state Houses than Democrats. Virginia is one place Democrats could make changes that benefit their party, even though it is not as heavily Democratic as some other states. Jahd Khalil at member station VPM in Richmond reports that Virginia Democrats say they are ready to go for it.JAHD KHALIL, BYLINE: If Virginia Democrats want to redraw the state's congressional districts, it takes a few steps, and they took one this month. They gave initial approval for an amendment to the state constitution. It would sideline the state's bipartisan redistricting commission and allow new maps to counter the redistricting in Republican states. It passed with a slim majority.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Ayes 21, nos 16. The resolution is agreed to.KHALIL: Just a few days later, Democratic lawmakers won big in elections. It was fueled by anti-Trump sentiment in a state where thousands of federal workers have been fired. Democratic State Senator Mamie Locke, who was once on the commission in question, said voters showed they want to counter Trump's redistricting push.MAMIE LOCKE: What we were doing was not something that they saw as a negative, you know, that Democrats are on the right track in terms of where we are in our politics, and that this is not a bad thing.KHALIL: The legislature still needs to approve the proposed amendment again. Then voters would decide on it in a special election. Senator Ryan McDougle is a Republican and also sat on that redistricting commission. He opposes changing the map now, whatever the recent election showed.RYAN MCDOUGLE: The maps should not be rigged so one party always gets the result that they want. Virginians said, we want to take the politics out of this and put in a bipartisan redistricting. And that's what we did. That's what we should continue with.KHALIL: But the election also made the redistricting possible because Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat, will replace Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin. Spanberger hasn't gone as far to say she would sign off on new maps yet. She's talked about keeping all options open, and her spokesperson, Connor Joseph, told NPR Spanberger thinks the legislature should be ready to respond to what Trump's been doing. He got Republican lawmakers in Texas, North Carolina and Missouri to redistrict, possibly picking up several House seats. California Democrats countered most of those with their own new map. But Spanberger often talks about working across party lines, an ideal praised as part of the state's political culture.ERNEST MCGOWEN: Is not necessarily bare knuckles like you would see in California, like you would see in Texas. And so that kind of sense of how Virginia state politics works goes against these kind of national trends.KHALIL: Ernest McGowen is a political science professor at the University of Richmond. But he says that because of Virginia's federal workforce, voters see Trump as a danger.MCGOWEN: Virginia was also hit very very very hard by DOGE and by the government shut down. And so there really is no love for President Trump.KHALIL: It's uncertain which party is ahead in redistricting. There are court challenges, and states are deciding whether to get in or out. Virginia Democrats could get an edge in two or three House seats if they redistrict. Since Republicans hold a few seat majority in the House, any one of those could make all the difference.For NPR News, I'm Jahd Khalil in Richmond.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

New polling suggests that's a risky bet.   \n\n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  In Texas, a Republican effort to redraw the state's congressional map to benefit their party makes an assumption about Latino voters. It bets that Latino Texas voters will vote Republican with the same enthusiasm they did in last year's presidential election, when exit polling showed more than half went for Donald Trump. But recent polling suggests that might now be a riskier bet. To understand why, I'm joined now by someone who tracks Latino voters closely. Clarissa Martinez de Castro is vice president of the Latino Vote Initiative with UnidosUS.So earlier this week, Clarissa, the Pew Research Center released a poll showing that 70% of Latinos disapprove of President Trump's performance in office. And your organization, of course, does its own polling. Are you seeing a similar trend?CLARISSA MARTINEZ DE CASTRO: Indeed. We did a bipartisan poll of Hispanic voters at the 100-day mark of the new administration and one year out from the 2026 election, so just earlier this month. And certainly, I believe that Hispanic voters are screaming at the top of their lungs that what Congress and the president need to do is raise wages and lower prices. And two-thirds of them, nationally and in Texas, believe that neither the president nor the Republican majority in Congress are paying enough attention to improving the economy.In addition, Latinos are feeling increasingly unsafe due to actions their own government is taking. So nearly two-thirds believe that civil rights and freedoms have eroded under this president. Nearly half are concerned that they or someone close to them can be a victim of political violence. And 4 in 10 say that in their communities, people fear being arrested for immigration reasons, even if they are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents.MARTÍNEZ: How do you think those numbers stack up to what we might see in Texas, where, as we mentioned, Trump's support by Latinos broke records?MARTINEZ DE CASTRO: I think Trump was able to increase support among almost every demographic, including significantly with Latinos, because of economic discontent. So economic discontent helped Biden beat Trump in 2020. It helped Trump beat Biden in 2024. And based on research, it is very clear that voters see that Trump and Republicans now own the economy. So that discontent may very well now be swinging against Republicans, and that's what they need to be paying attention to.MARTÍNEZ: Last week, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito paused a lower court ruling that would have thrown out Texas Republicans' new maps. Now, speaking hypothetically, if the high court allows the new maps to stand, what would that mean for Texas Republicans' chances in the midterms?MARTINEZ DE CASTRO: I think it's not as clear-cut as maybe those holding that pen to the map might have thought, right? I think that they're going to have to work hard to get these voters on the Republican column. And I think outreach is key, both to increase turnout in the midterm - frankly, another thing that Republicans may be banking on is that there's lower turnout in the midterm election. But I think turnout is the difference-maker, and so on the Democratic side, there's opportunity in terms of engaging these voters in whatever district they may fall.MARTÍNEZ: Clarissa Martinez de Castro is vice president of the Latino Vote Initiative, UnidosUS. Clarissa, thanks.MARTINEZ DE CASTRO: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF OATMELLO'S \"REFLECTION\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The president explained his decision on social media by posting that \"according to many people that I greatly respect,\" Hernandez was \"treated very harshly and unfairly.\"   In March of last year, Hernandez was convicted in U.S. court of conspiring to import cocaine into the U.S.A. He had served served two terms as the leader of the Central American nation of roughly 10 million people.   \n   Hernandez has been appealing his conviction and serving time at the U.S. Penitentiary, Hazelton in West Virginia.   \n   A lawyer for Hernandez, Renato C. Stabile, expressed gratitude for Trump's actions.   \"A great injustice has been righted and we are so hopeful for the future partnership of the United States and Honduras,\" Stabile said. \"Thank you President Trump for making sure that justice was served. We look forward to President Hernandez's triumphant return to Honduras.\"   A separate lawyer for Hernandez, Sabrina Shroff, declined comment.   The post was part of a broader message by Trump backing Nasry \"Tito\" Asfura for Honduras' presidency, with Trump saying the U.S. would be supportive of the country if he wins. But if Asfura loses the election this Sunday, Trump posted that \"the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is.\"   Asfura, 67, is making his second run for president for the conservative National Party. He was mayor of Tegucigalpa and has pledged to solve Honduras' infrastructure needs. But he has previously been accused of embezzling public funds, allegations that he denies.   In addition to Asfura, there are two other likely contenders for Honduras' presidency: Rixi Moncada, who served as the finance and later defense secretary before leaving to run for president for the incumbent democratic socialist Libre party, and Salvador Nasralla, a former television personality who is making his fourth bid for the presidency, this time as the candidate for the Liberal Party.   \n   Trump has framed Honduras' election as trial for democracy, suggesting in a separate Truth Social post that if Asfura loses, the country could go the way of Venezuela and fall under the influence of that country's leader, Nicolás Maduro.   Trump has sought to apply pressure on Maduro, ordering a series of strikes against boats suspected of carrying drugs, building up the U.S. military presence in the Caribbean with warships including the Navy's most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford.   \n   The U.S. president has not ruled out taking military action or covert action by the CIA against Venezuela, though he has also floated that he was open to speaking with Maduro.   Outgoing Honduran President Xiomara Castro has leaned into a leftist stance, but she has kept a pragmatic and even cooperative attitude in dealing with the U.S. administration and she has received visits from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Army Gen. Laura Richardson, when she was the commander of U.S. Southern Command. The president has even backed off his threats to end Honduras' extradition treaty and military cooperation with the U.S.   Under Castro, Honduras has also received its citizens deported from the U.S. and acted as a bridge for deported Venezuelans who were then picked up by Venezuela in Honduras.   Argentine President Javier Milei, a staunch admirer of Trump, also gave his support to Asfura in Honduras on Friday.   \"I fully support Tito Asfura, who is the candidate who best represents the opposition to the leftist tyrants who have destroyed Honduras,\" the libertarian president said on his X account.\n",

Joseph Edlow, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), said Friday night that the agency is pausing decisions \"until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.\"   \"The safety of the American people always comes first,\" Edlow wrote on X.   The decision follows President Trump's promise of a sharp crackdown on immigration from countries he described as \"third world.\"   \n   Writing on social media on Thursday night, Trump railed against immigrants from impoverished nations, accusing them of being a burden on the nation's welfare system and \"preying\" on natural-born citizens.   \"I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover,\" he wrote on Truth Social.   \n   \"Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.\"   The Trump administration is already deporting some immigrants, either to their countries of origin or to third countries, many of which are paid to receive them. Venezuelans were deported from the U.S. to El Salvador, a number of migrants were sent to Eswatini and South Sudan, and Rwanda has agreed to accept deportees.   Edlow wrote on social media Thursday that he had been directed to conduct \"a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern.\"   He did not say which countries this would entail, and the USCIS did not respond to an NPR request for comment. But a June White House proclamation placed a travel ban on 12 countries of concern.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A makeshift memorial of flowers and American flags stands outside the Farragut West Metro station on Saturday in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Andrew Leyden/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Leyden/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   These included many African nations suffering from conflict and terrorism such as Chad, Sudan and Somalia — as well as other countries, such as Afghanistan. Another 7 countries were slapped with partial restrictions.    \n   In a statement to CNN, the Department of Homeland Security said it had already halted all immigration requests stemming from Afghanistan and was in the process of reviewing \"all\" asylum cases approved under former President Biden.   The department did not respond to an NPR request for comment.   History of anti-immigrant sentiment   The president's latest comments against immigration was sparked by the revelation that the alleged shooter was identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal — a 29-year-old Afghan national who had worked with the CIA to fight the Taliban in his native country and was admitted into the United States in 2021 as a result of his service. In a Thanksgiving Day call with servicemembers, Trump described the shooting as a terrorist attack and the shooter as a \"savage monster.\"   He blamed the Biden administration for Lakanwal's entry to the United States and for a general failure of the immigration system.   \"For the most part, we don't want 'em,\" he said, referring broadly to immigration seekers as gang members, mentally ill and previously incarcerated.   \n   Trump ran both successful White House campaigns on a pledge to crack down on illegal immigration, targeting at various points migrants from countries including Mexico and Somalia.   Speaking to reporters on Thursday after the Thanksgiving call, Trump widened his attack to focus not just on the alleged shooter but to rail against immigration to the U.S. and immigrants in general.   When asked by a reporter about the fact that as a former CIA asset, Lakanwal had been vetted, Trump repeatedly berated the reporter as \"stupid.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                People detained earlier in the day are taken to a parking lot on the far north side of the city before being transferred to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility on Oct. 31, 2025, in Chicago.\n                \n                    Jamie Kelter Davis/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jamie Kelter Davis/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Asked by another reporter whether he blamed all Afghans for the alleged actions of one, Trump said: \"No, but there's a lot of problems with Afghans.\"   Trump then turned his attention to immigrants from Somalia, who he has repeatedly accused of being gang-affiliated and \"taking over\" Minnesota — home to the nation's largest Somali community.   \n   Questioned about what Somalis had to do with the D.C. shooting, Trump said: \"Nothing.\" But, he added, \"Somalians have caused a lot of trouble.\" .   Later on social media, he described \"Somalian gangs\" in Minnesota as \"roving the streets looking for 'prey' as our wonderful people stay locked in their apartments and houses hoping against hope that they will be left alone.\"   Officials for the United Nations on Friday criticized Trump's call for sweeping halts to immigration seekers.   \"They are entitled to protection under international law, and that should be given due process,\" U.N. human rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence told reporters in Geneva.\n",

Spencer Cox tells NPR's Steve Inskeep why he wants states to regulate artificial intelligence.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: Now, the epic investment in artificial intelligence is raising some big questions. Here are two. Where do we get the electricity to run all those new data centers? And once they're all built, what is AI going to do to society? Utah Governor Spencer Cox is one of the elected officials facing those questions. In his recent NPR video interview, he said Utah is promoting more nuclear power plants, yet he also said he worries about the consequences of AI and wants to preserve his state's power to regulate it.What are you trying to do in Utah with nuclear power?SPENCER COX: We're trying to build it, and lots of it. Back in the '50s and '60s, we built nuclear. We built it better than anywhere else in the world. We were the leaders in this technology - clean technology, cheap technology - and then we stopped doing it. So this is the mistake that we've made. Other places in the world kept doing this and doing it very well. We have to change this. It's happening - red states, blue states working together. The federal government finally gets it. They're working through the permitting process on nuclear as well. We can do it. We can get it done.INSKEEP: What thoughts do you have about the downsides of the massive expansion, both of data centers and artificial intelligence?COX: So the expansion of data centers, of course, is going to use an - a tremendous amount of energy. So that's a concern because that's going to raise prices if we aren't doing this. But it's a global arms race. If we don't do this, China and Russia are going to do it. And so we have to be able to compete, or we are at a significant disadvantage, not just an economic disadvantage but a true national security disadvantage.Now, when it comes to the deployment of artificial intelligence as it impacts our kids and our families, our schools, the human-flourishing piece of this, we should also be incredibly cautious. I'm very worried about any type of federal incursion into states' abilities to regulate AI. We've seen how social media companies, the most powerful companies in the history of the world, have used this incredible tool to utterly destroy our kids and our families, their mental health, to use this in ways that have made them a lot of money and gotten people addicted to outrage. AI's going to be even worse.INSKEEP: Pete Buttigieg raised this and talked about growing up in the Midwest, where over the course of 20 or 30 years, most of the auto jobs disappeared...COX: Yeah.INSKEEP: ...And steel jobs and other kinds of jobs, and it was a phenomenal social burden and social problem. And he foresees possibly the same thing happening with AI, except not in 20 or 30 years - happening in three or four or five years.COX: Yeah.INSKEEP: Is that on your mind?COX: This is going to be very different. Plumbers are going to do great. Attorneys are going to do very poorly. We've never had that kind of technological disruption. I don't know what that means. I'm just pointing it out - that it is going to impact a different segment of society than has in the past. And what we're trying to do in Utah is to adopt a human-flourishing model around AI to help companies understand that they have a responsibility not just to make money, but to actually make sure that their products make human life better for all of us and that we should be working closely together.INSKEEP: Are those efforts going to be overwhelmed, though, if we're building more nuclear reactors to build more data centers, to deploy more AI at an unbelievable speed with billions and billions of dollars of investments?COX: Yeah. Well, look, potentially. But there are certain things we can do and certain things that are just impossible to do. Like, that investment is going to happen. That building is going to happen somewhere, no matter what. And so we should make sure that it happens in the right way. It's really going to have to be regulators working closely with the AI companies to make sure that we're protecting our people.INSKEEP: Spencer Cox, the governor of Utah, in an NPR video interview.

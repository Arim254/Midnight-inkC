    "body": "\n      President Trump began the year with huge plans and a GOP in lockstep, but heading into 2026 there are cracks in his support that could affect how much his administration gets done.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  Of course, 2026 is just days away - a time to look backward at the year that was and forward to the year to come. NPR senior contributor Ron Elving has been thinking about the state of U.S. politics since President Donald Trump returned to power. And, of course, Ron is completely up to the task of looking both backward and forward. Ron, thanks so much for being with us.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.SIMON: I asked you last year what you were watching for in 2025, and you advised, buckle up. You some kind of psychic?ELVING: If I were Scott, maybe I could find my cellphone more easily. But you didn't need paranormal powers to see Trump's second term would be anything but normal, even by the standards of his first term when he got impeached twice and indicted on both state and federal charges. Yet he came back, and despite all that. And there's little chance he's going to be cowed by threats of consequences this time around.The balance between Trump's impulses and the restraints on his power was more conventional the first time around. He was finding his way for a while, relying more on people who knew the Washington way or were well established on their own in government or in the Republican Party. This time around, we have a Cabinet and White House staff dominated by dedicated enablers, willing to carry out orders the way Trump has always thought all his employees should.SIMON: But there are cracks in what have been the president's support in his own party - over Ukraine, the economy, the Epstein files. Do you see those divisions widening?ELVING: The conventional wisdom says the closer we get to the midterms, the more we will see vulnerable Republicans distance themselves from Trump on health care, on food prices or various other issues. That happens to any president who is down in the polls halfway through a term. Of course, there could be events, as there were in other midterm years, such as 2002 or 1998. Those reversed the usual dynamic.But the elections coming in '26 are not the only source of stress in Trump's movement. There are tremendous divisions among some of his reporters who are not officeholders, especially among the cultural activists and people in the media - the podcasters and online influencers, the ones who have provided so much of the heat around Trump. They're at odds with each other over Israel, over Epstein, over Venezuela, and they're battling over who gets the MAGA megaphone when Trump begins to fade.SIMON: One of the defining features of the second Trump administration is how it regards or disregards the rule of law. What are your thoughts?ELVING: This term has featured serious policy shifts, like the Trump tariffs and the deportation drive and the military strikes, without congressional approval. We also see a lot of personal retribution against Trump's political enemies and provocative displays of will, such as the partial demolition of the White House and the Trump rebranding of the Kennedy Cultural Arts Center and the Institute of Peace.In all of this, we see a willingness to test the boundaries, try the locks on the doors, see what's open, see what happens and ultimately to see who will step up to enforce the law. In the year to come, we can expect these confrontations to continue and quite possibly escalate.SIMON: What will you be looking at especially closely next year?ELVING: Once again, this year, the focus will be on Trump, not just what he does and what he says and what he spreads online. The focus will also be on how he looks and acts and behaves in highly personal ways. We've already seen a lot of this attention, especially in the visual and social media. The president turns 80 on June 14. He's planning a lot of high-profile events around his birthday, but he would not need those events to bring attention to his age. Are people going to be asking, is this the same Trump? Does he still have his famous mojo? And when the midterms have passed, the spotlight must inevitably shift to the question of succession.SIMON: NPR senior contributor, Ron Elving. Thanks so much, my friend. Happy New Year.ELVING: Thank you, Scott. Happy New Year to you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee.   Abrego Garcia has denied the allegations, and argued that prosecutors are vindictively and selectively targeting him. Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw, Jr. wrote in Tuesday's order that Abrego Garcia had enough evidence to hold a hearing on the topic, which Crenshaw scheduled for Jan. 28.   \n   At that hearing, prosecutors will have to explain their reasoning for charging Abrego Garcia, Crenshaw wrote, and if they fail in that, the charges could be dismissed.   When Abrego Garcia was pulled over in 2022, there were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was eventually allowed to continue driving with only a warning.   A Department of Homeland Security agent previously testified that he did not begin investigating the traffic stop until after the U.S. Supreme Court said in April that the Trump administration had to work to bring Abrego Garcia from El Salvador, where he was deported.   \n   Years earlier, Abrego Garcia had been granted protection from deportation to his home country after a judge found he faced danger there from a gang that targeted his family. That order allowed Abrego Garcia, who has an American wife and child, to live and work in the U.S. under Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervision.   Members of President Donald Trump's administration have accused Abrego Garcia of being a member of the MS-13 gang, but he has vehemently denied the accusations and has no criminal record.   Abrego Garcia's defense attorney and the U.S. attorney's office in Nashville did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",

    "body": "\n      Morning Edition host Leila Fadel asks GOP strategist Alex Conant about the future of the Republican party in 2026 and beyond.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  So what's ahead for the Republican Party in 2026? To get into that, we're joined by Republican strategist Alex Conant. Good morning, and a belated Merry Christmas.ALEX CONANT: Good morning. Merry Christmas.FADEL: So some pretty grim records there - longest government shutdown, least bills passed, most House members leaving. This is a Republican-controlled Congress. Given this record, how is the party thinking about messaging and appealing to Americans going into 2026 and the midterms?CONANT: Well, right now, the big focus is going to be on selling the tax cuts that the president and Congress passed last summer, which, Republicans argue, have already had a measurable, positive impact on the economy. You look at the GDP numbers that were released earlier this week that showed really high third-quarter growth. The White House feels confident that is just the beginning of what's going to be a banner year in 2026. And if the economy is strong and people start perceiving that it is strong, Republicans should be fine in the midterms.FADEL: And that's - but that's the challenge, right? I mean, Americans aren't perceiving that right now. They don't feel good about the economy, and a lot of them put that blame on the party in power.CONANT: Of course. I mean, I think the president always owns the economy. And look, Americans still remember when - what prices were like before the inflation that we've had over the last three or four years. But inflation is basically over. The White House and the Fed, I think, have done a good job of getting a handle on it. We've seen very low inflation to the point where the Fed is now cutting interest rates. That, coupled with strong GDP growth, continued low unemployment - the hope is that by next November, Americans are feeling much better about the economy, and Republicans will benefit from that at the polls.FADEL: Interesting. So this now-weakness may turn into a strength in the new year. You know, we're going into 2026, and that means another deadline that could lead to a government shutdown. If that were to happen - you know, last time we saw the Republican approach, which was to wait it out and blame the Democrats for the situation, which kind of worked. If Congress faces another government shutdown at the end of January, how do you expect House Speaker Mike Johnson to approach messaging for his party and for the public?CONANT: Well, as you said, the last time the government shut down for 40-plus days, Democrats suffered the most, and they ended up caving completely to reopen it. I'm not sure Democrats want to repeat that and shut down the government again, and I know Congress is working very hard to pass bipartisan...FADEL: Right. But I think both parties suffered - right? - when it came to perception with the American public. People were angry at Washington. So would simply blaming the Democrats again be as effective?CONANT: Well, it takes two parties to shut down the government, right? And so I don't think Republicans are interested in shutting it down. I don't know that Democrats are interested in shutting it down, but I think you're right, there is going to be a big funding deadline at the end of January. I think right now, both parties see value in not shutting down the government. But if it does shut down, of course, parties are going to - people are going to blame both parties. It's also, I think, why you're seeing so many - both Republicans and Democrats - I think there's 40-plus, 50-plus members of Congress who are not returning next year. You might see more retirements if we shut down the government, simply because it's not a fun place to be.FADEL: I want to talk about the fissures we've been seeing in the party. I mean, we saw that Mike Johnson really didn't have full control of his caucus in the last few months. I mean, do you expect him to remain speaker in the year ahead?CONANT: I do expect him to remain speaker simply because nobody else wants the job. It's got to be one of the worst jobs in America, especially with a majority as slim as his. But you're right. You're seeing, you know, just a lot of unhappiness, I think, within Congress, and especially within the Republican conference. And you're also starting to see some of the battles over the future of the Republican Party that have been under the surface for the last few years. They're starting to come up as we get closer to President Trump being a truly lame duck president.FADEL: What happens to the party when President Trump's no longer at the top of the ballot? Is there a clear leader of the future of this party?CONANT: There's not. I mean, I think a lot of people would look to JD Vance, but President Trump's political support has never been transferable. It's why we've lost every election that he hasn't been at the top of the ballot in the last decade. So I think it's an open question as to who will be our next leader, and what does that coalition look like? It could be JD Vance, but I think there's a lot of others that are considering running as well.FADEL: Republican strategist Alex Conant. Thank you so much for your time.CONANT: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that Trump has championed has mostly held, but progress has slowed recently. Both sides accuse one another of violations, and divisions have emerged among the U.S., Israel and Arab countries about the path forward.   \n   The truce's first phase began in October, days after the two-year anniversary of the initial Hamas-led attack on Israel that killed around 1,200 people. All but one of the 251 hostages taken then have been released, alive or dead.   Now comes the next, far more complicated part. Trump's 20-point plan — which was approved by the U.N. Security Council — lays out an ambitious vision for ending Hamas' rule of Gaza.   The two leaders also could discuss non-Gaza topics, including Iran, whose nuclear capabilities Trump continues to insist were \"completely and fully obliterated\" following U.S. strikes on its nuclear sites in June.   There are many key facets of the ceasefire's second phase that Israel's leader doesn't support or has even openly opposed, said Mona Yacoubian, director and senior adviser of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.   \"This is going to be a really tall order, I think, for President Trump to get Netanyahu to agree,\" she said.   \"How he does that, what kind of pressure he puts on Netanyahu, I think, is going to be important to watch for,\" said Yacoubian, who also said the two could exhibit \"a broader clash of approaches to the region.\"   \n   Next phase is complex   If successful, the second phase would see the rebuilding of a demilitarized Gaza under international supervision by a group chaired by Trump and known as the Board of Peace. The Palestinians would form a \"technocratic, apolitical\" committee to run daily affairs in Gaza, under Board of Peace supervision.   It further calls for normalized relations between Israel and the Arab world, and a possible pathway to Palestinian independence. Then there are thorny logistical and humanitarian questions, including rebuilding war-ravaged Gaza, disarming Hamas and creating a security apparatus called the International Stabilization Force.   The Board of Peace would oversee Gaza's reconstruction under a two-year, renewable U.N. mandate. Its members had been expected to be named by the end of the year and might even be revealed following Monday's meeting, but the announcement could be pushed into next month.   Netanyahu was the first foreign leader to meet Trump at the White House in his second term, but this will be their first in-person meeting since Trump went to Israel in October to mark the start of the ceasefire's initial phase. Netanyahu has been to Mar-a-Lago before, including in July 2024 when Trump was still seeking reelection.   Much remains unsettled   Their latest meeting comes after U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and the president's son in law, Jared Kushner, recently huddled in Florida with officials from Egypt, Qatar and Turkey, which have been mediating the ceasefire.   Two main challenges have complicated moving to the second phase, according to an official who was briefed on those meetings. Israeli officials have been taking a lot of time to vet and approve members of the Palestinian technocratic committee from a list given to them by the mediators, and Israel continues its military strikes.   Trump's plan also calls for the International Stabilization Force, proposed as a multinational body, to maintain security. But it, too, has yet to be formed. Whether details will be forthcoming after Monday's meeting is unclear.   \n   A Western diplomat said there is a \"huge gulf\" between the U.S.-Israeli understanding of the International Stabilization Force's mandate and that of other major countries in the region, as well as European governments.   All spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details that haven't been made public.   The U.S. and Israel want the force to have a \"commanding role\" in security duties, including disarming Hamas and other militant groups. But countries being courted to contribute troops fear that mandate will make it an \"occupation force,\" the diplomat said.   Hamas has said it is ready to discuss \"freezing or storing\" its arsenal of weapons, but insists it has a right to armed resistance as long as Israel occupies Palestinian territory. One U.S. official said a potential plan might be to offer cash incentives in exchange for weapons, echoing a \"buy-back\" program Witkoff has previously floated.   Questions about Gaza reconstruction   Israeli bombardment and ground operations have transformed neighborhoods in several Gaza cities into rubble-strewn wastelands, with blackened shells of buildings and mounds of debris stretching in all directions.   \n   Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey are pressing for a negotiated deal on disarming Hamas, and on an additional Israeli withdrawal from Gaza before moving to next elements of the plan. Those include deployment of the international security force and reconstruction, three Arab officials told The Associated Press.   That appears to run against ideas floated by U.S. officials to quickly start building temporary housing for Palestinians in parts of southern Gaza still controlled by Israeli troops. Three officials said the United Arab Emirates has agreed to fund reconstruction in Gaza, including new communities, although they said discussions are ongoing and plans remain unsettled.   A proposed map created by the U.S. and obtained by the AP shows an area labelled \"UAE Temporary Emirates housing complex\" inside an Israeli-controlled area of Gaza. The map shows a \"U.S. planned community area\" surrounding the UAE area.   \n   An Arab official said he was aware of the map, but said it was a suggestion from the U.S. and Israel that was put to the Emiratis and other countries.   The UAE did not respond to multiple requests for comment about whether it has agreed to the plans or to fund the communities. It is not known if the money would be contingent on gestures from Israel and Hamas, such as a commitment to Palestinian statehood or disarmament.\n",

And in his first term, he didn't really flex those muscles. But since returning to the White House, Trump has been on a remodeling spree.   \"I have two jobs,\" Trump said recently. Commander in chief is one, but his real passion appears to be the second. \"I have a construction job, which is really like relaxation for me because I have been doing it all my life.\"   There are many ways Trump has shaken things up in his first year back in office, including signing hundreds of executive orders and launching a global trade war. But somehow, he's also found the time to obsessively tweak decor and oversee several major renovations.   \n   During a recent dinner speech meant to salute Kennedy Center Honorees such as Gloria Gaynor and the band Kiss, Trump took a 9-minute detour to discuss his various renovations. He recounted asking someone whether he was a better builder or politician.   \"And they didn't know how to answer that question,\" Trump said with a laugh. \"I'm not sure how to answer it either, if you want to know the truth, but I actually get great relaxation out of fixing the White House and fixing the Kennedy Center.\"   He admitted this does take his time and attention, but insisted he can fit it all in because unlike other people, \"I don't really want to rest.\"   New projects   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The new sign outside of the \"John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts\" now includes \"The Donald J. Trump\" as seen on December 19, 2025 in Washington, DC.\n                \n                    Heather Diehl/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Heather Diehl/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   Since returning to office, Trump has bathed the Oval Office in gold, paved the Rose Garden, added giant flagpoles on the north and south lawn, weighed in on a restoration project at the Federal Reserve, replaced tile in the Lincoln Bathroom with marble, overseen a major overhaul of the Kennedy Center and even brought Trump-style luxury to a small passthrough at the White House known as the Palm Room.   In an interview with Laura Ingraham of Fox News, Trump explained that the old tile was cheap and broken. He replaced \"lanterns that were terrible\" with new chandeliers, and brought intense attention to every little detail.   \n   \"If you look at the air conditioner vent, it's book matched. Look at it,\" Trump said to Ingraham. \"I can do that because I know that, you know, it's even available that you could do that. Very few people can do it.\"   \n   Trump and members of his administration often refer to him as \"a builder\" and at a recent rally in North Carolina, Trump described himself as having strong opinions about the shape of the arms on chairs he put in his hotels. \"I am a very aesthetic person,\" he said.   That was also Trump's explanation for why he would be weighing in on the design of the new Navy battleships he was ordering up, the \"Trump class.\"   Trump even took time out from a speech to the United Nations General Assembly earlier this year to complain about long ago losing a contract to renovate the building.   \"They had massive cost overruns and spent between $2 and $4 billion on the building and did not even get the marble floors that I promised them,\" Trump said. \"You walk on Terraza, do you notice that?\"   Big changes   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Demolition work continues where the East Wing once stood at the White House on December 08, 2025 in Washington, DC.\n                \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   Much like his expansive use of executive power, Trump isn't slowing down or asking permission. Take his ballroom project. The entire East Wing of the White House was torn down in October to make way for it, even as images of excavators tearing into the building sparked public outcry. What started out over the summer as a $200 million project funded by private donors has now ballooned.   \"We're donating a building that's approximately $400 million,\" Trump shouted into a microphone at a recent Hanukkah celebration. \"I should do it for less. I will do it for less. But just in case I say 400. Otherwise, if I go $3 over, the press will say it costs more.\"   Many presidents have made small changes to personalize the White House. A swimming pool here, a basketball court there. The East Wing, West Wing and Truman balcony were all additions and all controversial at the time, says Kate Andersen Brower, author of The Residence about the staff who work at the White House.   \n   \"This is the most extreme, the biggest footprint, the most personal addition,\" said Brower.   Personal, she says, because it and all the other White House changes are so unmistakably matched to Trump's personal aesthetic.   \"This is about people 200 years from now knowing that he is president,\" said Brower. \"And it's going to be impossible to miss that ballroom.\"   Trump has said he has no plans to name the ballroom after himself.    But his name is now emblazoned on Kennedy Center, a performing arts center created by Congress as a memorial to the late President John F. Kennedy. A Democratic congresswoman who is an ex-officio member of the Kennedy Center board filed a lawsuit challenging the renaming of the memorial, calling the action \"unlawful\" because the original name was assigned by Congress.   \"It feels as though the president believes that this is his personal portfolio and not the portfolio owned by the American people,\" said Rebecca Miller, executive director of the DC Preservation League. \"The way the administration has been moving forward indicates that they don't have any guardrails that they have to run up against.\"   She says Trump is making so many changes to so many historic places so quickly it is hard to keep up.   \"President Trump is making the White House beautiful and giving it the glory it deserves at no cost to the taxpayer,\" said Davis Ingle, a White House spokesman. \"Only people with a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome would find a problem with that.\"   Information about the ballroom project is set to be presented to the National Capital Planning Commission next month. Though it is now controlled by the president's allies, which means that whatever Trump and his team propose is unlikely to meet much resistance.\n",

The president's statements came after the two leaders met for a discussion that took place after what Trump described as an \"excellent,\" two-and-a-half-hour phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose invasion of Ukraine launched the war four years ago. Trump insisted he believed Putin still wants peace, even as Russia launched another round of attacks on Ukraine while Zelenskyy flew to the United States for the latest round of negotiations.   \n   \"Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed,\" Trump said during a late afternoon news conference following a meeting with Zelenskyy, whom he repeatedly praised as \"brave.\"   \n   Trump and Zelenskyy both acknowledged thorny issues remain, including whether Russia can keep Ukrainian territory it controls. After their discussion they called a wide group of European leaders, including Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, and the leaders of Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain and Poland.   Zelenskyy thanked Trump for his work. \"Ukraine is ready for peace,\" he said.   Trump and Putin will speak again   Trump said he'd follow the meeting with another call to Putin. Earlier Sunday, Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said the Trump-Putin call was initiated by the U.S. side, lasted over an hour, and was \"friendly, benevolent and businesslike.\" Ushakov said Trump and Putin agreed to speak again \"promptly\" after Trump's meeting with Zelenskyy.   But Ushakov added that a \"bold, responsible, political decision is needed from Kyiv\" on the fiercely contested Donbas region in eastern Ukraine and other matters in dispute for there to be a \"complete cessation\" of hostilities.   In overnight developments, three guided aerial bombs launched by Russia struck private homes in the eastern city of Sloviansk, according to the head of the local military administration, Vadym Lakh. Three people were injured and one man died, Lakh said in a post on the Telegram messenger app.   \n   The strike came the day after Russia attacked Ukraine's capital with ballistic missiles and drones on Saturday, killing at least one person and wounding 27, Ukrainian authorities said. Explosions boomed across Kyiv as the attack began in the early morning and continued for hours.   Trump said, however, that he still believes Putin is \"very serious\" about ending the war.   \"I believe Ukraine has made some very strong attacks also,\" Trump told reporters as Zelenskyy stood by his side. \"And I don't say that negatively. I think, you probably have to. I don't say that negatively. But I think, he hasn't told me that, but there have been some explosions in various parts of Russia. It looks to me, like, I don't know. I don't think it came from the Congo.\"   \n   Trump noted that it was possible that the negotiations will fall apart. \"In a few weeks, we will know one way or the other, I think. ... But it could also go poorly.\"   The face-to-face sit-down between Trump and Zelenskyy underscored the apparent progress made by Trump's top negotiators in recent weeks as the sides traded draft peace plans and continued to shape a proposal to end the fighting. Zelenskyy told reporters Friday that the 20-point draft proposal negotiators have discussed is \"about 90% ready\" — echoing a figure, and the optimism, that U.S. officials conveyed when Trump's chief negotiators met with Zelenskyy in Berlin earlier this month.   During the recent talks, the U.S. agreed to offer certain security guarantees to Ukraine similar to those offered to other members of NATO. The proposal came as Zelenskyy said he was prepared to drop his country's bid to join the security alliance if Ukraine received NATO-like protection that would be designed to safeguard it against future Russian attacks.   'Intensive' weeks ahead   Zelenskyy also spoke on Christmas Day with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law. The Ukrainian leader said they discussed \"certain substantive details\" and cautioned \"there is still work to be done on sensitive issues\" and \"the weeks ahead may also be intensive.\"   \n   The U.S. president has been working to end the war in Ukraine for much of his first year back in office, showing irritation with both Zelenskyy and Putin while publicly acknowledging the difficulty of ending the conflict. Long gone are the days when, as a candidate in 2024, he boasted that he could resolve the fighting in a day.   \n   After hosting Zelenskyy at the White House in October, Trump demanded that both Russia and Ukraine halt fighting and \"stop at the battle line,\" implying that Moscow should be able to keep the territory it has seized from Ukraine.   Zelenskyy said last week that he would be willing to withdraw troops from Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland as part of a plan to end the war, if Russia also pulls back and the area becomes a demilitarized zone monitored by international forces.   Putin wants Russian gains kept, and more   Putin has publicly said he wants all the areas in four key regions that have been captured by his forces, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory. He also has insisted that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in eastern Ukraine that Moscow's forces haven't captured. Kyiv has publicly rejected all those demands.   The Kremlin also wants Ukraine to abandon its bid to join NATO. It warned that it wouldn't accept the deployment of any troops from members of the military alliance and would view them as a \"legitimate target.\"   \n   Putin also has said Ukraine must limit the size of its army and give official status to the Russian language, demands he has made from the outset of the conflict.   Ushakov told the business daily Kommersant this month that Russian police and national guard would stay in parts of Donetsk -– one of the two major areas, along with Luhansk, that make up the Donbas region — even if they become a demilitarized zone under a prospective peace plan.   Ushakov cautioned that trying to reach a compromise could take a long time. He said U.S. proposals that took into account Russian demands had been \"worsened\" by alterations proposed by Ukraine and its European allies.   \n   Trump has been somewhat receptive to Putin's demands, making the case that the Russian president can be persuaded to end the war if Kyiv agrees to cede Ukrainian land in the Donbas region and if Western powers offer economic incentives to bring Russia back into the global economy.\n",

The Associated Press first reported that Redd pulled out of the show days after President Trump's name was added to the exterior of the performing arts center in Washington, D.C.   In an email to NPR on Saturday, Kennedy Center spokesperson Roma Daravi said Redd's decision is a disservice to the arts.   \n   \"Any artist cancelling their show at the Trump Kennedy Center over political differences isn't courageous or principled—they are selfish, intolerant, and have failed to meet the basic duty of a public artist: to perform for all people,\" she said.   Redd, an international performer on drums and vibraphone, hosted the center's Christmas Jazz Jam for many years. NPR's messages to Redd were not returned Saturday morning.   \"When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,\" he told the AP.   Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell sent a scathing letter to Redd on Friday, criticizing him and calling the cancellation a political stunt. The center shared the letter with NPR.   \n   \"Regrettably, your action surrenders to the sad bullying tactics employed by certain elements on the left, who have sought to intimidate artists into boycotting performances at our national cultural center,\" it reads.   In a post on X on Friday, Grenell wrote: \"The left is boycotting the Arts because Trump is supporting the Arts. But we will not let them cancel shows without consequences. The Arts are for everyone - and the Left is mad about it.\"   Several artists have pulled out of performances and cut ties with the Kennedy Center since Trump replaced the board and was elected chairman. In March, Hamilton canceled its 2026 run at the Kennedy Center. Actor and producer Issa Rae also called off her appearance. Folk musician Rhiannon Giddens moved her concert to a different venue in the city.   \n   Trump's name was added to the Kennedy Center building last week, after the Board of Trustees voted to rename it. The exterior's iconic lettering now reads \"The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.\"   \n   The name change has prompted outcry from Democratic lawmakers. Ohio Rep. Joyce Beatty, an ex-officio member of the Kennedy Center Board, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Monday. Beatty argues changing the name of the memorial that is in honor of President John F. Kennedy requires an act of Congress. She's asking the court to declare the board's vote null and void.   According to a Kennedy Center online biography, Redd has been involved with The Smithsonian for more than two decades, serving as artist-in residence at The Smithsonian Jazz Café from 2004-2008. The Kennedy Center is part of the Smithsonian Institution.   \n   \"Art is a shared cultural experience meant to unite, not exclude,\" said the statement from Daravi. \"The Trump Kennedy Center is a true bipartisan institution that welcomes artists and patrons from all backgrounds—great art transcends politics, and America's cultural center remains committed to presenting popular programming that inspires and resonates with all audiences.\"   The Kennedy Center says it will file the lawsuit against Redd after the holidays.\n",

House Speaker Mike Johnson put it this way in his first address to his chamber this year.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE JOHNSON: In spite of our great challenges, and even our disagreements and our healthy debates, this extraordinary institution - the people's House - will still be standing strong.FADEL: But 12 months later, Congress has ceded much of its power to President Trump and has passed a record-low number of bills. NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales has been following this and joins us now. Hi, Claudia.CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Hey, Leila.FADEL: OK. So congressional Republicans started the year with these ambitious plans to pass bills, to strengthen the economy, address the border crisis, boost the military. Did any of that happen?GRISALES: Not exactly, unless you look at their marquee tax and spending plan they called the One Big Beautiful Bill, which became law. They would argue that is the key legislation that passed, but the jury's still out if this is going to have the advertised impact on the economy. And it was the exception to the rule. Congress ceded a lot of its power to the president this year. That included dismantling large sections of the federal government, taking over the power of the purse during the government shutdown by directing spending that was prohibited at that time and triggering the clawback of billions of spending that had been approved by Congress. And as you mentioned, we heard from public affairs network C-SPAN. They reported the number of laws enacted this year are at that all-time low.FADEL: Now, Republicans are the majority in both the House and Senate, but that is very narrow. How did leaders fare in 2025?GRISALES: Yeah. It definitely made it more difficult for them. In the House, we saw Speaker Mike Johnson lose more control of his conference. By year-end, he faced a rare series of successful discharge petitions. These are bipartisan efforts by rank-and-file members to bypass the speaker and pass law. And none was more noteworthy than the one securing the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. He also saw Republican pushback when he virtually closed the house down during the 43-day government shutdown. He's facing a record number of House retirements. That includes nearly 30 Republicans.FADEL: OK, so some division within his own party. What about the Senate? How did Majority Leader John Thune fare in comparison?GRISALES: Well, he didn't end the year with the same level of animosity, but he saw challenges, too. I asked him about lessons learned. Here's what he told me.JOHN THUNE: You know, I mean, sometimes you get frustrated that you don't get the things done you want to get done. But you got to keep trying there.GRISALES: Ultimately, the Senate approved a majority of Trump's nominees for the administration and federal courts. But not until recently did we see more Senate Republicans push back publicly on the president with some issues, such as the strikes on alleged drug traffickers at sea. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told me these challenges and the chaos we've seen with the federal government, the economy, Trump's tariff policies have all created an opening for Democrats.FADEL: Now, Congress will face even greater challenges next year with the midterms on tap. What do you expect to see?GRISALES: Well, lawmakers have their eye on exactly those midterms in November. Even with Republicans redistricting to add seats in the House, it's still not clear they're going to keep their majority. They face the prospect of another government shutdown threat in January, and that's in addition to calls for Washington to address an affordability crisis that we expect will dominate on the campaign trail. And there's also those spiking premiums for health insurance after Congress failed to extend subsidies for Obamacare plans. This is going to likely add fuel to the fire that Congress is not addressing a lot of urgent issues for American families come November.FADEL: That's NPR's Claudia Grisales.

    "body": "\n      President Trump is meeting with Ukrainian Pres. Volodymyr Zelenskyy today and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tomorrow.   \n\n    DANIEL ESTRIN, HOST:  Two world leaders involved in two major conflicts are meeting President Trump this week. In a few minutes, we'll hear about what the Israeli prime minister may have planned for the president tomorrow. Today, Trump meets Ukraine's leader, and this time, not in the Oval Office. NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben joins us now. Good morning, Danielle.DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Good morning, Daniel.ESTRIN: So this afternoon, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is scheduled to meet President Trump in Florida. That's where Trump is spending the holidays. And Russian President Vladimir Putin set the stage this weekend - didn't he? - with missile and drone attacks on Kyiv this weekend.KURTZLEBEN: That's absolutely right. So the meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump is scheduled for 1 p.m. Eastern today at Trump's club, Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach. And there's been some real movement here since that infamous bitter Oval Office meeting you alluded to, featuring Zelenskyy, Trump and Vice President Vance earlier this year. Now, earlier this week, Zelenskyy released a 20-point plan to end the war, which, according to multiple outlets, it described security guarantees and a demilitarized zone between Russia and Ukraine, which would be one way to try to deal with that sticking point of territory disputes between the two countries. Zelenskyy also told Axios this week that he's willing to bring that plan up for a referendum in Ukraine, but only if Russia agrees to a 60-day ceasefire. Now, that's a big if, because, as you said, Russia bombarded Kyiv yesterday, and they may not be inclined to stop attacking.ESTRIN: Yeah. And meanwhile, Trump ordered missile strikes on targets in northern Nigeria on Christmas Day, and he's also keeping up the pressure on Venezuela and President Nicolas Maduro. So what exactly is Trump's aim in these two very different parts of the globe?KURTZLEBEN: Well, let's start with Nigeria here. Trump announced in a Christmas night social media post that the U.S. had launched strikes against ISIS in northwestern Nigeria. And we should add here that the Nigerian government says they gave the green light to this. Well, Trump implied that this was retaliation for armed militants attacking Christians, though experts have disputed claims of Christian persecution in that country, as the AP found earlier this year, militants there have killed Muslims and Christians alike. As far as the aim beyond what Trump said here, it may be to please his Christian base. For one thing, this topic is getting louder. Rapper Nicki Minaj, who has become friendly to MAGA, has been talking about this alleged Christian persecution.But then there's Venezuela, which you mentioned, where the administration has been striking boats that they say are carrying drugs and killing people in the process. Well, the endgame there has been in question for months now. For example, does Trump want regime change in Venezuela? Now, all of this certainly fits with how the Trump administration likes to talk about itself, being tough on terrorists and tough on drugs, but you're right that it raises that question of why is Trump taking all these actions all over the world? Because that question of why has created strife within his own party. You have former Trump ally, Marjorie Taylor Greene, a congresswoman from Georgia, who has asked, for example, if Trump is still America First.ESTRIN: And speaking of strife in the Republican Party, let's talk about the cultural battles happening on the right. These past few weeks in this country, the hot topic used to be antisemitism, and now there's a new controversy over what it means to be American.KURTZLEBEN: Yeah. This got more attention in particular after Ohio GOP gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, in recent days, he pushed back against this idea of heritage Americans, which is a concept among some on the far right, that there are people in the U.S. whose lineage can be traced far back in the U.S.' history, and therefore, they are heritage Americans, that your lineage determines your Americanness, which, of course, means race is central to this conversation. And so therefore, we've seen this topic inflame existing tensions, for example, between people like Ramaswamy and the white nationalist streamer Nick Fuentes.Now, all of this is important, not just in and of itself, because it's another intra-party faultline in the GOP. There's this question about what America First means, like I mentioned. Then here's this divide between outright racists like Fuentes, who has a large following, and other MAGA leaders. And then, like you mentioned, there's that fight over what constitutes antisemitism and how to reject that. So there's a real chance that these often really ugly divides are a major storyline in 2026 as the midterms approach and as the GOP grapples with its post-Trump future.ESTRIN: NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben.

Pictures; NEON; Eddy Chen/Lionsgate; Warner Bros. Pictures\n    \n\n   \n   In 2025, a time of intense political turmoil and division, James L. Brooks released his first film in 15 years, a political rom-dramedy looking back on the year 2008 through wistful, Obamacore-clouded eyes. Despite a stacked ensemble that includes Jamie Lee Curtis and Albert Brooks, Ella McCay is easily one of the worst movies of the year for many reasons, not least of which is a line in which a character proclaims 2008 as \"a better time, when we all still liked each other.\" (Obvious follow-up question: Who is \"we\"?) Even more glaring is the fact that its protagonist, played by Emma Mackey, becomes the de facto Anyparty governor of Anytown, USA — her political party is never identified, the state she lives and serves in is never named.   \n   The revisionist non-specificity demonstrates zero interest in meeting The Moment, though plenty of other films released this year have at least attempted to engage with it more directly. This isn't to say all of them pulled off their aims. But before seeing Ella McCay, I'd been mulling what it even means for a film to be \"successful\" in tackling sociopolitical issues in this climate, when each new day conjures up utterly ridiculous and dystopian realities just as bizarre as any screenwriter might possibly imagine, if not more so. Brooks' film at least makes clear what definitely doesn't work in this space: nostalgia, and a posturing of neutrality.   \n   Beyond that extremely low bar, parsing how to assess work that engages in politics is hardly straightforward, and admittedly dependent on a wholly subjective perception of what The Moment is and requires. The output has been a mixed, yet fascinating bag. Entertaining mainstream movies like Wicked: For Good and The Running Man gestured overtly at radical ideas through their protagonists' anti-authoritarian struggles, but ultimately offered little besides oversimplified stick-it-to-the-man rallying cries. In contrast, two great movies which both happen to star Josh O'Connor — The Mastermind and Wake Up Dead Man — kept political themes simmering in the background but deployed them to meaningful emotional effect.   \n   Some of the more confounding and messy projects this year were made in the spirit of \"challenging\" the audience — getting the people going, as it were. This can usually be done a couple of ways: didactically or, as is the case with Luca Guadagnino's After the Hunt, obtusely. The thorny campus melodrama stars Julia Roberts as Yale professor Alma, who begins to unravel after her star student Maggie (Ayo Edebiri) accuses her colleague Hank (Andrew Garfield) of rape. It's deliberately ambiguous in nearly every aspect of its storytelling — to the point of incomprehension rather than subversion.   \n   Less vague but much weirder were Ari Aster's Eddington and Yorgos Lanthimos' Bugonia, which both truthfully depict the chaos that's gripped American politics in recent years. Eddington stars Joaquin Phoenix as the sheriff of a small, rural New Mexico town in the early months of the pandemic, and astutely captures the absurdities and discord of that time — the social distancing, the fights over masking, the dangerous online conspiracy theory rabbit holes that sucked many people in as they isolated. Bugonia, too, feels intimately ripped from real life, as Teddy (Jesse Plemons), a conspiracy theorist who admits to having cycled through \"the whole digestive tract\" of ideologies (alt-right, alt-left, Marxism, etc.), dictates his many grievances to Michelle (Emma Stone), the pharmaceutical CEO he's kidnapped, because he's convinced she's an alien. (It sounds completely unhinged, until you remember the hoopla around Pizzagate.)   Sometimes getting a vibe right — and in these cases, that vibe is the ball of utter confusion we're swirling in — is enough to carry a movie. But Aster and Lanthimos have made plain their intentions of puncturing the \"echo chamber\" with their respective projects, and neither fully pulls that off. (Fittingly, Aster is also a producer on Bugonia.) For one thing, expecting any movie to meaningfully shift someone's perspective about \"the other side\" is a tall order when the leader of one \"side\" — or at least, one of many — is disseminating A.I. slop videos trolling his critics. But in Eddington, as with After the Hunt, presenting uncomfortable scenarios and contemptible characters takes precedence over storytelling. (Eddington also shortchanges its sole Black character, a cop played by Micheal Ward, by relegating him to the role of one-dimensional stand-in for Black Lives Matter-era anxieties when the news of George Floyd's murder breaks.)   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Emma Stone in Bugonia.\n                \n                    Atsushi Nishijima/Focus Features\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Atsushi Nishijima/Focus Features\n    \n\n   \n   To its credit, Bugonia isn't ambiguous at all; the ending — spoilers incoming — follows the same basic plot twist as the Korean movie it's inspired by, Save the Green Planet!, revealing that Michelle the CEO is indeed an alien who was sent to earth to assess \"the human experiment\" and has deemed it a failure worthy of extermination. But its defeatist attitude nearly undoes everything that came before it, and contrary to feeling \"challenged,\" I was irked by how smug the conclusion felt. Is that all that there is?   \n   Other projects this year seemed to reflect filmmakers' attempts to look inward politically, and while they didn't always look hard enough, the results were still worth examining. Aziz Ansari's directorial debut Good Fortune, an enjoyable if clunky movie with a brilliant comedic turn from Keanu Reeves playing a guardian angel, is It's a Wonderful Life meets Trading Places. Ansari's character Arj, a struggling gig economy worker living out of his car in Los Angeles, swaps lives with Seth Rogen's wealthy tech bro Jeff, and the film mines comedy and occasional pointed commentary out of the many indignities Arj deals with as a courier and factory worker.   \n   For a middle-brow Hollywood comedy, there's a refreshing frankness about wealth inequality; it features unsubtle references to Amazon-related news stories, including a pro-union subplot. But the film clears a bare minimum and Ansari has readily acknowledged his situation is much closer to Jeff's than Arj's, which may account for why Good Fortune's critique ultimately lets the machinations of capitalism off the hook. Once Jeff and Arj's lives are switched back, the gig worker's financial circumstances are barely improved from the beginning of the movie, yet the message seems to be that Arj just needs to have a more positive outlook and channel it into activism. (Spike Lee's Highest 2 Lowest is undercut by a similar predicament in addressing wealth disparity.)   \n   That disconnect between filmmaking intent and impact is what keeps Paul Thomas Anderson's thrilling One Battle After Another from being as politically potent as some have argued it is. This is at least partially by design; he told the Los Angeles Times that he avoided \"put[ing] politics up in the front\" in service of presenting characters the audience would care about, and aptly noted that as timely as OBAA may seem, history is always repeating itself. (Fascism, he said, \"doesn't go out of style.\") Fair enough — but it's notable that he pointedly portrays white middle-aged malaise, an underground effort to shelter migrants from law enforcement agents, and a secret society of white nationalists.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Teyana Taylor in One Battle After Another.\n                \n                    Warner Bros. Pictures\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Warner Bros. Pictures\n    \n\n   \n   Less assured is his treatment of Black radicalism, which comes across as inadvertently disjointed or, less charitably, dismissive. In writing Perfidia (Teyana Taylor), a character who anchors the first third of the film before all but disappearing for the rest of it, Anderson pulls from markers of Blaxploitation and the sordid history of white men's fetishization of Black women to craft a thinly realized revolutionary — a figure whose hypersexuality is inextricable from her acts of rebellion. Taylor's magnetic and committed performance hints at how these tensions might have been more deeply explored, but it can't fully overcome the script's scattershot references and hurried characterization. (Here it also seems worth observing that while Anderson has been in a long-term relationship with Maya Rudolph, even casting her in small roles in Inherent Vice and Licorice Pizza, Black women characters have not been featured as prominently in his films before OBAA.)   \n   It seems the moment requires more than just presenting questions and what-ifs. It needs a stance, a commitment to an ethos and to the story it's ostensibly trying to tell, and an honesty about consequences. Ryan Coogler did this with Sinners, crafting a story that's richly entertaining while being acutely critical of the capitalistic and cultural forces that have leeched off Black Americans for centuries. Ditto Kleber Mendonça Filho's thriller The Secret Agent, a sprawling yet intimate film about political refugees living under aliases during Brazil's military dictatorship. In one scene, a resistance leader named Elza (Maria Fernanda Cândido) expresses sympathy toward former educator Marcelo (Wagner Moura) and his father-in-law Sr. Alexandre (Carlos Francisco) for the death of Marcelo's wife, and vows that Brazil will pay for it. \"I disagree,\" Sr. Alexandre replies plainly. \"With all due respect. It'll pay nothing. It won't pay s***.\"   \n   Of all these films, Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi's It Was Just an Accident may be the one most directly connected to the present moment, in no small part because the line between fiction and reality has been blurred by outside forces. Earlier this month, Panahi was handed a year-long prison sentence in Iran, as well as a two-year ban on all international travel. This isn't the first time Panahi, a longtime outspoken critic of the Iranian government, has been targeted; many of his films have been made in secret, including his 2011 documentary This Is Not a Film, which he shot while under house arrest and awaiting the results of an appeal of a six-year prison sentence and 20-year ban from making films.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Mohamad Ali Elyasmehr, Majid Panahi and Hadis Pakbaten in It Was Just an Accident.\n                \n                    ‎NEON\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        ‎NEON\n    \n\n   \n   In Accident, Vahid (Vahid Mobasseri), a former political captive, comes across a man he's convinced was one of his tormentors and kidnaps him to enact violent vengeance. (Plot details ahead.) The man, Eghbal (Ebrahim Azizi), insists he's got the wrong person, and Vahid, now unsure, enlists some of the other victims to see if they might help identify him. Panahi puts the concept of justice under a microscope as they debate his identity and the usefulness of retaliation. Eventually, the man finally confesses out of desperation, arguing that he was simply following orders. He also adds that he at first held a guilty conscience, but he \"got used to it with time.\"   \n   Time hangs over Accident like a dark cloud, and the astounding final scene suggests Vahid will never be able to get away from the traumas he's endured. Understood a different way, it may also imply Vahid's ultimate decision — to show his tormentor mercy — while morally admirable, may have been in vain. On an episode of the podcast Filmspotting, co-host Adam Kempenaar said of Accident, \"It's one of those films … that is fundamentally about asking those questions — asking big, moral and ethical questions, but it also has clarity. It has conclusions. It leaves open some interpretation at the end … but within that, there is also clarity in what we see the characters do.\"   This is the thing: the masks have come fully off in political discourse, with all the -isms and -phobias no longer cloaked under thin layers of coded language and niceties. Families are being torn apart, jobs are being lost for criticizing the current administration, governmental systems have been effectively dismantled and rendered useless. Nuance is always welcome, but now is not the time for vagueness or subtlety in art that dares to wade into these issues. The expectation is not for movies to change the world, but to help make sense of it, even just a little. The films that brought us closest this year are the most likely to withstand time.   \n",

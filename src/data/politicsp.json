Nearly all of them voted to force a release of the Epstein files after President Trump reversed his position. But even before that vote, a handful of Republicans signaled a willingness to take on the president over a different contentious issue. NPR's Andrea Hsu explains.ANDREA HSU, BYLINE: Back in late March, President Trump signed an executive order directing around 20 federal agencies to end collective bargaining rights for most federal workers, citing national security concerns. The move outraged the unions.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)EVERETT KELLEY: This isn't about safety or security.HSU: Everett Kelley is president of the American Federation of Government Employees. They represent the lion's share of the roughly 1 million employees affected by the order.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KELLEY: It's about silencing workers who are courageously standing up to this nonintegrity, to his nonaccountability in the government.HSU: The White House explained that unions have been obstructing agency management, and said that's dangerous in agencies with national security responsibilities. According to Trump, that includes the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency. Later, he added NASA and the National Weather Service. Since January, the American Federation of Government Employees has been hostile to Trump's agenda. It's filed lawsuits to block mass layoffs, the dismantling of agencies and, yes, the termination of its union contracts.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KELLEY: This executive order is plainly retaliatory. The executive order says plainly that they are taking this action because AFGE is standing up for our members.HSU: And here's where House lawmakers come in. Democrat Jared Golden of Maine introduced a bill.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JARED GOLDEN: The Protect America's Workforce Act, which would overturn President Trump's executive order.HSU: It would also restore any collective bargaining agreements canceled since March. Within days, the bill had gained enough Republican co-sponsors to pass in the House, but getting it to a vote was another matter. Leadership wasn't on board. So Golden turned to the same procedural tactic House lawmakers used to force a vote on the Epstein files - the discharge petition. Two hundred eighteen signatures guarantees a vote. Golden spoke at a press conference in July.(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)GOLDEN: If every member who signed on to this bill would join us, we could overturn this union-busting action and show America that this body will protect workers' rights, no matter what.HSU: And this week, Golden got to 218 with Republicans Nick LaLota and Michael Lawler of New York signing the petition on Monday. In a statement posted to his website, Lawler wrote, supporting workers and ensuring good government are not opposing ideas. Now, a date for the House vote has not yet been set, and if the bill passes, it would move on to the Senate, where it's far less clear there are enough Republicans willing to defy the president.

    "body": "\n      A measure to compel the Justice Department to release its files on Jeffrey Epstein is on its way to President Trump's desk after quickly advancing through both chambers of Congress Tuesday.   \n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  Both chambers of Congress have now moved to force the Justice Department to release its files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. We'll hear from one of the senators who voted for the bill, Democrat Maggie Hassan, right after we get up to date on the facts.LEILA FADEL, HOST:  President Trump has promised to sign the measure but told reporters that the intense focus on the files is a Democratic hoax.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein. I threw him out of my club many years ago 'cause I thought he was a sick pervert. But - and I guess I turned out to be right.MARTÍNEZ: NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas is following this story from Capitol Hill. So when we talk about releasing the Epstein files, Sam, I mean, which ones are we talking about?SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: So this legislation applies to unclassified documents, communications or investigation materials held by the Justice Department, the FBI and U.S. attorneys' offices related to federal investigations into Epstein in New York and Florida. Now, it's worth noting that the House Oversight Committee has already released other Epstein files, including thousands of pages of emails obtained from the Epstein estate. That batch of documents included Epstein telling a journalist that Trump, quote, \"knew about the girls,\" seemingly referring to people Epstein was trafficking. As we just heard, the president has said he broke ties with Epstein years ago and has denied any wrongdoing.MARTÍNEZ: Now, releasing the files has been a very divisive thing within the Republican Party. But, yeah, yesterday, legislation sailed through both chambers. So take us through what changed.GRINGLAS: For months, President Trump and Republican leaders in Congress tried to thwart a vote on these files. But Democrats and some Republicans, like Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, pressed ahead. Greene said Trump's refusal to release the files was a betrayal of his most ardent supporters.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE: For people that slept in their cars to go to rallies, have fought for truth and transparency, watching this actually turn into a fight has ripped MAGA apart.GRINGLAS: But once a bipartisan petition to force the issue got enough signatures, Trump reversed course. And that paved the way for Tuesday's vote in the House, which several survivors of Epstein's abuse actually watched from the gallery. Here's one of them, Jena-Lisa Jones, who spoke outside the Capitol before the votes.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JENA-LISA JONES: It is not about you, President Trump. I voted for you, but your behavior on this issue has been a national embarrassment.GRINGLAS: The House passed the legislation 427 to 1. And within a few hours, the Senate agreed to automatically advance the measure without a vote as soon as it arrives from the House, and that is expected sometime today.MARTÍNEZ: Four hundred twenty-seven to 1 sounds like unity, right?GRINGLAS: I mean, on paper, sure, but it's clear that many Democrats and Republicans are looking at this fight through different lenses. Just listen to House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer of Kentucky.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JAMES COMER: Democrats have chosen to manufacture yet another anti-Trump hoax instead of pursuing justice.GRINGLAS: And compare that to his Democratic counterpart on that committee, Robert Garcia of California.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ROBERT GARCIA: Trump has the power to release the files today. He does not even need a vote. What is Donald Trump hiding?MARTÍNEZ: So, Sam, the debate over the files - I think it's still a couple of steps to go before we get any resolution.GRINGLAS: The materials have to be made public within 30 days of Trump signing the bill. Depending on what comes out, that could fuel new conflicts. Trump, for example, has pledged to focus on Democrats whose names might come up. And depending on what the Justice Department redacts, that could spark even more questions.MARTÍNEZ: All right. NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas. Thanks a lot.GRINGLAS: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

On Wednesday, President Trump signed the legislation directing the Department of Justice to release those files.\n                \n                    Mehmet Eser/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mehmet Eser/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   New releases from Jeffrey Epstein's estate shine additional light on the array of powerful figures who kept ties to the disgraced financier after his criminal charges came to light.   Spread throughout the roughly 23,000 documents released by the House Oversight Committee last week, emails and texts show Epstein courted prominent politicos from both sides of the aisle, impressed academics and used his connections to push back on negative stories about his alleged crimes.   Epstein's career as a wealthy financier who gave money to universities and other causes put him in many elite circles.   Those circles did not entirely close to him after he pleaded guilty to state charges of solicitation of prostitution and of solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18 in 2008.   \n   Reading through the text messages and emails released, the people who consulted with Epstein rarely acknowledged the severity of the crimes that required him to register as a sex offender, though simply corresponding with Epstein does not implicate individuals in his criminal activities, convicted or accused.   \n   There's an apparent letter of recommendation for Epstein from linguist Noam Chomsky, calling him a \"highly valued friend,\" that recalled how Epstein connected him with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak — another frequent Epstein correspondent.   \"Jeffrey constantly raises searching questions and puts forth provocative ideas, which have repeatedly led me to rethink crucial issues,\" the letter reads.   There's advice Epstein gave to Steve Bannon, Trump's former strategist, about ways to build a far-right political movement overseas.   \"If you are going to play here, you'll have to spend time, [E]urope by remote doesn't work,\" Epstein wrote in 2018. \"Lots and lots of face time and hand holding. Europe can be a wife not a mistress.\"   Former Harvard University president and onetime Treasury Secretary Larry Summers is documented numerous times having intimate personal chats with Epstein, including asking for romantic advice and joking about women's intelligence.   \"I yipped about inclusion,\" wrote Summers in 2017. \"I observed that half the IQ [in the] world was possessed by women without mentioning they are more than 51 percent of population....\"   \n   Summers resigned as Harvard's president in 2006 after arguing that women may be innately less capable in math and science.   \n   In the week since the latest Epstein emails release, he has resigned from the board of OpenAI and abruptly left his teaching role at Harvard, as the university announced a probe of \"information concerning individuals at Harvard included in the newly released Jeffrey Epstein documents to evaluate what actions may be warranted.\"   Summers isn't the only high-profile Democrat who found themself in varying degrees of Epstein's orbit. Kathryn Ruemmler, former White House counsel in the Obama administration and current chief legal officer for Goldman Sachs, messaged with Epstein before and during Trump's first term.   \"Trump is living proof of the adage that it is better to be lucky than smart,\" she wrote in August 2015.   \"I regret ever knowing Jeffrey Epstein,\" Ruemmler told The Wall Street Journal in 2023.   More than a thousand mentions of Trump   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A protester holds a sign related to the release of the Jeffrey Epstein case files outside the Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Nov.12. President Trump signed the congressional legislation that directs the Department of Justice to release the files late Wednesday evening.\n                \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Trump promised to release the Epstein files on the campaign trail but largely stonewalled the effort this year since he returned to office, frequently calling the push for more transparency around the Epstein case a \"hoax\" perpetrated by Democrats.   In a Wednesday Truth Social post announcing the signing of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, Trump said Democrats were using the issue to distract from what he says are victories for his administration.   \"Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\" he posted.   The president has the authority to release the files without congressional action.   Trump is a frequent subject of emails and text messages in the latest file tranche — well over a thousand different mentions — though mainly the subject of Epstein's near-obsession with his presidency, as the latter positioned himself as a Trump whisperer of sorts to his powerful associates.   \n   This week, after an abrupt reversal that led to the near-unanimous approval of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the president has now called for Democrats mentioned in Epstein's communications to be investigated by the Justice Department.   \"I will be asking A.G. Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.   Other Republicans are going on the offensive too — highlighting revelations that Epstein was texting Democratic Del. Stacey Plaskett of the U.S. Virgin Islands during a House Oversight Committee hearing with Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen in 2019.   Comparing the newly released messages with the video of the hearing, minutes after Epstein suggested Plaskett ask Cohen things about the Trump Organization, Plaskett posed similar questions.   An effort to censure Plaskett in the House failed Tuesday. In a floor speech, Plaskett defended her actions as receiving information from a constituent and said it was \"not public knowledge at that time that he was under federal investigation.\"   Amid the partisan finger-pointing around the Epstein files, some of Epstein's accusers are imploring the president not to make things partisan and focus on the other powerful people that they say haven't faced scrutiny — regardless of political party.   What's next for the government's Epstein files?   Within 30 days of Trump signing the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the attorney general is supposed to make \"all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" available in a searchable and downloadable format.   That includes information that relates to Epstein, his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell and \"individuals named or referenced in connection with Epstein's criminal activities.\"   There's also a focus on information regarding plea deals and decisions not to charge Epstein for other alleged crimes, as well as documents pertaining to his 2019 death by suicide in federal custody.   \n   Over the summer, the FBI put out a memo that said their files include \"a significant amount of material, including more than 300 gigabytes of data and physical evidence.\"   Some of that includes photos and videos of Epstein's accusers, including minors, and disturbing material that will not be made public. The bill from Congress also says anything \"that would jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution\" can be withheld or redacted, too.   With Trump's ordering of the investigation into Democrats and financial institutions mentioned in the Epstein correspondence, it is unclear how much of the Justice Department's files will be released, to what extent they will be redacted and when they ultimately will be made public.\n",

Now that the bill has been signed by the president, there's a 30-day countdown for the Justice Department to produce what's commonly known as the Epstein files.   \"This bill is a command for the president to be fully transparent, to come fully clean, and to provide full honesty to the American people,\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Wednesday.   \n   Schumer added that Democrats were ready to push back if they perceive that the president is doing anything but adhering to \"full transparency.\"   In a social media post Wednesday as he announced he had signed the bill, Trump wrote, \"Democrats have used the 'Epstein' issue, which affects them far more than the Republican Party, in order to try and distract from our AMAZING Victories.\"   The swift, bipartisan work in Congress this week was a response to the growing public demand that the Epstein files be released, especially as attention focuses on his connections to global leaders including Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, who has already been stripped of his royal title as Prince Andrew over the matter, and many others.   There is plenty of public anticipation about what more the files could reveal. Yet the bill will most likely trigger a rarely seen baring of a sprawling federal investigation, also creating the potential for unintended consequences.   What does the bill do?   The bill compels Attorney General Pam Bondi to release essentially everything the Justice Department has collected over multiple federal investigations into Epstein, as well as his longtime confidante and girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for luring teenage girls for the disgraced financier. Those records total around 100,000 pages, according to a federal judge who has reviewed the case.   \n   It will also compel the Justice Department to produce all its internal communications on Epstein and his associates and his 2019 death in a Manhattan jail cell as he awaited charges for sexually abusing and trafficking dozens of teenage girls.   The legislation, however, exempts some parts of the case files. The bill's authors made sure to include that the Justice Department could withhold personally identifiable information of victims, child sexual abuse materials and information deemed by the administration to be classified for national defense or foreign policy.   \"We will continue to follow the law with maximum transparency while protecting victims,\" Bondi told a news conference Wednesday when asked about releasing the files.   \n   The bill also allows the Justice Department to withhold information that would jeopardize active investigations or prosecutions. That's created some worry among the bill's proponents that the department would open active investigations into people named in the Epstein files in order to shield that material from public view.   Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a longtime Trump loyalist who has had a prominent split with Trump over the bill, said Tuesday that she saw the administration's compliance with the bill as its \"real test.\"   \"Will the Department of Justice release the files, or will it all remain tied up in investigations?\" she asked.   In July, the FBI said in a memo regarding the Epstein investigation that, \"we did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\" But Bondi last week complied with Trump's demands and ordered a federal prosecutor to investigate Epstein's ties to the president's political foes, including Clinton.   Still, Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who sponsored the bill, said \"there's no way they can have enough investigations to cover\" all of the people he believes are implicated in Epstein's abuse.   \"And if they do, then good,\" he added.   \n   The bill also requires the Justice Department to produce reports on what materials it withheld, as well as redactions made, within 15 days of the release of the files. It stipulates that officials can't withhold or redact anything \"on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.\"   Who could be named?   There's a widely held expectation that many people could be named in case files for investigations that spanned over a decade — and some concern that just because someone is named, that person would be assumed guilty or complicit.   Epstein was a luminary who kept company with heads of state, influential political figures, academics and billionaires. The release of his emails and messages by a House Oversight Committee investigation last week has already shown his connections with — and private conversations about — Trump and many other high-powered figures.   Yet federal prosecutors follow carefully constructed guidelines about what information they produce publicly and at trial, both to protect victims and to uphold the fairness of the legal system. House Speaker Mike Johnson raised objections to the bill on those grounds this week, arguing that it could reveal unwanted information on victims as well as others who were in contact with investigators.   Still, Johnson did not actually try to make changes to the bill and voted for it on the House floor.   For the bill's proponents, a public reckoning over the investigation is precisely the point. Some of the survivors of trafficking from Epstein and Maxwell have sought ways to name people they accuse of being complicit or involved, but fear they will face lawsuits from the men they accuse.   Massie said that he wants the FBI to release the reports from its interviews with the victims.   Those reports typically contain unvetted information, but Massie said he is determined to name those who are accused. He and Greene have offered to read the names of those accused on the House floor, which would shield their speech from legal consequences. \"We need names,\" Massie said.\n",

    "body": "\n      Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire reacts after both chambers of Congress moved to force the Justice Department to release its files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire is among the many Democrats who had been pressing for a vote so Epstein's victims could have, quote, \"answers, accountability and the truth.\" And she joins me now. Good morning, Senator.MAGGIE HASSAN: Good morning, Leila. Thanks for having me.FADEL: Thank you for being here. Does the passage of this bill satisfy your calls for greater transparency?HASSAN: Well, it's certainly a beginning, and it's long overdue. The president needs to sign this into law. But I think what's really important to be thinking about today is the pain that the survivors and victims have suffered at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. I hope that the president's signature will mean that there is a prompt release of the files, and that that can bring some accountability and some closure. I just finished the memoir of Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein and Maxwell's victims...FADEL: Yeah.HASSAN: ...And it is really clear that without their voices, without their strength and bravery, which required that they relive pain over and over and over again, this wouldn't have happened. It's also a really important example, I think, to all Americans, about the difference you can make when you speak up and are persistent in the cause of this kind of justice and accountability.FADEL: Do you have any concern that if this bill is signed into law, for some reason, the Justice Department won't release the files? We heard Republican Congressman Thomas Massie, who, as you know, has long backed the releasing of these files, say he's worried that President Trump's demand for a Justice Department investigation into Democrats with Epstein ties will be used to prevent the release of the documents.HASSAN: Well, I certainly understand that concern, but what I hope is that the Trump administration has received the message loudly and clearly that there was unanimous passage of this bill in Congress, that the people of the United States are united in wanting answers here, that this long history of treating Epstein and Maxwell as a special class of people needs to end. And I think, you know, I'm hopeful that they will understand that the pressure from the American people and particularly from survivors and victims of Epstein and Maxwell is not going to subside simply because he signs a bill. He's going to have to follow through. The Justice Department is going to have to follow through here.FADEL: The bill passed with unanimous consent, as you mentioned in the Senate. The lone holdout in the House was Louisiana Republican Clay Higgins, who said he voted no on principle. In his words, quote, \"it abandons 250 years of criminal justice procedure in America.\" And we also heard House Speaker Mike Johnson - who did vote for it - say he was upset that what passed the Senate didn't include changes that he'd wanted, things like victim and whistleblower name protections. How would you respond to those concerns?HASSAN: Well, first of all, the legislation provides for privacy protections for victims and survivors. But let's also just think this through for a minute. Two hundred and fifty years of criminal justice procedure and law has also shielded abusers of children and women and people who traffic them. And the victims and survivors, in this case, have been unbelievably brave. They're the ones who have been calling for the release of these files for transparency, and they understand how important it is for people to understand the horror, the physical pain, the psychological pain this and trauma that Epstein and Maxwell and people like them and people who participated in this trafficking and abuse caused. And, you know, this is a really important moment because women and girls are not invisible, and they should be listened to and have the same rights and be able to hold the powerful to account the same way everybody else can.FADEL: What do you say to the Republicans who voted for the release of these files, but also say Democrats are using this as a way to attack the president, versus go after - protect the victims or get justice for victims?HASSAN: Look, the victims and survivors are the people who are speaking up and wanting this transparency. This was a - of course, a campaign promise that President Trump made that he would release the files. It is, of course, one of many campaign promises that this president has broken. But what I think is really critical is for people to understand that Epstein and Maxwell had reached well beyond the United States. They attempted to intimidate these victims wherever they were around the world. In Virginia Giuffre's case, threatening her as she was living in Australia, trying to silence her. And I think it's really important for the truth to come out here. And again, for us to take a step forward to say, trafficking of girls and boys, sexual abuse of girls and boys and women and men is wrong. And we need to stand together as a country and address this horror.FADEL: Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire. Thank you for your time.HASSAN: Thank you.

    "body": "\n      The latest NPR, PBS News, Marist poll shows approval ratings tumbling for Republicans and low confidence in both major political parties.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Republicans are fighting to maintain control of Congress in next year's midterm elections. But results from a new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll out today may complicate that game plan. President Trump is at his lowest approval rating in years, and voters around the country have low confidence in both major political parties. Here to talk about what this could all mean for 2026 is NPR political reporter Elena Moore. Hi, Elena.ELENA MOORE, BYLINE: Hey there.CHANG: Hey. OK. So let's start with Trump. He obviously is not literally on the ballot next year, but this is his Republican party after all. So how does it seem Americans are feeling about his job performance almost a year in?MOORE: Well, it certainly doesn't help his party that Trump is losing ground with some Americans. He's got a 39% job approval rating among national adults, according to this latest poll. That's the lowest rating, Ailsa, since shortly after the attack on the Capitol on January 6. Plus, he's particularly struggling with independents - less than a quarter approve of his job performance in office.CHANG: Well, did you get any sense of what exactly voters want to see from Trump going forward?MOORE: More than half said he should prioritize lowering prices, and that includes 4 in 10 Republicans, by the way, like 26-year-old Jesse Green, a Trump voter in Lexington, Kentucky, who responded to NPR's survey. He told me he slightly disapproves of Trump's job performance so far and wanted to see him really address inflation by cutting federal spending.JESSE GREEN: I think he has done some good in some other areas. But I think when you get to the bottom line, if families cannot afford to own homes and raise families and have kids, that's going to have a significant detriment on the future of our country.MOORE: He worries about being able to afford those things himself, you know? But at the same time, he said, rising prices were already an issue before Trump's second term.CHANG: True. Well, what about Congress? Like, how does it seem Americans are viewing both parties heading into the midterms?MOORE: Well, a lot could change by November 2026, but currently, this poll finds that Democrats may have a leg up in their fight to retake power. We asked registered voters how they would vote on a generic congressional ballot if the election were held today, and Democrats hold a 14-point advantage compared to Republicans. That's the biggest advantage on this question in Marist polling since November 2017, before, you know, Democrats made gains in the 2018 midterms.CHANG: Interesting. OK. That seems like a pretty good sign for congressional Democrats, but they have challenges, too, right?MOORE: Yeah. National Democrats have been struggling for a long time, you know, with low approval ratings and a divided party. This poll, you know, shows that's still the case. Eighty percent of Republicans have confidence in the GOP. But Democrats - just 57% have confidence in their own party. Sixty-one-year-old Wayne Dowdy of Memphis, Tennessee - he calls himself a lapsed Democrat and told me that while he begrudgingly keeps voting blue, the party doesn't speak to him anymore.WAYNE DOWDY: They don't interact with working people, regardless of whether they work in an office or on a job site or working in a factory. They don't know how people like that live. They have no connection to real people.MOORE: He told me he's seen the party pay lip service to working folks, but it doesn't feel real to him.CHANG: OK. Well, Elena, we are about a year out from the midterms. What do you think listeners should even take away from this poll at this moment?MOORE: Well, we've seen in elections this year that when Democrats hone in on affordability, it does resonate. So I expect that to stay a priority. But on the other side of the aisle, they have a lot of work to do. A combined 6 in 10 blame congressional Republicans or Trump for the government shutdown. And even though the president has high support among Republican voters, I had multiple respondents tell me that, though they back Trump, it doesn't necessarily translate to lawmakers on Capitol Hill.CHANG: That is NPR's Elena Moore. Thank you, Elena.MOORE: Thanks, Ailsa.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

President Trump has decided that the U.S. will completely boycott the conference over what he considers the discriminatory treatment of Afrikaners by the South African government. They are the largest subset of the country's white minority, and Afrikaners ran South Africa's government for much of the 20th century and famously oversaw the racist system of apartheid until 1994.   Trump has repeated false claims that the South African government is stealing land from white farmers and that there is an ongoing \"white genocide\" and \"extermination\" of Afrikaners, even taking the unprecedented step of offering refugee status to Afrikaners who want to flee. The first 59 Afrikaner refugees arrived in the U.S. in May.   \n   South African officials — including President Cyril Ramaphosa — have said Trump's claims are untrue and point to official government data showing that attacks against rural Afrikaners are rare, and that the country's Black majority bear the brunt of South Africa's rampant crime.   \n   Lindie Koorts, a historian at the University of Pretoria, said the false narrative has strained some of the progress made in post-apartheid South Africa, as Afrikaners whose ancestors perpetrated apartheid adjust to being a political minority.   \"This is a minority that used to be protected by apartheid laws\" who now don't have the same job security and other economic benefits, said Koorts, who is an Afrikaner. \"It turns into something of existential dread, and that is very, very easily manipulated by the right wing.\"   Here's what to know about the history of the Afrikaners.   Who are Afrikaners?   Afrikaners descend from colonists of mostly Dutch but also German and French origin who landed on the tip of Africa in the 17th century. Many passed through the resupply station established by the Dutch East India Company in present-day Cape Town, an ideal midpoint along the sea routes between Europe and Asia.   Some Afrikaners later moved inland to form large farming colonies as their population grew on the continent. They also became known as Boers, which translates to \"farmers.\"   \n   Disputes between British colonists and the Boer settlers who spoke Afrikaans led to the Boer War, which occurred at the turn of the century. The British forces won, but Afrikaners remained the majority of South Africa's white population after the war and gained control of South Africa's government in the early 20th century.   In 1948, the Afrikaner-led government began to implement apartheid, a system of institutionalized racial segregation that benefited whites. Black people and other non-white South Africans were displaced and dispossessed. Apartheid ended in 1994 with the formation of a new, democratic government led by anti-apartheid activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Nelson Mandela.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                In a joint 1990 press conference, former South African President F.W. de Klerk shakes hands with anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela, who would become the first democratically elected South African president after apartheid.\n                \n                    Rashid Lombard/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Rashid Lombard/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Apartheid helped consolidate wealth among several generations of South Africa's white minority, but its fall stripped them of their political power and has shifted race relations in the country, said Daniel Magaziner, a professor of African history at Yale University.   \"Afrikaners — as white people — do quite well since 1994, but they do lose their political privileges, and so there is a rise in a sense of grievance and nostalgia for what has been lost since they lost their political control over the territory,\" he said.   Magaziner said there remains in South Africa a strong cultural association of Afrikaners with farming, even though most Afrikaners now live in the suburbs or urban areas.   \"But this idea that they're being targeted on farms is something that has a very big afterlife and is one of the reasons the Trump administration claims that these are people worthy — uniquely worthy — of being granted refugee status,\" he said.   Some Afrikaners say they're facing discrimination   Some Afrikaners say they are at risk of having their land stripped away or even facing physical violence and death because they are white, a claim that's been widely disputed by other Afrikaners, South African officials and Ramaphosa.   Right-wing South African groups such as AfriForum have attacked a new federal land expropriation law, which replaces another law from the apartheid era. Critics say the new law lets the government take land from private citizens without compensation.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Afrikaner refugees from South Africa arrive at Dulles International Airport in Virginia on May 12.\n                \n                    Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Under the law, the government can only seize land without paying for it in limited circumstances, such as if the land is not in use. The government must also first attempt to strike a deal with the owner. Most commercial farmland in South Africa is still owned by the country's white minority, who make up about 8% of the population.   \n   AfriForum has also claimed there are widespread murders of white Afrikaner farmers, which it says law enforcement is doing too little to combat, though South Africa's government denies this. And the group has slammed politicians who've continued to sing the apartheid-era song, \"Kill the Boer,\" something Ramaphosa said does not represent the policy of the government.   AfriForum CEO Kallie Kriel told Newzroom Afrika that he wanted the South African government to condemn the song and recognize \"that we are seeing tortures that accompany these murders and declare it a priority crime.\"   \n   The claims have been boosted by some of Trump's allies in the U.S., including Elon Musk, who is from South Africa. In a dramatic Oval Office meeting in May, Trump surprised Ramaphosa with a video montage and news clippings showing what Trump claimed was widespread violence and discrimination against white farmers.   \"You do allow them to take land — when they take the land, they kill the white farmer, and when they kill the white farmer, nothing happens to them,\" Trump said to Ramaphosa, who immediately disputed it.   \n   This year the Trump administration began offering refugee status to Afrikaners, even as the administration cut the total number of refugees it would admit to an all-time low.   How South Africa is responding to claims of discrimination against whites   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump holds up a news article as he discusses what he claims is the widespread killing of white Afrikaners in South Africa, during an Oval Office meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in May. South African officials say the claims are false.\n                \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Ramaphosa and other South African officials say attacks on farming communities are rare. National police data shows that there were six murders on farms in South Africa during the first three months of this year.   Most crime victims in South Africa are Black — not white — officials say. Of the six farm murders from January to March, five of the victims were Black and one was white. South Africa's police minister said earlier this year that farm murders have a history of being \"distorted and reported in an unbalanced way.\"   Many Afrikaners have also disputed the idea that they're being persecuted. A number of Afrikaner journalists, professors and others signed a public petition, saying they rejected the idea that Afrikaners were \"victims of racial persecution in post-apartheid South Africa\" and didn't want to be \"pawns\" for American politicians.   \n   The group said South Africans of all races were facing a slew of problems. \"To cherry-pick white suffering and elevate it above others is dishonest and harmful,\" the petition reads. \"It feeds extremist ideologies that perpetuate division and have inspired real-world violence, including mass shootings.\"   Koorts, one of the signatories, said the allegations of a \"white genocide\" are not true and that Afrikaners have had to do a lot of work to reckon with the violent and racist history of apartheid.   \"What we now see is our story being taken out of context, being twisted for an American audience to make Americans fearful of multiculturalism, of multiracialism, of making Americans fearful of essentially becoming a white minority,\" she said. \"Don't. Please don't. That is not our story. That is a twisted version of our story.\"\n",

    "body": "\n    TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Today, we're going to talk about FBI director Kash Patel with Marc Fisher, who profiles Patel on the current issue of The New Yorker. It's titled \"Kash Patel's Acts Of Service.\" It's subtitled, \"The F.B.I. Director Isn't Just Enforcing The President's Agenda At The Bureau - He's Seeking Retribution For Its Past Investigations Of Donald Trump.\" Fisher also writes about other controversies surrounding Patel, ranging from whether he's even qualified for the job to his conflicts of interest and how he's transforming the FBI's mission as he focuses on cracking down on undocumented immigrants. Journalist Marc Fisher was a longtime writer and editor at The Washington Post and co-author of the book \"Trump Revealed\" before becoming a New Yorker contributor. We recorded our interview yesterday morning before both the House and the Senate approved the release of the Epstein files. Start with an excerpt of what Patel had to say about the Epstein files when he testified before the House Judiciary Committee last September. Here he is being questioned by California Democrat Eric Swalwell.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ERIC SWALWELL: You said you don't know the number of times Trump's name appears in the files, so it could at least be 1,000 times, is that right?KASH PATEL: The number is a total misleading factor.SWALWELL: But the number would at least be a thousand times.PATEL: We have not released anyone's...SWALWELL: But it would at least be a thousand times.PATEL: ...File that has not been credible. And we have...SWALWELL: Director, could it at least be a thousand times?PATEL: ...Released every piece of legally permissible information.SWALWELL: OK, so...PATEL: You can characterize the numbers however you want it.SWALWELL: Reclaiming my time, Director. It sounds like if you don't know the number, it could at least be a thousand times, which leads me...PATEL: It's not. It's not.SWALWELL: Is it at least 500 times?PATEL: No.SWALWELL: Is it at least a hundred times?PATEL: No.SWALWELL: Then what's the number?PATEL: I don't know the number, but it's not that.SWALWELL: Do you think it might be your job to know the number?PATEL: My job is to provide for the safety and security of this country. My job is not to engage in political innuendo...SWALWELL: And that includes protecting section...PATEL: ...So you can go out to the sticks and get your 20-second hit in your fundraising article.SWALWELL: So reclaiming my time, Director...PATEL: Keep going reclaiming your time because...SWALWELL: Director...PATEL: ...The people of California are being...SWALWELL: If Trump...PATEL: ...Underserved by your representations.SWALWELL: The president is not implicated. Why not release everything that involves Trump?PATEL: We have released everything the president and anyone else's side that is credible and lawfully be able to be released. Your fixation on this matter and baseless accusations that I'm hiding child pedophiles...SWALWELL: There's also Mr. Massie's...PATEL: ...Is disgusting.SWALWELL: ...Interests.PATEL: Anyone that says that needs to look at the stats alone and go back to the state of California, who's receiving the biggest surge in FBI resources...SWALWELL: So, Director...PATEL: ...Through my redeployment because the cities of Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco need it.SWALWELL: Reclaiming my time, Director. Remembering your oath to tell the truth, did you ever tell Donald Trump his name is in the files?PATEL: I have never spoken to President Trump about the Epstein files.SWALWELL: Did you ever tell the attorney general that Donald Trump's name is in the Epstein files?PATEL: The attorney general and I have had numerous discussions about the entirety of the Epstein files and the reviews conducted by our teams.SWALWELL: Did you tell the attorney general that Donald Trump's name is in the Epstein files?PATEL: And we have released where President Trump's name is in the attorney's file.SWALWELL: It's a simple question. Did you tell the attorney general that the president's name is in the Epstein files?PATEL: During many conversations that the attorney general and I have had on the matter of Epstein, we have reviewed painstakingly...SWALWELL: The question is simple.PATEL: ...Who can...SWALWELL: Did you tellPATEL: ...The...SWALWELL: ...the attorney general that Donald Trump's name is in the Epstein files? Yes or no?PATEL: Why don't you try spelling it out, if you're going to mock me.SWALWELL: Yes or no, Director?PATEL: Use the alphabet.SWALWELL: Yes or no?PATEL: No. A, B, C, D, E, F. Don't want to do it.SWALWELL: Director, it sounds like you don't want to tell us. Did you tell the attorney general that Donald Trump's name was in the Epstein files?PATEL: Why don't you try serving your...SWALWELL: Director, did you tell...PATEL: ...Constituency by focusing on reducing...SWALWELL: ...The attorney general Donald Trump...PATEL: ...Violent crime in this country and the number of pedophilesSWALWELL: Director...PATEL: ...That are illegally...SWALWELL: Reclaiming my time, Director.PATEL: ...Harbored in your sanctuary cities in California.SWALWELL: Director, reclaiming my time...PATEL: I'll work with you on that.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Regular order, Mr. Chairman.PATEL: Do you want to work with us on that?JIM JORDAN: Time belongs to the gentleman from California.SWALWELL: Did you tell the attorney general that Donald Trump's name is in the Epstein files?PATEL: The question has been asked and answered.SWALWELL: You have not answered it, and we will take your evasiveness as a consciousness of guilt.GROSS: Mark Fisher, welcome to FRESH AIR. Your profile of Kash Patel was very informative and very interesting. What was your reaction when you first heard Swalwell questioning Kash Patel?MARC FISHER: Well, this came amid a whole bunch of such confrontations between Patel and both House and Senate members, and it was pretty wild. It was one of the classic ways in which Kash Patel, very much like Donald Trump, values the show above almost all else. And this is one of the reasons Patel is one of Trump's favorites. One of the reasons Patel is in this job is his ability to commandeer the moment, to put on a big show, to present himself as aggrieved and to present himself as an advocate for all those Americans who feel aggrieved.GROSS: Have you ever heard an FBI director dodge questions in such a confrontational way?FISHER: No, we've never seen any FBI director like Kash Patel before. We've never seen someone who looks like Kash Patel. The previous FBI directors were all sort of clean-cut, conservatively dressed, very proper...GROSS: White men.FISHER: White men, all of them. And Kash Patel is not any of those things. So we haven't seen this kind of approach before. We haven't seen this kind of antagonism before. And we haven't seen this lack of experience before, lack of familiarity with what the FBI does. There is in Kash Patel's background every reason to see why Donald Trump wanted him in that job and every reason to understand why so many people within the Bureau believe he is ill-suited for the position and that he's doing significant and enduring damage to the bureau.GROSS: So Benny Johnson, who's a far-right commentator and podcaster, was interviewing Kash Patel, and he asked him why the FBI was protecting the world's foremost predators by refusing to release the names on the list. And Patel said, simple, because of who's on that list. That sounds contradictory to what we just heard.FISHER: Right. So that conversation with Benny Johnson took place a couple of years ago at a point when Kash Patel was on the outside and was agitating for the administration, then the Biden administration, to release this purported client list that Jeffrey Epstein is supposed to have kept. Now-FBI Director Patel has a very different set of facts that he would like people to believe, and that is that there is no client list, never was. And Patel, who had certainly entertained the idea that there was some conspiracy behind Epstein's death before Patel came to the FBI, now that he is the director, now that he's had the opportunity to read the files, he has concluded that this was absolutely a suicide, that there's no evidence to the contrary. There was no hanky-panky. Donald Trump's presence in the Epstein files is minimal and benign.And so this almost complete reversal on Patel's part is bizarrely accompanied now by Kash Patel saying, how can you not believe me? He gets indignant when people question him about this, including members of Congress. And so Patel says, I am the guy who was pushing for all this stuff to be released when I was out of office. Now that I'm in office and I tell you there's nothing to be released, you need to believe me. And he seems, at least he acts, as if he's astonished that people don't take his word for it.GROSS: So let's briefly run through some of the things that Kash Patel has been in the news for in the past couple of weeks. So this week, he was in the news for giving his girlfriend, country music singer Alexis Wilkins, a security detail. Tell us briefly why that's unusual.FISHER: Well, none of the previous FBI directors had executive protection for their spouses, not for their wives and not for any girlfriends. And so it's very unusual for a director to request that kind of protection for someone who's not the director and who's not even the director's spouse. So why is this in the news? Because there are a lot of people within the FBI who find these kinds of requests, these kinds of irregularities, not just unseemly, but a waste of resources. So whether it's providing protection for his girlfriend or providing the director with jet service on the Bureau's jet to take him to various forms of entertainment - hockey games, casino jaunts to Las Vegas, visits to that girlfriend in Nashville, all of this - it comes at great expense to the taxpayer and is seen by a lot of people in the Bureau as a waste of resources.GROSS: Patel, in response, says he's been paying back the government for these trips.FISHER: Yes. He pays the government back, or so he says, at the commercial rate - the rate that you and I would pay to fly to Nashville, which is dramatically less than it costs the Bureau to stand up their GV jet and whisk the director wherever he wants to go for that weekend's entertainment.GROSS: Last week, Patel exempted his deputy FBI director, Dan Bongino, and two other new senior FBI officials who were just recently hired from passing polygraph tests. And keeping in mind that Dan Bongino has access to the top government secrets as deputy FBI director, how unusual is it for the deputy FBI director to be exempted from a polygraph test, which I think everybody in the FBI has to pass?FISHER: Yeah. The FBI has used polygraph tests for decades as just kind of a routine check on basic security questions that everybody has to pass to have access to the kind of secure information that the FBI traffics in. So obviously, since that's the case for special agents across the country, it's equally the case for the people running the FBI, such as the deputy director, Dan Bongino.So why was Bongino given this exemption? That's gone unstated by the FBI. The assumption among many current and former agents is that he flunked a polygraph or had reason to flunk a polygraph and, therefore, was allowed to skip it. This is something that does not sit well with others in the FBI because they want to be able to trust the people around them, particularly the people above them, but their colleagues as well. And one thing that gives them that sense of trust is they know everybody's passed the same security hurdles. And when the No. 2 in the agency gets a bye on that, that causes a lot of unhappiness in the ranks.GROSS: And while we're on the subject of Dan Bongino, Patel had said that he'd appoint someone with FBI experience to be his deputy director. But Dan Bongino had no experience and no experience at the FBI at all, and of course, neither did Patel when Trump appointed him. Bongino had been a Secret Service agent, podcaster and Fox News commentator.FISHER: Yes. That's exactly right. Bongino was somebody who was known to the president as somebody who did very well on Fox News, who appeared frequently on Fox News. And in the president's mind, the people running the FBI ought to be folks who are well known to the public and who make the president's case very avidly, very effectively. And Bongino is seen as a tough guy. Trump loves tough guys. He loves guys who seem like stand-up, aggressive advocates for the MAGA movement, and Bongino very much fit that bill.So looks the part. That's the No. 1 qualification, frequently, in Trump's mind. And Bongino fit that part in a way that perhaps Kash Patel didn't. Patel was, in the president's mind, the ultimate loyalist, someone he could absolutely trust. So this was a team that you could see the president really envisioning as complementary. And so the fact that neither of these guys had any experience in the FBI didn't seem to matter much.GROSS: Well, let's take a short break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Marc Fisher. He recently left The Washington Post, where he was a longtime writer and editor. He's also the author of the book \"Trump Revealed.\" And now he's a contributor to The New Yorker and has profiled Kash Patel in his new article, \"Kash Patel's Acts Of Service.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF LOUIS SCLAVIS' \"FETE FORAINE\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Marc Fisher, who profiles FBI Director Kash Patel in a new article in The New Yorker titled \"Kash Patel's Acts Of Service.\" And the subtitle is, the FBI director isn't just enforcing the president's agenda at the Bureau - he's seeking retribution for its past investigations of Donald Trump.So there are questions about how Patel got the position as head of the FBI and whether he had the necessary experience and credentials. What position had he held compared to what FBI directors typically have?FISHER: FBI directors in the past have generally had long careers in criminal justice. There have been judges. There have been prosecutors, people who served as U.S. attorneys, running some of the largest U.S. attorneys' offices in the country, whether that be in New York or elsewhere. They are people who have come up through the system and have long histories of public service.And so Kash Patel has some of that. Kash Patel indeed has been a public servant his entire life. He's never worked for anyone but the government, except for some small businesses that he started on his own between the two Trump administrations. Patel, however, never had that kind of long-standing experience with the FBI directly, with - he did serve in the Justice Department in the first Trump administration. He was on the national security side of the Justice Department, and he worked on some counterterrorism cases. That's something that the FBI also does. But he didn't have the experience that his predecessors had in running an agency or in the sort of street crime that the G-men of the FBI have always been known for in the public imagination.So there were a lot of people within the Bureau who were very concerned that he would be coming in without the knowledge base, without the years of experience that would tell him how the FBI works, how its relationship with the Justice Department operates. So there was concern about his relative inexperience. Beyond that, I think there was a lot of concern that he was coming in as essentially a tool of Donald Trump - essentially someone who was going to be sort of forwarding the president's political agenda rather than sort of fighting for the men and women of the FBI.GROSS: The subtitle of your piece about Patel in The New Yorker is, \"The F.B.I. Director Isn't Just Enforcing The President's Agenda At The Bureau - He's Seeking Retribution For Its Past Investigations Of Donald Trump.\" So in his memoir, in Patel's memoir, he had his list of, quote, government gangsters. Eric Swalwell, who we heard questioning Patel, was on that list. Who has he been seeking retribution against, and what for?FISHER: Almost from the first day that Kash Patel took over the FBI, he has had as one of his top or perhaps his very top agenda item the calling-out and the investigation of people who the president sees as his enemies - people who the president sees as having investigated Trump himself, the folks who were involved in prosecuting Trump for his taking classified documents down to Mar-a-Lago in Florida when he left after his first administration, the people who prosecuted him on all of the various other things that he was convicted of, financial misdeeds and so on.So there's a long list of Trump enemies who Trump has talked about during his out years, the four years of the Biden administration. And Kash Patel came into office with that list and with his own list - what he calls his list of government gangsters. He wrote a whole book laying out who those people were, and it was accompanied by a list of at least 60 people who he saw as Trump's enemies and therefore as Patel's enemies. And so he has methodically gone through that list, already begun the process of coming up with evidence and seeking indictments of people like the former FBI director, James Comey, like other top officials of the FBI who were involved in the Russiagate investigation. All of these investigations that characterized Trump's first term - these are now the people who are - have targets on their backs.And as Patel has now told several people at the FBI, he sees it as his job to go after the people who the president wants prosecuted. The president has not forgotten. That's the line that Patel has used over and over again to explain why he's going after some of these people. It's ironic, of course, because Patel has staked his entire directorship on the idea that everyone who came before him had weaponized the FBI, weaponized the Justice Department for their own political purposes. And yet now he stands accused of exactly the same infraction - of going after people, using the power of the FBI to go after political opponents.GROSS: So not only did Patel have former FBI Director Jim Comey indicted. He fired an agent for refusing to stage a perp walk for Comey.FISHER: Yes. That's right. So Patel has fired, by various accounts, dozens of agents for various infractions, most of which he doesn't detail in any sort of way. But the reporting that I did, as well as other news organizations have done, has brought out the fact that Patel has fired agents for things such as having a gay pride flag at their desk or, as you mentioned, refusing to stage the classic perp walk in which the purported criminal is paraded before the cameras, in this case being the former FBI director himself, Jim Comey.So there is - in the minds of many FBI agents, there's this view of Kash Patel as someone who is vindictive on behalf of Trump and vindictive in ways that seem at least on the surface to be superficially just cruelty for cruelty's sake, compounded by the fact that Patel has told people within the Bureau that he would not fire many of these agents if it were solely up to him - that he's getting direction from the White House, direction from the Justice Department and that he is firing a number of these agents on the president's say-so or to please the president, rather than because Patel himself believes that the agent has done anything wrong.GROSS: Well, let's take another short break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Marc Fisher. And he profiles FBI Director Kash Patel in a new article in The New Yorker that's titled \"Kash Patel's Acts Of Service,\" subtitled, the FBI director isn't just enforcing the president's agenda at the Bureau - he's seeking retribution for its past investigations of Donald Trump. We'll be right back after a short break. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF JESSICA WILLIAMS' \"KID STUFF\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Marc Fisher, who has a new profile of FBI Director Kash Patel in The New Yorker, where Fisher is a contributor. He recently left The Washington Post, where he was a longtime writer and editor. He's also the author of the book \"Trump Revealed,\" a biography of the president.You write in your profile of Kash Patel that he has promoted several conspiracy theories. I want to play a clip, and this is something that you quote in your profile. This is an excerpt of him as a guest on Joe Rogan's podcast on June 6 of this year. And this is Kash Patel describing a conspiracy theory relating to China and fentanyl.(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE JOE ROGAN EXPERIENCE\")PATEL: You don't hear of fentanyl deaths in China. You don't hear of fentanyl deaths in India. You don't really hear of fentanyl deaths in England, Australia, New Zealand - our Five Eyes partners - and Canada. The Chinese, in my opinion, the CCP, have used it as a directed approach because we are their adversary. And they don't like us, and we don't like what they're doing when it comes to fentanyl. And their long-term game is this. How do I - in my opinion - kneecap the United States of America, our largest adversary? Well, why don't we go and take out generations of young men and women who might grow up to serve in the United States military or become a cop or become a teacher? And that's what they're doing when you wipe out tens of thousands of Americans a year. It's a long-term plan for them.JOE ROGAN: Whoa. That is such a dark, dark thing.PATEL: It is, but we got - we're on it.GROSS: So that was Kash Patel on Joe Rogan's podcast on June 6 of this year. I hadn't heard that one before. Had you?FISHER: No. That was a new one on me. But he's got a bunch of them, and he's got a whole book of them in his book \"Government Gangsters.\" There came a moment in that very same interview between Rogan and Patel where Rogan was almost teasing Patel about the fact that he's prone to these conspiracy theories and that he sees the government and the press and politicians as part of this cabal that is out to undermine Trump and undermine the MAGA movement. And Rogan kind of poked him and said, we love conspiracies, don't we? They're exciting. And Patel kind of laughed and said, yeah. They're our thing.GROSS: Do you see any connection between this China conspiracy theory and Trump's threats to attack Venezuela and sending warships close to there? Do you see a connection?FISHER: There's a certain constancy to the way in which Trump and Patel think, the way in which they tell stories about their administration's actions. They both are given to dramatic tellings of somewhat fanciful notions about what our enemies are up to and what is motivating them, and they both jump off from some actual facts. Fentanyl is obviously a scourge. It's obviously an enormous problem. It comes in from Mexico, but its component parts are frequently manufactured in China, so there's a legitimate issue there. It's a legitimate crime-fighting imperative for the FBI. That's the fact part.And then we get into the fanciful. As we hear Patel spin out his notion of why this might be happening, it's very reminiscent of the way Donald Trump frequently portrays issues not just in Venezuela, but around the world, where he sees or is told about some situation, presents the germ of the facts and then extrapolates from there, exaggerates and throws in numbers that can't quite be verified and so on. It all boils down to the show. Both Trump and Patel, very similar personalities in certain important ways, one of which is that they think of every day in their job as the next act in a long-running show that needs new juice to zap them into the headlines for that day.GROSS: What are some of the other conspiracy theories that Patel has promoted?FISHER: So Kash Patel, as he's admitted, is given to conspiratorial notions. He sees conspiracies in fact patterns. And obviously, you want any crime fighter to look for patterns in the facts that they are assembling, but in Kash Patel's case, it often goes a bit beyond the available facts. So, for example, Patel has believed for many years now that he is a target of a media conspiracy to portray him in a dark light and to make up things about him. And so he has sued a series of news organizations, claiming that they have defamed him. He sued The New York Times. He sued CNN. He sued Politico. In every case, he got a big splash in the news, and in every case, he ended up withdrawing the suit or seeing it thrown out by a judge.In the case of the January 6 assault on the Capitol, Kash Patel has for a couple of years been presenting the theory that the FBI itself had recruited operatives of one sort or another who were in the crowd on January 6, and who were perhaps encouraging the rioters to be more aggressive in their attack on the Capitol. He's never presented the slightest evidence for this, and yet he continues to present this idea. Even as director of the FBI, he has said that there may have been such people and they may have very much egged on the crowd on January 6, sort of portraying the January 6 attack almost as an inside job.GROSS: So since Trump was president on January 6 - I mean, he was about to leave the White House, but he was president then. If it was an inside job in the sense that the FBI sent people into militias to urge them to be more aggressive and even violent, why isn't that a Trump administration problem? The FBI director at this time was somebody appointed by President Trump.FISHER: Yes. This - it's absolutely right. The January 6 attack took place at the very tail end of the first Trump administration. So if, as Patel theorizes, the FBI in 2020 and the first days of 2021 was using its own confidential sources and placing those sources within the militia groups that were plotting the January 6 attack, it's perfectly reasonable to ask, does that mean that the first Trump administration was in some regard responsible for the attack? This is an aspect of this conspiracy theory that Kash Patel somehow never gets around to talking about. He sees the FBI as kind of a rogue operation. And it - so it fits in with his overall theory of this deep state that is the real governing factor in the United States, and this deep state doing its own thing, seeding these sources into the January 6 attack groups without perhaps the knowledge of Trump and the Trump administration.And, you know, the FBI did have some contacts who were, from time to time, inside some of the militia groups. So were they there for the purpose of encouraging those groups to take this more violent approach on January 6? No evidence has been presented along those lines, and yet it's been years now that he's been pushing this theory and saying that once he got inside, he would reveal the evidence. Well, nothing's been revealed.GROSS: After Trump was indicted in 2023 for secretly storing classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, Patel said, when you're president and you leave, you can take whatever you want. And when you take it, whether it's classified or not, it's now not.FISHER: I believe that the president said it first, but Kash Patel quickly adopted this idea that everything that was at Mar-a-Lago was there legally simply because the president had taken it there. This is completely contrary to the law. In 1978, Congress passed the Presidential Records Act. And that prohibits former presidents from taking any official records - whether they were classified or not - from taking them with them when they left office.Well, Trump brought a lot of those things down to Mar-a-Lago. And Patel has said several times, when he worked in the White House in the first Trump administration, that he watched the president declassify documents so that he could take them with him to Florida. So since Patel had said this in various public settings, he was then summoned to testify by prosecutors, to testify before a grand jury about, OK, what did you see? Which documents were they, and what did the president do when he was declassifying them? Well, he gets to the grand jury. And all of a sudden, Patel is taking the Fifth Amendment, saying that he's not going to answer any questions because he has this right against self-incrimination. So the prosecutor said, well, OK. We'll get you immunity. So they went and got him immunity from the court, and Patel appeared a second time. And this time, he answered their questions.So flash-forward, and he's at his Senate confirmation hearing for becoming FBI director. And the senators say, OK. Tell us about this grand jury testimony where you talked about why and how the president made these documents OK to take to Mar-a-Lago. And again, Kash Patel said, no, can't do that, not allowed, because it was against the law. And as several senators noted, that is just false. You own your own words and you are allowed to divulge that testimony, which he did not do.GROSS: I think we need to take another break here, so let me reintroduce you. If you're just joining us, my guest is Marc Fisher, who profiles Kash Patel in the current issue of The New Yorker. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF JULIAN LAGE GROUP & JULIAN LAGE'S \"IOWA TAKEN\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday morning with Marc Fisher, who profiles FBI Director Kash Patel in the current issue of The New Yorker, where Fisher is a contributor. The article is titled \"Kash Patel's Acts Of Service.\"Patel has fired a whole lot of FBI agents. I don't know the number. And he reassigned a lot of the remaining agents to work on catching people who are in the U.S. illegally. So what are some of the FBI missions that have been canceled or understaffed as a result of the firings and the reassignments, or units that have been completely shut down?FISHER: It's really a thoroughgoing change that he's brought to the FBI. The FBI has about 13,000 agents, and about a quarter of them have been assigned to work on going out and catching undocumented immigrants. This has not generally been a major focus for the FBI. Hundreds more of agents have been sent on these missions, along with the National Guard, to do basic sort of crime patrols in cities like Washington, D.C., and Chicago. This is part of this emphasis on combating violent crime that President Trump began some months back.So what's not being done? Well, for example, Patel disbanded the public corruption unit in the Washington Field Office. This is the group that investigates wrongdoing by public officials, including - this is the office that investigated Trump and various other Republicans for trying to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. I was given one example after another by various agents in the FBI of cases, for example, of someone working on Chinese counterterrorism efforts in the United States. One such agent was pulled off a case to essentially do street patrol in the District of Columbia, doing DWI arrests. So it's a wholesale rejiggering of what agents are doing. It's resulting in a lot of people retiring early, retiring as soon as they're able to, and quite a number, as you said, who've been fired.GROSS: Also, Patel has lowered the standards for getting hired into the FBI. New agents no longer need a college degree, and now new agents have to take a polygraph test that includes loyalty to the FBI director.FISHER: Yeah. This is something that Patel has denied, but we've heard this from several agents who said they've been asked about their loyalty to Director Patel and to his own personal agenda. This is one of a number of ways in which a lot of FBI agents feel like the standards for being an agent have been lowered. For example, Patel has shortened the length of the FBI academy from 18 weeks to eight weeks of training, and he's no longer requiring all new agents to have a college degree. Many agents in the FBI have advanced degrees. And many of them have done specialized work in languages and so on to prepare themselves for the kind of international investigations that the bureau does so well. So it's really disappointing to a lot of the people who've devoted their lives to the bureau to see what they see as a watering down of those standards.GROSS: Patel has managed to cash in financially on being director of the FBI. Can you describe some of the ways he's cashed in?FISHER: Well, during his time between administrations - so between his time at the National Security Council and his time as head of the FBI - he spent those out years on a number of efforts to make a lot of money, and he did make a lot of money. Some of it was selling stuff very much in a Trump kind of model. He set up a website to sell his K$h-branded clothes that he had made, K and then dollar sign and then H. It was kind of a logo. He raised money for some of the January 6 defendants. He promoted dietary supplements that he claimed would undo the damage from the COVID-19 virus. He wrote three children's books called \"Plot Against The King.\" The main character of those children's books was a guy named Kash the wizard, who was the hero, and he led a battle on behalf of King Donald to find the bad guys who were scheming to elect Hillary Queenton on not Election Day, but Choosing Day. And so he was highly involved in all of these efforts to make some money and push Trump's agenda. The No. 1 thing that made Patel richer during those years was the work that he did through a consulting group that he set up where his clients included the government of the country of Qatar. That's a relationship that continues to this day, even as he's the FBI director.GROSS: Patel also had a charity called the Kash Foundation, which promised to make grants to those who have the courage to stand up to government wrongdoing. What did you learn about how the money raised was used?FISHER: Well, the Kash Foundation raised $1.3 million one year, and they spent something like $700,000 in expenses, but they only gave away $200,000. So out of the $1.3 million in revenue, only $200,000 went out in grants, mostly in cash assistance to about 50 people who are not named. So the idea here was to help people who were supposedly standing up against the deep state, against the government, but only $200,000 went to those folks. More than that went to one of Patel's own friends, a business partner of his who runs an advertising firm that was hired to do some promotion of the charity's operations. So all told, we're talking about millions of dollars that Patel gained during those out years between administrations from his various business ventures and his representation of a Chinese company and the government of Qatar, all of these entities that did a lot of business with the United States government.GROSS: And I should mention the Chinese company that he worked with is the company that owns, among other things, SHEIN, that fast fashion retailer. It's really popular in the U.S. because the prices are so cheap.FISHER: Sure. And SHEIN's subsidiary, which Patel worked for, had a board that included investors who were accused of having ties to the Chinese military and the Chinese Communist Party. So there have been some real questions about the ethics of that organization. And yet, Patel, when he took over as FBI director, said that he saw no need to divest his holdings in the Chinese companies.GROSS: So has he promised to recuse himself from any legal issues pertaining to companies that he has worked with and gotten paid by?FISHER: To the contrary, in the case of his work for Qatar, Patel, after he took over the FBI, got a waiver from the U.S. government that allows him to continue to handle matters related to the government of Qatar. You know, the FBI deals with all sorts of terrorism issues around the world. And so if anything comes up regarding Qatar, he will be allowed to continue to do that work even though he took in some undisclosed amount for consulting services to Qatar in the years before he became FBI director. We don't know the amount of money, exactly, that he got from Qatar because he never registered as a foreign agent, which the advocacy group Public Citizens says was a violation of federal rules.GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Marc Fisher, who profiles Kash Patel in the current issue of The New Yorker. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday morning with Marc Fisher, who profiles FBI director Kash Patel in the current issue of The New Yorker, where Fisher is a contributor. The article is titled \"Kash Patel's Acts Of Service.This is kind of like a strange fact. I'm not quite sure how to interpret it. One of the things that Patel proposed was to bring mixed martial arts fighters to help FBI agents with their conditioning. And he proposed this to the head of the UFC, the Ultimate Fighting Championship. You know, related to that is that Trump wants to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the United States by having a mixed martial arts fight on the White House lawn. So what does that say about Patel and the MMA? Is he a fan, or is this just out of loyalty to Trump, who's planning to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States by having an MMA fight?FISHER: I'm willing to give Kash Patel the benefit of the doubt and believe that he's a genuine fan of UFC. He seems to really enjoy it when he goes to the bouts. He went with Mel Gibson to that Vegas fight. And so Kash Patel's true sports love is ice hockey. He plays ice hockey. He is a huge fan. He's used a government jet to fly to an Islanders game up in New York. So when it comes to the UFC, I think we have a happy coincidence where Trump's love for that sport and Patel's dovetail nicely. They both have a strong desire to appeal to a core part of the MAGA constituency, the hyper-masculine world of MMA. And so there is a political aspect to this. But in general, I think they both also just love that scene.GROSS: What do FBI agents think of the idea of bringing in mixed martial arts fighters to help with FBI agents' conditioning?FISHER: I can't quite capture for you just how humiliated and upset many FBI agents are by what they see as a belittling of their serious training, their serious academic background. This is an agency where a lot of the FBI agents, while you might see them in TV dramas as essentially street cops in suits, this is an agency where many of them are lawyers, many of them have advanced degrees. These are people deeply schooled in the technology necessary to combat cybercrime today. And so when they see that their own director is talking about making them have training sessions with MMA fighters, they see this as belittling and insulting. There are some ways in which many FBI agents like the fact that Patel has steered the agency back toward what they see as basic crime fighting. But the overwhelming sentiment, I think, is that he has more than shaken up the bureau. He has gutted it.GROSS: Do you have any insights into the relationship between Trump and Patel now? You've said basically that Patel was hired not because of his experience as much as for his loyalty to Trump. So now that he's been in that position a while, has it affected the relationship between him and Trump and Trump's trust in Patel?FISHER: I think what I've heard from people inside the bureau is that the president has been frustrated by some of Patel's missteps, such as his premature announcement that the Bureau had found and captured the assassin of Charlie Kirk, a move that Patel then had to reverse just minutes later. So there is a sense in the White House that Patel has made too many mistakes. On the other hand, the president clearly values Patel's loyalty, clearly values the energy with which Patel is putting the president's agenda into motion. So there's no indication that he's in trouble right now, but there are some real doubts about his overall capacity.GROSS: Marc Fisher, thank you so much for talking with us.FISHER: My pleasure.GROSS: Marc Fisher's profile of Kash Patel is titled \"Kash Patel's Acts Of Service.\" It's published in the current issue of The Atlantic.

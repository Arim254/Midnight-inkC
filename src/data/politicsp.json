She spoke critically of the Trump administration both before and during the shutdown.\n                \n                    Maansi Srivastava/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Maansi Srivastava/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Jenna Norton, a program director at the National Institutes of Health, says she has been put on paid leave following the end of the government shutdown.   \"I was not given a reason for being put on leave, but I strongly suspect it is because I have been speaking up in my personal capacity about the harms that I have been witnessing inside the National Institutes of Health,\" she said in a video posted to TikTok.   The notice Norton received from human resources stated that the leave \"is not being done for any disciplinary purpose.\"   She is among a number of federal employees who have been openly critical of the Trump administration, both before and during the 43-day shutdown.   \n   Norton first spoke out in June, when she helped organize a call to action by hundreds of NIH scientists, pushing back against cuts and changes at the agency. They warned the Trump administration was politicizing research and canceling studies, putting the health of participants at risk.   In an interview with NPR in early October, Norton said she believed the Trump administration's deep funding and staffing cuts have created a situation inside NIH that is far worse than the public realizes.   \"I feel like I have this front row seat to the destruction of our democracy,\" she said. \"We are seeing it in real time with a president who is asking us to do things that are illegal and harmful to the American public.\"   The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIH, did not respond to NPR's questions about why Norton was placed on leave and instead issued a statement calling her a \"radical leftist\" who \"chooses to constantly criticize this administration, even when she is supposed to be working.\"   Norton responded on TikTok, saying \"If it is radically leftist to believe that NIH policies should not be actively harming research participants, then I will wear the radical left label proudly.\"   \n   Agriculture Department employee also on leave   On Thursday, the Federal Unionists Network, a coalition of former and current federal workers and union members, announced that an Agriculture Department employee who worked on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) had also been put on leave.   Ellen Mei, who also serves as president of National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) Chapter 255, received a notice of proposed termination on Oct. 3, a day after she raised concerns about SNAP cuts in an interview on MSNBC, according to the Federal Unionists Network.    \"I didn't leak secrets or share anything confidential,\" said Mei in a statement released by the group. \"I told the truth about what's happening to hungry families and the people who serve them. I took an oath to serve the public — not to stay quiet while our government turns its back on the American people.\"   \n   In a statement, a spokesperson for USDA told NPR that the department does not comment on individual personnel matters, adding: \"During a lapse in appropriations, furloughed USDA employees are not authorized to perform any official duties, including speaking on behalf of the Department.\"   MSNBC prefaced Mei's interview by stating that she was not representing the government, but speaking in her own capacity.   A right to speak on matters of public concern   Norton says she believes federal workers not only have a right but an obligation to speak publicly on matters of the public interest.   She points to a 1968 Supreme Court decision that found public employees can speak on matters of public concern as long as the speech doesn't disrupt government operations. She knows federal employees also have whistleblower rights.   \"Allowing civil servants to put up a red flag when we're seeing a problem is critical to maintaining our democracy,\" she told NPR in October. \"These civil service protections aren't really about protecting me as a federal worker. They're about protecting our country.\"   \n   Still, on Friday, Norton told NPR she knew she was putting her job at risk by speaking out.   \"I was never under the impression that my rights would be respected,\" she said. \"I also recognized… that if you don't assert your rights because you're afraid or because you're demoralized or for whatever reason, then you've already given them up. You've let them be taken away. And I was determined not to do that.\"   NPR's Rob Stein contributed to this story.\n",

The Wednesday vote was the first time House members voted since House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., sent members home after the chamber passed its initial version of a continuing resolution in mid-September.   \n   \"The House did its job,\" Johnson said on the third day of the shutdown when asked why he wasn't having members stay in town. \"The House will come back into session and do its work as soon as [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer allows us to reopen the government.\"   He kept his word but tensions were high when members returned this week.   \"Long time, no see. I hardly recognize you guys,\" said House Rules Committee ranking member Jim McGovern, D-Mass., at a meeting. \"Where the hell have you been?\"   \n   After repeated comments from Democrats about Republicans being on vacation during the shutdown, Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., stepped in.   \"I am sick and tired of hearing you all say we had an eight-week vacation. I worked every day,\" she said. \"I don't want to hear another soul say that.\"   Although House leadership in both parties held press conferences every day during the shutdown, there was no legislative business of the House for over seven weeks.   \"The halls have been pretty, pretty lonely,\" said California Republican Kevin Kiley on Wednesday. Unlike Republicans, rank and file House Democrats were instructed by their leaders to come to D.C. regularly for caucus meetings.    But Kiley kept showing up to his Capitol office throughout the shutdown.   \n   \"This has not been the finest hour for the United States Congress, having the House of Representatives cancel its sessions while so many people across the country were suffering,\" he told NPR. \"I don't think that either party comes out of this thing in the best light.\"   Kiley said he used the time to work with a colleague on the other side of the aisle to address an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year – the crux of the shutdown itself.   \n   \"That was, I guess, one advantage of being here – that I have had some constructive conversations like that,\" he said. \"But of course, if the entire House was here, then we could have been having the sort of consensus building process that you need to pass legislation like this.\"   Other GOP members, like Missouri Rep. Mark Alford, said the time back home was useful.   \"In a way, this time away working in the district has been very, very helpful,\" he told NPR. \"I got more done in my district than I think in the three years that I've been [in Congress]. We went to farms, we went to businesses, we visited 14 of our 18 rural hospitals in our district, and it gave us a real clear picture of where America stands right now and what we can do to help.\"   Meanwhile, Democrats are still fuming that the chamber was sent home in the first place.   \"I think that the speaker really has exhibited some poor judgment. I think it was disrespectful to the body,\" said Rep. Julie Johnson, D-Texas.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Rep. Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., speak to the press after Grijalva was sworn in at the Capitol on Nov. 12. 2025.\n                \n                    SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images/AFP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images/AFP\n    \n\n   \n   She called it \"poor form\" for the speaker not to swear in fellow Democrat Adelita Grijalva, who won an Arizona special election in mid-September and was waiting to be sworn in during the shutdown.   Grijalva told NPR's All Things Considered she thinks her support of the effort to release the Jeffrey Epstein files played a role in her wait to get seated.   \n   \"I really like this lady. She's going to be an excellent member of Congress,\" Speaker Johnson said after he swore Grijalva in. \"We followed the custom of the House on the timetable and we've had a little, as we say in the deep South, some intense fellowship about that. But she's here now and I promised that we would have the oath administered before we began legislative business so she hasn't missed a vote.\"   Rep. Melanie Stansbury, D-N.M., said swearing in Grijalva during the shutdown is just one of the business items of the chamber that should have been done last month.   \n   \"For the last 54 days, the House has been completely closed and locked out, and there is all manner of legislative business that could have been going on,\" she told NPR. \"People are angry about the lack of accountability.\"   Stansbury added: \"We should have been here for the entire time.\"   Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., agreed with that.   \"We were gone far too long,\" he told NPR. \"I didn't want to go home in August [for recess]. So to be gone for those five or six weeks and then turn around and do it again in October was just – that's just more than Americans should have to put up with.\"   Womack, a longtime appropriator, said he has his eye on the end of January — when Congress has to finish the rest of its spending bills.   \"We're going to be putting Congress on the clock again in another 78, 79 days,\" he said. \"We're going to be right back where we were. I just hope we don't put America back through the same nut roll.\"\n",

That decision could help determine the fate of the politically charged cases, which were both shepherded by the hastily installed Halligan and together have amplified concerns that the Justice Department is being used as a weapon to target President Donald Trump's perceived adversaries.   Halligan was installed in the job at Trump's urging by Attorney General Pam Bondi in September, just days before Comey was indicted, in what defense lawyers say was an end-run around the constitutional and statutory rules governing the appointment of U.S. attorneys. They say the maneuver was designed to ensure indictments against the president's political opponents after the prosecutor who had been overseeing the two investigations, but had not brought charges, was effectively forced out.   \n   \"Ms. Halligan was the sole prosecutor in the grand jury room, and when the sole prosecutor lacks the authority,\" said Ephraim McDowell, one of Comey's defense lawyers, \"that's not going to be a harmless error.\"   \n   U.S. attorneys, top federal prosecutors who oversee regional Justice Department outposts across the country, are typically nominated by the president and then confirmed by the Senate. Attorneys general do have the authority to name an interim U.S. attorney who can serve for 120 days, but lawyers for Comey and James argued that once that period expires, the law gives federal judges the exclusive say of who gets to fill the vacancy.   The interim US attorney resigned under pressure   After then-interim U.S. attorney Erik Siebert resigned in September while facing Trump administration pressure to bring charges against Comey and James, Bondi installed Halligan, a White House aide with no prior prosecutorial experience. The appointment followed a Trump post on Truth Social in which he complained to Bondi about the lack of prosecutorial action against his political enemies and said, \"JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\"   Siebert had been appointed by Bondi in January to serve as interim U.S. attorney. Trump in May announced his intention to nominate him, and judges in the Eastern District unanimously agreed after his 120-day period expired that he should be retained in the role.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Former FBI Director James Comey's attorney Abbe Lowell talks to reporters as he leaves the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Va., Thursday, Nov. 13, 2025.\n                \n                    Jose Luis Magana/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jose Luis Magana/AP\n    \n\n   \n   But after the Trump administration effectively pushed him out in September, the Justice Department again opted to make an interim appointment in place of the courts, something defense lawyers say it was not empowered under the law to do.   \n   \"If the government were to prevail here,\" McDowell said, then it \"would never need to go through Senate confirmation again for U.S. attorneys.\" He said any dismissal of the indictment must be permanent, with no opportunity to bring the case again, to avoid rewarding the government for a violation.   The Justice Department defends Halligan's appointment   The Justice Department maintains that the law does not explicitly prohibit successive appointments of interim U.S. attorneys by the attorney general. Henry Whitaker, a lawyer for the department, argued that the indictment was properly returned by a grand jury and should not be dismissed over what he described as at most a paperwork or clerical error.   \n   \"The grand jury made a decision based on the facts and the law, and they followed their oath,\" Whitaker said.   He also said that even if there were questions about Halligan's appointment, they were resolved by the fact that Bondi had personally ratified the indictment and reviewed the grand jury proceedings. But Currie, the judge, questioned whether that was possible given that a section of the grand jury proceedings that were produced to her was, for unexplained reasons, missing a section.   A Justice Department spokesperson later said that there was no missing time and that the time period in question concerns when the grand jury was deliberating, which \"would not be included in a transcription.\"   Comey has pleaded not guilty to charges of making a false statement and obstructing Congress, and James, a Democrat, has pleaded not guilty to mortgage fraud allegations. The challenges to Halligan's appointment are part of a multiprong effort to get the prosecutions tossed before trial. Their lawyers have separately argued that the prosecutions are improperly vindictive and motivated by the president's personal animus toward their clients and should therefore be dismissed.   Trump's history with Comey and James   Comey, as FBI director in the early months of Trump's first term, infuriated the president through his oversight of an investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. Trump fired Comey in May 2017. The two have been open adversaries since, with Comey labeling Trump \"unethical\" and comparing him to a Mafia boss and Trump branding Comey an \"untruthful slime ball\" and calling for him to be punished because of the Russia investigation.   \n   James has been a frequent target of Trump's ire, especially since she won a staggering judgment against him and the Trump Organization in a lawsuit alleging he defrauded banks by overstating the value of his real estate holdings on financial statements. An appeals court overturned the fine, which had ballooned to more than $500 million with interest, but upheld a lower court's finding that Trump had committed fraud.\n",

Today's top stories   The White House says newly released Jeffrey Epstein documents don't prove any wrongdoing by President Trump. Within the more than 1,000 mentions of Trump in the documents, an email says Trump spent hours at the convicted sex offender's home with a victim. Republican strategist Alex Conant says the documents may not necessarily change people's minds for the next election, but it makes for a not-so-good week for the president.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump arrives for the signing ceremony for the \"Fostering the Future\" executive order in the East Room of the White House on Nov. 13, 2025.\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Conant says that the White House should have handled the Epstein story differently by releasing all the information they had. The White House claims it has been transparent about the situation, but at the same time, Trump doesn't want to answer questions about Epstein, NPR's Deepa Shivaram tells Up First. Conant points out that Trump's strategy is to deflect, attack and then change the story, but due to the slow drip of the Epstein story, it has been harder for the president to overcome this scandal.   The Trump administration has selected Charlotte, N.C., as the next city for its immigration crackdown, according to Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden. The sheriff said yesterday that federal officials contacted him and could arrive as early as tomorrow. The development comes as some Border Patrol agents are leaving Chicago, after weeks of aggressive raids there.    \n   🎧 Charlotte drew national attention this fall following the fatal stabbing of a Ukrainian woman on public transit, says Nick de la Canal with NPR network station WFAE. The suspect was not an immigrant, but Republicans and the White House criticized the city's Democratic mayor for the crime. Violent crime is down 20% over the last year, according to de la Canal, but there have still been calls for the National Guard to deploy to the area. It is currently unknown how many agents are expected to arrive in the city, and the community has been reacting with fear to the news, despite advocacy groups urging calm.   Trump will soon travel across the U.S. to address the economic hardship Americans are feeling, a senior administration official told NPR. Trump's message will be that, while some things have improved, there is still more work to be done. This comes as the president revives the talking point of making America affordable again — a pledge that helped him win the White House again but that has not been much of a focus the past eight months. Currently, voters rank the economy and cost of living as their top concerns in polls, and many blame Trump's policies for exacerbating these issues.   \n   Today's listen   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Why exercise is on the rise.\n                \n                    J_art/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        J_art/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Exercise appears to be more popular than ever in the U.S., from fitness influencers sharing gym tips on social media to fitness being a focus in our politics. Data also shows more Americans are exercising. But what caused this shift?

And now, after dropping it from his lexicon for more than eight months, he's saying it again as polls show voters rank the economy and cost of living as their top concern and blame Trump's policies for making things worse.   A senior administration official tells NPR Trump will soon travel around the country with a message that while some things have improved, there is more work to do to help people feeling economic strain. The official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, added that when it comes to affordability, \"there's no finish line.\"   \n   Thus far, Trump has spent far more time boasting about how great the economy and stock market are doing than acknowledging any economic anxiety.   \"Record high, record high, record high,\" Trump said of the stock market last week at a business event in Florida.   \"Costs are way down,\" Trump said at a late night signing ceremony in the Oval Office Wednesday. \"My administration and our partners in Congress will continue our work to lower the cost of living, restore public safety, grow our economy and make America affordable again for all Americans.\"   \n   Trump's affordability challenge marks a dramatic reversal of fortune for a president who returned to office on a promise to bring costs down and whose greatest political strength was on the economy. Now his approval rating on the economy is severely underwater.   After sweeping wins by Democrats in last week's elections where the cost-of-living was a key issue, Trump suddenly had a lot to say about \"affordability.\" But he has frequently come across as dismissive and defensive.   \"The affordability is much better with the Republicans,\" Trump said last week. \"The only problem is the Republicans don't talk about it, and Republicans should start talking about it and use their heads.\"   \n   But earlier this week when Fox News' Laura Ingraham pressed Trump on rising costs of things like coffee and ground beef, he called it a \"con job by the Democrats.\"   Asked why people are anxious about the economy, Trump responded by questioning whether people really are saying that.   \"I think polls are fake,\" Trump said. \"We have the greatest economy we've ever had.\"   \n   To support his positive outlook, Trump points to the booming stock market, his tariff policy and pledges by companies and countries to invest in the U.S.   Inflation this year has been persistent but not dramatic, at about 3%. Eggs have gotten cheaper since Trump took office, but other staples like ground beef and coffee are up. According to Gas Buddy, the average price of gasoline in the U.S. is $3.09 per gallon, slightly higher than this time last year.   \"Consumer confidence is the lowest it's ever been,\" said Jason Furman, a professor of economics at Harvard. \"People are really negative about inflation.\"   It's a political truth — and a pitfall for presidents — that people don't want to hear that everything is awesome if they are struggling.   \n   Furman, who served in the Obama administration, says the messaging team in that White House was very cautious not to brag about the economy, as the nation emerged from the Great Recession.   \"Because they thought anything we said positive about the economy risked people thinking President Obama was out of touch,\" said Furman. \"I didn't see that type of reserve when Biden was president. He bragged about it quite a lot, and I think that [rang] hollow with a lot of people. And President Trump is even less reserved about his bragging.\"   Trump's insistence that the economy is great earned him a rebuke from Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. Appearing on the Sean Spicer Show on YouTube, Greene said she gives Trump credit for holding inflation steady.   \n   \"But that doesn't bring prices down,\" said Greene. \"And so gaslighting the people and trying to tell them that prices have come down is not helping. It's actually infuriating people because people know what they are paying at the grocery store, they know what they're paying for their kid's clothes and school supplies. They know what they're paying for their electricity bills.\"   She called for compassion rather than lecturing.   \n   Former Trump economic adviser Stephen Moore says there are three major cost issues that have to be addressed: grocery prices, home prices and health care costs.   \"It is true factually that the average family has more purchasing power today than they did when Biden left office,\" said Moore. \"And yet people don't feel it. You know, they're not feeling the love. And I can't explain why that is except that people tend to focus on things where their prices are rising.\"   In fact, purchasing power also grew during the Biden administration, because wages rose faster than costs. But voters didn't want to hear it then, and they are in no mood to hear it now.   \"People are kind of in a crabby mood right now when it comes to the economy,\" said Moore.\n",

    "body": "\n      Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen voted to end the shutdown without healthcare stipulations. Her daughter, congressional candidate Stefany Shaheen, shares why she disagrees with her mother's decision.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire was a lead negotiator between several members of her party and Republicans to end the shutdown. Stefany Shaheen is her daughter and one of seven Democrats running for a House seat in New Hampshire, and she also publicly disagreed with her mother's consequential vote to reopen the government. We called her this morning to ask why. Good morning, Stefany, and thank you for being on the program.STEFANY SHAHEEN: Good morning, Leila. Thank you so much for having me today.FADEL: I want to start with why you don't support the deal that your mother ultimately negotiated.SHAHEEN: Sure. Well, you know, the fact is that improving health care has been the cause of my life. It became that when my eldest daughter, Elle, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when she was just 8 years old. It's the reason I got into this race, to improve and fight for better health care that's more affordable. And so when Speaker Johnson stated that he couldn't guarantee a vote to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits, I knew it was a deal I could not support in the House.FADEL: At any point during the actual conversations over the deal, when your mom was negotiating it, did you ever tell her, don't go through with it and here's why?SHAHEEN: Well, you know, I knew where she stood. She knew where I stood. She ultimately did what she thinks is right, and I'm doing what I think is right. And ultimately, what's right is to ensure that we turn this anger into action, and we demand that Speaker Johnson bring a vote to the floor to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits.FADEL: So when you say turn this anger into action, I mean, for anyone using the federal health care exchanges, out-of-pocket premium payments are expected to more than double without subsidies. In New Hampshire's first congressional district where you are running for office, there are more than 36,000 people who get their health insurance through the ACA marketplace. What are they telling you about what they want from Congress? And what are you telling them you will do if you get elected on this matter?SHAHEEN: Sure. Well, the first thing we have to do is extend these tax credits. You know, the fact is Republicans have made it pretty easy for them to extend their tax breaks to the billionaire friends they represent. And they're struggling very hard to figure out how to extend tax credits for the millions of Americans who need health care. The rising cost of health care in New Hampshire, a family of four can expect to see their premiums increase almost $7,000 next year if these tax credits don't get extended.It's simply unattainable. It's not affordable. And these costs on top of all the other expenses people are trying to navigate right now - with inflation, the rising cost of food, the rising cost of housing - it just can't keep going this way. We have to ensure we get these tax credits extended. And then beyond that, that's just the start of the fight. Then beyond that, we've got to do everything in our power to improve health care.We've got lots of ways of doing that. I think the first, most important step is that in the next six weeks, we have to get these tax credits extended. And so I invite all your listeners to check out our website and join us in this fight, stefanyshaheen.com, for the advocacy work we're going to need to do between now and the end of December. And let's be clear, we have to get these tax credits extended before January because that's when the premiums go up.FADEL: Now, the deal that passed that reopened the government didn't include any long-term commitment, as you mentioned, from Republicans to extend health care subsidies. But your mother noted about her vote that she thought the things that it did include were important - making sure federal workers got rehired and paid, food benefits got restored - that these were more important things and it's what the Democrats could get. I mean, do you agree?SHAHEEN: Well, I think ultimately the Senate is going to get a vote on the extension of the tax credits. And we need Speaker Johnson to guarantee the same thing. You know, being in a position where we're having...FADEL: But I guess, why wasn't that part of the deal originally? Like, it doesn't matter if the Senate does it if the House doesn't.SHAHEEN: Well, and that's why I had to speak out against it, because we have to have a vote in the House. You know, ultimately, being in a position where we're having to choose between sick kids and hungry kids is not a good place to be. And we have to make sure we still have time to channel this anger into action and get a vote in the House. The fight continues. And I think the fight has to be focused right now on doing everything in our power to make sure there's a bill that comes out of the Senate to extend the ACA tax credits and that we get the House to do the same before the end of December.FADEL: Is there a place for common ground between Democrats and Republicans on rising health care costs? Because it is something that is acknowledged on both sides of the aisle.SHAHEEN: There has to be. And, you know, part of that is my motivation in getting into this race. We collectively have to stand up and fight for what's right. And we know the health and well-being of the American people has to come first. So I am certain there's common ground here, and it can start with everyone agreeing to extend these tax credits before the end of December.FADEL: Stefany Shaheen is running to become a member of the U.S. House. She's the daughter of Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen and disagrees with her vote on this deal. Thank you so much.SHAHEEN: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Mark Schreiber, seen here in 2023, was one of 10 Republican holdouts in the chamber for a special session on redistricting.\n                \n                    John Hanna/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        John Hanna/AP\n    \n\n   \n   In September, Kansas Republican leaders said they wanted to join the national redistricting battle, initiated by President Trump, for control of the U.S. House.   But even in a state that went for Trump by 16 percentage points in 2024, Republicans could not rally enough support this fall for a special session on redistricting.   \"I haven't heard a good reason yet to vote for it,\" said Mark Schreiber, one of 10 Republican holdouts in the Kansas state House. \"To me that's not the purpose of redistricting. It's not used as a political tool to increase your majority, it's to adjust for population changes.\"   \n   Other Republican-led states — like Missouri, North Carolina and Texas — have heeded Trump's call for new congressional maps boosting the GOP. Last week, California voters approved new districts favoring Democrats.   \n   But Kansas' false start was just one example of lawmakers pushing back against a new round of partisan gerrymanders.   Republicans in Indiana and Democrats in Maryland have faced scorn from party leaders for speaking out against proposed redraws. And in Ohio, where many expected Republicans to enact a severe gerrymander, a bipartisan deal resulted in a map that moderately advantaged the GOP.   Why do some lawmakers oppose redistricting that would help their party?   Lawmakers' reasons for bucking their party leaders appear to vary widely, including those who object to gerrymandering on philosophical grounds — and some who simply fear the maneuvers could backfire.   \"The particulars might be a little idiosyncratic to every state,\" said Patrick Miller, a political science professor at Kent State University in Ohio.   \n   Miller said some states, like New York and Colorado, have filing deadlines for congressional candidates that place an impossibly short timeline on potential redistricting efforts, given the steps needed in the states to craft a new map.   Meanwhile, lawmakers in Kansas and Indiana raised eyebrows at the six-figure sums required to pay legislators outside of a regular session.   Republican leaders in Kansas also faced a unique challenge. The state GOP would need to marshal nearly the full strength of its supermajorities in the state House and Senate to override a veto from the Democratic governor.   \n   Overall, Miller said, opposition to redistricting has not necessarily come from a place of righteous objection to gerrymandering.   \"I'm sure that there are some Republican legislators out there who are opposed to Trump, who are principled about … redistricting,\" Miller said. \"But I don't see this as a pushback on Trump at all.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Kansas Statehouse is seen in Topeka.\n                \n                    Zane Irwin/Kansas News Service\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Zane Irwin/Kansas News Service\n    \n\n   \n   Kansas state Rep. Clark Sanders said gerrymandering is a \"fact of life\" in politics. But he opposed hastily redrawing Kansas' 3rd District — held by the state's lone Democrat in Congress, Sharice Davids — because he thought it could backfire on Republicans.   \"If we weren't careful, we might end up redistricting and making it difficult to also win in the 2nd District,\" he said.   Sanders said he expressed the same concern when he received a call from the White House several weeks ago, to talk about redistricting.   Last week, Republican House Speaker Dan Hawkins stripped Sanders of a leadership position for refusing to sign off on a special session. He was one of seven committee chairs and vice chairs who were demoted for failing to toe the party line on redistricting.   \"It's unfortunate that we lost our positions,\" Sanders said. \"We just … felt like we needed to do what we needed to do.\"   Similar objections have sparked infighting in other states. Maryland's state Senate president, Democrat Bill Ferguson, has stood in opposition to his governor by publicly opposing redistricting.   Ferguson has argued a legal challenge could place redistricting in the hands of the conservative-leaning state Supreme Court — resulting in new maps that hurt Democrats, rather than giving them a leg up.   \"Ready to ride\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Republican, demoted seven lawmakers for failing to toe the party line on redistricting.\n                \n                    Zane Irwin/Kansas News Service\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Zane Irwin/Kansas News Service\n    \n\n   \n   Despite those setbacks, redistricting proponents in several states are still trying to convince holdouts — under the watchful eyes of the national parties.   Indiana lawmakers will weigh redistricting in December. And Democratic Maryland Gov. Wes Moore recently formed a redistricting advisory commission, despite state Sen. Ferguson's pushback.   \n   Kansas Republican leaders have vowed to put maps before lawmakers when their regular session begins in January.   \"I learned a long time ago that when you get thrown by the bull, you dust yourself off and you climb back on,\" House Speaker Hawkins wrote in a newsletter after his chamber rejected a special session.   When lawmakers return to Topeka early next year, he said, \"House Republicans will be ready to ride.\"   Even some holdouts in Kansas, like Republican state Rep. Adam Smith, said they had not ruled out the possibility of voting to redistrict in the future.   \"If there's another map that's drawn that looks a little bit more representative for my folks, I'd probably seriously consider voting for that,\" he said.\n",

    "body": "\n      The House was out of session for the entire government shutdown. Members returned Wednesday with a lot of frustration.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  The House of Representatives came back for one day this week after being gone for more than 50. During the government shutdown, the House was officially out of session. Some members did town halls back in their districts. Others came to the Capitol anyway. But as NPR's Barbara Sprunt reports, there was angst on all sides when everyone reassembled.BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: The House Rules Committee met earlier this week ahead of the full House coming back into session on Wednesday. And let's just say things were tense. Here's Jim McGovern, the top Democrat on the panel.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JIM MCGOVERN: Long time no see. I hardly recognize you guys. Where the hell have you been?SPRUNT: After repeated comments from Democrats about Republicans being on vacation during the shutdown, Chairwoman Virginia Foxx stepped in.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)VIRGINIA FOXX: I am sick and tired of hearing you all say we had an eight-week vacation.YASSAMIN ANSARI: That's exactly what happened.FOXX: I worked every day. I don't know about you.ANSARI: I worked every single day as well.FOXX: But I don't want to hear another soul say that.ANSARI: We all worked every single...SPRUNT: The House passed its version of a stopgap funding bill in mid-September. House Speaker Mike Johnson then sent lawmakers home. He was asked on the third day of the shutdown, why not stay?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE JOHNSON: My quick answer's very simple. The House did its job.SPRUNT: Then he blamed Democratic leaders in the Senate for not doing theirs. Leadership on both sides of the aisle held press conferences almost every day of the shutdown, but there were no votes, no committee hearings. Wednesday was the first official day back in 54 days.KEVIN KILEY: It's a lot more crowded here. You know, the halls have been pretty lonely.SPRUNT: That's California Republican Kevin Kiley. He kept showing up to his Capitol office throughout the shutdown.KILEY: To be honest with you, this has not been the finest hour for the United States Congress, having the House of Representatives cancel its sessions while so many people across the country were suffering.SPRUNT: He said he used the time to work with a colleague on the other side of the aisle to address an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year. Those subsidies were central to the shutdown.KILEY: That was, I guess, one advantage of being here is that we - I have had some constructive conversations like that. But of course, if the entire House was here, then we could have been having this sort of consensus-building process that you need to pass legislation like this.SPRUNT: Fellow Republican Mark Alford of Missouri said the time back home was useful.MARK ALFORD: Look, I've been here for three years. I got more done in my district than I think in the three years that I've been there. I've been able to visit farms. We went to businesses. We visited 14 of 18 rural hospitals in our district. And it gave us a real clear picture where America stands right now and what we can do to help.SPRUNT: Meanwhile, Democrats are still fuming that the House was even sent home at all.JULIE JOHNSON: This was a ridiculous thing.SPRUNT: That's Julie Johnson, a freshman Democrat from Texas.J JOHNSON: I think that the speaker really has exhibited some poor judgment, and it was disrespectful to the body. And then the speaker refusing to swear in a dully elected, that was poor form.SPRUNT: She's referring to Arizona Democrat Adelita Grijalva, who won a special election in mid-September but wasn't sworn in until yesterday before any votes. The common refrain from Democrats, like New Mexico's Melanie Stansbury, is this.MELANIE STANSBURY: The House has been completely closed and locked out, and there is all manner of legislative business that could have been going on, and we should have been here the entire time.SPRUNT: Republican Steve Womack of Arkansas says he agrees with that.STEVE WOMACK: Listen, I didn't want to go home in August. So to be gone for those five or six weeks and then turn around and do it again in October was just - that's just more than America should have to put up with.SPRUNT: He's a senior appropriator, and he's now looking down the road at what lies ahead.WOMACK: We're going to be putting Congress on the clock again in another 78, 79 days. We're going to be right back where we were. I just hope we don't put America back through the same nut roll.SPRUNT: Funding for much of the government will run out again January 30.Barbara Sprunt, NPR News, the Capital.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

Instead, it will shift money toward transitional housing that requires work and addiction treatment.   In a statement, the Department of Housing and Urban Development said the new policies will \"restore accountability\" and promote \"self-sufficiency\" by addressing the \"root causes of homelessness, including illicit drugs and mental illness.\" It also noted that overall homelessness funding is going up, from $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion.   170,000 people could be at risk of losing their housing    Critics warn the major overhaul could put 170,000 people at risk of losing their housing again. And they say the timing is terrible. Normally, funding notices go out months earlier, but now programs around the country will have little time to start applying for new funding. And in many places, it will leave a months-long gap after current funding runs out and before new money flows.   \n   \"We'll move very, very fast,\" said HUD policy expert Robert Marbut, in response to such concerns. He also noted the federal shutdown delayed the funding notice, though homelessness advocates say it was already behind schedule before that.   In another change, HUD will no longer automatically renew existing programs – creating the possibility that formerly homeless people who've lived in subsidized housing for years will be forced out. In fact, Marbut said the agency expects some programs to no longer receive funding because it will go to others instead. The agency also says it's opening up more funding for faith-based groups.   The National Alliance to End Homelessness says the new policies could upend life for people who've found stability in permanent housing programs, many of them seniors or disabled.   \"HUD's new funding priorities slam the door on them, their providers, and their communities. Make no mistake: homelessness will only increase because of this reckless and irresponsible decision,\" CEO Ann Oliva said in a statement.   The new policies could also shift more funding to places that enforce bans on homeless encampments.   \"Donald Trump's approach to homelessness does nothing to address the sky-high cost of rent, which remains the main cause of homelessness,\" Jesse Rabinowitz of the National Homelessness Law Center said in a statement.   \n   The funding shift reflects a conservative backlash to longstanding policies   For two decades, federal funding has prioritized getting people into permanent housing and then offering them treatment. That policy is called Housing First and has long had bipartisan support. Backers say the approach has a proven track record of keeping people off the streets.   But critics counter that it has failed to stem the steady rise of homelessness to what are now historic levels.   Those critics include President Trump, who has long pushed cities to clear homeless encampments from streets and parks. The new funding shift reflects an executive order he signed in July, which also sought to make it easier to confine unhoused people in mental institutions against their will.   \n   Marbut, the HUD policy expert, also said Housing First policies have failed to address rising death rates among unhoused people from meth and fentanyl addiction.   \"The influence of Housing First just became too powerful,\" says Stephen Eide, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think-tank. He calls it a top-down approach, and says for years it was hard to get funding unless a program followed that policy. Eide says that left out a large group of people who may not need permanent housing or who may want the enforced sobriety it does not offer.   \"I think what we're going to be looking for is a reinvestment in transitional housing,\" he says. That means places people can stay for 18 months or so to get sober, or recover in other ways, and then — ideally — move out and succeed on their own.   There's broad agreement that the U.S. needs more of every kind of support for homeless people: permanent housing, rehab and mental illness treatment. But critics of HUD's shift fear this may make it harder for some to get help.   \n   \"It is moving away from trauma-informed care, and that's problematic,\" says Stephanie Klasky-Gamer, president and CEO of LA Family Housing in Los Angeles.   For example, she thinks this will lead more shelters to bar people unless they're already sober or enrolled in recovery or mental health care. But that's a high bar for many people, she says, and it could backfire.\n",

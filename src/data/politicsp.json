In the statement, leaders of the eight countries underscored their commitment to shared NATO goals, saying that they stood in \"full solidarity\" with Denmark and Greenland. They also reaffirmed their willingness to \"engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity\" in response to President Trump's repeated threats to take control of Greenland, which is currently an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark.   \n   On Saturday night, President Trump had written on his Truth Social platform that he would impose tariffs on imports from the eight countries. Trump's words came after the countries, which are all in NATO, deployed military personnel to Greenland in recent days, to participate in a Danish-led Arctic exercise known as 'Arctic Endurance'.   Trump said America would levy a 10 percent tariff on goods from the eight countries starting on February 1. He claimed those tariffs would rise to 25 percent on June 1, and remain in place \"until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland\" by the United States.   In their joint response, the eight NATO countries said that Trump's proposed tariffs \"undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.\"   \n   \"As members of NATO, we are committed to strengthening Arctic security as a shared transatlantic interest,\" the leaders said. \"The pre-coordinated Danish exercise 'Arctic Endurance' conducted with Allies, responds to this necessity. It poses no threat to anyone.\"   The coordinated statement reflects an unusually explicit diplomatic pushback by key U.S. allies. In addition, some individual European leaders issued their own individual criticisms.   British Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the use of tariffs against allies, calling it \"completely wrong\". A spokesman for the UK Prime Minister later said Starmer had shared this view with President Trump in a phone call on Sunday. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said Sweden would not be \"blackmailed,\" while Norway's prime minister stressed that \"threats have no place among allies.\"   \n   Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen also made a statement, praising \"great support\" from European allies. \"I am pleased with the consistent messages from the rest of the continent: Europe will not be blackmailed,\" Frederiksen said.   European foreign policy leaders made clear that trade coercion would harm the broader transatlantic relationship and potentially derail other ongoing negotiations.   One unnamed French official close to Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot told NPR that Paris had mobilized its diplomatic apparatus \"to coordinate a European response to the new, unacceptable tariff threats issued by President Trump.\"   The official added that Barrot had been in talks with his British, German and EU counterparts and was in contact with all affected foreign ministers and European Parliament political groups.   Ordinary citizens have also registered their opposition to President Trump's recent threats, with large protests in Denmark and Greenland against American pressure alongside the broader NATO debates about Arctic security as well as the diplomatic scramble.   In his social media post on Saturday, Trump framed Europe's actions as part of \"a very dangerous situation\" and argued the tariffs were necessary to protect \"Global Peace and Security\" – language that has been widely challenged by European officials and analysts as exaggerated or unfounded given the context of NATO cooperation in the Arctic.   \n   This latest tariff standoff follows weeks of increasingly assertive U.S. rhetoric regarding Greenland and Arctic policy. Trump has repeatedly declared Greenland — a vast, sparsely populated territory — as strategically vital to U.S. national security, citing its location and untapped mineral resources.   Greenlandic and Danish leaders have consistently pushed back, insisting the territory is not for sale, most recently during discussions between the two countries' foreign ministers and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.   Domestically, the tariff decision has sparked pushback not only abroad but among U.S. lawmakers. Bi-partisan voices in Congress have criticized the approach as damaging to NATO cohesion, and warned that it could jeopardize U.S. credibility.   \n   Analysts have pointed out that the United States already maintains a military presence in Greenland, which has shrunk dramatically over the decades, and so question the necessity of coercive economic measures tied to territorial ambitions.\n",

Ron, thanks for being with us.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.SIMON: I want to ask you - a new poll just out, about a year into Donald Trump's presidency, it finds that 58% of those polled think his first year of his second term has not been a success. Fifty-six percent find the fatal shooting of Renee Good an inappropriate use of force, and less than a third say that ICE operations have made America's cities safer. What do you see in these findings?ELVING: A lot of warning signs for a second-term president facing a fall that brings midterm elections for Congress. And it's not only CNN. The same message comes from other media polls and academic polls. The Associated Press works with people who compile a great deal of public opinion data. Their latest poll shows some erosion, even among Republicans, on some issues. Immigration was his best issue all last year, but even that's underwater for him now. Just 38% approve of his handling of immigration since the last ICE raids in that poll. Yet what is most striking is the disapproval on parts of Trump's foreign policy. It's rare to see any national polling question get a 60% negative response. But the idea of taking Greenland by force is opposed by nearly 70% of Americans.SIMON: And given these poll numbers, why do you think almost no change in course from the White House a year in?ELVING: There have been some efforts to vary the program, if not really change course. The president has changed tactics on household affordability as an issue, saying it's something to take seriously, proposing means of lowering home prices. In response to other controversies, the president has backed off on some of his threats. He hasn't struck Iran yet. He has not declared a state of emergency in Minnesota, as we just heard from Kat. But I'm reminded of two three-word phrases that we heard a lot in the first Trump term. One was flood the zone, and the other was audience of one. Flood the zone meant that if there was a bad story in the news, the best way to handle it was to blow it away with a flurry of actions or statements that were sure to grab attention.So whether the bad story is the Epstein files or the battles over ICE, we are suddenly seeing lots of unexpected stories. We mentioned Greenland and the tariffs, and now the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Jerome Powell, is being investigated. We mentioned the Minnesota governor and mayor of Minneapolis being investigated, possibly charged with obstructing, but no investigation yet for the ICE agent who shot an unarmed woman four times in that city. And as for the audience of one, it's clear that much is said and done in this White House and this administration with just one mind in mind.SIMON: What signals do you see about this administration's plans for Iran?ELVING: Those plans are not entirely clear at this point, but the president has sent an aircraft carrier battle group to the area and done a lot of saber-rattling, not unlike what he did before the incursion into Venezuela. Late in the week, the president backed off a bit on this one, too, after Iran withdrew its threatened mass executions of protesters. The death toll is already in the thousands there. But both the mullahs in Tehran and the president in Washington seem to have heard from allies and partners in the Arab world and elsewhere, all trying to lower the tension, prevent a U.S. strike, and one argument being that such a strike would worsen the situation without solving it. And those entreaties may have been heard and heeded, at least for the moment.SIMON: Finally, this week, Ron, what are your thoughts on the Nobel Peace Prize that President Trump seemed to acquire this week?ELVING: The Nobel Committee made it clear the prize was still María Corina Machado's to keep but not to give away. She did give the president the medal that went with the prize. That was surely a measure of how much she wanted to please and placate the president and a measure of her willingness to sacrifice for her cause and, we might add, a measure of her savvy in dealing with a certain audience of one.SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving. As always, a pleasure to talk to you, my friend. Talk to you later. Take care.ELVING: Thank you, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      A bipartisan group of Senators is in Denmark speaking to officials there as President Trump announces new tariffs and continues to talk about taking over Greenland.   \n\n    SARAH MCCAMMON, HOST:  President Trump is escalating his effort to acquire Greenland, which is part of the kingdom of Denmark. In a social media post earlier today, he said he will impose a new 10% tariff on several European countries that oppose the idea - including Germany, France and Denmark - that is, until they get on board. This came on the heels of a bipartisan congressional delegation that went to Denmark on Friday to try to turn down the temperature. NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt traveled there also, and she joins us from Copenhagen. Hi, Barbara.BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Hi, Sarah.MCCAMMON: So tell me more about this delegation. Who went, and what was their goal?SPRUNT: Well, this was a group of about a dozen lawmakers, mostly Democrats. There were two Republicans, both of whom have shown a willingness in the past to push back on the Trump administration. And this was, at its core, a reassurance tour. You know, they were coming to listen and hear the concerns of politicians of both Denmark and Greenland, as well as some Danish business leaders. Here's Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski speaking after an event at Parliament yesterday.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LISA MURKOWSKI: I think it is important to underscore that when you ask the American people whether or not they think it is a good idea for the United States to acquire Greenland, the vast majority - some 75% - will say, we do not think that that is a good idea.SPRUNT: You know what's interesting, Sarah - I follow these folks around on Capitol Hill all the time, and it was almost like seeing them in a completely different job. They were diplomats. They were talking to allies who are frankly in crisis mode.MCCAMMON: You know, that's a really interesting distinction - diplomats versus lawmakers. What did you see?SPRUNT: Well, on Capitol Hill, partisanship reigns. When there's an opportunity for Democrats to take a dig at President Trump over policy or politics, more often than not, it happens. But here in Copenhagen, that's not what I saw largely. I heard a lot of careful language, a lot about bringing the knowledge that they've gained here by listening to the concerns of people on the ground back with them to the U.S. Delaware Senator Chris Coons, who led the delegation, said he'd even welcome conversations with the White House about what they've learned.MCCAMMON: Needless to say, a very different tone from what we've heard from President Trump. What was the response from the politicians from Denmark and Greenland?SPRUNT: They said they were pleased that the delegation came, that they had constructive conversations and that it was important for lawmakers to hear directly from officials from Greenland. And although they're clear in their concern about the rhetoric around buying Greenland, I thought their tone was really notable. It was calm. They repeatedly said that they stand ready to work alongside the U.S. Here's Pipaluk Lynge, a Greenlandic politician. Reporters were asking her about Trump and his comments.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PIPALUK LYNGE: I think it's really important not to demonize anyone. It's really important to focus on what we're agreeing on and focus on dialogue.SPRUNT: And I think it's really significant there how measured she is, not at all inflaming what's already a volatile situation.MCCAMMON: Now, of course, President Trump says he wants to take over Greenland because he doesn't want China or Russia to take it over. What are officials there saying about that?SPRUNT: I heard repeatedly from lawmakers that they haven't received any intelligence that suggests that that is an imminent threat. That being said, Greenland and Danish officials did say that they're willing to work with the U.S. to address concerns around safeguarding the Arctic. And I should mention, the U.S. already has a military presence in Greenland.MCCAMMON: What else are you hearing from the people you're meeting there in Copenhagen, Barbara?SPRUNT: Well, I attended a demonstration earlier today, thousands of people marching to protest Trump. Lots of passion, tons of chanting of, Greenland is not for sale. I saw a lot of hats that looked almost like the signature red Make America Great Again hats, but they said, Make America Go Away. I went up to one gentleman who had a sign that showed a image of Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, and it said, Americans, we know there is good in you, come back to sanity. His name is Peder Dam, and he said he doesn't think that Trump's demands are necessarily representative of what all Americans want, but he does wonder why there isn't more outrage.PEDER DAM: I can't understand. If my government said that they would attack Sweden, then I would step up and protest that. Why isn't there more normal, average Americans stepping up, going to demonstrations, trying to protest what is going on?SPRUNT: And this is the overarching sentiment that I heard from people. They feel frankly betrayed by a key ally, and they're very worried about their future.MCCAMMON: NPR's Barbara Sprunt, reporting from Copenhagen.

    "body": "\n      President Trump announced fresh tariffs on European countries to pressure them on his desire to acquire Greenland. He travels to the World Economic Forum in Davos this week where tensions may be high.   \n\n    AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:  President Trump is back to using one of his favorite tools in an attempt to get what he wants. Yesterday, ahead of his trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump announced additional tariffs on eight NATO members resisting his plans to acquire Greenland. Joining me now is NPR White House correspondent Deepa Shivaram. Good morning, Deepa.DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: Good morning, Ayesha.RASCOE: So tell us more about these new tariffs.SHIVARAM: Yeah. So this is something the president floated Friday for the first time. I was actually at the White House when he said it during this event on rural health care. It was not related to Greenland at all, but he was talking about how he's used tariffs in the past to pressure other countries to work with his agenda. And then he said this.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland 'cause we need Greenland for national security. So I may do that.SHIVARAM: It was the first time he had said that, and then less than 24 hours later, he elaborated. In a post to social media yesterday, Trump said that Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland - which are all NATO allies, I will add - they will face new tariffs on goods sent to the U.S. And Trump says it would start at 10% starting next month, and then increase to 25% in June unless a deal is reached for the U.S. to purchase Greenland.Now, Trump's rhetoric on Greenland was already complicating relationships with European allies, and his tariff announcement is, as you can imagine, causing more tension. And it's happening ahead of Davos, like you said, where Trump is probably going to see the leaders of some of these EU nations and European nations. So, you know, in response, the Danish foreign minister said the tariff announcement came as a surprise, and ambassadors from EU nations are convening today in Brussels for an emergency meeting to respond to this.RASCOE: Does this reach for tariffs mean that Trump is less inclined to use military force, like he's threatened?SHIVARAM: Yeah. I would say it's a little unclear at this point. And just for context, I mean, this conversation has been going on for months now. Like, early on last year is when the president, you know, started bringing this issue up. It's been ongoing. What the president keeps saying is that the U.S. needs Greenland for national security reasons. He says if the U.S. doesn't take this territory, then China or Russia might, and that would give them the advantage. But Denmark, which is a nation in NATO - again, a really critical alliance - has control of Greenland, and they say they have no intention of giving it up. Leaders in Greenland have said they have no interest in being controlled by the U.S.It just seems like at this point, no matter how much officials in these areas - Greenland, Denmark, other countries - emphasize that the U.S. taking Greenland, whether it's purchasing it or by military force - they say it's unacceptable, and Trump just doesn't seem to want to hear that. And in the meantime, you know, things are tense. European countries, including France and Germany and Sweden, have sent over military units to Greenland to help boost security there.RASCOE: What are we expecting to hear from the president at this economic forum?SHIVARAM: Well, Trump has said in the last few weeks that he intends to announce his plan for more affordable housing while he's at Davos. He says he wants to lower home prices by getting private equity groups out of the housing market, but the rest of the specifics around that plan have not yet been released. And that announcement comes, Ayesha, as Trump is trying to tackle other topics around affordability. Remember, it is an election year. Midterms are coming, and the economy remains very top of mind for voters. Last month, there was a lot - a number of polls showing that Trump's rating on his handling of the economy have been really low. So he's trying to talk about saving costs.And in addition to talking about housing this coming week, he's also recently announced other plans. Last week, his health care plan was released. It's more of a broad framework, but he says it will reform things like drug pricing. I will say, though, there are criticisms around that plan - like I said, that it's too broad and that it doesn't do anything to address higher health insurance premiums that a lot of people are paying after Congress denied to extend a provision that would have kept those costs lower. So still some issues to tackle there.RASCOE: OK. So finally, stateside, it looks like President Trump may be moving away from his threat to use the Insurrection Act against Minneapolis, where an immigration crackdown has been met with sustained protest. Is it that Trump is focused elsewhere, or are there worries within the administration around public blowback?SHIVARAM: Yeah. I mean, look. On Friday, the president said he didn't think he needed to use the Insurrection Act, but I will note that he also said, you know, if he needed it, he would use it. So it's sort of that space where it's possible he's backing down on it. At the same time, it's not clear that he's, you know, ruled it out. But it is interesting to keep in mind that it's something that Trump keeps talking about. The last time a president invoked the Insurrection Act was back in the LA riots in the '90s. I will note, though, several news organizations are reporting that about 1,500 U.S. active-duty troops have been ordered to prepare for a possible deployment to Minnesota. NPR, though, has not independently confirmed those reports.RASCOE: That's NPR's White House correspondent Deepa Shivaram. Thank you so much.SHIVARAM: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

The crowd, waving Greenlandic flags, chanted \"Greenland is not for sale.\" Many demonstrators wore red hats in Trump's own \"Make America great again\" fashion that read, \"Make America go away.\"   Trump has continued to endorse the idea of acquiring Greenland, which he says the U.S. needs for national security purposes. The U.S. already has a military presence on the island.   \"One way or the other, we're going to have Greenland,\" Trump told reporters recently on Air Force One.   \n   Saturday's protest came on the heels of a bipartisan congressional delegation that travelled to Copenhagen. House and Senate lawmakers met with Danish and Greenlandic officials, as well as members of the Danish business community. The visit was meant to be a reassurance tour — affirming the longstanding relationship between the U.S. and the Kingdom of Denmark in the face of Trump's rhetoric.   \n   Peder Dam, who lives in Denmark, attended the demonstration with a sign that featured an image of Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker from Star Wars that read: \"Americans: I know there is good in you. Come back to sanity.\"   \"We know what is going on in the White House is not representative for all Americans,\" he told NPR.    But he said he wonders why there isn't more widespread outrage from the American public.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Peder Dam attended the protest alongside his son Gorm. They each carried signs: one with a cartoon of Trump stepping on leggos with a caption that read: \"Denmark is small, but we fight with what we have\"; and another with an image of Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker from Star Wars that read: \"Americans: I know there is good in you. Come back to sanity.\"\n                \n                    Barbara Sprunt/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Barbara Sprunt/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"I can't understand. If my government said they would attack Sweden, then Denmark would step up and protest that,\" he said. \"I like protests in the U.S. But why aren't there more normal, average Americans stepping up, trying to protest what is going on? It's crazy.\"   Another demonstrator, Thomas, whom NPR is identifying only by his first name because of concerns about retaliation at work, said the march represents \"an unseen level of resentment towards the U.S.\"    \"I cannot express how deeply disappointed I am — that we have sent our troops to die with you in Iraq, we were with you in Afghanistan,\" he said. \"How dare you turn your back on us in this way?\"   \n   He said while he thinks Americans might not believe that Trump will actually invade Greenland, that's a skepticism that people in the Kingdom of Denmark can't afford.   \"I don't think it's going to happen, but we don't know,\" he said. \"And that's creating an unprecedented level of emotional uncertainty and political uncertainty.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                One demonstrator held up a sign that read: \"Trump: Your need for megalomaniac legacy needs a psychiatrist — not Greenland.\" Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Copenhagen Saturday, protesting against Trump's rhetoric surrounding the proposed U.S. acquisition Greenland.\n                \n                    Barbara Sprunt/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Barbara Sprunt/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Naja Mathilde Rosing said the march felt intensely personal. She and her family are from Greenland.   \"We are here to show solidarity, that we do not wish to be a part of the United States,\" she told NPR. \"We are strong as we are, and we are not interested in having anything to do with America.\"   She pushed back on Trump's claims that Russia and China are encircling Greenland, claiming it's a red herring. The U.S. congressional delegation told reporters that there's no intelligence suggesting that, either.   Rosing said the idea itself of purchasing Greenland is offensive to indigenous communities, who she said respect the land and don't see it as something you can own.   \"America has a sense of feeling they can steal land from the Native Americans, steal land from the indigenous Hawaiian people, steal land from the indigenous Inuit from Alaska,\" she said. \"You cannot buy Greenland, you cannot buy a people. It is so wrong, disrespectful to think that you can purchase a country and a people.\"   Charlotte Holm lives in Copenhagen but has family in Greenland.   \"They're so scared,\" she said. \"They're afraid because they don't know what's going to happen to their society.\"   She said the message to the U.S. is simple: \"Leave them alone. Go focus on the Epstein files, go focus on the midterm elections.\"   She said she hopes Trump will \"get obsessed with something else\" but worries about the ripple effect of any possible U.S. encroachment into Greenland.   \n   \"It's going to reshape fundamentally the world order if he does. NATO's going to implode,\" she said, echoing similar comments from Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. \"We need American citizens to call their Republican representatives and tell them we need to take care of NATO, because if we go across that line, there's no going back. You can't put the toothpaste back into the tube.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      It's been a challenging year for the consumer watchdog agency, as the Trump administration has tried to deny it funding and lay off most of its staff.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  This first year of the second Trump administration has been especially tough for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The agency is supposed to investigate fraud, but instead, it's mostly been dealing with work stoppages, layoffs and funding threats. NPR's Stephan Bisaha reports on the yearlong attempt to dismantle the government watchdog.STEPHAN BISAHA, BYLINE: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is probably best known for going after banking giants, like accusing Wells Fargo of doing things like illegally seizing homes and cars and fining the bank billions of dollars. But really, the agency's watchdog duties cover a lot more.LISA ROSENTHAL: Everybody that affects your wallet and your bank account.BISAHA: Lisa Rosenthal's 12-year career as an investigator and manager at the CFPB gives a sense of that scope.ROSENTHAL: I focused on payday loan victims.BISAHA: The auto finance market.ROSENTHAL: The federal student loan market.BISAHA: And debt collectors. And since it's been created, the CFPB's returned nearly $20 billion to consumers.So it sounds like you take a lot of pride in the work you did.ROSENTHAL: I take a lot of pride in the work that we did as a - you know, as an institution.BISAHA: Congress created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2010 after the 2008 financial crisis. Basically, it took the consumer protection duties of other agencies and put them under one roof, along with new supervising and rule-making powers. But throughout the past year, the Trump administration has tried to dismantle the agency through layoffs and cutting off funds. To do that, Trump made one of the CFPB's biggest critics the agency's acting director, Russell Vought.(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE CHARLIE KIRK SHOW\")RUSSELL VOUGHT: All they want to do is weaponize the tools of financial laws against basically small mom-and-pop lenders and other small financial institutions.BISAHA: That was Vought on \"The Charlie Kirk Show\" last fall criticizing some of the agency's staff. We reached out for comment from Vought's office and the CFPB and have not heard back. One of Vought's first actions was emailing workers and telling them to stop working. Bank examinations had been paused, cases were dismissed, regulations withdrawn, all while over the past year, the number of complaints against companies sent to the CFPB to investigate have nearly doubled. Lisa Rosenthal made a decision.ROSENTHAL: This work that I had carried out for these decades and that I cared so deeply about, this was no longer that work.BISAHA: She resigned in February. As for the workers who tried to stay, in April, 84% of them got layoff notices.HELEN SHAW: Everyone was upset.BISAHA: Helen Shaw was one of them.SHAW: Colleagues were crying. It was very worrisome.BISAHA: Shaw regulates interstate land sales, basically making sure property developers are telling the truth to potential buyers. Now, a district court judge has blocked those layoffs while the legal fight continues, and Shaw says she will not be forced out.SHAW: I'm determined to stay because I really believe in the mission of helping individual consumers.BISAHA: The CFPB gets funded from the Federal Reserve, so Vought's recent plan to stop the agency was to refuse to ask for those funds. But in December, that same district judge ordered Vought to make the request, and he did. The judge also wrote in her decision, the agency is, quote, \"hanging by a thread.\" Some work like Shaw's has resumed, but she says bank inspections have essentially been paused, and the threats to the agency's future have not gone away.SHAW: We're still at risk of losing our existence, I think.BISAHA: Even some critics that were never in favor of the CFPB don't like how the Trump administration's doing this.NORBERT MICHEL: Well, I'm conflicted.BISAHA: Norbert Michel runs the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives. And, yeah, he thinks the CFPB should not exist, that it's redundant. But he also thinks Congress - not the administration - should be the one dismantling the CFPB, and he's concerned there isn't any legislation instructing other agencies to fill in the consumer protection gap.MICHEL: Now you have a lot of those things that are not being done, so that gets me a little bit nervous.BISAHA: He does say there are still state and local agencies enforcing consumer protection laws. But Helen Shaw says weakening CFPB goes against one of President Trump's priorities.SHAW: We're the agency to help consumers with the affordability crisis.BISAHA: One of Trump's affordability proposals is capping credit card interest rates. Shaw says enforcing that would naturally be the CFPB's job.SHAW: It's confusing, right? - because they're stating that they'll pursue ways to alleviate the affordability crisis for families, yet we're not fully functional right now.BISAHA: And those early court actions that protected the CFPB from things like layoffs, those were just temporary. The legal battle that could decide the fate of the agency is likely to be long and drawn out - a battle Shaw calls existential.Stephan Bisaha, NPR News.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

Bishop Rob Hirschfeld was one of several community and faith leaders gathered in Concord, N.H., for a vigil for Renee Macklin Good just days after she was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis.    \n   Hirschfeld called out the \"cruelty, the injustice and the horror … unleashed in Minneapolis,\" and warned his clergy to prepare for \"a new era of martyrdom.\"   \"I've asked them to get their affairs in order to make sure they have their wills written,\" he said, \"because it may be that now is no longer the time for statements, but for us with our bodies to stand between the powers of this world and the most vulnerable.\"   Hirschfeld's comments quickly went viral.   \n   \"I was actually quite surprised to open up my phone and find my social media blowing up with my own bishop on it,\" said Reverend Jason Wells of St. Matthews Epsicopal Church in Goffstown, N.H.   Wells, a community organizer who regularly prays outside ICE offices, said he and many others took it as a great relief – and a validation of sorts – to hear the bishop speaking openly about the mounting anxiety felt by faith leaders around the nation who've been stepping up their public prayers and protests against ICE, and getting pelted with pepper rounds, roughed up and arrested.   \"People feel like he's giving voice to a feeling in the pit of their stomach about what is going on,\" said Wells. \"It's a relief to hear him naming a concern that I've had on my mind for a while.\"   \n   The Reverend Betsy Hess of St. Barnabas Episcopal Church in Berlin, N.H. added her voice to the chorus of \"amens\" and immediately emailed the bishop to thank him.   Hess believes clergy \"need to quit just being polite Episcopalians, and get out there and do stuff.\" But exactly what she would do, and what level of risk she's willing to take, is something she's still figuring out.   \"It used to be that … you might go to jail, and now you might get shot! So it makes us need to be a lot more brave,\" she said. \"I hope I would be brave, but I can't promise that I would be able to. But definitely, it's time to move beyond 'I won't do anything that has any risk whatsoever.'\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A priest claps as protesters conitnue anti-ICE demonstrations in Los Angeles, California, on June 9, 2025.\n                \n                    David Pashaee/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        David Pashaee/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty\n    \n\n   \n   Others, however, took issue with the bishop's words.   \n   \"My initial reaction is 'Oh boy, this isn't diffusing tension at all. This feels like a war cry,\" said the Reverend Tom Gartin of Faith Episcopal Church who heard about the bishop's comments from his parish in Cameron Park, California.   \"I didn't sign up to be a martyr,\" he said. \"I have a family and a congregation who rely on me. If I was gone tomorrow what would happen to them?\"   Gartin also bristled at the idea of a preacher making the case for physical resistance. Based on his assessment, mere statements have not \"moved the needle one bit.\" He sees the bishop's message as \"inflammatory,\" and at odds with one of Episcopalians' guiding tenets – Via Media – that calls for finding a middle path between extremes.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Demonstrators, including many clergy, protest near the immigration processing and detention facility on Oct. 10, 2025 in Broadview, Illinois.\n                \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Scott Olson/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Gartin said the focus of church leadership should be \"to do the work of peacemaking and to deescalate the tension we've seen all around us.\"   \"We're called to do the work of peacemaking and to deescalate the tension we see all around us because it doesn't serve anyone to become the next victim,\" he said, \"but it does serve everyone to build the next bridge.\"   Hirschfeld said he was surprised by the stir his comments created.   \"I don't feel like I said anything that was new,\" he said in an interview with NPR. \"In no way did I intend anything I said to be inciteful of violence or to invite it.\"   Hirschfeld said he understands how some may be hearing his words in ways he didn't intend, but he stands by his message.   \"What I said to the clergy (was) 'I'm just asking you to live your life without fear of death. Be prepared. I'm not asking you to go look for that bullet,'\" He said. \"I'm simply saying be ready, have your affairs in order, have your soul ready, in case you find yourself in trouble.\"   \n   That, Hirschfeld said, is the Episcopal tradition. At the vigil where he made his initial remarks, he listed several church activists who became martyrs, including Jonathan Daniels, a New Hampshire native and seminary student who travelled to Alabama in 1965 to help integrate public places and register Black voters. He took a bullet to protect a black teenager he accompanied.   \"Not everyone can be a Jonathan Daniels,\" Hirschfeld said, but \"we're increasingly called to go into places that feel dangerous.\"   That could be anything, he said, from his venture into the home of a neighbor whose political yard signs made him feel unsafe, to attending public demonstrations against ICE.   \"I increasingly wonder when I go to these rallies or even a peaceful vigil. There are people driving by, honking their horns,\" he said. \"I see people with guns in New Hampshire, this is an open-carry state, and it doesn't necessarily lend itself to a feeling of security and safety. But does that mean I shouldn't show up? I don't think so. I think it means I go and I should be prepared for whatever happens.\"   In a statement to NPR, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said interfering with federal law enforcement is a crime and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. The administration maintains the ICE agent who shot Renee Macklin Good was acting in self-defense.   DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called Hirschfeld's comments about martyrdom \"absurd,\" saying if he \"really wanted to take a stand for the vulnerable\" he would stand by the ICE agents who increasingly are under attack.   Hirschfeld said he does feel compassion for those agents.   \"It's definitely our Christian responsibility to extend love even to our enemies,\" he said, and to love all God's children, even those who may be \"swept up in a maelstrom of hatred and fear and power that is not godly.\"   \n   Hirschfeld added, \"I pray for everyone's conversion of heart.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      Stephen Fowler is NPR's go to reporter for document dumps. He explains how he approaches the day's biggest stories...and its most perplexing datasets.   \n\n    SARAH MCCAMMON, HOST:  If you've spent any time on the internet over the past few years, you've probably heard the name Jeffrey Epstein and the mystery surrounding the files tied to his case. Last month, just a few days before Christmas, some of those records were officially released. Not a handful of documents, but tens of thousands of pages - court filings, emails, photos, all landing at once and instantly lighting up social media, cable news and conspiracy theories.STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: When the first batch of files were released, well, the thing that I thought was something that I can't say on the radio.MCCAMMON: That's Stephen Fowler. He's a political reporter based in Atlanta. We worked together on NPR's Washington Desk.FOWLER: There are a few of us that had started combing through the documents as soon as they came out. We had to download them. We had to file, organize them and sort them and make sure we didn't miss anything, count the total number of pages and documents to see if there was anything missing or anything that needed to be formatted a different way.MCCAMMON: Sorting through that kind of data is exactly what Stephen does. He's become our go-to reporter for digging into large document dumps from government data to the Epstein files to figure out what they actually show and, just as importantly, what they don't show. And I'll admit, I picked up that beat for a day or two during the holidays when everybody was kind of jumping in on whatever needed to be done, and it is a lot of work. So for this week's Reporter's Notebook, I wanted to ask Stephen about his process. Where does he start when these files are released, and how does he go through them? It turns out the work starts long before those documents drop.FOWLER: We did have a story ready to go, saying, hey, the Justice Department has started releasing Epstein files, that we already had in advance of the backstory of how we got to this point, what the law said, directing the release, the political fallout for it. So we didn't really start from scratch.MCCAMMON: How do you go about going through these tens of thousands of pages and just figuring out what's there and what is important?FOWLER: So that prep work that I talked about was important because we didn't know what was going to be released, when it was going to be released, how it was going to be released - things like what file format it would be, if there were going to be pictures or PDFs or videos or anything like that. But we did know that there were tens of thousands of other files that had been made public already - court cases, Freedom of Information Act requests from other agencies. There were files on the FBI's vault and Epstein's private files that were turned over to Congress through a subpoena. So those of us that were looking methodically through these pages had a baseline to look at to understand what was already out there, what it looked like, and to be able to determine, is this new? Oh, this is redacted. Oh, that's a copy of the same email chain that we saw 10 pages ago, so move on to the next thing.There was a spreadsheet that we had and a Slack chat of notable pages and mentions and files that were being uncovered so that we could go back and track and document. And so everything that you saw online or heard people talk about on the air about the Epstein files, there was somebody that personally laid eyes on that document and what it said and made sure that it is, in fact, what it said, and here's where you could find it.MCCAMMON: Yeah, I mean, that was one of the challenges, at least that - during that brief time that I was working with some of these files. You know, a lot of it - I mean, this was taken - these were files that the Justice Department had received from all kinds of people in all kinds of places, right? And just even figuring out what's legitimate was tough.FOWLER: Yeah. I - this is where there were a lot of challenges because the files that were released were not in any sort of order, any sort of organization. There was no road map. There was no table of contents. There was no asterisk or disclaimer to say, hey, by the way, we have to release this by law, but it's actually something that's not true, which is actually something we ran into. There were files that were in there that were submitted tips from the public that contained conspiracy theories about Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein and other things that were completely unverifiable and unvetted, but they were part of the case file that were supposed to be released by law, so they were released. So it made it really, really hard to know what exactly we were looking at.Another thing that made it hard to look at, Sarah, was the sheer volume of things that were redacted. I mean, there were pages and pages where all you could see was black boxes. There was no hidden word there or, you know, this part here. There were just complete pages that were just completely blacked out and blank. So it was difficult to glean information from black rectangles.There was, however, an email sent by federal agents after Epstein was arrested in 2019 for allegedly sex trafficking minors. It mentioned 10 possible co-conspirators, including Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. Most of the other names on that list are redacted, and the law made it clear that information like that should be released if it was there. So really, the big story coming out of the Epstein files ended up being all of the information and files and possibilities that were not released.MCCAMMON: Now, it wasn't just the Epstein files. You also got to dig through some files from DOGE, which I think we all still remember was the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. You were really active in sorting through those during the first few months of Trump's second term. And you broke some news. I mean, tell me more about that. How did you go about looking through those DOGE files?FOWLER: Well, it's a lot different looking at federal government data than a bunch of disjointed documents and files from court cases and things. I mean, the federal government - I don't know if people realize this - has one of the richest and most thorough and easily accessible datasets for things you could imagine. Anything you think of that the government does or thinks about, there is probably a dataset probably sitting there waiting for you to download it. The trick is knowing what you're looking at and how it's used.So over the course of last year, I tracked the change in federal spending data, tens of thousands of alterations to federal contracts under DOGE. There was federal leasing statistics, other things like that that I looked at to understand how the government was working or wasn't working and if DOGE was actually doing the things it claimed it was doing. I mean, showing your work looks a lot different, too, because with the Epstein files, you can say, hey, on this page with this file number, this thing was said.With DOGE data, there were so many spreadsheets. I mean, my editors can tell you - spreadsheet on spreadsheet on spreadsheet that had meticulous calculations that came from on-record and background interviews with all these different experts in these areas to make sure that I understood what I was looking at. And did I mention there were spreadsheets? And so it took a lot of effort to be able to show the work and make sure that I knew what I was looking at so then I could tell the audience what we're looking at.I think the biggest example of that was DOGE's infamous wall of receipts. It was the website where DOGE still claims to track how much taxpayer money it saved through its changes. The data DOGE was putting out there didn't match the source data that the federal government put out. There were overstatements and errors and inaccuracies, and that took a lot of time and effort to kind of - to sort of compare these data sources to get to the truth behind things.MCCAMMON: What else has all of this data reporting during this first year of Trump's second term - what has it taught you about how to cover this moment in politics and what it might mean?FOWLER: I think it's even more important to show the work, to bring receipts and to give people those primary sources that I've been using to do this coverage. One, I want people to trust the reporting and trust what I have to say, and they can see for themselves how I got there and also kind of peel back the curtain for the public to learn how to look at this information on their own. And also, numbers are hard to bring to the radio. If you put too many of them out there, people's eyes start to gloss over. If you have too few, you risk kind of underselling your findings and leaving out important context.So spending the last year really grounding a lot of my reporting in this data - even if not every story starts out with a, here's this insert number fact here to use - I mean, it does help contextualize the scope or the scale or significance of what's going on in politics, whether it's the small fraction of Epstein files or the 58th lawmaker retiring or federal spending.MCCAMMON: That's Stephen Fowler, a political reporter with NPR's Washington Desk.

It's a comical line of questioning for the 25-year-old former financial risk analyst, who estimates he clocks about 100 hours a week on prediction markets Kalshi and Polymarket. After a while, understandably, some of the bets blur together. What are his net profits, though? That's a number he's got at the ready.   \"Last month, I made $100,000,\" said Sudeith, who does most of his trading from his laptop while bed-lounging in his Atlanta apartment. He's executing so many orders on the sites, he says, that he has no time to cook. So he DoorDashes every meal.   \n   \"My last salary was $75,000 a year, so I left my job to trade full time,\" he said    Some of his biggest hauls in recent months include lucrative stakes on Time Magazine's person of the year ($40,236), the most-searched person on Google last year ($11,083) and a wager on the New York City mayoral race ($7,448). And of course, a couple thousand here, a couple thousand there on questions like, how many times will a sports announcer say \"air ball\"? And will President Trump use the phrase \"drill baby drill\" at an upcoming press conference? (Traders had $500,000 on the line on this market.)   \"I'm not a fan of Trump, though I do spend most of my day listening to him and tracking what he is doing,\" said Sudeith, noting that whatever candidate in the next presidential race is the most friendly to prediction markets has his vote. \"I could be a single-issue voter. If they're super-super heavy anti-prediction markets, it would be hard for me to vote for them.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sudeith says he made $100,000 last month on prediction market apps.\n                \n                    Evan Frost for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Evan Frost for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   The boom of online prediction markets is being driven by the Sudeiths of the world. He's one of millions of traders logging on every day to services like Kalshi and Polymarket to place high-dollar and incredibly risky bets on the outcome of the world in real time, whether it's an award host's turn of phrase to the number of migrants the U.S. will deport this year.   \n   Much like previous financial crazes around meme stocks and NFTs, true believers view prediction markets through a stick-it-to-the-man prism. It's a movement against the elite establishment, they say, whether it's the mainstream media, pollsters or government agencies. This growing group of renegade traders maintain that core truths emerge only after thousands of people express their opinions with their pocketbooks.   \n   \"Markets are the most efficient way to get to real information,\" Sudeith said. \"If you're watching on election night, I think you'll know who the winners are before the news can report it.\"   While the industry may position itself an alternative to the mainstream, the mainstream is embracing it.   CNN and CNBC have struck deals to incorporate Kalshi prediction markets into coverage. The Wall Street Journal's owner, Dow Jones, is partnering with Polymarket, as did the Golden Globe awards this year, with announcers updating viewers on Polymarket odds before every commercial break.   Founders of the prediction markets apps say they enable people to turn their opinion into a financial hedge against things like inflation or a government shutdown, yet skeptics say that is twisty and self-serving logic.   \"They are gambling sites no different than FanDuel or DraftKings, a corner bookie, or a casino in Las Vegas,\" said Dennis Kelleher, chief executive of Better Markets, a nonprofit that pushes for Wall Street reform.   Kalshi says 'there's no house,' not all agree   Traditional gambling often means wagering against \"the house,\" where the casino acts like the banker, extracting fees and maintaining a competitive edge.   Prediction markets like Kalshi say they're different.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Advertisements by the company Kalshi predict a victory for Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral election before the polls closed on Nov. 4, 2025.\n                \n                    Olga Fedorova/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Olga Fedorova/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Here's how they work: A staff member creates \"a market,\" often after one has been suggested by a user, like what will President Trump say at his next Oval Office briefing?   Then anyone can propose a \"strike,\" the lingo for a term that's being bet on, whether, for instance, Trump will say \"Greenland,\" or \"Minnesota,\" or some other word or phrase.   \n   Kalshi staff pick what terms will be bet on for both sides of that \"yes\" and \"no\" wager.   \n   In order to work, however, there needs to be money on both the \"yes\" and the \"no\" side of the market, so Kalshi relies on institutional partners, like the hedge fund Susquehanna International, or everyday users with large enough portfolios to front the cash. This is called being a \"market maker.\" Kalshi provides financial perks and data access to traders who do this.   But because traders are competing with other traders, Kalshi argues there is no house involved in these transactions.   Several federal lawsuits against Kalshi have challenged this notion, claiming that the Wall Street firms that Kalshi taps are indistinguishable from a traditional \"house.\"   One suit filed this month in the Northern District of Illinois highlights that the company itself has a separate entity, Kalshi Trading, that supplies cash on the opposite side of trades.   \"Thus, Kalshi users are betting against the house exactly the same way it would in a brick-and-mortar casino,\" wrote lawyer Russell Busch in the complaint.   Kalshi denies this. Company spokeswoman Elisabeth Diana told NPR that market makers merely price bids and asks and do not have a competitive advantage.   \"Market making is completely different from being a house, because a house has monopoly pricing power, whereas market makers compete with thousands of other market makers to take bids,\" she said.   The Trump family invests in prediction markets. The administration is taking a friendly policy stance   While the Biden administration sought to rein in this industry, Trump's regulators are breaking down barriers to allow it to flourish.   More than $2 billion is now traded every week on Kalshi, an amount the company says is 1,000% higher compared to the Biden years.   Polymaket, which was forced in 2022 to shut down in the U.S. for operating as an unlicensed betting site, recently won the Trump administration's blessing to re-launch in the U.S.   \n   The Trump family is also getting in on the action. The president's son, Donald Trump Jr., is on the board of Polymarket, and his venture capital firm invests in the company. He is also a \"strategic adviser\" to Kalshi. Truth Social, the president's social media site, is planning to launch its own prediction market called Truth Predict.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Donald Trump Jr. speaks during The Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas on May 27, 2025.\n                \n                    Ian Maule/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Ian Maule/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The explosive growth and permissive regulatory environment has ignited a debate about the underbelly of an industry that essentially turns many features of modern life into potential monetary wins and losses. Fears persist that when elections, politics and foreign invasions become a gamble that insiders could abuse their access for profit and market odds could influence what actually happens.   Then there's the most prosaic, but perhaps more immediate worry: That the prediction markets gamify trading with slickly designed apps, one-click checking account deposits and constant push alerts, catering to compulsive online bettors. They're not unlike other app-based trading platforms, but now almost anything is a potential betting opportunity, which economists and other financial experts say can enable a new generation of gambling addicts.   While individual bets on Kalshi are not public, the app has a leaderboard showcasing top profit winners.   That offers hope to some traders who turn to Discord and Reddit to discuss how losses have set them back.   \"I'm down 2000 this week when I was up 1200 last week,\" wrote a Kalshi trader who goes by Educational_Pain_407 on Reddit. \"Lost it all and keep trying to claw it back. So I don't know what to tell you but right now I don't have enough to pay my bills in my bank account so I can't bet even if I wanted to.\"   There are three federal lawsuits against Kalshi seeking class action status alleging the apps have sucked young traders into gambling addiction.   \n   Officials at Kalshi have said if traders \"lose their shirt that's on them,\" and even the Reddit user behind on his bills concedes it's a matter of personal responsibility: \"Live and learn and pay for your mistakes. The consequences of being an adult,\" he wrote recently.   While online sportsbooks and gambling are nothing new, the rapid speed, volume of cash and ease at which transactions flow across prediction market apps set them apart from other forms of betting, according to legal and financial experts.   \"Like sports betting, these platforms can be addictive. It is the adrenaline rush that the target demographic is chasing,\" said Melinda Roth, a visiting professor at Washington and Lee University's School of Law who studies prediction markets. \"I do believe this is a looming public health crisis.\"   Decoding the lingo: 'Mogged,' 'Fudded,' 'PMT'   Evan Semet, 26, is another diehard prediction markets trader who left his salaried position in finance as a quantitative researcher after he started raking in six figures a month on Kalshi.\"I don't feel the need for another job at the moment,\" he said.   His first golden ticket came via bets on the number of Transportation Security Agency screenings that happen across a certain period on Polymarket.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Evan Semet quit his job in finance to do prediction market trading full time.\n                \n                    Meredith Nierman/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Meredith Nierman/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Semet said he set up a dedicated server through Amazon Web Services to host statistical models that he runs to help him decide where to place bets.   \"It was pretty modelable,\" he said, noting that he leans on the finance savvy he gleaned at a trading firm to make money on predictions. \"Most day traders draw some shapes on a chart and think it has some statistical significance but it's really just astrology,\" he said. \"They're old-school gamblers going off of intuition. I try to be driven by statistics.\"   To stay tapped in, he's often toggling between multiple live trades on one screen and following a discussion among other traders on the social network Discord.   \n   Keeping up on what's happening there requires understanding a hyper-specific type of lingo that's a blend of Generation Alpha and Gen Z slang, repurposed finance terminology and a grab-bag of other cultural influences from gaming to crypto to the gutter humor of fringe sites like 4chan.   If you've been out-maneuvered by another trader, you've been \"mogged.\"   If a market has \"fudded,\" people are selling their positions out of fear, uncertainty and doubt. A \"rulescuck\" is someone who is a stickler for the rules of a betting market and will try to win on a technicality.   A \"bondsharp\" is a well-known community member who frequently puts up money on the other side of a bet.   These are just a handful of the terms required to stay apace of the chats on Discord, where PMTs are often discussing their full port (prediction market trader, and full portfolio, of course).    Loading... \n   \"It is a good amount of terminology. It's borrowing lingo and terms from stuff I've heard at real trading firms mixed with online pop culture,\" Semet said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                \"Sometimes I prefer to not look at all and see how I did later,\" Semet said.\n                \n                    Meredith Nierman/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Meredith Nierman/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Prediction market trading can be a compulsive sport for many of them, who admit they can be dopamine junkies. Others prefer to avoid the pressure-cooker feeling of watching a bet win or lose live.   \"It's an antsy, gambling-like feeling watching it all happen live,\" Semet said. \"It's intense, almost feels like the fog of war, trying to decide what to do,\" he said. \"Sometimes I prefer to not look at all and see how I did later.\"   How predictions markets got into politics   Kalshi's big day came, as it were, on Election Day in November 2020.   That's when they got word that Trump's Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates futures contracts, greenlit it as a \"designated contract market,\" a blessing that essentially gave the platform a license to operate as a financial exchange.   It was a long time coming.   \n   For years before that, Kalshi's co-founders Tarek Mansour and Luana Lopes Lara, former Wall Street traders who met at MIT, had been battling a skeptical CFTC, which had long rejected similar applications over concerns that an events contract platform would operate a type of gambling outside the purview of state gambling commissions. Regulators also feared the bets invited insiders to rig the outcomes of events from sports to elections.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Tarek Mansour, (left) and Luana Lopes Lara are co-founders of Kalshi.\n                \n                    Alexey Yurenev/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alexey Yurenev/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   As Kalshi hired lawyers and lobbyists leading up to their CFTC approval, another prediction market, where most are betting with cryptocurrencies, Polymarket, was exploding in growth. It, however, had not bothered to even try to receive federal buy-in. The Biden administration shut down the exchange for operating without a license. Now, Polymarket has the CFTC on its side, and is staging a U.S. comeback.   Two developments helped Polymarket's return: the company acquired a little-known derivatives exchange QCX, which had already obtained CFTC approval. And the Trump administration's CTFC and Justice Department abandoned investigations into Polymarket.   States, however, are on the attack. Massachusetts has sued to push Kalshi out of the state. Eight other states, including New York, New Jersey and Maryland, have sent the company cease and desist letters alleging that it is operating as an illegal and unlicensed sports gambling site. The motivation is clear: Gambling brings in serious tax revenue for states, while prediction markets bring in none.   For both Kalshi and Polymarket, one of the most controversial areas of prediction market trading is elections, an issue Biden-era regulators took Kalshi to court over.   Under the 1936 Commodity Exchange Act, which was updated in 2008 after the financial crisis, future event contracts cannot involve terrorism, assassinations or \"games,\" but political betting is not explicitly banned.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Polymarket prediction market website is seen on a computer screen.\n                \n                    Wyatte Grantham-Philips/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Wyatte Grantham-Philips/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Biden administration lawyers argued that placing wagers on races amounted to a game, a word that is not defined at all in the law. Election bets, the regulators contended, could turbocharge the spread of political misinformation and create financial incentives for voters to cast a ballot even when it's contrary to a voter's political views.   \n   It also puts the CFTC in the awkward position of having to investigate news, whether real or fabricated, that moves a prediction market. Former CFTC officials told NPR that the agency has never been equipped to be \"an election cop.\"   The federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. rejected that framing and handed Kalshi a major victory. The court also pointed out that the harm these markets would cause the government was not \"concrete\" enough.   The Trump administration dropped the appeal, unleashing what is expected to be an unprecedented torrent of prediction market cash into this year's midterm elections, which is raising alarms among those pushing for stricter regulations on this industry.   \"AI, deepfakes, and other nefarious activities to attack candidates could easily impact the betting activity and odds, as well as the actual outcome of elections,\" said Kelleher of Better Markets. \"They don't really care who wins or loses. They only care about the volume of bets and driving that volume as high as possible.\"   Regulators appear unprepared. The CFTC usually has five commissioners but currently only has one. Meanwhile, Kalshi's board includes former CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz, who was among the officials who gave the platform its federal approval in 2020.   Former CFTC Commissioner Kristin Johnson, who left the agency in 2025, said that lack of commissioners comes on top of high levels of turnover among the most senior staff lawyers.   \"We're essentially asking the CFTC to get involved in engaging and policing an element of our democratic process that we really haven't thought carefully enough about,\" Johnson said.   Insider trading scrutiny grows   Before a U.S. operation ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, one trader on Polymarket banked a nearly half-million-dollar profit on a bet Maduro would not remain president for long.   While the trader's identity remains a mystery, speculation continues to rattle around the internet about whether the person had insider information. The episode has renewed scrutiny on how the companies ensure bets aren't rigged.   \n   On Discord, when traders see a large bet placed that immediately stands out as an outlier, cries of \"the market is insidered\" are common. Proving it is another matter.   As is often the case on the platforms, open-shut evidence of insider trading is elusive. Kalshi requires a government-issued ID to sign up in order to trace any possible market manipulation back to a real person. Polymarket does not, but it has yet to publicly re-launch its U.S. app. Internal and third-party surveillance tools, the companies say, are on the lookout for unusual activity.   Congress has begun to take notice. Following the Maduro trade, Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-NY, and 30 other Democrats, sponsored legislation banning federal officials from using prediction markets to trade on policies or political outcomes using non-public information.   Being up against an insider is always a risk, said full-time prediction markets trader Semet.   \"There's always going to be someone who has more information than you, unless you're the insider,\" he said. \"There are certain accounts that miraculously have every single Google and OpenAI release date nailed perfectly, and it's like, all right, just don't fade those people,\" he said using the slang word for voting against another trader.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Being up against an insider is always a risk, said full-time prediction markets trader Semet.\n                \n                    Meredith Nierman/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Meredith Nierman/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   When asked if he thinks Kalshi and Polymarket are doing enough to combat insider trading, he gave a blunt assessment: \"F*** no,\" Semet said. \"I really don't think they care.\"   \"Tailing,\" or making a bet joining in on a suspiciously large bet is common on the platforms. Bloomberg on Monday reported on a new tool that allows traders to get alerts when anomalous transactions occur so they can potentially cash in on what could be a winning wager.   From the vantage point of these traders, nearly everything has a trading implication.   And that kind of thinking can fuel conspiratorial theories about why something did or did not happen.   \n   Take, for instance, a recent White House press briefing in which press secretary Karoline Leavitt left the room seconds before hitting 65 minutes. To most, that was unremarkable.   Yet on Kalshi, that looked like a secret message, because many thousands of dollars in bets were at stake that she would cross the 65-minute mark.   The chatter about Leavitt was mentioned on CNBC, which got the attention of traders on Discord, who wondered if this or another incident will ever lead to a PMT, prediction market trader, testifying in Washington about rigging the markets.   \"PMT getting called before Congress,\" wrote a Discord user, whose handle is \"permanent resident of hell,\" they added: \"Let's get a market on it.\"\n",

Kennedy Jr., pictured at the White House earlier this month, promised he would set up the Administration for a Healthy America back in March 2025. It doesn't exist yet.\n                \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was just a few weeks into his new job as health secretary in March 2025 when he unveiled a dramatic plan to remake the Department of Health and Human Services.   Kennedy quickly determined that the size and structure of his agency — which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes for Health — was \"incomprehensible.\" He said it was bloated and that explained why federal health officials had failed to improve Americans' health.   \"We're going to eliminate an entire alphabet soup of departments and agencies while preserving their core functions,\" he said in a social media video. Those \"core functions\" would be preserved, he explained, \"by merging them into a new organization called the Administration for a Healthy America or AHA.\"    \n   The name plays off of Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" slogan.   \n   Weeks into the second year of the second Trump term, many staff and departments of HHS have been eliminated in chaotic cuts handed down on April 1, 2025, but the Administration for a Healthy America does not yet exist.   There's no public information about when AHA might be created, and very little about what staff and programs it would include.   Not a normal process   The most recent public document from HHS about AHA was a budget request published in June. It says that the new agency will \"focus on areas including primary care, environmental health, HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, mental and behavioral health, and workforce development.\"   Those programs are spread out across health agencies, including at the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and several centers at CDC.   Congress didn't include any money for AHA in the latest HHS funding bill. Staffers on committees with jurisdiction over HHS tell NPR there have not even been meetings with Kennedy's staff to help secure support for new funding or authorization to stand up the new agency in the future.   \n   Instead, political appointees at HHS are holding secretive planning meetings about AHA, according to seven current and former employees at federal health agencies who spoke to NPR.   HHS would not answer NPR's questions for this story, but in a statement said that planning for AHA was still underway.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Humphrey Building in Washington, D.C. is the headquarters of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n                \n                    Jose Luis Magana/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jose Luis Magana/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Behind the scenes, rushed and secretive meetings   At CDC in Atlanta, a senior official describes a constant demand for information about budgets, staff and public health work. It's not even clear who is asking for the data or what they plan to do with it, they say, but they understand it is related to AHA planning.   \"All that you're told is that 'they' are asking for this information and they want it now — or they wanted it yesterday.\" The official asked NPR not to use their name because of fears of professional retribution for speaking publicly without authorization. \"'They' can refer to a small circle of people around Kennedy that he trusts, who are either unnamed, or you'll receive a different name each time, so you're never really quite sure where the ask is coming from.\"   A different senior official at HHS, who also asked that NPR not to use their name for fear of professional retribution, echoed that description of political appointees connected to Kennedy holding \"constant meetings in secret about what this new AHA is supposed to look like, but they don't share with anyone in the civil service.\" The source adds there are rumors that Kennedy's team is \"going to stand up AHA in the next few months, like in the spring.\"   \n   There's no public information about who is in charge of planning to create the agency, and HHS did not make anyone available to interview for this story.   \"What does this mean?\"   Dr. Karen Hacker says the process of restructuring HHS has been \"like building and flying the plane at the same time,\" she says. When Kennedy began as secretary, Hacker was the director of CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. She was put on administrative leave on April 1 — along with thousands of others at HHS — then retired from CDC. She now works as an adjunct professor and health policy fellow at Emory University.   \n   She says even though her center worked on chronic diseases, a central priority of AHA, her team was sidelined by the political appointees executing Kennedy's vision. \"We never were asked about strategies for reductions, or about what would be best to move, or whether any of these programs were authorized [by Congress],\" she says. \"My center alone had over 40 line items with specific appropriations language.\"   None of that seemed to matter. A third of the staff in her center were cut during the April 1 reduction in force, and the entire center was slated to be eliminated in President Trump's 2026 budget, published in May. \"I do remember having conversations about — 'What does this mean? Wait a second, are we not going to AHA?'\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. Some centers of CDC are supposed to become part of AHA, but no details about logistics are public.\n                \n                    Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Then and now, there are big logistical questions about how a center in Atlanta with hundreds of staff members and a $1.4 billion budget could become part of a new agency, possibly in Maryland or Washington, D.C.   When it comes to AHA, Hacker says: \"The question remains — what are their plans? Are they planning to roll out a big reorg? Are they planning to consider other alternatives?\"   A former secretary is \"baffled\"   If Kennedy and his team at HHS wanted to reorganize the Department of Health and Human Services and enlist Congress to authorize a new agency, the public would be seeing a very different process unfold.   When it comes to AHA, \"there is no budget authority to create a new agency, there's no congressional framework for what that looks like, there's no staff numbers,\" says Kathleen Sebelius, the former governor of Kansas who served as health secretary under President Obama.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Kathleen Sebelius, pictured at a panel event in 2016, set up the Administration for Community Living when she was President Obama's health secretary.\n                \n                    Charlie Riedel/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Charlie Riedel/AP\n    \n\n   \n   That lack of engagement with Congress, she says, also shows in Kennedy's disregard for lawmakers' intent when he eliminated staff and programs during the DOGE-fueled firings in April 2025.   \"What I found when I was [secretary] is that a lot of the entities that seemed to me to be redundant had underlying congressional authorization — they passed a specific bill, it had specific appropriations — and in my day, with my president, we paid a lot of attention to that,\" she says. The firings directed by Kennedy and DOGE included many offices required by Congress that have not been reconstituted elsewhere at HHS, despite his promise that the \"core functions\" of the health agencies would be preserved.   \n   \"A lot of what I see at least in these restructuring documents under Secretary Kennedy just absolutely are baffling to me,\" Sebelius says. She mentions the plan to dismantle the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), which responds to natural disasters and pandemic threats, and the elimination of several HHS regional offices that states rely on.   Sebelius also has the perspective of having created a new agency during her tenure: the Administration for Community Living, which helps seniors and people with disabilities live at home.   \"We took a year to have listening sessions to really bring a firm proposal,\" Sebelius says. \"It ultimately was in a budget document, and had staff recommendations and jurisdiction recommendations.\"    She says by that time, \"we had buy-in from — not only key members on the Hill — but key members in the communities across the country.\"   When it comes to the Administration for a Healthy America, \"I don't see any of that going on,\" she says.    Incidentally, the Administration for Community Living is one of the entities slated to be dismantled as an independent agency and integrated into AHA.   Staff numbers confusion   While Trump administration officials work quietly on a plan to create an AHA entity at the agency without input or funding from Congress, the American public is left with health agencies diminished by a year of personnel cuts.   Exactly how much HHS has shrunk because of Kennedy's restructuring, DOGE-led buyouts, and retirements, is difficult to pin down. HHS has declined multiple requests from NPR to provide the current number of staff, but the stated goal when the reorganization was announced in March was to reduce the staff by 20,000 people or about 20% of the workforce.   When Kennedy took office, 88,731 staff worked across HHS, according to an official staffing plan from November 2024. The latest version of that plan, dated September 2025, shows 79,717 HHS employees, which represents a cut of only 10%.   \n   It's not clear if that headcount includes staff whose firings have been blocked by the courts and are on administrative leave. Hacker, the former CDC center director, knows of employees who have been in that situation since April. \"They're getting a paycheck, they're getting their benefits, they're just not working in their jobs,\" she says. Other staff who were fired have been brought back.   \n   Just this week, 400 occupational safety staff at CDC who had been on administrative leave were suddenly ordered back to work without explanation. And about a thousand HHS workers fired during the shutdown were brought back as part of a deal to reopen the government. They wonder if they'll be re-fired at the end of January when that deal expires.   All of the agencies that are slated to become part of AHA have had deep RIFs, or reductions in force, especially CDC and SAMHSA, the mental health and substance abuse agency. \"There were people in my center [at CDC] that got riffed multiple times — some were brought back and then some were riffed again,\" says Hacker. \"It's a very chaotic scenario.\"   An exercise in branding?   The current CDC official predicts that Kennedy and his allies will create a pilot or initiative at HHS \"by hook or by crook\" to be able to claim success in creating the Administration for a Healthy America. \"They want things fast, they want it to be bright and shiny, they want to capture the attention of the public, and they want it to look like a success up front.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Secretary Kennedy is pictured at an event called the MAHA Summit in November. Kennedy interviewed Vice President JD Vance, and it was carried live on Fox News.\n                \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The official does not think it will be an actual new agency funded and backed by Congress. They think Kennedy will find teams and initiatives that were already happening at HHS related to nutrition, fitness and chronic disease prevention and \"brand\" them as \"MAHA wins\" to assert that the secretary accomplished the goals of the new AHA agency, without having to engage with Congress.   \n   Sebelius is skeptical of the idea that Kennedy can create anything close to a new agency on his own. \"You can do a lot on paper and play musical chairs all you want, but at the end of the day, they're gonna have to have some funding and some jurisdiction.\"   She says lawmakers in Congress are either going to buy into Kennedy's plan to create AHA or reject it. \"It's really unclear to me what they're gonna do.\"\n",

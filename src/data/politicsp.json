Republicans' plan would fund the government for seven weeks.</p>   <p>The plan supported by most Senate Democrats would fund the government in exchange for extending Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, reversing cuts to health spending under the One Big Beautiful Bill act and limiting Trump's ability to withhold funds appropriated by Congress.</p>   \n   <p>In an interview with <em>Morning Edition</em>, Van Hollen described expiring ACA subsidies as a \"ticking time bomb\" that could drastically increase consumers' monthly health premiums. Most of the 24 million people who buy health insurance through ACA marketplaces rely on the subsidies, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/02/nx-s1-5559810/shutdown-aca-health-care-premium-subsidies\" target=\"_blank\"><u>according to health policy research group KFF</u></a>.</p>   <p>Van Hollen also said he expects his home state of Maryland, where federal workers make up <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/press/new-epi-resource-calculates-how-many-federal-workers-live-in-every-state-county-and-congressional-district\" target=\"_blank\"><u>more than 7 percent of the workforce</u></a>, to fight the Trump administration over its decision <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/02/nx-s1-5560869/energy-trump-democrats-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\"><u>to cancel billions of dollars in green energy </u></a>funding and possibly fire many more <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/02/nx-s1-5560994/trump-vought-shutdown-democrats\" target=\"_blank\"><u>federal employees</u></a>.</p>   <p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/03/nx-s1-5561131/government-shutdown-white-house-karoline-leavitt\" target=\"_blank\"><u>defended the Trump administration's actions in an interview last week</u></a>, saying the White House is attempting to \"save money in a responsible way that respects the American taxpayer's money, especially when we are in this financial crunch right now, in the midst of a Democrat shutdown.\"</p>   \n   <p>Speaking to NPR's Steve Inskeep, Van Hollen discussed Democrats' efforts to push back against the administration.</p>   <p><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>      <p><strong>Steve Inskeep: </strong>I just want to remind people of the numbers. Republicans would need seven Senate Democrats in order to prevail and reopen the government. They do have three [including Sen. Angus King of Maine, who is an independent but caucuses with Democrats]. Are any more of your colleagues defecting?</p>   <p><strong>Sen. Chris Van Hollen: </strong>Well, Steve, I think it's important that people understand that Democrats have voted four times to reopen the government. We want to reopen the government without giving Donald Trump a blank check to continue his lawless activities, including, by the way, taking what they called a chainsaw to federal agencies. And we want to address the issue that Donald Trump claimed to care about, which was rising costs and prices in the country. And they did leave a ticking time bomb in place on health care. And if we don't defuse that bomb, people's health care costs are going to go through the roof. So, yes, we have put our proposal out there. Republicans have voted that down four times in the Senate. And as you heard, the House isn't even showing up.</p>   \n   <p><em>Editor's Note: Democratic Senators John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada also voted for Republicans' funding plan.</em></p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5031x3354+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F45%2F3c670f364a1bb77549e913c46d98%2Fap25191605420339.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5031x3354+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F45%2F3c670f364a1bb77549e913c46d98%2Fap25191605420339.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5031x3354+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F45%2F3c670f364a1bb77549e913c46d98%2Fap25191605420339.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5031x3354+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F45%2F3c670f364a1bb77549e913c46d98%2Fap25191605420339.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5031x3354+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F45%2F3c670f364a1bb77549e913c46d98%2Fap25191605420339.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5031x3354+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F45%2F3c670f364a1bb77549e913c46d98%2Fap25191605420339.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5031x3354+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F45%2F3c670f364a1bb77549e913c46d98%2Fap25191605420339.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5031x3354+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F45%2F3c670f364a1bb77549e913c46d98%2Fap25191605420339.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5031x3354+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F45%2F3c670f364a1bb77549e913c46d98%2Fap25191605420339.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5031x3354+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F45%2F3c670f364a1bb77549e913c46d98%2Fap25191605420339.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5031x3354+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F45%2F3c670f364a1bb77549e913c46d98%2Fap25191605420339.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5031x3354+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F45%2F3c670f364a1bb77549e913c46d98%2Fap25191605420339.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5031x3354+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F45%2F3c670f364a1bb77549e913c46d98%2Fap25191605420339.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5031x3354+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F45%2F3c670f364a1bb77549e913c46d98%2Fap25191605420339.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5031x3354+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F45%2F3c670f364a1bb77549e913c46d98%2Fap25191605420339.jpg\" alt=\"Sen.

And all Democrats want to make sure we don't see an explosion in health care costs for the American people.</p>   <p><strong>Inskeep: </strong>I want to ask about the lawless activity that you mentioned. You've made the shutdown about health care tax credits, for the most part. But you now raise this other issue, which I know Democrats want to deal with in the longer term. The president does what he wants, including violating laws and saying the law is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has largely deferred to him, at least temporarily, which does leave Congress. Are you saying you hope somehow to get a restriction on him out of Congress in the coming days?</p>   <p><strong>Van Hollen: </strong>Well, if you look at our proposal, the one that we have been voting for, it does include provisions to address this illegal unilateral withholding of funds from Congress. Even [Republicans] Sen. Susan Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski have acknowledged that when the president unilaterally withholds funds, that that's illegal and we can change that. And in our proposal, we do create guardrails and safeguards against that.</p>   <p><strong>Inskeep: </strong>The administration is moving to punish or retaliate against Democrats. Last week we heard the administration said it was canceling clean energy projects in 14 blue states – $7.6 billion in total for clean energy. And I noticed that one of the states affected is your state, Maryland. Have you heard from the people affected and how much damage is done here?</p>   \n   <p><strong>Van Hollen: </strong>Yes, they have been threatening to do that. They haven't necessarily invoked that yet. But this is another example of what the Donald Trump administration has been doing since Day One. I mean, they've been withholding funds from Maryland, from FEMA projects, meaning projects to help some of our communities prepare and mitigate against future damages in hurricanes. They've been withholding funds for [the National Institutes of Health]. So it is important to recognize that they've been shutting down parts of the government since Day One and their threat to fire people in a shutdown just shows how vindictive they are. There's nothing in the law that gives the president any more power to fire people in a shutdown. In fact, as [the American Federation of Government Employees] states in the lawsuit they filed two days ago, there's actually less authority for a president to be able to do that in a shutdown.</p>   <p><strong>Inskeep: </strong>This is really interesting about the clean energy grants because it was my understanding that Russell Vought, the president's budget director, said in a social media post these were cancelled. It sounds like you just feel they have threatened to do that and have not really stopped the flow of money.</p>   <p><strong>Van Hollen: </strong>Well, they did say that they've canceled it. I haven't heard directly from the people on the ground that this fund has been totally terminated. But I expect them to follow through on that threat. I also expect that the state of Maryland will be part of another lawsuit against these illegal actions by the Trump administration.</p>   \n   <p><strong>Inskeep: </strong>You did mention the possibility of firing people, which they've repeatedly threatened to do. A lot of your constituents are federal workers. If they start firing people on a large scale, how, if at all, will you respond?</p>   <p><strong>Van Hollen: </strong>I will respond in two ways. Number one, supporting the litigation — the lawsuit that's already been filed by the federal employees union, making it clear it's illegal. And also doing everything I can to reopen the government — but again, without giving the president this blank check – and dealing with the health care cost issue.</p>   \n   <p><em>This digital article was edited by Ally Schweitzer.

Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, in which he called for a military response to protests over George Floyd's murder. In a lengthy <a href=\"https://x.com/jeremymbarr/status/1283058025654366209\" target=\"_blank\">resignation letter</a>, Weiss accused her colleagues of harassment and argued that the <em>Times</em> was too influenced by its left-leaning critics online.</p>   <p>Weiss, along with her sister Suzy Weiss and her spouse Nellie Bowles, started The Free Press as a newsletter (originally titled Common Sense) the following year, <a href=\"https://www.thefp.com/about\" target=\"_blank\">calling it</a> a \"new media company … built on the ideals that once were the bedrock of great American journalism: honesty, doggedness, and fierce independence.\"</p>   <p>The Free Press developed into a full-fledged media company in 2022, expanding its offerings into podcasts and live events. Its investigations and commentaries largely scrutinize political and cultural issues like <a href=\"https://www.thefp.com/p/i-thought-i-was-saving-trans-kids\" target=\"_blank\">gender-affirming health care</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thefp.com/p/david-zweig-covid-lies-school-lockdowns-destroyed-kids-lives\" target=\"_blank\">COVID-19 lockdowns</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thefp.com/p/end-dei-woke-capture\" target=\"_blank\">DEI programs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thefp.com/p/the-witch-trials-of-jk-rowling\" target=\"_blank\">J.K. Rowling's anti-trans views</a>.</p>   <p>It's where then-NPR editor Uri Berliner <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/04/16/1244962042/npr-editor-uri-berliner-suspended-essay\" target=\"_blank\">published his essay</a> arguing the public radio network had lost America's trust (he joined The Free Press as a senior editor mere months later). The publication, like Weiss herself, is also known for its staunchly pro-Israel views, especially in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks and Israel's ensuing war in Gaza.</p>   \n   <p>The Free Press has built a sizable following. It has grown its subscriber base by 86% over the past year to a total of 1.5 million people, <a href=\"https://www.paramount.com/press/paramount-announces-deal-to-acquire-the-free-press\" target=\"_blank\">according to Paramount</a>, and is backed by a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/who-is-bari-weiss-iconoclastic-new-head-cbs-news-2025-10-06/\" target=\"_blank\">slew of big names</a>, including venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, hedge fund tycoon Paul Marshall and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz.</p>   \n   <p>\"As proud as we are of the 1.5 million subscribers who have joined under the banner of The Free Press — and we are astonished at that number — this is a country with 340 million people. We want our work to reach more of them, as quickly as possible,\" Weiss wrote on Monday. \"This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity allows us to do that.\"</p>   <p>The Free Press says it will retain its own brand and operations. And, as <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/06/nx-s1-5561116/bari-weiss-cbs-skydance-free-press\" target=\"_blank\">NPR has reported</a>, Weiss — who has no broadcasting experience — appears unlikely to run the news division at CBS News on a day-to-day basis.</p>   <p>But she will play a key role in shaping the network's editorial direction, at a time when it is looking to expand its appeal among right-leaning viewers. When Skydance Media acquired Paramount, CBS' parent company, in July — a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/24/nx-s1-5477530/paramount-cbs-skydance-sale-fcc-approves\" target=\"_blank\">merger that required Trump administration approval</a> — it promised to embrace a diversity of political and ideological viewpoints.</p>   <p>\"Bari is a proven champion of independent, principled journalism, and I am confident her entrepreneurial drive and editorial vision will invigorate CBS News,\" Skydance Media CEO David Ellison <a href=\"https://www.paramount.com/press/paramount-announces-deal-to-acquire-the-free-press\" target=\"_blank\">said in a statement</a>, calling the move \"part of Paramount's bigger vision to modernize content and the way it connects … to audiences around the world.\"</p>   <p>Here's what else to know about Weiss.</p>   <h3>What is Weiss' background? </h3>   <p>Weiss grew up in a Jewish family in Pittsburgh and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/27/opinion/synagogue-shooting-pittsburgh.html\" target=\"_blank\">had her Bat Mitzvah</a> at the Tree of Life Synagogue — long before the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/10/27/661347236/multiple-casualties-in-shooting-near-pittsburgh-synagogue\" target=\"_blank\">2018 mass shooting</a> that made it the site of the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history.</p>   \n   <p>Weiss attended Columbia University (where, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/04/bari-weiss-the-new-york-times-provocateur?srsltid=AfmBOoq2xEZbNTVw-OigAyMkviTLFK28R1suiaWfH00ZTd6mq_dzb2E8\" target=\"_blank\">she says</a>, she dated future <em>Saturday Night Live</em> star Kate McKinnon). As a sophomore, Weiss was <a href=\"https://www.columbia.edu/cu/current/press2.html\" target=\"_blank\">part of a group of Jewish students</a> who challenged the university to respond to what they perceived as anti-Israel intellectual intimidation in its Mideast studies department.</p>   <p>While a university panel ultimately concluded there was no ongoing problem in the department, the incident gained national prominence and prompted Columbia to revise its process for reviewing complaints against faculty.</p>   \n   <p>It was also a formative experience for Weiss, who became the founding editor of a campus magazine dedicated to politics, culture and Jewish affairs — and went on to write a book called <em>How to Fight Anti-Semitism</em>, which was published in 2019.</p>   <p>After college, Weiss worked as a senior editor at the online Jewish life magazine Tablet before joining the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in 2013 as an op-ed and book review editor. She left in 2017, after President Trump took office. She later <a href=\"https://reason.com/2018/01/28/bari-weiss-it-was-heartbreaking-for-me-t/\" target=\"_blank\">told Reason</a> that she left the job in part because of her employer's resistance to political op-eds that were \"too anti-Trump.\"</p>   \n   <p>\"It was heartbreaking for me to see people who I thought that we sort of shared fundamental values making peace with a candidate who, I mean, just from the most basic perspective ran a campaign on denigrating and demonizing the weakest people in our culture,\" Weiss told the magazine.</p>   <p>The <em>New York Times</em> hired Weiss as a staff editor and writer in the opinion section in 2017, as part of its stated efforts to broaden ideological diversity in its op-ed pages, then led by James Bennet.</p>   <p>\"I've gone in the last year from being the most progressive person at <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, to being the most right-winged person at <em>The New York Times</em>,\" Weiss told the <a href=\"https://jewishchronicle.timesofisrael.com/times-opinion-editor-burgh-native-bari-weiss-talks-news-jews-and-views/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle</em></a> later that year.</p>   \n   <p>Many of Weiss' <em>Times </em>columns garnered controversy — like a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/opinion/cultural-appropriation.html\" target=\"_blank\">2017 defense of cultural appropriation</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/opinion/aziz-ansari-babe-sexual-harassment.html\" target=\"_blank\">2018 defense</a> of comedian Aziz Ansari after he faced <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/01/16/578422491/the-fine-line-between-a-bad-date-and-sexual-assault-two-views-on-aziz-ansari\" target=\"_blank\">#MeToo accusations</a>, a piece questioning whether sexual assault allegations against then-Supreme Court justice nominee <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/msnbc/ny-times-bari-weiss-other-instance-brett-kavanaugh-has-reputation-being-prince-man\" target=\"_blank\">Brett Kavanaugh</a> should be disqualifying and a 2018 attack on liberal intolerance titled \"<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/opinion/were-all-fascists-now.html\" target=\"_blank\">We're All Fascists Now</a>.\"</p>   <p>But the biggest backlash came in June 2020, after the <em>Times</em> ran the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/opinion/tom-cotton-protests-military.html\" target=\"_blank\">op-ed by Cotton</a> — the Republican senator — calling for the military to respond to Black Lives Matter protests with an \"overwhelming show of force.\" Hundreds of <em>Times</em> staffers signed a letter <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/05/870920623/debate-over-racial-justice-coverage-roils-n-y-times-philadelphia-inquirer\" target=\"_blank\">protesting the piece</a>, which an editor's note later said \"fell short of our standards and should not have been published.\" Bennet resigned within days.</p>   <p>Weiss, who defended the op-ed's publication, <a href=\"https://x.com/bariweiss/status/1268628680797978625\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted about the fallout</a> as a \"civil war inside The New York Times between the (mostly young wokes) [and] the (mostly 40+) liberals\" — a characterization that many of her colleagues pushed back on. In July 2020, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/business/media/bari-weiss-resignation-new-york-times.html\" target=\"_blank\">Weiss resigned</a> in a nearly 1,500-word letter to the paper's publisher, citing \"bullying by colleagues\" and an \"illiberal environment.\"</p>   <p>\"The paper of record is, more and more, the record of those living in a distant galaxy, one whose concerns are profoundly removed from the lives of most people,\" she wrote. \"Nowadays, standing up for principle at the paper does not win plaudits.

But it has been relatively measured in its view of the Trump administration, occasionally <a href=\"https://www.thefp.com/p/donald-trumps-revenge\" target=\"_blank\">publishing critical pieces</a> and most recently <a href=\"https://www.thefp.com/p/jawboning-and-jimmy-kimmel-free-speech-censorship\" target=\"_blank\">objecting to its \"coercion\" of ABC</a> to suspend Jimmy Kimmel's show.</p>   <p>Even as Weiss has made a name for herself in part by lambasting progressive culture, her own political views have been somewhat hard to pin down.</p>   \n   <p>Over the years, she has described herself as a \"<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/business/media/bari-weiss-free-press.html#:~:text=She%20is%20a%20reformed%20print,the%20lapsed%20or%20wobbly%20Democrat.\" target=\"_blank\">radical centrist</a>\" and a \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjV7EDuL21M\" target=\"_blank\">Jewish, center-left-on-most-things-person</a>.\" In a 2024 <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/bari_weiss_courage_the_most_important_virtue/transcript\" target=\"_blank\">TED Talk</a>, she said she voted for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in one election, and Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden in others.</p>   \n   <p>She went on to characterize her ideological views as pro-choice, pro-Israel and pro-gay marriage, \"so much so that I'm actually in one myself.\" (Weiss married Bowles, a former <em>Times</em> tech reporter, in 2021 — the same year they cofounded The Free Press — and they have two children together.)</p>   <p>But she also acknowledged that she is a frequent target of criticism from fellow liberals.</p>   <p>\"I am, or at least … I used to be, considered a standard-issue liberal,\" Weiss said in the same speech. \"And yet somehow, in our most intellectual and prestigious spaces, many of the ideas I just outlined and others like them, have become provocative or controversial, which is really a polite way of saying unwelcome, beyond the pale, even bigoted or racist.\"</p>   <h3>Why is she returning to legacy media? </h3>   <p>In Weiss' announcement letter, she acknowledges that many people may be wondering: \"Why flee <em>The New York Times</em> only to head back into another legacy institution?\"</p>   <p>She says that while she was \"raised to be a believer in the institutions that built America and that made sense of it,\" she found in 2020 that \"the most important public conversations were happening outside of those places.\"</p>   \n   <p>Things look different five years later, Weiss writes, \"as the gatekeepers of the mainstream have failed one after another\" and new voices — including podcasters and influencers — have come to dominate the media landscape.</p>   <p>Weiss paints a picture of two increasingly powerful extremes — \"an America-loathing far left\" and a \"history-erasing far right\" — and says the majority of \"smart, politically mixed, pragmatic Americans\" who fall somewhere in between are not being well served. She pitches Paramount's embrace of The Free Press as a way to change that.</p>   \n   <p>\"The values that we've hammered out here over the years — journalism based in curiosity and honesty, a culture of healthy disagreement, our shared belief in America's promise — now have the opportunity to go very, very big,\" Weiss writes.</p>   <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/10/06/bari-weiss-free-press-skydance-paramount-cbs-memo\" target=\"_blank\">note to CBS News staffers</a> obtained by Axios on Monday, Weiss laid out the 10 principles that she says have and will continue to guide her journalism.</p>   <p>Those include holding \"both American political parties to equal scrutiny,\" embracing \"a wide spectrum of views and voices so that the audience can contend with the best arguments on all sides of a debate\" and respecting \"our audience enough to tell the truth plainly — wherever it leads.\"</p>\n</div>",

The administration federalized at least 300 members of the Illinois National Guard, who are likely to be sent to Chicago.

In contrast, the court ruled against the administration in these emergency cases three times. These rulings are temporary because the court didn't hear arguments in the cases. Now, some of the cases are back at the court with full briefing and arguments expected.</li></ul>   <p><strong>Negotiators are beginning talks today in Egypt in an attempt to finally end the war in Gaza. </strong>The U.S. presented a peace plan, which Israel agreed to.

Messages posted on agency websites and in emails to federal workers across multiple Cabinet departments blamed congressional Democrats and, in some cases, the \"Radical Left\" for the shutdown and its impacts. (Republicans control both chambers of Congress but need Democratic support in the Senate to approve any government funding deal.)</p>   \n   <p>Many Department of Education employees who were furloughed due to the shutdown were surprised to see the following message inserted into their out-of-office replies: \"Thank you for contacting me. On September 19, 2025, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5371, a clean continuing resolution. Unfortunately, Democrat Senators are blocking passage of H.R. 5371 in the Senate which has led to a lapse in appropriations. Due to the lapse in appropriations, I am currently in furlough status. I will respond to emails once government functions resume.\"</p>   \n   <p>Multiple employees told NPR that although the message was written in the first person and sent from their email, they did not write it and were not told it would replace whatever out-of-office message they had originally set up.</p>   <p>The language also differed from the model language the department had provided to staffers as they prepared for the shutdown, according to the lawsuit. Some staffers who tried to change their out-of-office messages to remove the partisan language found they were changed back, the lawsuit said.</p>   <p>The lawsuit argues that the messages violate the First Amendment, which prohibits the government from compelling speech. It names the Department of Education and Secretary Linda McMahon as defendants.</p>   <p>\"Without giving notice to their employees, let alone obtaining their consent, the Department of Education has replaced employees' out-of-office email messages with partisan language that blames 'Democrat Senators' for the shutdown,\" the complaint said. \"Employees are now forced to involuntarily parrot the Trump Administration's talking points with emails sent out in their names.\"</p>   \n   <p>In a statement to NPR, Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications, said: \"The email reminds those who reach out to Department of Education employees that we cannot respond because Senate Democrats are refusing to vote for a clean CR and fund the government. Where's the lie?\"</p>   \n   <p>Government ethics experts have <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/30/nx-s1-5558393/government-shutdown-trump-ethics-hatch-act\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> that the inclusion of overtly political messages in federal agency communications could violate the <a href=\"https://osc.gov/Services/pages/hatchact.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Hatch Act</a>, which limits political activity by civil servants in the executive branch.</p>   <p>\"The Hatch Act prohibits engaging in political activity while in an official capacity, including communication that contains advocacy in opposition to a political party,\" Michael Fallings, a partner at Tully Rinckey, an employment law firm, said in a statement. \"Here, while the reference to Democrats alone likely does not constitute a violation, the explicit blaming of the Democratic Party for the shutdown and 'reference to radical left' may constitute a violation.\"</p>   <p>On Thursday, Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, <a href=\"https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-oversight.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2025-10-02-garcia-to-osc-re-hatch-act-shutdown-agency-messages.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">asked</a> the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal agency that enforces the Hatch Act, to investigate the Trump administration's use of agency websites and official government emails \"to promote a false, partisan Republican political agenda.\" (The Office of Special Counsel is being led by an acting director since President Trump <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/17/nx-s1-5475191/trump-executive-power-supreme-court-whistleblower\" target=\"_blank\">fired</a> its Senate-confirmed leader <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/05/nx-s1-5319326/trump-hampton-dellinger-watchdog-appeals-court\" target=\"_blank\">before the end of his term</a>. The agency is closed during the shutdown, according to its website.)</p>   <p>More than two dozen current and former federal workers contacted NPR in recent days to express concern about the politicized language they are seeing from agencies and officials.</p>   <p>\"As a professional civil servant and human being I find the rhetoric shocking, offensive and jarring,\" said one federal worker who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation from the Trump administration for speaking publicly.</p>   \n   <p>Six people shared screenshots of a weekly newsletter the Department of Veterans Affairs sends to \"Veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors.\" Titled \"How the government shutdown impacts VA,\" the Oct. 1 newsletter said: \"President Trump opposes a lapse in appropriations, and on September 19, the House of Representatives passed, with the Trump Administration's support, a clean continuing resolution to fund the government through November 21. Unfortunately, Democrats are blocking this Continuing Resolution in the U.S. Senate due to unrelated policy demands.\" It went on to list VA services that would be affected.</p>   <p>\"I think the politicization of a VA newsletter which is intended only to let us know of our benefits should also be reported on,\" a veteran who received the newsletter and requested anonymity because they fear reprisal from the government told NPR.</p>   <p>\"The message was 100% factual, and even mainstream media outlets and reporters say the same thing,\" VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz said in a statement in response to NPR's questions about the newsletter and the concerns veterans expressed about politicization.</p>   <p><em>NPR's Cory Turner contributed reporting.</em></p>\n</div>",

Or it could be handling complaints about <a href=\"https://immigrantjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CRCL-complaint-letter-NIJC-request-for-investigation-Sec.-504.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">the use of solitary detention</a>, sexual assault or <a href=\"https://immigrationjustice.us/advocacy/advocacy-issues/access-to-medical-mental-health-care/complaint-urges-immediate-release-of-infants-from-detention/\" target=\"_blank\">issues with infants in detention</a>.</p>   \n   <p>The Trump administration earlier cut hundreds of staff in these congressionally mandated offices in order to save money and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/21/nx-s1-5336738/homeland-security-rif-cuts-dhs\" target=\"_blank\">because DHS argued they were</a> \"internal adversaries that slow down operations.\"</p>   \n   <p>This included federal employees who conducted regular visits to detention centers, reviewed and investigated complaints about detention conditions, and prepared reports due to Congress.</p>   <p>\"You don't have anyone to turn to,\" said Whitlock, now senior policy counsel at the National Immigration Law Center, a legal advocacy group. Without the offices, immigration advocates are turning to members of Congress to address problems on behalf of their clients.</p>   <p>\"That's like a one-time flash bang situation,\" she said, about outreach to Congress. \"That's no way to treat somebody who is having issues.\"</p>   <p>NPR spoke with four former employees — all part of a lawsuit challenging their terminations — who said they would regularly review DHS immigration-related policies and programs to make sure there were no civil rights violations.</p>   <p>Now, it's unclear who has that role — even as the Trump administration is ramping up detention space provided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, after a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/03/g-s1-75609/big-beautiful-bill-ice-funding-immigration\">funding boost</a> from Congress this summer.</p>   \n   <p>\"DHS CRCL is performing all legally required functions, but in an efficient and cost-effective manner and without hindering the Department's mission of securing the homeland,\" DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said, speaking about the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.</p>   <p>Former agency watchdogs warn that the rapid expansion comes without hundreds of internal employees to oversee it, increasing the risk of civil rights violations and even deaths while migrants are detained.</p>   <p>\"This massive infusion of funds to ICE is super problematic,\" said one former employee of DHS's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to fear of reprisals from the agency. \"If we were still there, we would be incredibly busy.\"</p>   \n   <p>\"More people are going to die in custody as a result because there are not going to be the same level of checks and balances internally. And the American public will not be able to be as outraged because there's no one with whom to file these complaints,\" the former employee added.</p>   <p>Now, with fewer staff, DHS said the offices are working; it was not immediately clear how many employees are still working in each office.</p>   \n   <h3>Effort to reduce federal workforce</h3>   <p>In fiscal year <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/detain/detainee-death-reporting\" target=\"_blank\">2025</a>, at least<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/23/nx-s1-5549411/ossoff-warnock-noem-immigration-detention-death\" target=\"_blank\"> 15 people died in ICE custody</a>, out of more than 59,000 people in immigration detention. That's the highest detention total in the <a href=\"https://www.ice.gov/detain/detention-management\" target=\"_blank\">last six years of publicly available</a> ICE data and it's the highest death count since 18 people died in fiscal year 2020.</p>   <p>The deaths represent a tiny fraction of overall detainees. But it doesn't capture any other issues detainees may face. Across the country, media and immigration advocates have reported <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/05/nx-s1-5413364/concerns-over-conditions-in-u-s-immigration-detention-were-hearing-the-word-starving\" target=\"_blank\">overcrowding, unsanitary conditions and issues with food</a> and health care access — a byproduct of a rapid scaling-up of immigration arrests.</p>   <p>\"It's hard to know when things are stopped in the middle, out of the blue, what work actually continues,\" said Katerina Herodotou, a senior policy adviser at CRCL who was laid off.</p>   <p>She said detainees could see posters with the CRCL hotline to call, and that listed what rights they have, something that \"might not seem like much, but could make a huge difference to someone who's experiencing abuse or discrimination in in a jail,\" she said. She worries that posters that were up previously may have been removed — something NPR couldn't immediately verify.</p>   <p>Earlier this year, over 300 people across the three oversight <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/21/nx-s1-5336738/homeland-security-rif-cuts-dhs\" target=\"_blank\">divisions of DHS</a> received notice that their jobs were being cut as part of a broader effort to reduce the size of the federal government.</p>   \n   <p>The oversight offices were created by Congress in order to provide internal reviews and gather external complaints related to immigration enforcement.</p>   <p>Even the existing mechanisms were imperfect, given that they were part of the agencies they were supposed to police, immigration advocates say.</p>   <p>\"These oversight bodies already had limited authority and power to change the system,\" said Jesse Franzblau, associate director of policy at the National Immigrant Justice Center. \"But scrapping these limited oversight mechanisms that were in place has left the door open for expansion to happen in a very secretive way that has allowed lack of accountability,\" he said about the increase in detention space.</p>   \n   <h3>Former watchdogs warn of potential for deaths and abuse</h3>   <p>The former employees interviewed by NPR say they played a critical role to avoid civil rights violations in immigration enforcement — not just address them. For example, some former oversight employees would help approve local law enforcement agencies who wanted to partner with ICE, according to Herodotou.</p>   <p>\"[I was] looking at whether or not the law enforcement agencies that were partnered with ICE under that program were following the protocols and not using the program to racially profile individuals or to go outside the bounds of what the agreement with ICE was in regard to civil liberties and civil rights,\" Herodotou said.</p>   \n   <p>She also worked on a project to change the language the agency used in its interviews with those applying in order to help better identify victims of human trafficking. Now, she worries none of the work to review the agency's programs, or congressionally mandated annual reports, is getting done.</p>   <p>Another former employee recalls regular visits to Customs and Border Protection detention centers and meetings with detained children, to monitor conditions and raise concerns about any harassment or lapses in health care.</p>   <p>The former employee of the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman also spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisals, and said oversight staff were often the only outsiders any detainees could appeal to.</p>   \n   <p>\"The humanitarian provisions in internal policies and procedures are very likely not being abided by. I do believe that,\" the former employee said.</p>   <p>NPR couldn't independently verify how much oversight is provided by the remaining employees in the oversight offices. Immigration advocates say they have also been unable to keep track.</p>   <p>Congress requires that CRCL issue two reports per year: a semi-annual report and a yearly report based on the previous fiscal year. It does not appear that a semi-annual report has been published this year. The annual report is due later this winter.</p>   \n   <h3>Oversight employees seek to be reinstated</h3>   <p>About 86 former DHS employees in these oversight offices have joined a legal challenge filed to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), the federal agency that hears appeals of personnel actions taken by the government.</p>   <p>\"The first argument is that the agency does not have legal authority to abolish the functions that are required by Congress, although they claim to still be carrying out those functions; they have not provided any evidence,\" said Marlene Laimeche, one of the attorneys on the case at Gilbert Employment Law. </p>   \n   <p>Lawyers fear the potential implications of the missing staff in the oversight offices if the roles are not reinstated.</p>   <p>\"They are cherry-picking people to perform crucial functions that will turn the government into a machine to execute what the president's priorities are any given day without any type of oversight, without the proper balance and checks on presidential power,\" she speculated.</p>   <p>Legal challenges, including a<a href=\"https://rfkhumanrights.org/litigation/rfk-human-rights-v-noem-fighting-for-accountability-in-immigration-enforcement/\" target=\"_blank\"> separate federal lawsuit brought by nonprofits</a>, could take months, at best. In the meantime, oversight advocates worry their absence could exacerbate conditions in detention.</p>   <p>\"It's not a risk, it's a reality. We've already seen the treatment of individuals being encountered, arrested and detained,\" Herodotou said, adding that her office experienced an increase in complaints just as employees were being cut back in March.</p>   <p>\"More detention woes, people with health issues in detention, deaths in detention,\" she predicted. \"I don't know if there's an avenue for anyone to get that help anymore.\"<br /></p>\n</div>",

It came hours after the government dispatched California National Guard members to Oregon.</p>   \n   <p>Oregon and Portland <a href=\"https://x.com/AGDanRayfield/status/1974996554084667579\" target=\"_blank\">went back to the court</a> — this time with California as an additional party to the lawsuit — and asked U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut for a new temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from sending the California National Guard to Oregon.</p>   <p>In her ruling, Immergut barred any National Guard members from being relocated from any state for service in Oregon. One day earlier, she had <a href=\"https://www.opb.org/article/2025/10/05/federal-tactics-on-protesters-escalates-hours-after-judge-rules-against-trump/\" target=\"_blank\">temporarily blocked</a> the Trump administration from federalizing the Oregon National Guard.</p>   <p>\"I am certainly troubled by now hearing that both California and Texas are being sent to Oregon, which does appear to be in direct contradiction of my order,\" Immergut said in her order, <a href=\"https://www.opb.org/article/2025/10/05/california-and-oregon-sue-trump-administration-to-block-national-guard-deployment-to-portland/\" target=\"_blank\">according to Oregon Public Broadcasting</a>.</p>   <p>The ruling came as Portland and Chicago were preparing for the possibility that National Guard members would be deployed to their streets, as President Trump moves ahead with his plan to send troops to Democratic-run U.S. cities that he says require help to control crime and protect federal law enforcement officers.</p>   <p>On Saturday, the White House said Trump \"authorized\" the deployment of 300 Illinois National Guard members, after vowing for weeks to send federal forces into Chicago.</p>   <p>Guard members will be used to protect federal property as well as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Federal Protective Service agents and other federal employees, according to a copy of a federal memo viewed by NPR. They will be sent to places where there are \"violent demonstrations\" in the state or where they are likely to occur based on \"current threat assessments,\" the memo said.</p>   \n   <p>Also over the weekend, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said he had <a href=\"https://x.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1975027635295007073\" target=\"_blank\">authorized the deployment</a> of 400 Texas National Guard members at Trump's request.</p>   <h3>A broader picture is taking shape</h3>   <p>Already this year, the Trump administration has sent National Guard members to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. Trump has said he also <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/29/nx-s1-5556831/portland-memphis-national-guard-trump-troops\" target=\"_blank\">intends to send troops to Memphis</a> with the backing of Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee.</p>   \n   <p>The latest effort comes against the wishes of the Democratic governors of Oregon and Illinois, Tina Kotek and JB Pritzker, who say the Guard deployment is unnecessary and will escalate tensions.</p>   <p>On Saturday, Pritzker wrote in <a href=\"https://x.com/GovPritzker/status/1974531904767656030\" target=\"_blank\">a post on X</a> that the \"Trump Administration's Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will.\" Pritzker added: \"It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.\"</p>   <p>In <a href=\"https://x.com/GovPritzker/status/1975013177026109717\" target=\"_blank\">a later post</a>, Pritzker said no one from the administration had contacted him about the deployment of Texas National Guard members to Illinois. \"We must now start calling this what it is: Trump's Invasion,\" he wrote.</p>   <p>White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement on Saturday that Trump had activated the Illinois National Guard troops \"[a]midst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness\" in Chicago in order to \"protect federal officers and assets,\" <a href=\"https://www.wbez.org/politics/2025/10/04/donald-trump-jb-pritzker-illinois-national-guard\" target=\"_blank\">WBEZ reported</a>. Trump has said National Guard deployments are in an effort to fight crime, despite violent <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/08/nx-s1-5534338/ice-chicago-boston-immigration-raids\" target=\"_blank\">crime being down</a> in Chicago and other cities.</p>   <p>It came on the same day that Border Patrol agents <a href=\"https://www.wbez.org/immigration/2025/10/04/federal-agents-shoot-woman-they-say-boxed-in-authorities-in-brighton-park\" target=\"_blank\">shot a woman in Chicago</a>. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, said the woman was one of a group of drivers who rammed federal agents with their vehicles.

No agents were seriously injured, according to McLaughlin.</p>   \n   <h3>A judge blocks Trump's effort to deploy the National Guard in Portland — twice</h3>   <p>Immergut's ruling late Sunday was the second time over the weekend that she had temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard in Oregon.</p>   <p>Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek blasted the government's actions <a href=\"https://www.opb.org/article/2025/10/05/california-and-oregon-sue-trump-administration-to-block-national-guard-deployment-to-portland/\" target=\"_blank\">in a statement</a> after the ruling. \"President Trump's actions are an effort to occupy and incite cities and states that don't share his politics,\" Kotek said, \"and I believe that we should expect him to continue to push the limits of his authority.\"</p>   <p>On Saturday, Immergut ruled that the government had failed to meet the threshold for declaring that recent protests outside an ICE facility in Portland constituted a rebellion.</p>   \n   <p>Immergut, who was appointed by Trump in 2019, said protests at the facility since July were generally limited to fewer than 30 people and were \"largely sedate.\" She added that the city's police force was trained in crowd management and could seek the assistance of other law enforcement agencies — and even the National Guard — if it needed to.</p>   <p>The Trump administration federalized 200 members of the Oregon National Guard last Sunday for a 60-day deployment, according to a memo sent to Gov. Kotek from the Department of Defense.</p>   \n   <p>As in Chicago, Trump was planning to send the troops to Portland over the objections of state and local leaders.</p>   <p>Trump said Sunday he hadn't seen the judge's order, but that \"that judge ought to be ashamed of themselves.\"</p>   <p>Despite the judge's ruling, Guard members began traveling to Oregon, according to California Gov. Gavin Newsom. He said in <a href=\"https://x.com/CAgovernor/status/1974882275927249293?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\" target=\"_blank\">a post on X</a> on Sunday that the Trump administration had sent 300 California National Guard personnel to the state's northern neighbor.</p>   <p>\"They are on their way there now,\" Newsom wrote. \"We are taking this fight back to court. The public cannot stay silent in the face of such reckless and authoritarian conduct by the President of the United States.\"</p>   \n   <p>Kotek said that 101 California Guard members arrived on Saturday in Oregon and more were on their way. </p>   <p>Later on Sunday, Newsom praised the judge's decision blocking the California troop deployment. \"We just won in court — again,\" he <a href=\"https://x.com/CAgovernor/status/1975042264885035195\" target=\"_blank\">wrote in a post</a> on X. \"Trump's abuse of power won't stand.\"</p>   <p><em>Gigi Douban and Tom Bowman contributed reporting.</em></p>\n</div>",

The agency <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2025/2026-census-test-jobs.html\" target=\"_blank\">says</a> it received a temporary exemption from President Trump's <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/ensuring-accountability-and-prioritizing-public-safety-in-federal-hiring/\" target=\"_blank\">freeze </a>on hiring federal civilian workers.</p>   <p>The census test is supposed to help the bureau develop better ways of getting complete and accurate population counts and demographic data, especially of historically undercounted populations such as children under the age of 5, people of color and renters.</p>   \n   <p>Some people living outside of the test sites may also receive invitations in the mail to participate starting in March 2026 as part of what the bureau calls a \"nationally representative sample of households.\"</p>   \n   <p>While the ongoing federal shutdown has put a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/03/nx-s1-5561750/shutdown-jobs-labor-economy-wall-street?utm_campaign=npr&utm_source=bsky.app&utm_term=nprnews&utm_medium=social\" target=\"_blank\">halt to work on new government statistics</a>, test preparations have continued because Commerce Department officials supervising the bureau have <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26173179-department-of-commerce-plan-for-orderly-shutdown-due-to-lapse-of-congressional-appropriations-sept-29-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">deemed it a \"mission critical priority\"</a> ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv%5C\" target=\"_blank\">constitutionally required</a> tally in 2030.</p>   <p>Last month, however, the Commerce Department inspector general's office raised concerns that the bureau may not be able to recruit enough workers for the test. Uncertain funding from Congress and Trump's <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/ensuring-accountability-and-prioritizing-public-safety-in-federal-hiring/\" target=\"_blank\">hiring freeze</a> led to the bureau putting off finalizing a staffing plan, an <a href=\"https://www.oig.doc.gov/wp-content/OIGPublications/OIG-25-030-A_FinalReport-SECURED.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">audit by the inspector general </a>found.</p>   <p>At a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/_5-Y9QdVBco?si=cinACJwEe8sCS8g8&t=4530\" target=\"_blank\">September hearing on Capitol Hill</a>, Democratic Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan flagged that the bureau's hiring for the test is \"behind the curve of what we've seen in the past.\"</p>   <p>\"The Census Bureau has refused to provide updates to me on the status of preparation for this test,\" added Peters, the top Democrat overseeing the bureau on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.</p>   <p>The bureau's public information office did not respond to NPR's requests for comment.</p>   \n   <p>Monday's announcement from the bureau also comes after the agency made the rare move of <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26158952-sept-26-2025-commerce-department-letter-requesting-withdrawal-of-federal-register-notice-on-2026-census-test/\" target=\"_blank\">withdrawing a public update</a> on the test that was set to be published in the Federal Register.

So there's a lot of concern and also a lot of mystery. We're just not seeing the kind of transparency about how they're going to do this work that we have in previous decades.\"</p>   <p>Local officials at two of the six census test sites, which were <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024/webinar-2026-census-test-sites.html\" target=\"_blank\">announced last year</a>, told NPR they have also been in the dark. The bureau <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20251002183601/https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/decade/2030/planning-management/plan/research-and-testing/2026-census-test.html\" target=\"_blank\">had said</a> efforts to raise \"awareness in the test sites about the importance of participating\" would begin this past summer. But Lottie Barker, manager of western North Carolina's Swain County, and Curtis Evans, judge of western Texas' Jeff Davis County, said no one from the agency has talked to them or their staff about the test as of last week.</p>   <p>\"I am hopeful that it will be easy to recruit those temporary workers,\" Barker said in an email, \"but many times this is hard depending on what commitments community members already have.\"</p>   <p>Changes the Trump administration has made at the bureau in recent months — including <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/17/nx-s1-5349435/us-census-bureau-data-decennial\" target=\"_blank\">slashing its permanent workforce</a> and installing a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5288846/trump-census-bureau-director-george-cook\" target=\"_blank\">new acting director with no obvious qualifications</a> for the role — are also prompting questions about its ability to produce reliable statistics.</p>   <p>Official 2030 census numbers are set to be used to determine each state's share of congressional seats and Electoral College votes in the next decade.</p>   <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv\" target=\"_blank\">14th Amendment</a>, the \"whole number of persons in each state\" must be included in the census apportionment counts. But <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/07/nx-s1-5265650/new-census-trump-immigrants-counted\" target=\"_blank\">Trump</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/15/nx-s1-5467533/counted-in-the-census-congressional-redistricting-electoral-college\" target=\"_blank\">a growing number of Republican lawmakers</a> in Congress are calling for the exclusion of some or all non-U.S. citizens living in the states — an unprecedented change that, if carried out, would likely spark new lawsuits.</p>   \n   <p>Data from the census are also used to distribute federal funding for public services in local communities and redraw maps of voting districts for every level of government across the country.</p>\n</div>",

CBS' parent company, Skydance Media, is buying her upstart news site The Free Press.\n                <b>\n                    Noam Galai/Getty Images for The Free Press\n                </b>\n                <b><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>\n            <p><b><b>toggle caption</b></b>\n    </p></div>\n    <p><span>\n        Noam Galai/Getty Images for The Free Press\n    </span>\n</p></div>\n   </div>\n   <p>CBS News is planning to take another step to appeal to right-of-center viewers by installing Bari Weiss as editor in chief. CBS' new corporate owner, Skydance Media, is also acquiring The Free Press, Weiss' views-and-news site.</p>   <p>Weiss arrives with a mandate to redefine the CBS News brand in the eyes of the public and refine its news coverage. She is seen as a change agent for a network regularly accused by President Trump and his political allies of liberal bias.</p>   <p>\"Bari is a proven champion of independent, principled journalism, and I am confident her entrepreneurial drive and editorial vision will invigorate CBS News,\" said David Ellison, the CEO of parent company Skydance Media, in a statement Monday, adding that Weiss will report directly to him. \"We believe the majority of the country longs for news that is balanced and fact-based, and we want CBS to be their home.\"</p>   \n   <p>In a note to staff, Ellison decried partisanship as a threat to communities. The media, he said, also played a role. </p>   <p>\"Too often it has become a platform that amplifies the very partisanship tearing our society apart,\" he wrote.</p>   <p>Weiss echoed that view in a note to subscribers, saying that the majority of Americans, who are neither part of \"an America-loathing far left\" or \"a history-erasing far right,\" have been ill-served, and she sees this as an opportunity to reach them as quickly as possible.</p>   <p>Weiss founded The Free Press after a blistering resignation from <em>The New York Times</em>, where she accused colleagues of intolerance. She has no experience in broadcasting and appears unlikely to run CBS' news division on a day-to-day basis given the logistical demands of TV news. The current president and executive editor,  Tom Cibrowski, a veteran broadcast news executive, is staying on. The two will be partners, Ellison said. </p>   \n   <p>NPR interviewed eight current and former journalists at CBS News for this story. Several still at the network — speaking on condition of anonymity because the network did not authorize them to speak publicly — say they are withholding judgment until they see whether Weiss offers insight and guidance or starts issuing decrees with ideological intent.</p>   <p>Weiss' job will be complicated, however, by the company's intention to conduct network-wide layoffs this month of up to 10% of the workforce, according to two people with direct knowledge. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.</p>   \n   <p>While the news division president is the titular head, CBS News has a tradition of strong-willed, independent-minded executive producers stretching back to Edward Murrow's collaborator Fred Friendly and <em>60 Minutes</em> creator Don Hewitt.</p>   <p>Weiss is considered sharp, savvy and entrepreneurial. She had been an opinion and book reviews editor at <em>The</em> <em>Wall Street Journal </em>before joining the <em>New York Times' </em>opinion section, where she also wrote under her own byline, often taking a contrarian bent. When she left that paper in July 2020, it — <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/15/874530954/rancor-erupts-in-la-times-newsroom-over-race-equity-and-protest-coverage\" target=\"_blank\">like many newsrooms</a> — was grappling with tensions over social justice. She denounced her former colleagues in a publicly posted letter to <em>Times </em>Chairman and Publisher A.G. Sulzberger, saying they bullied her and created what she said was an \"illiberal environment.\" At the time, the <em>Times</em> responded by affirming a commitment to honest dialogue and mutual respect among colleagues. </p>   <p>The Free Press has focused on what it contends is a cancel culture afflicting institutions across higher education and popular culture. It made a splash last year by <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/04/09/1243755769/npr-journalist-uri-berliner-trust-diversity\" target=\"_blank\">publishing a critical essay</a> about NPR by Uri Berliner, then a senior business editor at the public media network, and critiques of how mainstream news organizations are covering the Israel-Hamas war. </p>   <p>While drawing support from many who accuse the mainstream media of being reflexively liberal, the site does not blindly embrace Trump's agenda. When the nation's top broadcast regulator, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5546764/fcc-brendan-carr-kimmel-trump-free-speech\" target=\"_blank\"><u>pressured ABC to \"take action\" on Jimmy Kimmel</u></a>, The Free Press cried foul on First Amendment grounds.</p>   \n   <p>Under the new plan, Weiss will continue to run The Free Press as a standalone news-and-views site, maintaining its own brand and subscription model. Outside analysts say the acquisition figure appears high, but reflects the value that Ellison and his multibillionaire father Larry Ellison place on Weiss and her news site. </p>   <p>Since Skydance bought CBS' parent company Paramount in July, David Ellison has made clear that the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/12/nx-s1-5537152/cbs-news-ellison-steps-appease-trump\" target=\"_blank\"><u>network is friendly to conservative views</u></a>. His father, who is the major financial backer of Skydance and the Paramount deal, is the founder of Oracle and a vocal Trump supporter.</p>   \n   <p>Yet that purchase was held up for months as CBS' former owner <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/02/nx-s1-5454790/cbs-settlement-trump-60-minutes-harris-interview-analysis\" target=\"_blank\"><u>negotiated a $16 million settlement</u></a> with Trump. Just before last year's election, Trump sued CBS alleging that a <em>60 Minutes</em> interview with Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris had been edited in an effort to make her appear more articulate than she was.</p>   <p>Many <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/02/nx-s1-5290171/trump-lawsuit-paramount-cbs-60-minutes-kamala-harris\" target=\"_blank\">legal experts</a> had considered the lawsuit frivolous and CBS likely to triumph in court. Yet Carr initiated a formal FCC review of CBS that reinforced Trump's complaint, raising the pressure on the network and its owners. </p>   \n   <p>Before the settlement, Cibrowski's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/19/nx-s1-5403690/cbs-news-wendy-mcmahon-resigns-paramount-trump-lawsuit-60-minutes\" target=\"_blank\"><u>predecessor Wendy McMahon resigned</u></a>, as did Bill Owens, the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/22/nx-s1-5372733/60-minutes-bill-owens-cbs-trump-paramount\" target=\"_blank\"><u>longtime executive producer</u></a> of the network's signature show, <em>60 Minutes</em>. In a note to staff, Owens said he was no longer allowed \"to make independent decisions based on what was right for 60 Minutes, right for the audience.\"</p>   <p>Before completing the purchase, David Ellison made commitments to the FCC's Carr to reshape Paramount, CBS and CBS News. Skydance then hired Kenneth Weinstein, the former president and chief executive of the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank, as CBS News' ombudsman to field complaints about news coverage.</p>   <p>In approving the sale, the FCC said Skydance had made written commitments to \"root out the bias that has undermined trust in the national news media\" and \"ensure that the new company's programming embodies a diversity of viewpoints from across the political and ideological spectrum.\"</p>   <p>Ellison may not be done expanding Skydance's journalism portfolio.

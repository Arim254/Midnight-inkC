But it was unclear hours after the rulings Friday afternoon how much assistance may be provided or when it might come.   U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston ruled the Trump administration has until Monday to decide whether to pay at least partial SNAP food benefits. She declined to issue a temporary restraining order to force the administration to act before the funds run out tomorrow, finding that resuming payments at some point can still avoid irreparable harm to SNAP recipients.   \n   In Rhode Island, U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. granted a temporary restraining order while saying ending SNAP payments would harm not only people, but also local economies. The judge said the Trump administration \"must distribute\" aid from emergency reserves as soon as possible. He also said it must submit a plan on how it would comply with his order, or \"at least an update,\" by noon on Monday, Ocean State Media reported.   It is not yet clear how the two court orders would impact the flow of benefits, which are set to run out Saturday.   Hours after the rulings, President Trump posted on social media that he has directed government lawyers to find a way to pay SNAP benefits. \"If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay,\" he wrote. However, it's not clear what sort of legal direction the administration was seeking.   The Trump administration had said it did not have enough money to pay November's SNAP benefits because of the government shutdown and that it lacked legal authority to use contingency funds set aside for emergencies.   \n   Talwani acknowledged her order would leave millions of people without assistance starting Saturday. She issued her decision in a case filed by two dozen Democratic-led states that sued over the administration's decision to suspend the nation's largest anti-hunger program for the first time in its history.   The judge said the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, must use emergency funds to keep SNAP going. She also said other money is legally available but left the decision of how much benefits to distribute up to the administration.   \n   In Rhode Island, McConnell issued his decision in a lawsuit filed by eight cities and nonprofit and business groups.   The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, helps 1 in 8 U.S. residents, who get an average of $186 a month.    Loading... \n",

Schaben/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Off-year elections are often a referendum on the president and his party. And this year, of course, that means President Trump and Republicans. Trump is unpopular, particularly with independents, who will be key in swing districts in next year's midterm elections.   So the narratives and the margins coming out of the Nov. 4 elections will matter — and offer some clues as to how the landscape for 2026 begins to take shape.   \n   Here are five questions to consider when thinking about Tuesday's elections:   1. How much of a drag is Trump?   Republicans lost 40 House seats during Trump's first midterm in 2018. Just before that election, Trump's approval rating, according to Gallup, was 40%.   Now, it's an almost identical 41%.   Democrats have certainly been trying to use Trump a lot in the 2025 elections, mentioning him often in ads, and trying to tie their Republican opponents to him. Republican candidates in these elections have largely steered clear of the president.   \n   Partially, that's because the most closely watched elections Tuesday are taking place in states that lean left — governors' races in Virginia and New Jersey, the New York mayor's race and the fight over a ballot initiative in California.   But these elections have a history of moving in the direction of the party opposite of the president's. That's because they're among the first chances for voters aligned with the party out of power to register their frustration. It's why, for example, the governor's race in Virginia has gone to the opposition party in 11 of the last 12, dating back to 1977. (The exception was Democrat Terry McAuliffe during Obama's presidency.)   It's a necessary, perennial caveat that too much shouldn't be made out of off-year elections and what they mean for midterms, but Tuesday's elections will be the first major electoral sign of the political mood in the county — and what voters think of the president.   2. Will Democrats have a chance at counterbalancing Republican redistricting efforts?    Maybe the most important election Tuesday is one in California when voters decide on Proposition 50.   The state is currently mandated to redraw congressional districts by an independent commission. But voting in favor of Prop 50 Tuesday would temporarily overturn that requirement and give Democrats the chance to try and offset gains Trump is trying to make in redrawing in red states like Texas.   \n   This will also be an early test of Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a likely 2028 presidential candidate. The \"No\" campaign has run ads urging people to stop Newsom's \"power grab.\" Newsom himself has run ads for the \"Yes\" campaign and opponents have pulled back the millions they had been promising to spend. A sign of the direction this is headed Tuesday?   3. Are Latinos shifting away from Republicans?   Trump made inroads with Latinos in the 2024 presidential election.   In fact, he did better with Latinos than any Republican in history, according to exit polls.   But there have been signs in polling during this second Trump term that they are slipping from the president and the GOP. That's come amid Trump's mass deportations that have rounded up far more than the hardened criminals Trump's administration promised — and Trump's lack of focus on getting prices down, a key reason many switched sides to vote for Trump.   One place to watch as an indicator is New Jersey. Though Trump lost the state in 2024, he made significant improvements, particularly in counties with heavy Latino populations. For those playing at home, the counties to watch here include Passaic (45% Latino, per the Census), Hudson (41%), Cumberland (36%) and Union (35%). Trump improved in all of them from his 2020 national loss to 2024 win. He was the first Republican to win Passaic since 1992. He won it by about 3 points after losing it by 16 points four years earlier and 22 points in 2016.   \n   4. What messaging lessons do Democrats take out of Tuesday?    There are very different candidates running in these elections. And they are likely to serve as different examples over the next year of how to run — or not — as a Democrat.   For New York mayor, for example, Zohran Mamdani has captured the imaginations of progressives with his focus on affordability. But he's also become a lightning rod on the right for his criticisms of Israel and past tweets calling for defunding the police.   \n   He has since disavowed the idea of defunding the police and says safety is a top priority. How he does Tuesday — and, more importantly, how he governs, if he wins — could indicate whether Democrats nationally run with his message and style, or if they prefer the more reserved approach of their gubernatorial candidates in Virginia and New Jersey.   Abigail Spanberger in Virginia is running on \"tradition\" and \"service,\" and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey stresses her military credentials. But the truth is Democrats are in the wilderness, and there's no perfect way to run.   First of all, candidates have to be authentic, true to themselves. Few will be able to replicate Mamdani's knack for using social media. And Mamdani can't invent being a CIA officer (Spanberger) or Navy helicopter pilot (Sherrill). What his campaign has exposed most is that a focus on affordability with a clear message and a lack of condescension toward a younger generation has been key for winning over younger progressives.   \n   Of course, not everywhere is New York and progressives aren't a majority of voters. That's something Democrats, in particular, have to balance as the party has traditionally had a wider range of views and identities.   5. What will the elections mean for the shutdown?    The country is careening toward the longest government shutdown in American history. There is no real end in sight, but Tuesday's results may have an impact.   Health care has been a major reason for this shutdown. Democrats want to extend subsidies before they expire at the end of the year so tens of millions of people don't see their premiums go way up.   Republicans are refusing to negotiate until the government is reopened, but Democrats are skeptical they would negotiate in good faith at all.   During the longest shutdown in history in 2019, polling clearly showed a majority blaming Trump for the shutdown. That put pressure on Trump to come to the table. But this time around, even though Republicans are getting more of the blame, it's not as overwhelming as six years ago. And that has the two sides in a stalemate.   \n   Tuesday could shake that up, especially if there are definitive results in one direction or the other.\n",

People here are concerned about suburban issues like traffic, rapid development and gas prices.   It's a red area represented by a Republican in Congress. But an election Tuesday will determine whether the state redraws congressional lines and divides people here into districts likely to elect Democrats to the U.S. House.   \"We want to keep our communities that are alike together, right? And so if we get sucked into Sacramento or, you know, somewhere, we don't share the same needs, right?\" says Amanda Cortez, a Republican who serves on the Loomis Town Council.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Republican Amanda Cortez, member of the Loomis, CA., town council, opposes the redistricting map on the ballot.\n                \n                    Laura Fitzgerald/CapRadio\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Laura Fitzgerald/CapRadio\n    \n\n   \n   The result of the election in California on Tuesday could determine not only who represents Cortez and her neighbors in Loomis, but who controls the U.S. House after the midterm elections next year.   \n   California's ballot question was a reaction to Trump's redistricting push   This summer President Trump set off a national redistricting race, starting in Texas, to boost chances for GOP candidates in 2026. Missouri and North Carolina Republicans also redistricted and Trump is urging leaders in Indiana, Kansas and other states to follow. Democrats say the GOP is gerrymandering in ways that dilute the votes of Black and Latino communities.   \n   California's redistricting proposal, Proposition 50, would redraw the state's congressional map to help yield up to five new seats for Democrats. California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom set it in motion after Texas Republicans moved to get the edge in five seats in their state.   Republicans in California could pay the price. Mike Murray, another Republican voter in the third Congressional district that Loomis is in, says the ballot proposal will dilute his community's voice by splitting the county into three separate districts.   \n   \"If we wanted to live in an urban community with the problems and the benefits of an urban community, we would. But we choose to live here. And when we choose to live here, we hope that somebody will represent us in our way of life,\" Murray said.   Eric Schickler, co-director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, says opponents of  California's redistricting plan are concerned it will sideline the state's independent citizens redistricting commission, which has helped give their communities a voice.    \n   \"The basic argument made by opponents of Prop 50 is that the non-partisan process that was set up in 2008 for the legislature and 2010 for Congress has worked well for the state. It's giving rise to more competitive elections,\" Schickler said.   Democrats see a chance to counter Trump's national agenda   But for proponents, mainly Democrats, California's special election is all about Congress and the Trump administration.   \"To the extent that voters care about having a check on President Trump, well, you need a Democratic House to do that, is the argument that Democrats are making,\" Schickler added.   Cyan Samone lives in Truckee, California near Lake Tahoe, a blue dot in the same Republican congressional district as the town of Loomis.   At a recent gathering of local Democrats organizing to support Prop 50, Samone said the redistricting is a chance to push back on the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.   \"I have a lot of friends who are immigrants from different countries who have left authoritarian regimes,\" said Samone. \"You see the patterns and you just don't want to see that happen here and I don't want to have to see people who fled terrible situations having to run again.\"   Samone's husband, Ben Woodard, says redistricting could mean Democrats here are able to elect a representative that'll pay more attention to what his community needs.   \"The Democratic Party representative would do that,\" Woodard said. \"Look over our interests like, you know, the cuts to Medicare definitely impact rural health care.\"   Supporters of California's redistricting measure appear to have the upper hand heading into election week. It's a state with a deep blue electorate and many voters see this as a national struggle.      Laura Fitzgerald covers California state politics for CapRadio.\n",

Starting on Saturday, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP benefits are set to lapse, impacting millions of Americans amid the government shutdown.\n                \n                    Matthew Hatcher/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Matthew Hatcher/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   More than 40 million Americans who rely on federal food assistance woke up to uncertainty on Saturday over whether their aid is secure or when it will resume in full.   A federal judge in Rhode Island on Friday ordered the White House to use contingency funds to pay for those benefits. But it was unclear how that decision would correspond with a separate decision by a judge in Massachusetts telling the administration it had until \"no later than Monday\" to come up with a way to use emergency funds to pay for aid.   The impasse over funding the government means that the nearly 1 in 8 U.S. residents who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, to buy groceries may be facing at least a temporary lapse in benefits. Following Friday's decisions, President Trump said he had directed government lawyers to find a way to pay for SNAP, and that he instructed them to seek further clarity on the rulings. He cautioned, however, that even with immediate guidance, benefits \"will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out.\"    \n   SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, is the country's largest anti-hunger program.   \n   A coalition of Democratic governors and attorneys general are suing the federal government to keep the payments flowing, arguing the benefits cannot legally be cut off. The Trump administration says it's not legal to extend the benefits using emergency funds — though the administration extended benefits during a shutdown in the first term.   As congressional gridlock continues, states are exploring what they can offer their residents who've just lost their food aid.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Volunteers on the National Mall sorted groceries during the People's Pantry Food drive to replenish food banks on Thursday as the lapse in SNAP benefits was approaching.\n                \n                    Oliver Contreras/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Oliver Contreras/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Eyes turning to food banks    Food bank administrators are warning that the loss of November SNAP benefits could lead to a public health crisis.   Jason Riggs, the director of advocacy and public policy at Roadrunner Food Bank of New Mexico, likens it to the recession 17 years ago and the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.   \n   \"This is a huge increase in need, but that's where comparisons end,\" he said. \"When [those] happened, there was a robust SNAP program, with all its flaws, doing what it is designed to do. And that's the difference with what's happening right now — there will not be SNAP. There will just be the same kind of catastrophic need for food.\"   More than 21% of New Mexico residents receive SNAP benefits, the highest rate in the nation.    Loading... \n   People are turning to food banks to help fill in the assistance gap, but administrators caution they aren't designed to act as a safety net for a government program.   \"It's very daunting,\" Riggs told NPR. \"SNAP can provide nine times the amount of meals as the entire nationwide food bank network.\"   Central Texas Food Bank CEO Sari Vatske said shutdowns aren't like other food crises.   \"In a situation during a natural disaster where we could rely on our sister food banks for support, with this government shutdown, we are all experiencing the same need,\" she said.   Businesses that partner with grocery retailers and restaurants to take surplus or near-expired food and sell it at a heavy discount, like Too Good To Go and Flashfood, are trying to reach people affected.   Flashfood CEO Jordan Schenck said the organization has seen a spike in downloads in the last few days.   \"That started as [the SNAP cliff] really became more prevalent in the media. We've definitely seen more traffic,\" Schenck told NPR.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Anthony Bryant, a volunteer with Feeding South Florida, prepares food items to give to government workers on October 28, 2025 in Dania Beach, Florida. As the government shutdown nears four weeks, Feeding America and its members have been launching food distribution sites for people affected by the government shutdown.\n                \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Joe Raedle/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   The view from Capitol Hill     One month into the shutdown, there is no concrete off-ramp.   \n   The Senate left D.C. on Thursday for the weekend, ahead of two major pain points of the shutdown coming into sharper relief on Saturday: the SNAP cliff, and the start of open enrollment for health insurance plans sold on the exchanges as part of the Affordable Care Act.   Health care has been at the center of Congressional Democrats' shutdown strategy. They have demanded that Republicans negotiate with them to extend the enhanced subsidies, which were boosted during the pandemic. They are set to expire at the end of the year. If nothing changes, Americans who purchase healthcare via the exchange could see their premiums skyrocket.   At a Thursday town hall with Maryland Democrats, including Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, Democratic constituents urged the party to hold the line.   \"I think they should hold out as long as possible,\" said Maryland voter Christina Thompson. \"It's clear whose shutdown this is. Republicans hold all the leverage and all the cards. And if we back out now, then we're just showing again the party has no backbone.\"   Republicans have maintained throughout the month-long shutdown that Democrats must first vote alongside them to fund the government, before addressing the health care subsidies.   The typically subdued Senate Majority Leader John Thune R-S.D., reproached Democrats on the floor Wednesday after they tried to pass a measure that would fund SNAP and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).   \"This isn't a political game,\" Thune said, raising his voice. \"These are real people's lives we're talking about and you all just figured out 29 days that, oh there might be some consequences?\"\n",

Today's top stories   Tomorrow, many Americans will feel the impact of the government shutdown as SNAP food benefits will run out for about 42 million people. Saturday also marks the start of enrollment on federal insurance exchanges, and premiums are expected to more than double on average. Democrats say they'll vote to reopen the government if Congress extends health care subsidies to help manage the rising costs. Yesterday, major airlines asked Congress to pass the Republicans' stopgap funding plan as air traffic controllers continue to work without pay.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The air traffic control tower is seen at Orlando International Airport in Orlando, Florida early morning on Oct. 31. Flights at Orlando International Airport faced major delays on Oct. 30, after the Federal Aviation Administration said the airport had no certified air-traffic controllers in its tower, forcing arrivals to be halted or severely delayed amid the ongoing US government shutdown.\n                \n                    Miguel J.

Rodriguez Carrillo/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Democrats have traditionally been hesitant to shut down the government, but don't appear to be backing down, NPR's Barbara Sprunt tells Up First. Democrats seem to think Republicans will take the blame for the shutdown and not them. They are hoping public pressure will build on the GOP over the expected rise in costs of health insurance premiums. Republicans say they are holding votes to fund the government and if Democrats care about funding nutrition aid and paying air traffic controllers, they would vote with them.   \n   SNAP benefits have never been cut off due to a shutdown, and now a federal judge is stepping in to decide whether to order the Trump administration to find ways to get people money to buy food. The Agriculture Department posted on its website that \"the well has run dry\" and stated in a memo that it doesn't have sufficient funds for SNAP benefits for next month and cannot legally use contingency funds. Democratic governors and attorneys general from about two dozen states sued, arguing that SNAP is an entitlement that cannot be simply cut off.    🎧 Even if the ruling comes soon, there will still be a delay in states receiving the funds they need, according to NPR's Jennifer Ludden. This is because the federal government sends funding to the states before the first of the month, and then it takes days to get it onto the debit-like cards that people use. An added complication is that the full SNAP funding for November is approximately $9 billion, but the administration reports that there is only about $5.5 billion in the contingency fund. Recalculating for partial payments could take weeks, resulting in people not only having to wait but also getting less money.   \n   President Trump announced yesterday that the U.S. would resume testing nuclear weapons for the first time in decades. Some experts believe that this decision would be a major escalation and could disrupt the nuclear balance of power.    🎧 The world's major nuclear powers have observed a testing moratorium since the 1990s as a goodwill gesture for stability after the Cold War, says NPR's Geoff Brumfiel. The U.S. embarked on a program that utilizes science to ensure weapons function effectively without requiring testing. Much of that science happens in the same tunnels in the desert outside of Las Vegas where the government used to conduct nuclear testing. The U.S. has a significant technological advantage over Russia and China regarding nuclear weapons, but if those countries resume testing, they could narrow that gap, says Jon Wolfsthal at the Federation of American Scientists. There are also environmental concerns that even if radiation is contained underground, the shaking would be enough to damage buildings near the site.

In April, researchers released results from a study involving over 300 individuals age 50 and older who were genetically predisposed to Alzheimer's disease. The overall findings indicated that those who received the drug did not perform better than those given a placebo. However, in September, a further analysis of a subgroup of 125 participants revealed mild benefits for those who had only mild memory issues at the start of their treatment with the drug.    💊 By one measure, the drug slowed cognitive decline by 52% in people with mild cognitive impairment. It is challenging, however, to assess the true impact of ALZ-801 due to the small sample size in the mild cognitive impairment group.💊 ALZ-801 could get special consideration from the Food and Drug Administration due to its potential advantages over the two drugs already on the market. The drug can be taken at home and does not cause swelling or bleeding in the brain, which often comes with monoclonal antibody treatment.💊 More evidence of the drug's effectiveness is expected to come from people who have continued to take the medicine after the initial 18-month study period ended, says David Watson, a co-author of the new study.   \n   Read more about the new findings about the Alzheimer's pill.

Saturday he's golfing. On Friday night, he hosted a glitzy gathering at his Mar-a-Lago resort, where guests dressed in sequins, fedoras, feathers and long pearl necklaces. The Great Gatsby-inspired theme for the event was \"A Little Party Never Killed Nobody.\"   This isn't an isolated trip for the president. He has spent nearly two full weeks outside of Washington since the shutdown began.   There are missed paychecks for federal workers, travel disruptions and SNAP food assistance is at risk for millions of Americans. The White House and Republicans in Congress blame Democrats in the Senate for refusing to support a short-term funding bill that would reopen the government.   \n   \"They've lost their minds,\" Trump said of Democrats from Air Force One on his way to Florida. \"All they have to do is say the government is open, and that's the end of it.\"   Trump spent less than 24 hours in Washington, D.C. this week. Most of the week, he was in Asia, on a three country trip that started in Malaysia. He was greeted there by a brass band and brightly clothed dancers. Trump got in on it too, doing his signature Trump dance, swaying with clenched fists.   This lengthy foreign trip, Trump's second time overseas during this shutdown, marked a significant break with how past presidents, including Trump himself, have approached government shutdowns. They have typically avoided the bad optics of skipping town during a crisis.   \n   In 1995, President Clinton canceled a planned trip to Japan during the government shutdown so he could stay at the White House for talks with Republicans who controlled both the House and Senate.   \"We spent a number of days in the Oval Office basically negotiating … trying to see if we could find a way to resolve it,\" said Leon Panetta, who was Clinton's chief of staff at the time. \"Because the last thing we wanted to do was to have the government shut down. That, unfortunately, is no longer the case.\"   During a lengthy shutdown in 2013, then-President Obama canceled a four-nation Asia trip. And in 2019, President Trump had a trip planned to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.   \"If the shutdown continues, I won't go,\" Trump said.   The shutdown continued. And he didn't go. Back then, though, Trump was talking about negotiating. He was trying to get border wall funding added to a government funding bill.   \"Look, this is really something that should be bipartisan,\" Trump said as that shutdown dragged on. \"And we'll see if it is. I hope it is.\"   \n   2019 versus 2025   That shutdown lasted 35 days, the longest on record. An NPR analysis finds that during that period, Trump only left Washington for six days. He traveled to:   Iraq to greet the troops around ChristmasDover Air Force Base in Delaware for the dignified transfer of Americans killed in an attack in SyriaCamp David in Maryland for a dayThe U.S.-Mexico border to make the case for border wall fundingNew Orleans to speak to the American Farm Bureau   There were no visits to Mar-a-Lago resort.   This time is quite different. Since the start of the shutdown on October 1, Trump has seemingly made no adjustments to his travel plans and normal routines. His travels have included:   Two trips to FloridaGolfed twice at his course near Washington, D.C.Israel and Egypt to mark the signing of the Gaza ceasefire agreementStops in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea during a six day trip   Not counting his golf outings in Virginia, Trump spent all or part of 14 days outside of Washington during the first 31 days of the shutdown.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump speaks to journalists aboard Air Force One en route to South Korea on October 29, 2025.\n                \n                    Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Republicans say there is nothing to negotiate until the government reopens   Just before Trump returned to the White House from Asia, Vice President JD Vance held a press conference to reassert the administration's position.   \"We are not going to give in on policy demands under the threat of hostage taking,\" he said. There would be no negotiations until Democrats vote to reopen the government.   \"We need five more reasonable Democrats to put the American people first and reopen the government. That's all that we're asking,\" Vance said.   \n   And it isn't just Trump. The GOP-controlled House of Representatives was away the entire month of October. The Senate has voted 13 times on the same funding bill, failing each time because of a lack of support from Democrats. Senators went home for the weekend on Thursday, with many of them encountering flight delays related to the shutdown.   Democrats, who in the past have supported bills like the temporary funding measure Trump and Republicans are insisting on, say they want to negotiate. But, so far Republicans are sticking with their position that there is nothing to negotiate until the government is open.   \n   \"Trump can behave however he wants in this situation,\" said Doug Heye, who was deputy chief of staff to a top house Republican during the 2013 government shutdown. \"Whether he's going to events in foreign countries or just sort of living life, none of that interferes with what the core argument is, which is Republicans saying, 'we've done our job, Democrats step up and do yours.' To do anything different would actually cut against their own messaging.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump greets Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on October 30, 2025 in Busan, South Korea.\n                \n                    Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Also, he said, Trump clearly isn't all that concerned with political risk from looking like he isn't engaged in ending the shutdown. Even if Trump keeps teasing a 2028 run for an unconstitutional third term, the president  is governing like he has nothing to lose, said Heye.   \"He is YOLO [you only live once] and he is going to do what he wants, wherever he wants and he is going to push the boundaries as far as he can, because whatever he talks about, he's not going to be on the ballot again,\" said Heye.   But Panetta, who served in congress and multiple Democratic administrations, sees it differently. He says what's happening now is an abdication of a basic responsibility to govern.   \"We've elected these people and they're not there. They've left Washington. They're going on trips,\" said Panetta. \"They're basically walking away from the very responsibility that they should be exercising as elected officials. I mean, that's what's depressing about all of this.\"   White House spokesperson Anna Kelly defended the president's travel as good for the country.   \"While Democrats flail, President Trump won't stop delivering historic wins for our country while simultaneously finding creative ways to pay our troops and reduce the suffering as a result of Democrats' far-left priorities,\" Kelly said of Trump's Asia travels.   NPR's Sam Gringlas, Saige Miller and Anusha Mathur contributed to this report. \n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's A Martinez speaks to Democratic Gov. Matt Meyer of Delaware, who declared a state of emergency to temporarily fund SNAP benefits for his state's recipients of the federal food aid.   \n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  Some governors are using state funds to try and close the federal gap in food assistance. In Delaware, Democratic Governor Matt Meyer declared a state of emergency to temporarily replace SNAP benefits with money from the state. Governor, about 11% of Delaware's residents receive SNAP benefits. Will they all be covered, at least for the time being?MATT MEYER: Yes, they will. One in 9 Delawarians rely on SNAP - 119,000 people. Two-thirds of them are families with children. Thirty-six percent are family members who are seniors - or have family members who are seniors or with disabilities.MARTÍNEZ: And for how long will they be covered for in Delaware?MEYER: Well, you know, I made a promise to our people that we're going to do everything we can, look at our budget and move money around to feed our people as long as we can. Normally, SNAP assistance is provided one time on a monthly basis. A card is loaded electronically. We're going to do that weekly, just looking at what the federal government is doing. We don't believe this is a state financial responsibility, but as a governor, we need to stand up and lead in this time and make sure in one of the wealthiest countries in the world our people literally don't go hungry.MARTÍNEZ: Do you think Delaware will be OK at least through November?MEYER: We will definitely be OK through November. To be honest, there's a...MARTÍNEZ: OK.MEYER: ...Parking lot project where - that's in our budget to build a parking lot - $20 million that will get us enough money to get through November. We're willing to shift money around, put that parking lot project on delay, and we're looking at other things too if necessary.MARTÍNEZ: Now, SNAP's a federal program. So how do you direct state money to SNAP residents? Don't you need approval from lawmakers to do that?MEYER: Yeah. It's a great question that's much more complicated behind the scenes than I have time to explain. But putting money on a card that's sort of federally designated is not easy. We're technically not doing it under the SNAP program. We're originating a new program during the state emergency that effectively fills the card with resources based on state rules. So we're trying to make it as simple as possible for SNAP users, for mostly working Americans who are struggling in this time to have money on their cards. So Delawarians with SNAP cards, they're not going to see any difference from October to November except that their benefits will be received on a weekly basis and not once on a monthly basis.MARTÍNEZ: Would that money - would that state money be money that you'd want replenished by the federal government? Is that something that you would want to do?MEYER: I think it's a federal responsibility. For 86 years, since the food stamp program was created in 1939, this has been a federal responsibility. So, yes. I think we're one of 25 states. We have a fantastic attorney general, Kathy Jennings, who was among those who sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture, saying, you have the money to pay this. And if and when federal money does come, either through this discretionary fund at the federal level or through later refunding, we're going to use that money and use it to fill our state coffers.MARTÍNEZ: The USDA says it can't legally use contingency funds to cover regular SNAP benefits. What's your response to that?MEYER: Well, we'll see what the court says.MARTÍNEZ: OK.MEYER: I think it's - I have a legal background, and I think there have been several times before when this administration, you know, in my nine months in office, have said things with a hundred percent certainty that turned out not to be legally accurate. So we're a country of law, and we'll see what the judges say.MARTÍNEZ: Governor, do you feel that the state of Delaware is being let down by the federal government? Not necessarily just the administration, but Congress - the House, the Senate and the White House put together right now.MEYER: It's not lost on me that on the same day I declared a state of emergency, something no governor in our state's history - the First State - no governor has ever had to do. Nvidia surpassed $5 trillion in market capitalization. We are a rich country at a time when stock markets are hitting records. This is a total failure of leadership. And I'm hoping - I've also made it very clear to the people of Delaware, to state legislators, other elected officials that this is probably not the first chip to fall. There's more coming.I recognize that this stalemate in Washington is largely about health care. And right now, lawmakers could decide to end the shutdown and fund programs like SNAP so governors like myself don't have this problem. But then we're going to have another huge problem that health care premiums will be doubling for millions of Americans. So these are all self-inflicted crises. And in a wealthy country like ours, we got to find a better way.MARTÍNEZ: Just a few moments left, Governor. How do you square that with your constituents when they ask you, like, why is this happening? What do you tell them?MEYER: Well, first of all, I tell my constituents you're going to eat. You're going to have food benefits that we've had for as long as the SNAP program has existed. So I tell them my job and our job as state leaders is to protect you. In terms of what's going on in Washington, listen, there's a Republican executive. There's a Republican president, President Trump. There's a Republican legislature. The courts - Supreme Court is largely controlled by the Republican Party. This is the direction the country's going in now. It's not the direction that I want it to go in. I appreciate that Democratic legislators are fighting, and we got to fight. But while we're fighting, we got to make sure people can eat.MARTÍNEZ: That's Democratic Governor Matt Meyer of Delaware. Governor, thank you.MEYER: Thanks so much.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Scott Detrow speaks with Sen. Lisa Murkowski about the possible loss of SNAP benefits due to the shutdown.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  Tomorrow - November 1 - is the day that federal food assistance will be drastically cut or reduced for tens of millions of people across the United States. The loss of SNAP benefits would be just the latest casualty of a federal government shutdown that has now gone on for a month.Senate Democrats and the Trump administration remain dug in, and as federal workers go without paychecks and now people will begin to go without critical food assistance, there's been some talk from some lawmakers about more narrowly targeted bills to keep specific parts of government funding flowing. Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski has been part of those talks as well as others, as she often is, and joins us now. Hi, Senator.LISA MURKOWSKI: Hey. How are you this afternoon?DETROW: Let's start with this. SNAP is a broad program. Something like 66,000 Alaskans rely on it. What are you telling your constituents about what to expect and why those benefits are going away?MURKOWSKI: Well, everyone has been watching the news of this prolonged shutdown. They see these looming deadlines. It has been well advertised that SNAP benefits would run out at the end of this month. And so my effort has been, let's get this government open. Let's make sure that not only SNAP benefits are paid, but that our military are paid, our Coast Guard are paid, our federal workers, our air traffic controllers.But we are sitting here on the day before these benefits are due to be paid out, and we're told by the secretary that the well is dry. So it is, I think, a dire situation. You mentioned the number in Alaska. Over 66,000 Alaskans rely on SNAP benefits. Around the country, it's over 12% of the population that rely on SNAP benefits.DETROW: Yep.MURKOWSKI: Forty-one million people - this is significant, and this is real harm to real people.DETROW: I want to talk about the more narrow bills to just fund SNAP, the broader state of negotiations. But first, I want to ask this - and this is tied to a federal court case that is being decided right now - this question of whether the U.S. Department of Agriculture could be funding SNAP right now with contingency funding. We have seen the Trump administration move money to keep paying members of the military, for instance. First of all, do you believe the administration has the power to keep SNAP going through the weekend?MURKOWSKI: Well, they do have contingency funds, and we have asked very specifically about the ability to spend those contingency funds to help pay out SNAP benefits or at least partial. Again, we have seen coming out of the USDA and the secretary of agriculture the statement that that will not be forthcoming.I have seen different statements indicating that these contingency funds need to be reserved for disasters. We just had a disaster in Alaska. And so for those SNAP recipients in Alaska who have suffered this disaster, yeah, we want to make sure that they have some level of assistance or relief there.But I do think it is - it's important to recognize that just this afternoon, the courts did come out with a ruling ordering the Trump administration to pay for food stamps during this shutdown, saying that they must distribute aid using what they're calling a set of emergency funds. I don't know what that is and where that might come from.DETROW: And my understanding is at minimum, that wouldn't begin until Monday. So I think either way, we're looking...MURKOWSKI: Yeah.DETROW: ...At the weekend without these benefits.MURKOWSKI: Well, and keep in mind that when you have a lapse in programs, oftentimes you will see a gap there. This is why I felt it was so important that we not get into this place in the first place...DETROW: Well...MURKOWSKI: ...Not be in a situation where we were actually going to see these benefits not be able to be paid out and these individuals left hanging and wondering how they're going to feed their family.DETROW: Let's just zoom out then for a moment because the Trump White House is not negotiating. Senate Democrats are saying that they will not take any vote to reopen the government until there's a guarantee on extending these health care credits. You are one of the, you know, at times it seems like dwindling members of the Senate who are having conversations on both sides of the aisle. Do you see any clear path forward, or even beginning of a path forward, at this point in time?MURKOWSKI: Yes. Yes. And it's not as if we're just now starting to define a path. There has been a good number of folks on both sides of the aisle that have engaged in good, constructive dialogue about the ways that we get through this shutdown, what it's going to look like. There are good, constructive conversations that are happening. They have been proceeding. They are occurring now. And...DETROW: Is there a most likely path? I know negotiations can change quickly, but is there a most likely path? Is it a short-term spending bill? Is it a guarantee of a future vote? Like, what do you think is the most likely way to...MURKOWSKI: I...DETROW: ...Get moving again?MURKOWSKI: I think you're going to see an effort to ensure that we start moving on our appropriations bills that we have already moved through the full committee. Keep in mind, we wouldn't be talking about a SNAP issue if we had been able to enact the agriculture appropriations bill into law. It's already moved through the committee. It just needs to be conferenced, and this wouldn't be an issue at all. So whether it is funding for the military, let's get the defense appropriations bill through. If it's funding for air traffic controllers, let's get the appropriations bill through.So I hope you're going to see a path where we are advancing our appropriations bills through the process here in the Senate, through the conference that we will have with the House - an opportunity for us to address, as the Senate, the ACA premium tax credits and the expiration that we see on that at the end of this year. And so that is obviously part of the mix.The bill that we have been voting on from the House is an extension through the 21 of November. That's not going to be sufficient time for us. So how far do we move that towards the end of the year is another subject of debate. But there's...DETROW: What's your confidence level this is done by the next first of the month, December 1?MURKOWSKI: My confidence level on this - that it is done by December 1 - is very high.DETROW: All right. That is Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Thank you so much.MURKOWSKI: OK, thanks so much, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

That wouldn't be particularly notable, except there is a government shutdown that is creating more and more real-world consequences, including that impending lapse in SNAP benefits. This is not an isolated trip for the president. NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports Trump has spent nearly two weeks outside of Washington since the shutdown began October 1.TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: When President Trump arrived in Malaysia earlier this week, he was greeted by a brass band and dancers. Trump got in on it, too, as described in this color commentary that went out on the White House video feed.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: In rare, lighthearted moment, President Donald Trump has joined the Malaysian dancers, moving to the cheerful rhythm of the ensemble.KEITH: It was the start of a weeklong trip to Asia that included stops in three countries, but it also marked a significant break with how past presidents, including Trump himself, have approached government shutdowns. They have typically avoided the bad optics of skipping town during a crisis. In 1995, President Clinton canceled a trip to Japan during a shutdown. Republicans controlled Congress at the time. Leon Panetta was Clinton's chief of staff.LEON PANETTA: We spent a number of days in the Oval Office basically negotiating with both Speaker Gingrich and majority leader Bob Dole because the last thing we wanted to do was to have the government shut down.KEITH: During the 2013 shutdown, then-President Obama canceled a four-nation Asia trip. And in 2019, President Trump had a trip planned to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If the shutdown continues, I won't go.KEITH: The shutdown continued, and he didn't go. That shutdown lasted 35 days, the longest on record. An NPR analysis finds that during that period, Trump only left Washington for six days, and there were no visits to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.This time is quite different. During the monthlong shutdown, Trump has gone to Florida twice, golfed at his club in Virginia,and visited the Middle East and Asia - 13 days on the road so far with more to come. The White House position on negotiating is different now, too. Vice President Vance spoke to the press yesterday.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JD VANCE: We're not going to give in on policy demands under the threat of hostage taking.KEITH: He said Republicans won't negotiate with Democrats until they vote to reopen the government. The GOP-controlled House of Representatives has been gone all month. The Senate voted 13 times on the same funding bill and failed each time without enough Democratic support. Democrats say they want to negotiate. Doug Heye was a House Republican aid during the 2013 government shutdown, and he doesn't fault the president for leaving now.DOUG HEYE: Whether he's going to events in foreign countries or just sort of living life, none of that interferes with what the core argument is, which is Republicans saying, we've done our job - Democrats, step up and do yours. To do anything different would actually cut against their own messaging.KEITH: But Leon Panetta, who served in Congress and multiple Democratic administrations, sees it differently.PANETTA: They're basically walking away from the very responsibility that they should be exercising as elected officials. I mean, that's what's depressing about all of this.KEITH: White House spokesperson Anna Kelly defended the president's travel, saying he secured massive investments in the U.S. economy.

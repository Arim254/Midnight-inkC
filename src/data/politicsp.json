    "body": "\n      NPR's Steve Inskeep speaks with Republican Minnesota State Rep. Nolan West, who represents part of Minneapolis, about the reservations he's expressed on the federal show of force in the state.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Some people who voted for President Trump have been horrified by the video from Minnesota. We heard elsewhere on today's program about a focus group of Trump voters from 2024 who've turned against his immigration policy. They'd seen the video. They knew it frame by frame. In Minnesota, Republican candidate for governor dropped out to show his objection to that policy, and Republican Nolan West joins us next from Minnesota. He is a state representative, and his district includes some of the Twin Cities' northern suburbs. Welcome to the program, sir.NOLAN WEST: Thanks for having me on.INSKEEP: I noticed that you put out a statement over the weekend calling for an end to the federal immigration operation in Minnesota. Did you have some personal experience that motivated you to say that?WEST: Oh, so that was the day of my 1-year-old's birthday. And my wife was going to pick out a cake - well, pick up a cake from a baker on the very street where Pretti was shot minutes after it happened. As she was leaving, droves of protesters were showing up, and it took her, like, an extra 20 minutes to get home.INSKEEP: And how did that affect you when you heard that story?WEST: Well, I was already looking at the situation with resounding depression, let's say. And when you see this happening in your own state and somewhat again after it happened recently, it's - just hurts. And when it affects your family's safety, and, you know, honestly, I was more concerned about the protesters and her safety than the ICE agents posing any threat to her.INSKEEP: Understood.WEST: But it was still, like, a horrible situation. And knowing it's an ongoing situation, and the only way to stop it I see is the federal government to do something.INSKEEP: Would you have been in support of the way the president has been enforcing immigration law up to the last month or two in Minnesota?WEST: Well, I think there's broad support for deporting illegal immigrants who have committed an actual crime or charged with drug or murder or something, a violent crime like that. The idea that we're going to deport every single one was never - like, it's shocking that that seems like it was even attempted because, you know, our immigration system has been broken for so many years that that was never going to be something doable without, well, one, violence and two, economic calamity 'cause significant parts of our economy, especially in agriculture, depend on them.INSKEEP: I want to be clear, the Trump administration has constantly given multiple messages on this. We were told during the campaign, first, we're going to get rid of the criminals, which it sounds like you completely support and which most Americans would support. But then they kept adding to the numbers, increasing the numbers, saying, actually, it's 11 million, maybe 15 million, maybe 20 million. A few weeks ago, the Department of Homeland Security talked about 100 million deportations, which, of course, is far more than the number of people without legal status in the entire United States. Was there something of a bait-and-switch, or just inviting people to believe what they wanted to do what they liked?WEST: Well, I mean, there's always a difference between any presidential candidate's campaign and their administration. It happens with every single administration. I don't - I can't speak to their motives, but I would like them to stick to a more refined approach that doesn't have any of these situations where they, you know, even just detain a U.S. citizen is unacceptable.INSKEEP: I want to take a little bit of extra time and talk about what the administration has said over the last several days and get your thoughts about it. As you know very well, the Trump administration got its say on this - referred to Mr. Pretti, your fellow citizen, as a domestic terrorist, said that he had brandished a gun, when video clearly showed that he did not brandish a gun. Lots of other things were said, saying that he wanted to do maximum damage to immigration agents and so forth. Now we have an opportunity to hear from the other side, a friend of Alex Pretti was on All Things Considered, the NPR program, yesterday. Scott Detlow (ph) spoke - Detrow spoke with Heather Zielinski, who's a friend of this nurse, this ICU nurse. And here's some of their conversation.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)SCOTT DETROW: I want to ask what you thought when you heard Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem call Alex Pretti a domestic terrorist or top White House aide Stephen Miller call him a would-be assassin.HEATHER ZIELINSKI: Liars, traitors, cowards.INSKEEP: And she went on to say a little more.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)ZIELINSKI: He was nothing like what the people you just named said. He was an American citizen. He was a good man. He was a hard worker, and he cared for people.INSKEEP: What do you think of the way the administration has handled this incident once it happened?WEST: I mean, it obviously was a complete disaster. For one, when you speak in these situations, you don't speak for yourself. You speak for the organization you represent. And I have no idea why it was so hard not to say, you know, this is a active investigation. We're going to investigate, get to the bottom of it, and we have no comment at this time, and then actually investigate it and cooperate with state investigators. I just - it was absolutely horrifying to see. I'm glad it looks like there's a corner being turned with the conversations between Governor Walz and President Trump, and bringing in Tom Homan as somebody who doesn't have a bunch of statements that they refuse to retract. So I'm optimistic that we're trending in the right direction now, but the response was terrible.INSKEEP: What do you want from your state's Democratic governor, now, Governor Walz, who did speak with President Trump?WEST: Well, I would like to see him meaningfully compromise. Like, both sides have been really dug in. One of the things that caused this, outside of just having federal agents here, is local law enforcement, state patrol were pulled from providing protection for them, which created a lot of these opportunities for ICE agents who are not properly trained for this kind of stuff to engage with protesters. And that - you know, that helped create this situation. So what I would like to see is, OK, you have to get less ICE agents on the street. Like, that's his position he wants (ph). Let's make sure we - the federal government takes them out and they can do that if you help them enforce a more targeted approach. And that's what I would like to see.INSKEEP: And I guess we'll just note for the record. We've heard differing statements about whether police have said they're withdrawing from DHS or whether DHS isn't giving them information. But in any case, you are correct that in this incident and so many others, it's DHS people not trained for crowd control who are doing crowd control and a little more. Representative, thanks for your time. I really appreciate it.WEST: Thank you for having me.INSKEEP: Nolan West is a Republican state representative in Minnesota who has called for federal immigration agents to pull back.(SOUNDBITE OF PARACHUTE DAY'S \"YEARBOOK\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Steve Inskeep asks conservative political consultant and pollster Sarah Longwell how voters are reacting to ICE operation in Minnesota.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  How do voters view all of this? We've called Sarah Longwell, who is a political consultant and pollster and publisher of the conservative website The Bulwark. Good morning.SARAH LONGWELL: Good morning.INSKEEP: OK. As I understand it, you had a focus group last night with some swing voters - people who voted for Biden in 2020 and then Trump in 2024. What was it like, and what did you hear?LONGWELL: Well, here's the most remarkable thing about this story, which is that everybody had organically heard about it. One of the things that - when it comes to voters and big news stories, they're not always connected.INSKEEP: Yeah.LONGWELL: It might be something we're talking about in Washington, but the voters - it hasn't really broken through to them. In both the cases of the shooting of Renee Good and of Alex Pretti, everybody had heard about it. Everybody had seen the videos. And the slight difference, 'cause we've been talking to voters over the last three weeks since the shooting of Renee Good - there was much more of a sense after Renee Good's shooting that people said, you know, bad things happen. It's a tragedy, but she shouldn't have been parked there, and maybe she was going to hit him with her car. The Alex Pretti shooting - there's no ambiguity with voters. They are fed up with ICE's tactics. They believe that they voted for Trump to get dangerous criminals off the streets, not to shoot Americans. And so not only had they seen it, but they were dramatically against it.INSKEEP: I want to explain for people who don't follow this every day. When we say focus group, this is a small group of people in a room or on a Zoom call or - just talking together. But a small group of people in all walks of life, and you hear their kind of in-depth thoughts and conversations. Is that how this went?LONGWELL: That's right. And when you have polling, you can tell from the polling that the social impact of ICE's actions has led to a major backlash in public opinion. When we do a focus group, we're trying to figure out why. What is it about what's happening that is causing that movement? And in this case, it is the disconnect between what people see as the overzealous actions of ICE - the fact that there are all these troops on the streets, that they're creating chaos, that they're shooting Americans - versus what people wanted when they voted for Trump, which was a secure border and dangerous criminals deported.INSKEEP: Are there two parts to the failure among the - as perceived by the voters here? One being the actual killing, which people could see for themselves, and the other thing being the obviously false statements that the U.S. government made in our name with our tax dollars.LONGWELL: You know, the - I would say voters are aware that there is some disconnect, although that tends to not be the locus of their outrage. The locus of their outrage is that they have seen the video. They can tell you chapter and verse, scene by scene, what the ICE agents did wrong. And I think that has captivated people in a way that's slightly different from the way people who follow the news much more closely might understand that - the disconnect between sort of the administration, the story they told, versus what we actually saw on the ground and how we all know that the administration is lying.INSKEEP: Now, as we heard from Franco Ordoñez, the White House has changed course in the last day in certain ways. They stopped calling the victim a terrorist without actually admitting a mistake. They are making this personnel change in Minnesota. We don't know how long this will last. We know from past experience the president has a tendency after a day or two to revert to his original talking points, but they did make a change here. Is there a connection between that change and public opinion, do you think?LONGWELL: I do. I think that one of the reasons that Republicans often simply just back Trump is because they think that's what the public is demanding of them. In this case, it is loud and clear to people that the public is fed up with having these troops in the streets, with seeing Americans get shot. And the public opinion is very much turning against them on an issue that is supposed to be one of Trump's best issues, and I think that is causing Republicans to get spooked.INSKEEP: Oh. Let's talk about that aspect of this. When you say it's supposed to be one of Trump's best issues, it has been. It's one where he has majority support. Does he still have majority support, as far as you can tell?LONGWELL: He does not. And I will say there is a slight difference between the border - voters - they think, yes, we want the border secure. And so he still does all right when it comes to the actual securing of the border. Where he is underwater now is on ICE, is on Border Patrol, is on the actions of deportations. People - it - the polling on that has completely flipped. He is now well underwater on this issue. And now we are getting into the territory not just of the public doesn't approve, but there is an active backlash against your administration on this point.INSKEEP: Briefly, what are voters telling you about the economy, which Trump would rather be talking about, apparently?LONGWELL: Well, I don't know why he'd rather be talking about it because I don't think that there's anything that voters are more angry about than the state of the economy. If they - if Trump had one job for voters, it was to lower costs, and they do not feel like he's doing it.INSKEEP: Sarah Longwell is publisher of The Bulwark and a political consultant and pollster. Thanks for your insights. It's always really appreciated.LONGWELL: Thanks so much.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

You can't,\" Rutte told EU lawmakers in Brussels. Europe and the United States \"need each other,\" he said.   \n   Tensions are festering within NATO over U.S. President Donald Trump's renewed threats in recent weeks to annex Greenland, which is a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark.   Trump also said that he was slapping new tariffs on Greenland's European backers, but later dropped his threats after a \"framework\" for a deal over the mineral-rich island was reached, with Rutte's help. Few details of the agreement have emerged.   The 32-nation military organization is bound together by a mutual defense clause, Article 5 of NATO's founding Washington treaty, which commits every country to come to the defense of an ally whose territory is under threat.   At NATO's summit in The Hague in July, European allies — with the exception of Spain — plus Canada agreed to Trump's demand that they invest the same percentage of their economic output on defense as the United States within a decade.   \n   They pledged to spend 3.5% of gross domestic product on core defense, and a further 1.5% on security-related infrastructure – a total of 5% of GDP – by 2035.   \"If you really want to go it alone,\" Rutte said, \"forget that you can ever get there with 5%. It will be 10%. You have to build up your own nuclear capability. That costs billions and billions of euros.\"   France has led calls for Europe to build its \"strategic autonomy,\" and support for its stance has grown since the Trump administration warned last year that its security priorities lie elsewhere and that the Europeans would have to fend for themselves.   \n   Rutte told the lawmakers that without the United States, Europe \"would lose the ultimate guarantor of our freedom, which is the U.S. nuclear umbrella. So, hey, good luck!\"\n",

It comes as polls show that voters are unhappy with many elements of his messaging so far.   Tuesday's speech in Clive, Iowa, is expected to focus on energy and the economy — two areas where Trump's policy changes in the last year have negatively impacted the state.   Trump was last in Iowa on the eve of July 4, 2025, where he kicked off a yearlong celebration of America's 250th birthday and touted Congress' passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which enacted sweeping cuts to taxes and social safety net programs.   \n   As the tax season starts, voters will begin to see the impact of the law's signature policies, like no tax on tips and overtime and an expanded child tax credit. Later this week, the Treasury Department will hold a summit to release more details about the \"Trump Accounts\" created by the law, which will be seeded with a $1,000 government contribution for babies born between 2025 and 2028 and which will serve as investment accounts for newborns.   Much has changed in those six months, though, as polling data suggests the American public has soured on the Trump administration's overhaul of the country's foreign and domestic agenda. That includes an aggressive immigration enforcement crackdown in Minnesota where federal agents shot and killed two people in two different incidents this month.   Last week, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that his message for Iowa was \"straight to the farmers,\" touting the billions of dollars the administration made available as bridge payments to farmers negatively affected by the president's tariff policies.   \"You know, the farmers like Trump, and I like the farmers,\" Trump said. \"The farmers have been very special to me. Very successful.\"   The speech also comes as farming industry groups have expressed frustration that the Republican-led House failed to include a measure allowing higher-ethanol E15 fuel to be sold year-round in its spending plan that passed last week.   \n   Ahead of Friday's deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown, Senate Democrats say they will not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security without additional guardrails for immigration enforcement after the latest shooting of a U.S. citizen by federal immigration agents.   Trump's visit to Iowa also highlights the political gravity that Republicans must overcome in an environment where voters are already primed to express displeasure with the party in power. The president earned 55% of the vote statewide in 2024 and Democrats hold only one statewide office, but that Democrat, auditor Rob Sand, has drastically outraised his opponents in the race for governor.   Control of Congress could hinge on Iowa, too: Three of its four House districts could be competitive, and national Democrats see the retirement of Republican Sen. Joni Ernst as an opportunity as Trump's popularity continues to plummet.   Recent surveys of Trump's approval rating find the president struggling with key demographics that swung toward Republicans in 2024 and also losing support on issues like immigration and the economy. At the state level, Iowa often gives Trump a lower approval rating than any other Republican-led state.\n",

The arrival of the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and guided missile destroyers accompanying it provide the U.S. the ability to strike Iran, particularly as Gulf Arab states have signaled they want to stay out of any attack despite hosting American military personnel.   \n   Two Iranian-backed militias in the Mideast have signaled their willingness to launch new attacks, likely trying to back Iran after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened military action over the killing of peaceful protesters or Tehran launching mass executions in the wake of the demonstrations.   Iran has repeatedly threatened to drag the entire Mideast into a war, though its air defenses and military are still reeling after the June war launched by Israel against the country.   \n   Both the Houthis and Kataib Hezbollah sat out from Israel's 12-day war on Iran that saw the United States bomb Iranian nuclear sites. The hesitancy to get involved shows the disarray still affecting Iran's self-described \"Axis of Resistance\" after facing attacks from Israel during its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.   Activists offer new death toll   The new figures Tuesday came from the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which has been accurate in multiple rounds of unrest in Iran. The group verifies each death with a network of activists on the ground in Iran.   It identified the dead as including at least 5,777 protesters, 214 government-affiliated forces, 86 children and 49 civilians who weren't demonstrating. The crackdown has seen over 41,800 arrests, it added.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A Hezbollah supporter waves an Iranian flag during a rally to show their solidarity with the Iranian government, in the southern suburb of Beirut, Lebanon, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026.\n                \n                    Hussein Malla/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Hussein Malla/AP\n    \n\n   \n   The Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the death toll given authorities cutting off the internet and disrupting calls into the Islamic Republic.   \n   Iran's government has put the death toll at a far lower 3,117, saying 2,427 were civilians and security forces, and labeled the rest \"terrorists.\" In the past, Iran's theocracy has undercounted or not reported fatalities from unrest.   That death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest there in decades, and recalls the chaos surrounding Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.   The protests in Iran began on Dec. 28, sparked by the fall of the Iranian currency, the rial, and quickly spread across the country. They were met by a violent crackdown by Iran's theocracy, the scale of which is only starting to become clear as the country has faced more than two weeks of internet blackout — the most comprehensive in its history.   Iran's U.N. ambassador told a U.N. Security Council meeting late Monday that Trump's repeated threats to use military force against the country \"are neither ambiguous nor misinterpreted.\" Amir Saeid Iravani also repeated allegations that the U.S. leader incited violence by \"armed terrorist groups\" supported by the United States and Israel, but gave no evidence to support his claims.   Iranian state media has tried to accuse forces abroad for the protests as the theocracy remains broadly unable to address the country's ailing economy, which is still squeezed by international sanctions, particularly over its nuclear program.   Some Iranian-backed militias suggest willingness to fight   Iran projected its power across the Mideast through the \"Axis of Resistance,\" a network of proxy militant groups in Gaza, Lebanon, Yemen, Syria and Iraq, and other places. It was also seen as a defensive buffer, intended to keep conflict away from Iranian borders. But it has collapsed after Israel targeted Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon and others during the Gaza war. Meanwhile, rebels in 2024 overthrew Syria's Bashar Assad after a yearslong, bloody war in which Iran backed his rule.   \n   Yemen's Houthi rebels, backed by Iran, have repeatedly warned they could resume fire if needed on shipping in the Red Sea, releasing old footage of a previous attack Monday. Ahmad \"Abu Hussein\" al-Hamidawi, the leader of Iraq's Kataib Hezbollah militia, warned \"the enemies that the war on the (Islamic) Republic will not be a picnic; rather, you will taste the bitterest forms of death, and nothing will remain of you in our region.\"   The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, one of Iran's staunchest allies, refused to say how it planned to react in the case of a possible attack.   \"During the past two months, several parties have asked me a clear and frank question: If Israel and America go to war against Iran, will Hezbollah intervene or not?\" Hezbollah leader Sheikh Naim Kassem said in a video address.   He said the group is preparing for \"possible aggression and is determined to defend\" against it. But as to how it would act, he said, \"these details will be determined by the battle and we will determine them according to the interests that are present.\"\n",

More Republicans are calling for an investigation after a second U.S. citizen was shot by a federal agent in Minneapolis.   The president is expected to tour a local business and give a speech on energy and the economy.   His chief of staff, Susie Wiles, says the trip is the beginning of what will eventually be weekly travel across the U.S. in support of Republican candidates ahead of the midterm elections. But Trump is unlikely to escape the controversy surrounding his administration's immigration tactics in Minneapolis.   \n   \"The primary news story at the moment isn't just the ICE-related shooting. It's the response to the ICE-related shooting,\" said Ryan Williams, a veteran Republican strategist who helped lead Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. \"That's what's going to be the focus. And the president can attempt to focus on the economy, on what he views are successes of his administration on the economic front. But he's going to be stuck talking about this issue for a significant period of time.\"   \n   The Republican Party has struggled with how to respond to Saturday's fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse at a VA hospital.   The shooting happened just weeks after another Minneapolis protester, Renee Macklin Good, was killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.   A number of Republican lawmakers are pushing for more details about the second shooting, including Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas and Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.   This weekend, Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma questioned Trump's broader goals.   \"Americans are asking themselves, 'What is the endgame? What is the solution?'\" said Stitt. \"And we believe in federalism and state rights. And nobody likes feds coming into their state. And so what's the goal right now? Is it to deport every single non-U.S. citizen? I don't think that's what Americans want. We have to stop politicizing this.\"   \n   After his top officials rushed to declare the U.S. citizen killed by federal agents a \"domestic terrorist,\" Trump is now trying to strike a softer tone   Trump spoke with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Monday. Trump said in a social media post that Walz requested that they \"work together.\"   \"It was a very good call, and we, actually, seemed to be on a similar wavelength,\" Trump wrote.   But soon after the call, Trump's team was attacking Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey again.   Press secretary Karoline Leavitt blamed the local Democratic leaders for the tragedies, saying it was a result of their \"deliberate and hostile resistance.\"   She called on the city and state leaders to turn over \"criminal illegal aliens currently incarcerated in their prisons and jails and assist federal law enforcement in apprehending illegal immigrants wanted for crimes.   \"In Minnesota, ICE and local law enforcement can peacefully work together as they are effectively doing in so many other states and jurisdictions,\" she said.\n",

Initial moves involving such mainstay shows as 60 Minutes and the CBS Evening news have sparked dissent inside the newsroom and drawn criticism from journalists outside it.\n                \n                    Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   CBS News Editor-in-Chief Bari Weiss said she will make the news division \"fit for purpose in the 21st Century\" at an all-staff meeting Tuesday,  in which she outlined her strategy.   Weiss announced the hiring of 18 paid commentators — on subjects ranging from national security to health and wellness — as part of an effort to \"widen the aperture of the stories we tell and the voices we listen to.\" They include HR McMaster, who served as national security advisor during the first Trump administration; Reihan Salam, the president of the conservative Manhattan Institute; and the historian Niall Ferguson.    \n   She also cited several new hires who are going to produce original reports from Kyiv, London and New York City with a social media-first approach. And she said she only wants top-flight performers committed to her approach to stick around.    Weiss is expected to make significant cuts to the newsroom, though she did not address them in her remarks.   Weiss has expressed exuberance about the task she confronts at CBS, ranked third behind NBC and ABC, and an eagerness to learn about broadcast news. She has said she wants to appeal to independently minded Americans. And she says the news division has not — until now —addressed the fundamental reasons that she believes it is losing audience: a sharp drop in public trust in the mainstream media and a huge spike in competition for viewers' attention.   \"We all must focus first on what we're building, not what we're maintaining. On how we are going to reach an audience exponentially bigger than the one we have now,\" Weiss said, according to prepared remarks shared by the network with NPR and other outlets. She said that she would do that by \"marrying the journalistic principles that will never change — seeking the truth, serving the public, and ferociously guarding our independence — with the tools that constantly are.\" (The network said Weiss hewed closely to her prepared text.)   \n   \"We can still do what the Wild West of social media cannot,\" she said.    First months marked by controversy   In her brief tenure, Weiss has alienated much of the staff of 60 Minutes, the crown jewel of the news division; sought to reinvent the CBS Evening News; and questioned whether CBS journalists have been fair or worthy of Americans' trust in the past.   This story also draws on interviews with eight current and former CBS News journalists. All of those still at the network spoke on condition they not be named, citing professional repercussions. Several noted that Weiss has told staffers she welcomes internal debate but cannot abide public dissent.   While Weiss has been welcomed by some CBS journalists, including Chief Legal Correspondent Jan Crawford, others have taken issue with her style of leadership and the editorial choices that have followed her arrival.   In addition, liberal critics outside the network have blasted her, alleging that she is doing the handiwork of the networks' owners, who are allies of President Trump and are seeking his blessing in their bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. Weiss has rejected that assertion, though she declined to comment for this story through a spokesperson.   Weiss brought in to reshape CBS News   A former conservative opinion writer and editor for the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, Weiss was hired last fall by Paramount's new controlling owner, David Ellison, to shake up CBS's news division as it came under renewed attack from the Trump administration.   The previous owners of Paramount had paid $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump as a private individual over the editing of a fall 2024 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris. That helped clear the way for approval from Trump's chief broadcast regulator, who additionally secured promises from Ellison of an ombudsman to field complaints of ideological bias.   \n   Paramount also acquired Weiss's center-right digital startup, The Free Press, for $150 million. The Substack views-and-news site has approximately 170,000 paying subscribers and is built on the proposition that most of the mainstream media is reflexively liberal, though it does sometimes offer coverage that is critical of Trump.   She has been personally involved in remapping the CBS Evening News.   Ahead of his debut as the new anchor of the Evening News, CBS's Tony Dokoupil said the press has too often missed the story.   \"Because we've taken into account the perspective of advocates and not the average American. Or we put too much weight in the analysis of academics or elites and not enough on you,\" he wrote in an online post on Jan. 1. \"At certain points, I have been you. I have felt this way too. I have felt like what I was seeing and hearing on the news didn't reflect what I was seeing and hearing in my own life.\"   On Instagram, Dokoupil wrote in response to a critic: \"I can promise you we'll be more accountable and more transparent than Cronkite or any one else of his era.\"   His comment was taken as an affront by some of his colleagues, according to four people at the network's news division. Walter Cronkite, the iconic CBS anchor who narrated the death of President John F. Kennedy, humanity's ascent to the Moon, and the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon for tens of millions of Americans, embodied the definition of the TV news anchor for the modern era.   The internal tensions erupted into public view in December. Less than two days before broadcast, Weiss decided to hold a 60 Minutes story on the alleged abuse of immigrants sent to an El Salvador detention center where the Trump administration sent hundreds of Venezuelan migrants last March.   \n   She said the segment wasn't ready, though it had been reviewed and approved by CBS News lawyers and video excerpts had been released publicly to promote the segment. Weiss later said she would not be rushed into approving it for air.   The incident became public and sparked an enormous outcry. Yet, when the story aired this month, it had not changed appreciably. (The initial version was available from a Canadian distributor that had mistakenly already loaded it for streaming subscribers.)   The story ended up running almost exactly as it had been prepared, with an extra element documenting the written comments of Trump administration officials and CBS's efforts to get them to come on camera for an interview.   According to someone who attended Tuesday's meeting, Weiss conceded making a mistake on the 60 Minutes story, saying she had not understood how the timing of her decision would throw the show into disarray. Yet she did not back down from the merits of her decision, which she grounded in the desire to get a Trump administration official to speak about the matter on camera.   Initial CBS Evening News coverage choices prove divisive    Less well known are some of the incidents involving the Evening News that inspired internal discomfort.   Weiss and top producers had drawn up plan to fly Dokoupil around the country to underscore his desire to talk to Americans outside elite circles in New York, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles.   Yet since Dokoupil's debut in early January, CBS has taken an Evening News segment off the air called \"Eye On America,\" on since 2024, that had been doing just that.   On the first night, executives pulled Dokoupil back to New York City to cover the U.S. seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The second night was Jan. 6 and Dokoupil was in Miami. Major news organizations, including NPR and the New York Times, offered new projects about what had been learned in the five years since the siege of the U.S. Capitol.   \n   Dokoupil offered this scant reference: \"President Trump today accused Democrats of failing to prevent the attack on the Capitol, while House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused the president of 'whitewashing' it.\" The he-said, he-said formulation lasted about 15 seconds.   That prompted denunciations from outside critics. Sarah Longwell, the founder and publisher of the center-right, anti-Trump publication The Bulwark, wrote on X: \"Trump is getting exactly what his rich buddy paid for.\"   Ellison's takeover of Paramount was financed by his father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. The elder Ellison is a Trump adviser who encouraged his efforts to contest the 2020 race.   CBS Justice Correspondent Scott MacFarlane took great exception to Dokoupil's Jan. 6 broadcast, according to two people inside the network who spoke on condition they not be named.   MacFarlane has spent the past five years covering the attack on the U.S. Congress, drawing upon evidence presented in court to document the effort to deny the formal certification of President Joe Biden's win in the 2020 race.   He did not appear on the air on CBS News this Jan. 6. Instead, as he posted on the social media platform X, MacFarlane appeared on the BBC. It lasted nearly four-and-a-half-minutes.   \"Here's my deep dive on the 5-year mark of Jan 6,\" MacFarlane wrote. \"The ongoing impact on victims, the lies... and the continued malignant corrosion of democracy[.] As aired on.... The BBC.\"   At the tail of that night's broadcast from Miami, Dokoupil hailed Secretary of State Marco Rubio as a prominent Floridian in a flippant segment at the end. The anchor noted his key role in the administration — including on Venezuela — and shared AI-generated social media memes envisioning Rubio in a variety of roles, including as a hunter, the Michelin Man, and the leader of Greenland.   \"Marco Rubio, we salute you,\" Dokoupil deadpanned. The light-hearted approach to the minute-long segment so close to the Venezuelan military action delighted the Trump White House and stirred backlash from journalists.   \n   A White House threat over Trump interview   Weiss has personally gotten involved to secure major interviews in her drive for the network to make and break news.   Dokoupil landed several big-name interviews including with Trump and Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth. The Independent reported Hegseth said he only did the interview because Weiss asked. The New York Times posted audio showing that White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt threatened to sue CBS at the end of the interview with Trump if it was not run in full, unedited. Dokoupil said it would.   In a statement, CBS News said the network had already made \"the independent decision to air it unedited and in its entirety.\"   Several current and former CBS journalists pointed to another instance that appeared to pull a punch that could land hard on the Trump administration. Correspondent Nicole Sganga broke down video footage of the deadly shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer. A retired ICE agent who watched the footage frame by frame with CBS said the officer appeared to act improperly.   The segment streamed on the YouTube page of CBS Evening News. But it did not air on the flagship news program.   \"There are always growing pains when you start something new,\" says former CBS News President Andrew Heyward, citing the reinvention of CBS Evening News with Dokoupil as anchor. \"Those growing pains have been exacerbated by today's polarized political atmosphere and execution errors.\"   \"Now comes the hard slog of, day after day, drawing on CBS News's journalistic capacities to do original reporting that delivers real value to the existing audience and attracts new people without chasing away the people who like what they see,\" Heyward says.   Weiss told staffers Tuesday that she's thinking of CBS News as a start-up.   \"If we all do our jobs right, in a year's time CBS News will look very different,\" Weiss said in her prepared remarks. \"But start-ups aren't for everyone. They're places that move at rapid speed. They experiment. They try new things. They sometimes create noise and, yes, bad press!\"   \n   \"If that's not your bag... that's okay,\" Weiss added. \"But if what I'm describing sounds exciting and exhilarating to you... I am here to work very hard alongside you. What I can promise you in return is a common, shared purpose, the freedom to do great work and to see it aggressively promoted, and the stability and support you deserve.\"  \n",

The case, filed in Massachusetts, is the first lawsuit over the strikes to land in a U.S. federal court since the Trump administration launched a campaign to target vessels off the coast of Venezuela. The American government has carried out three dozen such strikes since September, killing more than 100 people.   \n   Among them are Chad Joseph, 26, and Rishi Samaroo, 41, who relatives say died in what President Trump described as \"a lethal kinetic strike\" on Oct. 14, 2025. The president posted a short video that day on social media that shows a missile targeting a ship, which erupts in flame.   \"This is killing for sport, it's killing for theater and it's utterly lawless,\" said Baher Azmy, legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights. \"We need a court of law to rein in this administration and provide some accountability to the families.\"   The White House and Pentagon justify the strikes as part of a broader push to stop the flow of illegal drugs into the U.S.   \"The October 14th strike was conducted against designated narcoterrorists bringing deadly poison to our shores,\" Anna Kelly, the White House deputy press secretary, said in an emailed statement. \"President Trump used his lawful authority to take decisive action against the scourge of illicit narcotics that has resulted in the needless deaths of innocent Americans.\"   The Pentagon declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying it doesn't comment on ongoing litigation.   \n   Victims' families deny thy presented imminent threat   The new lawsuit described Joseph and Samaroo as fishermen doing farm work in Venezuela, with no ties to the drug trade. Court papers said they were headed home to family members when the strike occurred and now are presumed dead.   \n   Neither man \"presented a concrete, specific, and imminent threat of death or serious physical injury to the United States or anyone at all, and means other than lethal force could have reasonably been employed to neutralize any lesser threat,\" according to the lawsuit.   Lenore Burnley, the mother of Chad Joseph, and Sallycar Korasingh, the sister of Rishi Samaroo, are the plaintiffs in the case.   Their court papers allege violations of the Death on the High Seas Act, a 1920 law that makes the U.S. government liable if its agents engage in negligence that results in wrongful death more than 3 miles off American shores. A second claim alleges violations of the Alien Tort Statute, which allows foreign citizens to sue over human rights violations such as deaths that occurred outside an armed conflict, with no judicial process.   \n   The American Civil Liberties Union, the Center for Constitutional Rights, and Jonathan Hafetz at Seton Hall University School of Law are representing the plaintiffs.   \"In seeking justice for the senseless killing of their loved ones, our clients are bravely demanding accountability for their devastating losses and standing up against the administration's assault on the rule of law,\" said Brett Max Kaufman, senior counsel at the ACLU.   U.S. lawmakers have raised questions about the legal basis for the strikes for months but the administration has persisted.   —NPR's Quil Lawrence contributed to this report.\n",

And Carlson is more than happy to provide his thoughts and his advice,\" Zengerle says. \"That doesn't mean that Trump always takes that advice, and there have certainly been instances where Carlson's been disappointed by some of Trump's decisions, but he seems to have a seat at the table.\"   \n   Carlson got his start in conservative print media and transitioned to TV in the early days of cable news. After he was let go from CNN and MSNBC (now MS NOW), he was hired by Fox, then abruptly fired in 2023. He has since launched a new streaming show on the social media platform X, where he's espoused far-right fringe positions, such the \"great replacement\" conspiracy theory.   \"Since leaving Fox, he doesn't have a built-in audience anymore and he has to navigate the attention economy. And in order to get people to listen to his podcast, I think he has kind of embraced more outrageous views,\" Zengerle says. \"He's saying things before in a more explicit fashion, whereas in the past he tried to modulate his rhetoric a little bit.\"   \n   Zengerle sees the throughline of Carlson's career as a desire for \"fame, fortune and power.\" To that end, he would not be surprised if Carlson ran for office himself.    \"It's a mistake to think of him as just a media figure because I think his ambitions are bigger than that,\" Zengerle says. \"He operates as a political actor, maybe even more than a media actor at this point.\"      Interview highlights    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Hated By All The Right People: Tucker Carlson and the Unraveling of the Conservative Mind, by Jason Zengerle\n                \n                    Penguin Random House\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Penguin Random House\n    \n\n   \n   On Carlson's shift from print journalism to TV in the '90s   The things that he was good at, in terms of being glib and having an opinion on everything and just being able to appear reasonably intelligent on camera, that was the start of his career. … He would spend all this time and energy crafting these [print] stories, and it might get a little bit of a response. And then he would go on some TV show and make some off-handed remark, and a cabinet member would call him to talk about it. And I think that it was that sort of recognition that made him think that TV was the way to go.   \n   On Jon Stewart's 2004 appearance on CNN's Crossfire, which led to the show's cancellation    I think [it] was a really important moment in Tucker's career and life, because it was a humiliation. He was sort of friendly with Stewart. … He knew, obviously, that Stewart had kind of a dim view of Crossfire and a dim view of cable news. But they all thought they were kind of … play acting the way Crossfire was, you know? You would argue with this person for 30 minutes and then afterwards you'd go out and have a steak and a drink and everybody was sort of doing the same thing, and it was like professional wrestling in some ways. When Stewart came on there and wasn't part of that game, I think Tucker was really surprised and he tried to debate Stewart and Stewart just destroyed him, and destroyed him in front of a studio audience. … It led to the cancellation of the show. It led to Tucker leaving CNN.   \n   I think it was a really important moment in his life and his career because he was a member in good standing of the Washington political and media elite, and I think he felt that his friends in that world did not come to his aid and did not support him the way he would have wanted them to. And so years later, when he developed this populist streak and really turned against people in Washington and legacy media and the things like that, I think he remembered that moment and some of his bitterness towards those people really came out at that point.   On Carlson co-founding the conservative website The Daily Caller in 2010 and pivoting from reporting to tabloidy content    When he launched The Daily Caller, his idea for it was it was going to be a right-wing version of sort of a combination [of] Huffington Post and New York Times. He wanted it to be a very fact-based, heavily reported website. He had a critique of conservative media that conservatives didn't report, they just opined and, \"We need to get back to reporting. We need to get back to presenting facts, and we need to be serious about the news.\" And that was his vision for The Caller. I think within a couple months, looking at the website's traffic, he realized that there was not an audience for that kind of conservative publication — and he pivoted, and he kind of went more in the direction of tabloidy, kind of outrageous stuff.    \n   Increasingly, I think he saw that the types of stories that were getting attention, that were [getting] a lot of traffic, getting clicks, had to do with race, had to do with immigration, and had to do with gender, and he just leaned into that. Eventually he kind of found himself in this competition with Breitbart that Steve Bannon was running at the time. And it was just kind of this race to the bottom in terms of who could write more kind of inflammatory and incendiary stories about Black-on-white crime or about immigrant crime and things like that. And he saw that there was an audience there for that.   On Carlson climbing the ranks at Fox   He really was kind of an afterthought at Fox. You had the stars, you had the Bill O'Reillys, you had the Sean Hannitys. Tucker was just this guy who they could put on the weekend Fox & Friends show and he had some television experience. He was conservative, so he wasn't going to say anything that veered from the party line. He was just kind of a bit player. ...   \n   Then he got his own show, and he got his own show because he was able to use Trump's presidential candidacy to revive his career. ... When Trump came along, those more prestigious Fox shows, they had a basic television problem. They could not find camera-ready, intelligent human beings to go on their programs and make a sensible case for Donald Trump. And Tucker was someone who could, so ... he started getting more airtime that way. And then as Trump's candidacy took off and it became clear that Trump was going to be the Republican nominee. … By the end of the campaign, [Fox News CEO] Roger Ailes had been fired because of the sexual harassment scandal. [News Corps CEO] Rupert Murdoch was now running the network. And the first big move Murdoch made was taking Tucker and giving him his own show at 7 p.m.   \n   Thea Chaloner and Susan Nyakundi produced and edited this interview for broadcast. Bridget Bentz, Molly Seavy-Nesper and Brett Neely adapted it for the web.\n",

    "body": "\n      President Trump's State of the Union speech was a mix of the president touting his first-year record, slamming Democrats and creating made-for-TV moments.   \n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  President Trump addressed the nation last night at a critical moment in his presidency.LEILA FADEL, HOST:  During an almost two-hour State of the Union address, Trump was using a fair bit of exaggeration. He painted a nation that's in the early stages of a historic economic boom, though polls show most Americans disagree.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our nation is back, bigger, better, richer and stronger than ever before.FADEL: Like Republicans wanted, Trump focused much of his speech on the economy and affordability. He couldn't resist attacking political foes, though, calling Democrats crazy and blaming them for everything from rising health care costs to corruption without evidence. In a few moments, we'll ask a political consultant how Trump's message landed with independent voters. First, let's get more on the speech.MARTÍNEZ: NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez was up late watching the longest address ever to Congress. Franco, what stuck out to you?FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: Yeah, A. You know, I was struck by how much he stuck to the script, at least in the first hour of the address, which is really important because it's when the speech has its most viewers. Trump, as you noted, hit at all the notes the Republicans wanted him to hit on - the economy, housing costs, energy costs, drug prices. And, of course, ever the showman, Trump staged some key moments, you know, presenting the Medal of Honor to a 100-year-old veteran and trotting out the U.S. men's Olympic hockey team.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Here with us tonight is a group of winners who just made the entire nation proud, the men's gold-medal Olympic hockey team. Come on in.ORDOÑEZ: It was really a rare bipartisan moment of applause, even a standing ovation during, the speech.MARTÍNEZ: Now, the Supreme Court justices were sitting in front of him. Last week, they slapped down his tariff agenda. So I was wondering, Franco, what, if anything, he was going to say about them?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. Trump called the Supreme Court's ruling unfortunate and totally wrong, but he didn't actually get personal with the justices as he did last week. He actually even stopped to shake each of their hands as he walked in the room, which is, you know, quite the deliberate choice.MARTÍNEZ: Now, last year, during his congressional address, Democrats were criticized for holding up paddles with protest messages on them. So what kind of a pushback did he get this year?ORDOÑEZ: Well, at the very beginning, Congressman Al Green was escorted from the chamber for displaying a sign that read, Black people aren't apes, which, of course, is a clear reference to the racist video that Trump posted about the Obamas. But there were no paddles. Some Democrats chose to boycott, and you could see the empty seats. And there was some vitriol thrown back and forth when Trump spoke of immigration and accusations of fraud.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: But when it comes to the corruption that is plundering - it really - it's plundering America - there's been no more stunning example than Minnesota where members of the Somali community have pillaged an estimated $19 billion from the American taxpayer. Oh, we have all the information.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: You're lying.ORDOÑEZ: And you can't really hear it so well on that tape, but Democrats started to yell out and call Trump a liar there.MARTÍNEZ: No, no, no. I was - I heard that, for sure, at the end there. Now, Franco, the U.S. might be on the verge of taking military action against Iran. Did he make a case to the American people for why this might be necessary?ORDOÑEZ: Well, he spent more time on hockey and the other staged moments, but near the end, he did speak of the Iranian regime killing thousands of protesters, you know, their nuclear ambitions and the threat that they may present building missiles - that he said, at least - will be soon able to reach the United States. But it wasn't really any new rationale for the strikes, which is concerning to a lot of Americans, including Republicans who were worried about the U.S. being drawn into a long and complicated conflict.MARTÍNEZ: That's NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez. Thanks a lot.ORDOÑEZ: Thanks, A.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

He also did not vote for Trump in 2024.GREG HARDY: The thing that stuck out most to me was just his complete refusal to kind of address the affordability crisis, that on top of, you know, his attack on our immigrant population, the teetering towards war it seems that we're doing with Iran, talking around that. Yeah, definitely doesn't inspire hope in the way the country's going, currently.FADEL: John Edwards (ph), a Republican in Maryland, did vote for Trump.JOHN EDWARDS: He addressed many concerns that Americans have about the economy and, you know, cutting taxes for Americans and bringing us together and stopping wars, which is an amazing thing for any president to do.FADEL: He said the president's State of the Union was upbeat.EDWARDS: He's done a remarkable job in his position so far in his second term. And I think there's three more years of fantastic things that will come of his presidency. And I really pray that we all can get behind him. He's a great man.MARTÍNEZ: We heard from Rena Schulte (ph) on this program yesterday. She's a Democrat in Iowa who voted for Kamala Harris in 2024 who also worked with law enforcement for more than 17 years as an attorney. After the speech, she called in to say that the rosy image Trump painted, in her view, is not real.RENA SCHULTE: These are the darkest times I have witnessed in my lifetime. There's a lack of basic due process that never in my lifetime I thought I would ever witness, regardless of political affiliation.MARTÍNEZ: She says she's horrified by images of ICE agents taking people off the streets.SCHULTE: The address was like a bizarre pep rally rather than a serious reflection on the state of our nation. Instead of acknowledging the real pain division and fear that many families are experiencing, Donald Trump's speech focused on exaggerating and distorting visions of our country's past that don't really match the reality or the truth of what has happened or what is currently happening.FADEL: That was Rena Schulte in Iowa, John Edwards in Maryland and Greg Hardy in Florida.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Leila Fadel asks political consultant Frank Luntz whether President Trump positioned his administration and Republicans to reach Independent voters in his State of the Union address.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Veteran pollster and political consultant Frank Luntz. He joins me now to take a closer look at how last night's address might have played with undecided or independent voters. Frank, thank you for joining us. Sorry about that.FRANK LUNTZ: Well, it's an honor. Thank you.FADEL: So going into this address, an NPR/PBS News/Marist poll found that two-thirds of independents say the State of the Union is not strong. Did the president's address hit a reset with independent voters who may have chose him in 2024 and no longer approve?LUNTZ: It was a speech to the Trump faithful from beginning to end. And, in fact, I tweeted out in the first two minutes just how unifying he was when the speech opened up. But that is not how the speech continued or ended. In the end, it was the most confrontational State of the Union that I've ever seen. And I think that's the challenge because independents have soured on politics, they've soured on the economy and, frankly, they've soured on the country.FADEL: You said it started out unifying and turned into what you saw as one of the most confrontational, or if - the most confrontational State of the Union address. What made it that way? And does the president not think he has to appeal to a larger part of America than just his core base?LUNTZ: I think he sees his core base as his electorate and that it is his responsibility to keep his promises to them, to address them, to let them know that they matter. And that's why they've stayed with him. But when you focus on independents, on people in the center, they're looking at affordability, and they believe it. They believe that prices have gone up for housing and health care. And the president spend a lot of time focusing on where prices have come down. But in the end, as one of those voters noted, perception is reality, and if you think prices are higher, you're going to punish the administration and the party in power.FADEL: So the midterms are coming up in eight months. Given the tone of the State of the Union address, do you think that he was able to appeal to a wider group of Americans at all, and will that hurt - the fact that you don't see it that way, will that hurt him and his party in the midterms?LUNTZ: In the end, the midterms have a lower turnout, and so you have to get your voters to the polls. And I do believe that the way the president agitated and the way that he framed his stuff - for example, when he asked people - asked members of Congress to stand up if you believe the American government is - primarily (ph) responsibility is to protect American citizens not illegal aliens, probably 80% of Americans would agree with that. So that was a very positive tone in turning out his voters.But people in the center are not looking for performance, they're looking for reality. And what they're asking of the president is to focus on these challenges and make things start to happen. I'm frightened for the democracy. To be really candid with you, this division is getting to the point where it's going to start to affect our day-to-day lives.FADEL: Say more about that - the tone of the speech. How do you see that translating into the day-to-day lives of Americans?LUNTZ: Well, I used to be a political consultant, and so I recognize the tactics that he used. And it was tactics that 20, 25 years ago I was recommending. But at a certain point, when I start to see people unable to talk to each other, unable to listen, the fact that 40% of Americans have actually lost friends and lost compatriots because things are so divisive, and half of Americans will no longer raise issues that they're concerned about because they're afraid of being canceled. When I see results like that, I get concerned. And this and the yelling on - from the representatives and the language that the president used, both of them were problematic. And I think problem is...FADEL: And you're referring to the Democrats yelling at the president during the speech?LUNTZ: That's correct. And I think at some point, we have to say, enough, with an exclamation point.FADEL: Beyond the divisions in this country, which are scary, when you think just strategically, does the president not think he needs Americans beyond his core base to win not just the midterms, but the next presidential election?LUNTZ: He should, and they all should. But I do want to emphasize for the people who listen to this show - because you have an incredible listening base - that they're not looking for the next election, that they're looking for the next generation, and they simply want these people to tone it down and get it done.FADEL: Pollster and political consultant Frank Luntz. Thank you, as always, for your time.LUNTZ: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Leila Fadel asks Emma Ashford, a senior fellow with the Stimson Center, about the lean foreign policy content in President Trump's State of the Union address.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  President Trump's longer-than-ever State of the Union focused mostly on domestic issues and spent relatively little time on how he has been dealing with the rest of the world.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: As president, I will make peace wherever I can, but I will never hesitate to confront threats to America wherever we must.FADEL: To discuss what we learned and what we didn't about Trump's foreign policy, we're joined by Emma Ashford. She is a senior fellow with the Reimagining U.S. Grand Strategy program at the Stimson Center, which is a nonpartisan, nonprofit think tank dedicated to promoting international security and justice. Good morning, Emma.EMMA ASHFORD: Good morning.FADEL: So, Emma, this speech, as I mentioned, was quite light on Trump's approach to the world. Did you come away knowing or learning anything new about the president's foreign policy here?ASHFORD: No. I think, like many people, I was watching very closely for the foreign policy section, particularly when it comes to Iran and the president's Middle East policy. And instead of sort of any announcement of, you know, a policy going forward with Iran, he simply repeated the existing approach, which is build up a force in the region, wanting to get to some sort of nuclear agreement with the Iranians.So he is in very many ways, treading water on the question of Iran, talks about how they are, you know, doing bad things, but not saying where we're going next. And so I was actually quite surprised at how little substance there really was in the speech.FADEL: Why do you think he sort of avoided - there was this expectation that he might make a big announcement on Iran. Why do you think foreign policy was such a small part of his speech?ASHFORD: The administration has actually emphasized foreign policy over the last year. It's been a top priority. But I think here, they were very much trying to play to voters' domestic concerns, and that may well be another reason why we're seeing them being so cautious on Iran. The president seems to have backed himself very much into a corner. But the idea of strikes on Iran is actually wildly unpopular among the American public. Even in Congress there are questions, and there's not been really any explanation of what this is intended to achieve.FADEL: And negotiations with Iran are ongoing - will go on tomorrow. Trump listed a series of wars that he says he ended in his prepared remarks - the war in Gaza one of them. Here's what he said about that.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: And, of course, the war in Gaza, which proceeds at a very low level. It's just about there.FADEL: So that was a little bit of an admission from the president, right? I mean, he negotiated this ceasefire but then acknowledges that there has been violence. I mean, hundreds of Palestinians have been killed since that ceasefire.ASHFORD: That seems to have been a little bit of an ad lib, but he isn't clearly admitting the truth, which is that this is a ceasefire that is mostly holding but not all the way. In general, I think it was very notable that he called out not just these peace deals he's apparently negotiated - although not all of them are real - but he also took the time to acknowledge Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, who he has empowered to go out and try and make these peace deals everywhere, from Gaza to Ukraine. So peacemaking still does seem to be a priority for the administration.FADEL: Well, let me ask you about that because his address came on the four-year mark of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He mentioned the war, saying only that it never would have started if he'd been in the White House, but not much else. Was that an opportunity missed?ASHFORD: I think he also took the opportunity to point out that European states are now paying for most of the cost of the war in Ukraine, which I think is a relatively popular talking point of his. But there is no real progress to be reported on Ukraine peace talks right now. So I think sort of not mentioning it was probably the better part of valor here.FADEL: Emma Ashford is a senior fellow with the Reimagining U.S. Grand Strategy program at the Stimson Center. Thank you for your time and your insights.ASHFORD: Thanks so much.(SOUNDBITE OF DO MAKE SAY THINK'S \"THE LANDLORD IS DEAD\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      President Trump spent a substantial portion of his State of the Union speech talking about the economy, including a vow to replace the tariffs the Supreme Court recently struck down.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  President Trump opened his State of the Union address by declaring a golden age of America.(SOUNDBITE OF STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It is indeed a turnaround for the ages.A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  That is not how many voters see things. Trump used the opportunity to defend his tariff policy, recently struck down by the Supreme Court, and celebrate last year's Republican tax cuts.FADEL: He also made familiar attacks on immigrants, and later, Democrats.(SOUNDBITE OF STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS)TRUMP: These people are crazy, I'm telling you.UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Vocalizing).TRUMP: They're crazy.MARTÍNEZ: In a few minutes, we'll hear about what might be next for the administration's immigration enforcement policies and the use of the military abroad. We start, though, with NPR's Scott Horsley, who was focusing on Trump's message about the economy.SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The president talked as if he had inherited a stagnant economy with record high inflation from the Democrats.(SOUNDBITE OF STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS)TRUMP: Their policies created the high prices. Our policies are rapidly ending them. We are doing really well. Those prices are plummeting downward.HORSLEY: Trump is trying to paint himself as some sort of turnaround artist here, but this just does not comport with the facts. Inflation has mostly moved sideways under President Trump, and in fact, his tariff policies pushed prices higher in some cases. GDP growth has actually slowed a little bit from the last year of the Biden administration, although it was pretty respectable at 2.2% last year. And then, of course, job growth has been much slower under this president than it was under his predecessor.MARTÍNEZ: Did he present any new economic policies?HORSLEY: He did. He talked about how half of all working Americans don't have a retirement plan right now where their bosses can contribute to match what they put in. So he says he wants to come up with a new type of plan.(SOUNDBITE OF STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS)TRUMP: To remedy this gross disparity, I'm announcing that next year, my administration will give these often forgotten American workers - great people. The people that built our country - access to the same type of retirement plan offered to every federal worker. We will match your contribution with up to $1,000 each year.HORSLEY: Now, of course, that would take help from Congress, and he didn't talk about where the money would come from. Trump also doubled down on his tariff policies just days after the Supreme Court had struck down about half of his import levies. Of course, he did so with some of the justices who ruled against him in that case sitting right in front of him.He also said that even with some of those tariffs now outlawed, the trade deals with other countries that he managed to negotiate using those tariffs aren't going anywhere because, he says, those countries are afraid of getting an even worse deal later.(SOUNDBITE OF STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS)TRUMP: But the good news is that almost all countries and corporations want to keep the deal that they already made - right, Scott? - knowing that the legal power that I, as president, have to make a new deal could be far worse for them.HORSLEY: The Scott the president's talking to there is Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. We have actually yet to see a lot of dividends from those trade deals. U.S. exports were up only marginally last year. Farm exports were down, and the overall trade deficit barely budged from 2024.MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. And, Scott, I know that he is not a big fan of the word affordability. Did he say anything about affordability in the State of the Union?HORSLEY: He did. He listed a few items where prices have come down - notably eggs and gasoline. He didn't dwell on things that have gotten more expensive, like natural gas and electricity. One of the things that's driving high electricity prices these days is increased demand from data centers. And Trump did say he has a plan to make tech companies building all those data centers cover the cost of that power so it's not borne by local ratepayers. He called that the ratepayer protection pledge.(SOUNDBITE OF STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS)TRUMP: We're telling the major tech companies that they have the obligation to provide for their own power needs. They can build their own power plants as part of their factory, so that no one's prices will go up, and in many cases, prices of electricity will go down for the community, and very substantially downHORSLEY: Now, he was short on specifics, but this does address a real political liability. Electricity prices were up more than 6% in the last year - more than double the overall rate of inflation.MARTÍNEZ: That's NPR's Scott Horsley. Scott, thanks a lot.HORSLEY: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Here's NPR's Barbara Sprunt.BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Just five weeks ago, Abigail Spanberger became the first woman to be sworn in as governor of Virginia, flipping control of the office from Republican to Democrat. And last night, she addressed the nation, pushing back on President Trump's assertion that the U.S. is in a golden age.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: The president did what he always does - he lied, he scapegoated and he distracted. And he offered no real solutions to our nation's pressing challenges, so many of which he is actively making worse.SPRUNT: Spanberger structured her speech around three questions.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SPANBERGER: Is the president working to make life more affordable for you and your family? Is the president working to keep Americans safe both at home and abroad? Is the president working for you?SPRUNT: She said the answer to all three - no. Affordability, one of the key pillars of her speech, is something Democrats see as a winning message as they look ahead to the midterm elections.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SPANBERGER: Costs are too high in housing, health care, energy and child care.SPRUNT: She slammed what she called Trump's reckless trade policies and spoke about the violence from federal immigration enforcement officers on American streets.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SPANBERGER: Our president told us tonight that we are safer because these agents arrest mothers and detain children. Think about that. Our broken immigration system is something to be fixed, not an excuse for unaccountable agents to terrorize our communities.(APPLAUSE)SPRUNT: The rebuttal to a State of the Union is considered an honor given to a rising star, but it can be a tough gig.JOEL PAYNE: It's very hard to match the pomp and circumstance and the bully pulpit of the president.SPRUNT: That's Joel Payne, a longtime Democratic strategist. He says who gets chosen to give the speech sends an important message.PAYNE: Democrats, they want people to think about folks like Abigail Spanberger as core to the Democratic message and core to the Democratic coalition. Someone who comes from a state that's purple - not too far to the left, not too far to the right.SPRUNT: In 2018, Spanberger was part of a blue wave of Democrats who flipped control of the House. Party leaders are now looking to her to help them achieve that feat again this November, starting tonight, where she'll headline House Democrats' retreat to share lessons learned from her campaign.Barbara Sprunt, NPR News.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

Only one president in U.S. history has gone before Congress during a State of the Union address and said that the state of the union was \"not good.\"   It wasn't President Trump on Tuesday.   It was Gerald Ford in 1975 with the country facing similar economic problems to today's, including high prices. People continue to say that prices and the cost of living are their top concerns, and they blame Trump's policies, particularly his tariffs, for making things worse.   But Trump ignored those economic warts, instead boasting that \"our nation is back\" and that it had achieved a \"turnaround for the ages.\"   \n   It all amounted to a fairly standard Trump speech. It hit familiar notes on immigration and culture, was wide-ranging and record-setting — the longest spoken State of the Union address in recent history at 1 hour and 48 minutes — and had a usual amount of Trump showmanship.   Here are five takeaways from what Trump had to say in this midterm election year:   1. Trump ignored the difficulties people are facing with the economy.   Voters have been saying for a long time that prices and the cost of living are their top concerns. It's largely what has landed Trump and the Republican Party in a precarious position ahead of this year's midterm elections.   \n   And yet, Trump largely ignored the economic hardships many are feeling. He gave a rosy outlook, touting the stock market and lower gas prices. But the reality is, it's just not how voters are feeling, and Trump did not have an \"I feel your pain\" moment in this speech.   Trump's approval ratings are at or near record lows, and voters are blaming his policies, particularly his tariffs, for making things worse. In this speech, he doubled down on those tariffs. With the Supreme Court justices sitting just feet away, he criticized their ruling last week that many of his tariffs were illegal. He said he had come up with \"alternative\" legal justifications for keeping them in place.   \n   2. Trump's midterm message is … not new   There was no novel political message from the president in this speech. Trump talked a lot about his political hobby horses: the woes of immigration, crime and the culture wars. He tried to hit a reset button on immigration, focusing on border security and crimes committed replete with gory anecdotal details.   It's a tactic that's long been employed by Trump, the GOP and conservative media to advocate against immigration, particularly when data doesn't back up allegations of higher levels of crime committed by those in the country without legal status.   Trump's message worked in 2024, but two very important things have changed: (1) he owns the economy now, and people don't feel great about it and (2) he has a record now on immigration. And while people have said in polling that they are in favor of deportations, they're not happy with how his administration has gone about them — especially since most of those rounded up have no criminal record — and after two Americans were killed by federal officers in Minnesota in January.   3. There was no legislative agenda.   State of the Union addresses can sometimes descend into laundry lists of things the president wants Congress to accomplish.   Not this speech.   There were only about half a dozen specific things Trump asked Congress to do:   \"Codify\" Trump's attempts to lower drug prices, though it's unclear how.Pass the \"Stop Insider Trading Act\" that would restrict the Wall Street trading of members of Congress and their spouses.Pass what Trump is calling the \"Delilah Law\" that would ban commercial licenses for immigrants in the country without legal status.Restore funding for the Department of Homeland Security. After the killing of the two Americans in Minnesota, Democrats refused to authorize new funding for DHS, leading to a partial government shutdown. Pass the SAVE America Act, which would require proof of citizenship to vote. Proven instances of fraud, including by noncitizens, are very rare, but Trump claims there is \"rampant\" cheating. It's something he has used to justify his 2020 election loss, and it's a claim he could use to cast doubt on this year's outcome — if Republicans lose.   \n   While those are certainly consequential, they don't add up to a major legislative push. That's not surprising, though, since Trump has spent the better part of the last year trying to consolidate power in the White House.   4. The Democratic response had a wide range.   State of the Union speeches have turned from staid to raucous in the past 16 years. Outbursts and protests have become more common. That was certainly the case Tuesday night. Some Democrats boycotted. Others, like Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, shouted at the president about things she found outrageous during the speech. Rep. Al Green of Texas carried a sign that read, \"Black people aren't apes,\" a reference to a Trump social media post featuring a video that depicted former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes. For the second year in a row, Green was removed from the chamber.   \n   Then there was Abigail Spanberger, the governor of Virginia, who had the task of delivering the official Democratic response. Channeling the campaign message that got her elected in November, she focused on the economy. Trump, by not addressing the difficulties people are feeling about the economy, gave Spanberger an opening, and she took it.   She hammered home a sharp message that many Democratic candidates in swing districts will likely aim to emulate. It has a good chance of success, as Democrats look to flip only a handful of seats to take control of the House, and midterm elections are not kind to the party in power — especially when the president is unpopular.   Come 2028, though, there could be a reckoning on the horizon for the Democratic Party on what it stands for and what direction it wants to take the country in a post-Trump world.   5. None of this will likely matter much politically because views of Trump are \"baked in.\"   After the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll was released last week, pollster Lee Miringoff, who conducts the poll with his colleagues at Marist University, said Trump had an opportunity \"to try and reset with the nation, but it's a tall order when views about him are so baked in.\"   \n   Instead of trying to reach out beyond his base, he resorted to trying to bait Democrats, calling them \"crazy\" in an effort to position himself as \"normal\" on things like immigration, crime and transgender rights.   And he turned the address into a show. The gold-medal winning Olympic men's hockey team was there. So were veterans, who were decorated, live on-camera, with medals of honor.   Trump may have missed an opportunity to speak to voters' concerns, especially since presidents don't get that many opportunities to speak to the nation in prime time.   But, for Trump, no matter how things are going, the show must go on — and it will for roughly three more years.\n",

Democrats pushed back against President Trump's State of the Union address Tuesday night, with some lawmakers boycotting the speech, attending counter-programming or mounting a small number of protests from within the House chamber.   In the lead-up to the address, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., urged Democrats to \"attend with silent defiance,\" or choose not to attend. However, Trump repeatedly sparred with seated Democrats as some interrupted or refused to applaud during his address.   The pushback comes as Democrats enter a midterm year where they hope political headwinds can help them make gains in the House and Senate. In the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll, 57% of respondents said the state of the union is not strong, including 8 in 10 Democrats and about two-thirds of independents. Sixty percent said the country is worse off than it was a year ago, including about two-thirds of independents and 9 in 10 Democrats.   \n   Dozens of Democratic lawmakers skipped Trump's speech, with some addressing a few hundred protesters who congregated on the National Mall for a counter-event dubbed the \"People's State of the Union.\" A number of others walked out as Trump delivered his remarks.   At the start of Tuesday's address, Rep. Al Green, D-Texas., held up a sign that read \"Black people aren't apes,\" a reference to the racist video depicting former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes that was posted on Trump's social media account earlier this month. Green was then escorted out of the chamber.   Green was also removed from the chamber last year for protesting Trump's address to a joint session of Congress.   Other protests came as Trump touted his immigration crackdown and criticized liberal cities designated as sanctuary jurisdictions. Democratic Rep. Norma Torres, D-Calif., could be seen holding up photos of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, the two U.S. citizens killed by immigration enforcement officers in Minneapolis last month. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., shouted \"you have killed Americans\" as Trump discussed his immigration enforcement.   Throughout his remarks, President Trump criticized Democratic lawmakers for refusing to stand and clap as he ticked through his agenda, telling them, \"You should be ashamed of yourself.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Rep. Norma Torres, D-Calif., holds up a photo of Minnesota shooting victim Alex Pretti during President Trump's State of the Union address at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday.\n                \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Win McNamee/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"These people are crazy. I'm telling you, they're crazy,\" Trump said minutes later, remarking again that Democrats were not standing up and applauding, prompting more shouts from the crowd. \"We're lucky we have a country with people like this. Democrats are destroying our country,\" he added.   \n   Democrats also invited over a dozen individuals to the State of the Union who say they were victims of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with guests and lawmakers wearing pins that read \"stand with survivors, release the files.\" It comes as the administration continues to face pressure over its handling of information about Epstein and his network, including some from Republicans.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A woman wears a \"Release The Files\" pin at a press event with survivors of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, held by the Democratic Women's Caucus in advance of the State of the Union address.\n                \n                    Alex Wroblewski/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wroblewski/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n",

Trump often points to his change to taxes on tips as an example of how he's trying to mitigate rising costs — and address voters' concerns.    Garrett Watson, at the Tax Foundation, said refunds will be higher on average this year for the middle class. Watson pointed to these new tax policies Trump campaigned on just over a year ago: tax breaks on tipped income, overtime pay and social security benefits.    \n   \"Often we see federal taxes, it's more slow going,\" Watson said. \"That contrasts with a lot of these new ideas, which very much were brand new, in their infancy, and were created in the context of the 2024 campaign.\"   Trump first coined the phrase \"no tax on tips\" in Las Vegas. Then-candidate Vice President Kamala Harris quickly endorsed the campaign promise. And during Trump's first year in office, the GOP-controlled Congress passed a tax deduction of up to $25,000 for tipped wages in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.   This new tax deduction leaves tipped workers — who make up 12% of the U.S. workforce according to a TurboTax survey — wondering how to get this new deduction, whether they qualify, and if it will make a financial difference.     \n   \"There's a lot of confusion or popular misperception, as there always is, with tax changes and new items,\" Watson said.   Tipped workers expect relief   Ashlee Armstrong is a waitress, wife and mother of three.   She waits tables and greets travelers at the local airport in Kalispell, Mont. — southwest of Glacier National Park.    Tips make up a significant portion of her annual wage, which Armstrong estimates at $85,000. This year, she's looking forward to tax season.   \"If I have $25,000 taken off of that, it will impact me,\" Armstrong said.    For Armstrong, the tip deduction will keep her family from jumping up into a higher tax bracket — one she can't afford. And she's not alone.    \n   In Cambridge, Mass., bartender Joe McGuirk, 60, expects a bigger-than-normal tax break.    \"It will probably end up being a boon to me,\" McGuirk said. \"I have one friend who's already started doing the taxes. It appears that he'll be getting about $5,800 back as opposed to the $1,500 he might have gotten back last year.\"   Still, McGuirk — who has tended bars for 35 years — said he doesn't think this year's tax break will meaningfully change his financial situation.    \"With the cost of everything going up, this obviously will help me,\" he said. \"With that said, other trends in our society make it, you know, it's really like using a spoon to deal with a flood.\"   Housing in Cambridge is his biggest financial pressure, but it wasn't always.    \"There's a lot of work for me here,\" he said. \"Good work that for decades allowed me to keep a roof over my head and get two kids through college. Now, my income is not commensurate with housing costs.\"   \n   Back in Kalispell, the biggest cost for Armstrong is health care.   \"It's huge,\" she said. \"My daughter was having an asthma situation and had to stay in the children's hospital ward for three days. And we don't qualify for scholarships because we make too much, but we don't make enough that we can actually afford those kind of bills.\"   Armstrong is the only one in her family with health insurance — through her job. Her kids and husband pay out of pocket for medical costs.    \n   \"We're middle class and we're also not wealthy enough that we can afford, you know, to pay insurance monthly,\" Armstrong said.   How it works and who qualifies   For those who do file for the benefit, it's up to the employees — not the employer — to separate out tips from other wages on their tax forms this year, according to Lisa Greene-Lewis, a CPA and tax expert at TurboTax. The Treasury Department is not requiring employers to do that as taxpayers and businesses transition to the tax law changes.    \n   While some employers will separate tips from other wages, Greene-Lewis said it's up to tipped workers and their accountants to double check their tipped earnings and then report the deduction.    She said tax platforms have added a section for tipped workers this year.   Greene-Lewis recommended adding up all the tips earned on paystubs to make sure no tips are missed. While it's added work, Greene-Lewis said TurboTax data shows it'll be worth it.   \"We are seeing that people will see an increased refund of up to $1,000 or lower balance due ... compared to last year\" Greene-Lewis said. \"So I would definitely take advantage of these.\"   As for eligibility, the Treasury Department issued guidance on the jobs that qualify for the tip $25,000 deduction: bartenders, waiters, beauticians, ride share drivers, baristas. etc. Workers who make over $150,000 annually can't deduct tips from their taxable income.    Treasury Department and White House officials did not respond to requests for an interview on the new tip deduction.   Will it last?    In Las Vegas, Starbucks barista Yolanda Garcia said she expects to get a financial bump this tax season — but nothing major.     \"I think it's going to help a little, but it's not much because you're going to get something once a year,\" Garcia said.    \n   Garcia and her husband support two daughters. For her family, rising grocery prices is the chief concern.   \"I used to go to for groceries like every single week,\" Garcia said. \"Now, I go like every two weeks, and now I buy like the necessities, not the things that I want.\"   Both Garcia and McGuirk in Cambridge said this new tax benefit could make a real difference if it was permanent. As it stands, the tax deduction on tips expires in 2028.   \n   \"Even if it is boon to me, it's nothing I can count on except for the next three years,\" McGuirk said. \n",

You're reading the Up First newsletter. Subscribe here to get it delivered to your inbox, and listen to the Up First podcast for all the news you need to start your day.   Today's top stories   NPR's senior political editor/correspondent Domenico Montanaro joins the newsletter today to break down the State of the Union address.   President Trump has been facing difficult poll numbers, tied to the economy, specifically prices and the cost of living. But in his first State of the Union address of his second term, Trump ignored those economic warts.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Donald Trump delivers his State of the Union address during a Joint Session of Congress at the U.S. Capitol on February 24.\n                \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Instead, he boasted that \"our nation is back\" and that it had achieved a \"turnaround for the ages.\" It all amounted to a long speech — record-setting, in fact — that hit familiar Trump notes on immigration and culture, with a healthy amount of the usual showmanship.   Here are five takeaways from the speech:   Trump ignored the difficulties people are facing with the economy. Voters continue to say it's their top concern, but Trump had no \"I feel your pain\" moment. And he doubled down on his unpopular tariffs, criticizing Supreme Court justices sitting feet away for ruling that most of his tariffs were illegal.The midterm message is … what Trump talks about all the time. Gory stories of immigrants causing crime and the culture wars. It's a tactic long employed by Trump, the GOP and conservative media. His message worked in 2024, but now he owns the economy and has a record on immigration.There was no legislative agenda. There was no laundry list of things Trump wants Congress to do this year. No surprise, given that Trump has spent the better part of the last year trying to consolidate power.The Democratic response had a wide range. From outbursts, silent stares and boycotts to Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger's official response, which was sharply focused on the economy, Democrats will have a choice to make on which direction the party will go. But not in 2026, with midterm elections so heavily focused on Trump.None of this will likely matter much politically because views of Trump are \"baked in.\" Views of Trump haven't changed much in the last decade, and they likely won't as a result of this speech. Trump used prime time to put on a show, from gold medals to medals of honor, and the show will go on for roughly three more years.   \n   For more up-to-date politics news, sign up for our politics newsletter here.   The House of Representatives narrowly rejected a bipartisan aviation safety bill yesterday. Lawmakers developed the proposed legislation, called the ROTOR Act, after a U.S. Army helicopter and a passenger jet collided midair near Washington, D.C. last year, killing 67 people. Safety investigators and the victims' families backed the bill, yet the Pentagon withdrew its support just before the vote.    🎧 The act would mandate wider u,se of ADS-B in and ADS-B out, a safety system that transmits an aircraft's location to other aircraft, NPR's Joel Rose tells Up First. The National Transportation Safety Board said the technology could have prevented the deadly midair collision near Washington by giving pilots more warning and time to react. Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said that the bill could create \"unresolved budgetary burdens and operational security risks.\" Parnell didn't clarify what those risks are. Rose says these concerns appear new, as the Pentagon backed the bill when it passed the Senate unanimously in December. The act's sponsors say they plan to push for another vote in the House.   Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is threatening to blacklist Anthropic after the artificial intelligence company refused to loosen its safety standards for the military. During a meeting with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Hegseth vowed to punish the company for denying the Trump administration's demands, according to two people with direct knowledge of the meeting who were not authorized to speak publicly. One person said that Hegseth suggested the Pentagon could cancel Anthropic's $200 million contract. A Pentagon official said repercussions could include the government seizing Anthropic's AI tools for use against the company's will.   \n   Deep dive   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The front lobby of the Miami Immigration Court seen on Jan. 28, 2026 in Miami, Florida.\n                \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The Trump administration fired nearly 100 judges in 2025 as part of a larger push to reshape U.S. immigration courts. These firings, as well as resignations, shrunk the number of judges in the nation's immigration courts by about a quarter in the last year, even when accounting for new hires. The Justice Department Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) lost more than 400 legal assistants, attorney advisers and legal administrative specialists, according to data NPR obtained and verified. While the administration defends its personnel decisions as a necessary correction to \"lenient\" asylum rulings, the drain has crushed staff morale, bloated backlogs and left the due process system floundering.    ➡️ The staff left behind say that the current justice system is fundamentally different from what it was a year ago. One visible change is in the work environment. People in bureaucratic roles witnessed immigration and customs officers violently arresting people in the court hallways. Some judges also say they feel pressure to align case decisions with the administration's priorities.➡️ Although the majority of courts across the U.S. have lost judges, the impact hasn't been spread evenly. The Trump administration onboarded 17 new permanent judges, but assigned only one to a court that lost the majority of its judges.➡️ Smaller courts have felt the biggest impact of personnel shrinkage. Fourteen are now operating with two or fewer permanent judges.

He channels this horror into his latest album, titled Perseverantia. The 11-part suite for piano and strings combines classical and jazz, capturing the sounds of war, empathy and hope. In an interview with Morning Edition, Neselovskyi explained that, despite how music plays a big part in his life, he was unable to play for three weeks after the Russian invasion. When he finally approached the piano, he played brutal chords that later became the basis of the suite's second movement, \"Tanks Near Kyiv.\" That is when he realized that instrumental music could deliver a message that words couldn't.

The first summit on the African continent was also the first time the U.S. had boycotted the summit of the world's largest economies.   It was also unprecedented in that the group of disparate nations agreed to a declaration at the meeting's start rather than its conclusion, and that there was no ceremonial handover between the outgoing and incoming G20 chairs.   The Trump administration boycotted the event after Trump falsely accused the South African government of confiscating white-owned land and allowing the killing of white Afrikaners. The U.S. also objected to what it considered the summit's DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — agenda.   \n   Despite what some officials and analysts said were Washington's best attempts to derail the event, South African Minister of International Relations Ronald Lamola was upbeat as it wrapped up on Sunday at a convention center not far from the famous Johannesburg township of Soweto.   \"In a nutshell … this has been a great success for our country,\" said Lamola.   Earlier Sunday, host President Cyril Ramaphosa had declared the meeting closed, banging a ceremonial gavel on the table.   \"This gavel of this G20 summit formally closes this summit and now moves on to the next president of the G20, which is the United States, where we shall see each other again next year,\" he said.   Usually he'd be expected to hand that gavel over to the leader of the country taking over the rotating chairmanship of the G20, but President Trump was not in attendance. Washington had asked that Ramaphosa hand over to a junior embassy official, but the South Africans refused.   \"I mean, it's a breach of protocol. It has never happened before and it was never going to happen for the first time here in South Africa,\" Ramaphosa's spokesperson, Vincent Magwenya, told reporters.   The handover will now take place on Monday between South African and U.S. officials of similar rank.   \n   Joint declaration   The U.S. had also told the South Africans that they should not issue a joint declaration at the summit's close, and that if they issued something it should only be called a \"chair's statement.\"   However, Ramaphosa, who said ahead of the event \"we will not be bullied,\" announced at the meeting's opening on Saturday that consensus had been reached and a joint statement was issued without the input of the U.S.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                People walk by a large screen TV where South African President Cyril Ramaphosa holds a wooden gavel as he officially closes the G20 leaders' summit, in Johannesburg, South Africa, on Sunday.\n                \n                    Jerome Delay/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jerome Delay/AP\n    \n\n   \n   While G20 declarations are not binding, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly criticized the move, accusing Ramaphosa of \"refusing to facilitate a smooth transition of the G20 presidency\" and said Trump looked forward to \"restoring legitimacy\" to the group next year. He has said he plans to hold the event in Florida.   The declaration contained the kind of DEI language disliked by the Trump administration, stressing the threat of climate change, the importance of achieving \"gender equality\" and the debt burden faced by poorer countries.   Argentina — whose libertarian president, Javier Milei, is a strong Trump ally and did not attend the summit in solidarity with Trump but sent other representation — voiced some objections to the language but ultimately the declaration was still issued.   World leaders in attendance thanked South Africa for its G20 leadership, with French President Emmanuel Macron giving Ramaphosa a warm hug. But while Ramaphosa lauded the event as a win for multilateralism, Macron noted the divisions at the summit were still apparent.   And while Ramaphosa said South Africa had used the summit to put \"the Global South at the heart of the agenda\" and \"prioritized the issues that matter most to developing economies,\" it was conflicts in other parts of the world that dominated on the summit's sidelines.   European leaders put out a statement raising concerns about the U.S.'s new peace plan for Ukraine, which some see as favoring Moscow, saying it needed \"additional work\" and adding that proposed limitations on Ukraine's armed forces would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack.   \n   Separately, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva expressed concern Sunday over the U.S. military buildup near Venezuela.\n",

But the entity that the U.S. government alleges is led by Maduro is not a cartel per se.   \n   The designation is the latest measure in the Trump administration's escalating campaign to combat drug trafficking into the U.S. In previewing the step about a week ago, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio accused Cartel de los Soles, or Cartel of the Suns, of being \"responsible for terrorist violence\" in the Western Hemisphere.   The move planned Monday comes as Trump evaluates whether to take military action against Venezuela, which Trump has not ruled out despite bringing up the possibility of talks with Maduro. Land strikes or other actions would be a major expansion of the monthslong operation that has included a massive military buildup in the Caribbean Sea and striking boats accused of trafficking drugs, killing more than 80 people.   \n   Venezuelans began using the term Cartel de los Soles in the 1990s to refer to high-ranking military officers who had grown rich from drug-running. As corruption later expanded nationwide, first under the late President Hugo Chávez and then under Maduro, its use loosely expanded to police and government officials as well as activities like illegal mining and fuel trafficking. The \"suns\" in the name refer to the epaulettes affixed to the uniforms of high-ranking military officers.   The umbrella term was elevated to a Maduro-led drug-trafficking organization in 2020, when the U.S. Justice Department in Trump's first term announced the indictment of Venezuela's leader and his inner circle on narcoterrorism and other charges.   \"It is not a group,\" said Adam Isaacson, director for defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America organization. \"It's not like a group that people would ever identify themselves as members. They don't have regular meetings. They don't have a hierarchy.\"   Trump's expansion of terror label to cartels   Up until this year, the label of foreign terrorist organization had been reserved for groups like the Islamic State or al-Qaida that use violence for political ends. The Trump administration applied it in February to eight Latin American criminal organizations involved in drug trafficking, migrant smuggling and other activities.   \n   The administration blames such designated groups for operating the boats it is striking but rarely identifies the organizations and has not provided any evidence. It says the attacks , which began off the coast of Venezuela and later expanded to the eastern Pacific Ocean, are meant to stop narcotics from flowing to American cities.   \n   But many — including Maduro himself — see the military moves as an effort to end the ruling party's 26-year hold on power.   Since the arrival of U.S. military vessels and troops to the Caribbean months ago, Venezuela's U.S.-backed political opposition also has reignited its perennial promise of removing Maduro from office, fueling speculation over the purpose of what the Trump administration has called a counterdrug operation.   Trump, like his predecessor, does not recognize Maduro as Venezuela's president.   Maduro is on his third term in office after ruling-party loyalists declared him the winner of last year's presidential election despite credible evidence that the opposition's candidate defeated him by a more than 2-to-1 margin. He and senior officials have been repeatedly accused of human rights violations of real and perceived government opponents, including in the aftermath of the July 2024 election.   Hegseth says designation offers 'new options'   U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said last week that the upcoming designation of Cartel de los Soles will provide a \"whole bunch of new options to the United States\" for dealing with Maduro. But Hegseth, speaking in an interview with conservative news outlet OAN, did not provide details on what those options are and declined to say whether the U.S. military planned to strike land targets inside Venezuela.   \"So nothing is off the table, but nothing's automatically on the table,\" he said.   Trump administration officials have signaled that they find it difficult to see a situation in which Maduro remaining in power could be an acceptable end game. But as Trump considers an array of military and non-military options, including covert action by the CIA, for next steps, there is strong belief inside the administration that Maduro's rule \"is not sustainable,\" according to a senior administration official who was not authorized to comment publicly on the sensitive matter.   \n   The official added that Trump has been keenly listening to his intelligence team, which has reported to him that chatter picked up inside Venezuela indicates growing anxiety from Maduro and other high-level Venezuelan officials as the U.S. strikes continue. Trump, the official said, is \"very content and satisfied\" for the moment with the strikes' impact.   All the while, pleas from Maduro and others close to the Venezuelan leader to speak directly to the administration, relayed through various intermediaries and channels, seem to be more frantic, the official said. But Trump has not sanctioned any intermediaries to speak to Maduro on behalf of the U.S. administration.   Indictment alleges conspiracy to 'flood' US with drugs   The 2020 indictment accused Maduro, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López, among others, of conspiring with Colombian rebels and members of the Venezuelan military for several years \"to flood the United States with cocaine\" and use the drug trade as a \"weapon against America.\" Colombia is the world's top cocaine producer.   Before laying down weapons as part of a 2016 peace deal, members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, regularly used the porous border region with Venezuela as a safe haven and hub for U.S.-bound cocaine shipments — often with the support or at least consent of Venezuelan security forces. Dissidents continued the work. Colombia's National Liberation Army guerrilla is also involved in the illegal trade.   Maduro has denied the charges. The U.S. Justice Department this year doubled to $50 million the reward for information that leads to Maduro's arrest.   Maduro has insisted that the U.S. is building a false drug-trafficking narrative to try to force him from office. He and other government officials have repeatedly cited a United Nations report that they say shows traffickers attempt to move only 5% of the cocaine produced in Colombia through Venezuela.   \n   The U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on the Cartel de los Soles in July, saying Maduro and his top allies had bent the power of the Venezuelan government, military and intelligence services to assist the cartel in trafficking narcotics to the U.S.   U.S. authorities also alleged Maduro's cartel gave material support to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and the Sinaloa cartel, both of which were among the organizations that the U.S. designated as foreign terror organizations in February.\n",

Virginia is one of just three states where only the governor can restore voting rights for people with felony convictions.\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   RICHMOND, Va. — Tati King says he wants to set an example for his grandchildren that it's important to make sure their voices are heard.   It's why King, a 54-year-old living in Alexandria, Va., is suing Virginia election officials in federal court to get his voting rights restored.   \"I want them to see that their grandfather was on the right side of things for once in his life,\" he said.   King lost his ability to vote in the state because of a 2018 felony drug possession conviction. He served 11 months in prison and is now challenging Virginia's constitutional rule that automatically strips anyone's voting rights if they're convicted of a felony. The constitution gives the governor sole authority to restore those rights.   \n   More than 300,000 Virginians currently can't vote because of the policy, according to filings in King's legal challenge — which is just one of the ways Virginia's voter restoration system could soon change.   \n   Virginia's incoming governor, Democrat Abigail Spanberger, is expected to implement changes and a proposed constitutional amendment could make the restoration process automatic once someone's served out their sentence.   How Virginia stands out   Virginia is one of just three states where only the governor can restore voting rights for people with felony convictions.   And the governors of the other two states, Iowa and Kentucky, have signed orders to make the process automatic for most people with felony convictions, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, which tracks voting regulations.   Virginia's current governor, Republican Glenn Youngkin, rolled back efforts from his last three predecessors — a Republican and two Democrats — that made the restoration process automatic in most cases. He's implemented a case-by-case review system that has led to far fewer people getting their voting rights back.   Youngkin's protocol has sparked lawsuits and questions about the criteria he's using to make decisions. It's also opened up transparency questions.   \n   \"In the current administration, it's been tough, because we in the past had tried to help people understand the process and figure out what their status was and what they could do to get the right to vote back,\" said Rebecca Green, a law professor at William and Mary. \"But it's been a very low information environment.\"   Youngkin's office has said it's appropriate to consider each application individually. They said Youngkin's decisions are made after a review of all the information, including the nature of someone's felony conviction, whether a gun was used and if court fees are paid.   \n   King's case   King's lawsuit argues the state's disenfranchisement policy violates the Virginia Readmission Act of 1870 — which allowed Virginia to regain congressional representation after the Civil War.   In exchange for Virginia's readmission, the state was prohibited from adding laws that take away people's right to vote, with the only exception being those convicted of a crime considered a common law felony at the time.   These 1870 felonies include crimes like murder and manslaughter, but not drug-related ones like the one King was convicted of.   \"Virginia's one of the only states where we still have to go through hurdles and hoops in order for somebody to tell you, 'OK, now we see you,'\" King said. \"I think the laws are draconian, I think they're archaic and it should be changed.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                \"I Voted\" stickers are seen at a polling station on Nov. 4 in Alexandria, Va.\n                \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia and other groups helped King bring the case forward.   Vishal Agraharkar, a senior supervising attorney for the ACLU of Virginia who's working on King's case, said thousands of Virginians with felony convictions could get their voting rights restored if the case is successful.   \"Virginia has been illegally disenfranchising people, and disproportionately Black people, who were targeted with this disenfranchisement after the Civil War for more than 100 years,\" Agraharkar said. \"We're hoping that we can put that legacy of Jim Crow behind us.\"   Civil liberties advocates have often pointed to the disproportionate impact of felon disenfranchisement on Black people.   A 2024 report from the Sentencing Project — which advocates for responses to crime that minimize imprisonment — said an estimated 4 million Americans had lost their right to vote because of a felony conviction. This included one in every 22 eligible Black voters, which was more than triple the rate of other voters.   Big changes are on the horizon   As King waits on a ruling that could change Virginia's voter disenfranchisement practice, Spanberger is expected to change the rights restoration process used by Youngkin once she takes office in January.   \n   The governor-elect has vowed to ensure all eligible Virginians who have served their prison sentences have their voting rights restored.   Voters could take it out of the governor's hands completely if they approve a proposed constitutional amendment that would automatically restore people's voting rights once they've been released from prison.   To get the amendment on the ballot for voters, the state legislature needs to pass the proposal in back-to-back legislative sessions.   The Democratic-led General Assembly has already passed the measure once, and after Democrats expanded their majority in the House of Delegates earlier this month, the proposal is expected to make it on the state's ballot during next November's midterm elections.   Agraharkar, the ACLU attorney, said he hopes King's legal challenge and the constitutional amendment will usher in a new age of voter access.   \"Both of these efforts can work together to really make a big dent, hopefully this coming year, make really an enormous dent in felony disenfranchisement in Virginia, and hopefully this becomes a relic of the past,\" he said.\n",

    "body": "\n      Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene announced her impending resignation last night. We examine what led to the Georgia Republicans' decision and what it might mean for their party's narrow House majority.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  One of President Trump's most outspoken critics in Congress says they're leaving. Marjorie Taylor Greene says she will resign from her seat in the House in the new year. The Georgia Republican was once among the president's fiercest champions, but they fell out over releasing the Epstein files. NPR's Stephen Fowler has covered Marjorie Taylor Greene's career. He joins us now from Atlanta. Thanks so much for being with us.STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Good morning.SIMON: What seems to have prompted her decision to resign?FOWLER: Well, Greene put out an 11-minute video late Friday night that details the arc of her nearly five years in Congress. She outlined her path as the embodiment of Trump's MAGA movement, touted bills she passed and causes she championed. But mainly, there was this pervasive disappointment with the president, her party, the leadership of the House and the state of American politics.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE: Americans are used by the political industrial complex of both political parties election cycle after election cycle in order to elect whichever side can convince Americans to hate the other side more. And the results are always the same.FOWLER: Basically, she says she was elected to govern, and govern is one thing that Congress isn't doing.SIMON: Of course, recently, President Trump called Marjorie Taylor Greene a traitor for supporting the release of the Epstein files. Then he signed the bill into law this week. How does the figure of Epstein play into their relationship?FOWLER: Well, since Trump returned to office, there've actually been a number of policies and positions that have garnered criticism from some Republicans, especially Greene, who said they're not in the spirit of America first. When the U.S. bombed Iran, there was MTG asking how the foreign policy push benefited conservative America-first views. She called Israel's war in Gaza a genocide and has criticized America's support of Israel as not being America-first. Trump's economic policies, tariffs, importing Argentine beef to try and lower domestic prices - well, you get the idea.And on the Epstein files front, Trump's campaign promise to release the files related to his life and death and the numerous ways the president stonewalled the release this year before ultimately relenting this week is another factor. Here's what she said in her video.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GREENE: Standing up for American women who were raped at 14 years old, trafficked and used by rich, powerful men should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the president of the United States, whom I fought for.FOWLER: Scott, this was basically the last straw.SIMON: You mentioned her disappointment with Congress. Republicans, of course, hold a narrow majority there. Did that seem to factor into her decision?FOWLER: Absolutely. January 5, the day she'll resign, is right before the House returns to work in 2026. Republicans do have a narrow majority for now, and Greene hints that it's not being used to govern properly and that she doesn't expect that majority to last. There's also a healthy dose of criticism in her statement about Speaker Mike Johnson keeping the House out both before and during the government shutdown and not doing anything, like addressing health care subsidies.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GREENE: The House should have been in session working every day to fix this disaster. But instead, America was force-fed disgusting political drama once again from both sides of the aisle on television every single day.FOWLER: It is not just Marjorie Taylor Greene that wants to get out of Washington, Scott. She's one of a record 40 House members and 10 senators - mostly Republicans - who've indicated they don't plan to return to their seats after the 2026 election, joining a number of other lawmakers who are retiring or running for a different office.SIMON: Does Marjorie Taylor Greene's decision indicate anything - 'cause you cover this beat - about the broader direction of the Republican Party now?FOWLER: Well, it's not just a one-off fight with a member of Congress. Marjorie Taylor Greene is a canary in the coal mine for the state of the Republican Party. The Republicans suffered defeats up and down the ballot in this month's elections. Economic headwinds are not in their favor. And Greene has put a very visible dent in the previously impenetrable armor that is Trump's control over the GOP and its future. There was always going to be questions about what a post-Trump Republican Party would look like. We're now just seeing that sooner and messier than Republicans would've hoped for.SIMON: NPR's Stephen Fowler. Thanks so much.FOWLER: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Kennedy, says she has been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer.   Schlossberg is a journalist and author who writes about the environment.   She made her diagnosis public in an essay, called \"A Battle with My Blood,\" that was published on the website of The New Yorker on Saturday, the 62nd anniversary of her grandfather's assassination.   In the article, Schlossberg reveals that despite fighting the disease for over a year, her treatments did not result in a lasting remission and says the disease will kill her.   \n   Schlossberg is the daughter of Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg. She is 35 years old and is married and has two children. Here's what to know about the cancer, called acute myeloid leukemia, and what else Schlossberg says in the essay.   What is the disease?   Acute myeloid leukemia is a blood cancer. The form Schlossberg has been diagnosed with is known as acute myeloid leukemia with inversion 3, a rare mutation which is most commonly seen in older patients. Schlossberg learned of her diagnosis at just 34.   \"I would say acute myeloid leukemia with inversion 3 is one of the ones that most of us who manage leukemia look at as probably one of the most aggressive mutations,\" says Dr. Clark Alsfeld, a hematology oncologist with Ochsner MD Anderson Cancer Center in New Orleans, who specializes in leukemias and other myeloid malignancies. He's also an expert in stem cell transplantation, which was part of Schlossberg's treatment.   \"It's very, very challenging to get to remission, long-term prognosis is unfortunately very short, and survival rates are much less than we see with other types of acute myeloid leukemia,\" Alsfeld says.   \n   Very little is known about what causes the disease or what might increase someone's risk of getting it, according to Alsfeld. Schlossberg writes that she didn't feel sick and the disease was discovered via blood tests on the day she gave birth to her second child. She had swum a mile in the pool the day before, she says.   \"The challenge that we have with acute myeloid leukemia, patients ask all the time, 'how long did this exist?'\" before it was detected, he says. \"I usually tell them probably not very long. A lot of these leukemias that we have, we don't think of as something that are lingering for years and years and years before they're developed or before they're detected.\"   \n   Schlossberg's rebuke of RFK Jr.   In the essay, Schlossberg also writes about the physical and emotional pain brought about from the disease, and the anguish of seeing her loved ones share in that pain.   But the essay is not only personal. Schlossberg also offers a stinging indictment of her first cousin once removed, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.   \n   \"Throughout my treatment, he had been on the national stage: previously a Democrat, he was running for President as an Independent,\" Schlossberg writes. \"But mostly as an embarrassment to me and the rest of my immediate family.\"   She describes Kennedy's history of vaccine skepticism, inexperience in the medical field, and antipathy for the funding of medical research as her gravest areas of concern.   \"Suddenly, the health-care system on which I relied felt strained, shaky,\" she writes.   Alsfeld says stories like Schlossberg's can make a difference.   \"Pieces like this are so incredibly important to help bring it home for a lot of people that might hear 'acute myeloid leukemia' and just think of a commercial on TV or something and not really be able to make it as heartfelt as that article was, and make it very real for people,\" he says.   Alsfeld hopes the article spurs renewed interest in funding for medical research, after the Trump administration moved to cut federal research grants this year.\n",

But he offered very little information on what was discussed. He also downplayed a Thursday deadline set by President Donald Trump for Ukraine to respond to the plan, saying simply that officials want to see fighting stop as soon as possible and that officials could keep negotiating Monday and beyond. He said that higher-level officials may eventually have to get involved.   \n   \"This is a very delicate moment,\" Rubio said of what still needed to be worked out. \"Some of it is semantics, or language. Others require higher-level decisions and consultations. Others, I think, just need more time to work through.\"   The 28-point blueprint drawn up by the U.S. to end the nearly four-year war has sparked alarm in Kyiv and European capitals. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said his country could face a stark choice between standing up for its sovereign rights and preserving the American support it needs.   The Ukrainian leader has vowed that his people \"will always defend\" their home.   \n   The proposal acquiesces to many Russian demands that Zelenskyy has categorically rejected on dozens of occasions, including giving up large pieces of territory.   In a subsequent statement Sunday night, the White House said the Ukrainian delegation \"affirmed that all of their principal concerns — security guarantees, long-term economic development, infrastructure protection, freedom of navigation, and political sovereignty — were thoroughly addressed during the meeting.\"   It added that the Ukrainians \"expressed appreciation for the structured approach taken to incorporate their feedback into each component of the emerging settlement framework.\" The White House said changes made to the proposal now reflect \"their national interests\" and provide \"credible and enforceable mechanisms to safeguard Ukraine's security in both the near and long term.\"   \n   But language of such positive steps came only after concerns about the original, Trump-endorsed deal intensified. A bipartisan group of U.S. senators said Rubio told them Saturday that the plan had originated with Russia and was actually a \"wish list\" for Moscow, rather than a serious push for peace.   German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that he'd spoken to Trump and made clear there were some parts of the plans key European nations could agree on but others where they could not.   \"I told him that we are fully in line with Ukraine, that the sovereignty of this country must not be jeopardized,\" Merz said in an interview with DW.   Rubio touts progress on talks, saying efforts will continue   Rubio called the U.S. proposal a \"living breathing document\" that would continue changing. He also made, clear though, that any final product — once it's ready — will still have to be presented to Moscow: \"obviously, the Russians get a vote here.\"   The head of the Ukrainian delegation, presidential chief of staff Andrii Yermak, said of the talks, \"We have made very good progress and are moving forward to a just and lasting peace,\" he said.   The rosy assessment of what was discussed defied Trump himself. Before talks began, the president blasted Ukraine for a lack of gratitude for U.S. military assistance while shying away from criticizing Russia.   Trump has set a Thursday deadline for Ukraine to respond to the plan but also suggested it could slide if there was proof of real progress. He also said that the plan was not his final offer — without offering further details on what that meant.   \"UKRAINE 'LEADERSHIP' HAS EXPRESSED ZERO GRATITUDE FOR OUR EFFORTS, AND EUROPE CONTINUES TO BUY OIL FROM RUSSIA,\" Trump posted on his social media site Sunday morning.   After Trump's post, Zelenskyy cheered U.S.-led efforts on security while also stressing that \"the crux of the entire diplomatic situation is that it was Russia, and only Russia, that started this war.\"   \n   \"Ukraine is grateful to the United States, to every American heart, and personally to President Trump,\" Zelenskyy wrote in a post on Telegram, adding, \"We thank everyone in Europe.\"   \"It is important not to forget the main goal – to stop Russia's war and prevent it from ever igniting again,\" he added.   Ukraine and allies have ruled out territorial concessions   Before convening with U.S. officials, Yermak and his team also met with national security advisers from the U.K., France and Germany. The allies have rallied around Kyiv in a push to revise the plan.   Alice Rufo, France's minister delegate at the Defense Ministry, told broadcaster France Info before the talks began that key points of discussion would include the plan's restrictions on the Ukrainian army, which she described as \"a limitation on its sovereignty.\"   \n   \"Ukraine must be able to defend itself,\" she said. \"Russia wants war and waged war many times in fact over the past years.\"   On Sunday, Zelenskyy said that there was an understanding the U.S. would take into account \"a number of elements\" in a peace deal that are important for Ukraine, but did not elaborate further.   \"There have already been brief reports from the team about the results of the first meetings and conversations,\" he said. \"There is now an understanding that the American proposals may take into account a number of elements based on the Ukrainian vision and are critically important for Ukraine's national interests.\"   Rubio's reported comments cause confusion   Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Sunday that Warsaw was ready to work on the plan with the leaders of Europe, Canada and Japan, but also said that it \"would be good to know for sure who is the author of the plan and where was it created.\"   Some U.S. lawmakers said Saturday that Rubio had described the plan as a Russian \"wish list\" rather than a Washington-led proposal. A U.S. State Department spokesperson said that account was \"blatantly false.\" On his way to Geneva, Rubio then took the extraordinary step of suggesting online that the senators were mistaken, even though they said he was their source for the information.   \n   The issue was still causing a stir on Sunday.   The top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Mark Warner, told ABC's \"This Week\" that the peace plan appeared to be \"almost a series of Russian talking points,\" had made Europeans \"feel like they've been totally left high and dry\" and had led to \"ferocious pushback.\"   Turkish leader plans talk with Putin   Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced that he would hold a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday. He said he would talk to Putin about reviving a previous deal from July 2022 that allowed Ukraine to safely ship exports of grain via the Black Sea.   The agreement stayed in place until the following year, when Putin refused to extend it, saying that a parallel agreement promising to remove obstacles to Russian exports of food and fertilizer hadn't been honored.   \"We had a grain corridor endeavor to open the path to peace,\" Erdogan said, \"Unfortunately we were only partially able to succeed. Tomorrow I will be asking Putin to revisit the endeavor.\"   Erdogan's new diplomatic push comes just days after he met with Zelenskyy in Ankara.\n",

    "body": "\n      We take a look at President Trump's peace plan to end the war in Ukraine, Marjorie Taylor Greene's decision to step down from Congress, and a surprisingly cordial visit to the White House.   \n\n    AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:  President Trump is pushing a peace plan to end the war in Ukraine. Initially, the president wanted a response from Kyiv by this Thursday but now says the deadline could be extended if things are working well. And when asked by a reporter yesterday if this was his final offer to Ukraine, the president replied...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. Not my final offer.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: And I would like to get to peace. It should have been - it should have happened a long time ago.UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS: [inaudible].TRUMP: The Ukraine war with Russia should have never happened. If I were president, it never would have happened. We're trying to get it ended. One way or the other, we have to get it ended.RASCOE: To discuss all this, we're joined now by NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben. Good morning, Danielle.DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Good morning, Ayesha.RASCOE: So as the president himself admitted last week, ending this conflict has not been easy and is not easy. So what do we know about this peace proposal? And what are the chances it could work?KURTZLEBEN: Well, it's a 28-point plan, and it was crafted by the U.S. and the Kremlin without Ukraine's involvement. And so it is widely seen as very friendly to Russia. It - under it, Ukraine would give up territory to Russia, it would cut the size of its military, and this plan says that Ukraine can never enter NATO. That's a big deal.Now, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has responded in stark terms. He said, the choice here is a loss of dignity or the risk of losing a key partner, seeming to mean the U.S. So Ukraine doesn't like this plan, but Trump badly wants to be able to say he ended this conflict. And there was that clip you played. Trump said that this plan isn't his final offer, so maybe he'll be inclined to help reach a compromise.RASCOE: We had a really dramatic announcement late on Friday night from Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. She was, until recently, one of the president's biggest supporters, but now she says she'll leave Congress in January. Are we seeing cracks in the MAGA coalition?KURTZLEBEN: Yes, and this break is just stunning. I remember seeing her on the campaign trail open for Trump at a rally in Georgia. The Trump crowd went wild for her. This was a tight relationship. But we've seen this MAGA rift growing this year over U.S. ties to Israel, military involvement in Iran. There's just this feeling among some that Trump has softened on his isolationism.So there's ideology at work here, but then there's politics. Trump is 79, and also, running again would be unconstitutional, no matter what he says. So Marjorie Taylor Greene may be looking ahead to the post-Trump GOP and staking out her territory. She's been saying lately that she's more America First than Trump. So if she pursued office again, that might appeal to MAGA people.RASCOE: President Trump labeled Marjorie Taylor Greene a traitor after their public fallout. But she wasn't the only politician that he lashed out at, right?KURTZLEBEN: No, not at all. Trump last week responded to a video made by Democratic lawmakers who are also veterans, and in that video, they told members of the military and intelligence communities, you can refuse illegal orders. Now, Trump went on social media and said that this is seditious behavior punishable by death, which is shocking and dark and upsetting.And it led to this surreal-feeling moment in the press briefing last week where a reporter asked if the president really wants to execute members of Congress, and Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said no. But both this episode and Trump's feud with Marjorie Taylor Greene resulted in real fear. Taylor Greene has talked about having increased threats, and Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin received a bomb threat.RASCOE: And New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani had what I think many would call, like, a surprisingly cordial visit to the White House. Here's what the president had to say.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: We agree on a lot more than I would have thought. I think he's - I want him to do a great job, and we'll help him do a great job.RASCOE: What do you make of that?KURTZLEBEN: Yeah. Surprising, no doubt. You said it. Trump had attacked Mamdani a lot. He had even threatened at one point to arrest him. And, of course, Mamdani had attacked Trump as well. But Mamdani did have a reason to make nice. Trump had threatened cutting federal funds to New York and also sending federal troops to the city.Now, Trump - you know, it's possible Mamdani just charmed him, but it's also possible Trump didn't want to lash out at a guy who's popular, has a winning populist message. And also, we all know Trump just likes a winner.RASCOE: That's NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben. Thanks so much.KURTZLEBEN: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

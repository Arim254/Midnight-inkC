Mike Quigley of Illinois about DHS funding and ICE reforms ahead of Friday's deadline to avert a partial government shutdown.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Democratic Congressman Mike Quigley of Illinois is part of this discussion. After the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, Quigley changed his mind about ICE, saying it could not be reformed and must be dismantled. Congressman, good morning.MIKE QUIGLEY: Good morning. Thanks for having me back.INSKEEP: What do you mean by dismantled? Are you in favor of abolishing ICE, as some people say?QUIGLEY: Look, I voted no on DHS funding for this, and I'll vote no again. Reforms are no longer enough to course-correct here. We have to dismantle ICE and start over, rebuilding an immigration enforcement agency from the ground up. We need people keeping the border secure, making sure drugs and people aren't tracked into the country and removing the worst of the worst criminals. But they're not doing that. We've seen the horrors and the terror of what they're doing. So I don't trust this agency. I think you dismantle them and you start anew with the original mission of the agency in place.INSKEEP: It seems likely that's not going to happen in this negotiation, so let's talk about the situation now. We just heard that Republicans seem to be on board with body cameras. There is some support for limiting these roving patrols. What else do you think is realistic to get out of this negotiation?QUIGLEY: You know, I think they shouldn't wear masks because what we've seen here is that there's no accountability when they're not mearing wasks (ph). But we've also seen police across the country wear ID, whether it's some sort of QR code. If they're worried about them being doxed, a QR code - you know, the agency and people will know who those are and not the general public. I mean, maybe that's a compromise. But look, there's just too much at stake here - protecting sensitive locations, stopping racial profiling. And then, again, we're not asking ICE to do anything that we don't ask of every police force in the country. They have to uphold the use-of-force standards. There should be some coordination with state and local officials. So that's not a lot to ask. That's all we've asked Chicago Police Department and every police department in the country.INSKEEP: I had not heard this idea previously that you're discussing about QR codes. I want to make sure I understand this. The idea is, instead of their name on the uniform, the agent has a QR code, and people who are standing around monitoring this with their phones can scan the QR code with the phone. And maybe they don't learn the agent's name, but they're able to report this specific person did this specific thing, and someone can investigate later. Is that what you mean to say?QUIGLEY: Look, you asked what the fallback might be. I don't think they should wear a mask. But I'm just saying this is how unreasonable they are. If there's some sort of QR code where the agency knows who they are and if something bad happens, as it's had happen all too often here, there is at least some way that we can find out who's responsible and someone can be held accountable. That's, at least, some way. I'm not suggesting that's the ideal. I'm suggesting - to answer the question, is there a way to compromise on this? Frankly, we're way past that. At this point in time, we've got to take this agency down and start anew with an agency who gets its mission and doesn't exceed it on a daily basis.INSKEEP: Sounds like you're going to be a no vote regardless on this DHS funding, but you're surrounded by other Democrats and Republicans. And in conversations, is it your sense that the deadline is going to be missed, that it is likely that DHS, the other parts of DHS, will shut down for a while?QUIGLEY: Yeah. I don't see any middle ground popping up right now. You know, when the president of the United States talks about, well, we've got to fund FEMA, and you have to be voting for this or you vote against FEMA, just a few months ago, he was talking about dismantling FEMA. Seems to forget that much of the reason that we need FEMA is his total disregard for climate change and the extreme weather events that we're experiencing. So the president's hypocrisy is showing here. I don't want to shut down any level of government. The irony is ICE has been so dramatically funded, you know, they won't be hurting in a shutdown. Their budget was tripled. And when they talk, again, about a lack of body...INSKEEP: Yeah.QUIGLEY: ...Cameras, they've got all the money in the world to buy what they need.INSKEEP: OK. Congressman Mike Quigley of Illinois. Thanks very much for your insights. Really appreciate it.QUIGLEY: Thank you. Take care.INSKEEP: Have a good morning.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Scott Detrow talks with Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., and Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., about current congressional negotiations regarding funding for the Department of Homeland Security.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  Top immigration officials are testifying on Capitol Hill this week ahead of Friday's deadline to fund the Department of Homeland Security. Democrats have refused to fund DHS without changes to how federal agents conduct immigration sweeps, and Republicans are reluctant to approve significant reforms to an immigration enforcement operation that they broadly support. So how can the parties find any common ground before DHS runs out of money on Friday?We have invited on two lawmakers, one from each party, to talk about all of this. Republican Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Democratic Congressman Tom Suozzi of New York. Together, they co-chair the Problem Solvers Caucus. They both penned a letter to the White House urging President Trump to take this moment to consider a broader bipartisan fix to immigration and immigration enforcement. Thanks to both of you for coming on.BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Thanks for having us.TOM SUOZZI: Yeah, thanks, Scott.DETROW: Let me start with this. I'll start with Congressman Fitzpatrick then turn to Congressman Suozzi. You both work together a lot. You talk about finding common ground, getting solutions. So I actually would love to start with what the biggest area you disagree on when it comes to immigration, when it comes to immigration enforcement because, I mean, that tells us a lot about the possibility of a deal. Congressman Fitzpatrick, let me start with you.FITZPATRICK: In terms of policy, both of us agree that the border needs to be secure. Both of us agree that we need to be humane and show compassion when it comes to enforcement in the interior. Both of us agree that you have to separate out the dangerous, violent offenders who pose a public safety threat from the people that are here in this country undocumented who have committed no other crime other than crossing the border. You know, Tom may disagree. But, you know, in my communications with him, there's been no distance whatsoever.SUOZZI: Yeah, we don't disagree between the two of us. And I think there are a lot of Democrats and a lot of Republicans could easily come to a way forward to, as Brian said, to secure the border, to fix the broken asylum system, to legalize a bunch of people that have been here for more than nine years, since President Trump first came into office. The problem is, is that the people that are most involved in politics these days, most passionate in politics, are often off at the extreme edges. So we have to do the hard work of functioning in what is a toxic environment to say, listen, we share more in common than what divides us - let's try and push that through.DETROW: So the two of you seem to be mostly on the same page in saying there is a path forward here. I think it's clear to everybody that Congress as a whole is not necessarily on that page, and I'm wondering what you think the biggest challenge is. Whether it's a short-term deal, whether it's a longer-term deal, what is the biggest sticking point? Is it the idea of any sort of restrictions on ICE and Border Patrol operating within the U.S.? Do you think it's something else?SUOZZI: Well, we certainly need to have restrictions on the way that ICE is operating now. I think that we've really just hit a tipping point after Alex Pretti was killed. And, you know, I've long said that, you know, the president's right, we have to secure the border. The president's right, we have to deport violent criminals. The president's right, we have to go after violent cartels.But he's squandering any success he's had in that respect on these raids that are taking place that are really - have been, I believe, illegal and immoral in many ways. And, you know, they're economically unwise, they're socially destructive, and they're morally wrong. And I think most Americans are leaning in the position, you know, we want to go after the gangs. We don't want to go after the gardeners.DETROW: So Representative Fitzpatrick, everything that Representative Suozzi just said, how many Republicans in the House, do you think, would by and large agree with what he said?FITZPATRICK: Believe it or not, the majority.DETROW: Yeah.FITZPATRICK: You know, the challenge, unfortunately, is politics gets in the way for a lot of these people. We're not going to get to an agreement on all the things that need to be fixed with ICE in a week. It's not going to happen in a week. It's going to take time. It's going to take a lot of conversations, just like we had post-George Floyd. But in terms of ICE, we should all agree that the masks should come off. We should all agree on the need for body cameras, you know, 24/7 that they're in operation.DETROW: Well, I don't think the White House agrees on the mask question, though. And that feels like a pretty key...FITZPATRICK: Well, that's - listen, I'm speaking on my own behalf. And I'm also telling you, the conversations that I have with many, many of my colleagues on the floor, they agree with that.DETROW: You are both saying things that I think if you polled the majority of Americans would agree with, right?FITZPATRICK: Yeah.DETROW: But we are living in a world where you know that, if anything, congressional districts are going the opposite direction as both sides get more and more redistricting.FITZPATRICK: Yeah, and we got to fix that.SUOZZI: That's one of the biggest problems we have.DETROW: Sure.FITZPATRICK: We got to fix that.DETROW: Sure. And you have seen immigration and ICE and Border Patrol enforcement become something that has terrified a lot of Americans. This has become some of the biggest political crises we've seen in a long time. So I guess my question is, given the reality of the world we are facing right now, what do you both think the path forward is in this Congress for this issue that you both clearly care about?FITZPATRICK: I will answer that question. I think that for the immigration issue with DHS funding, which is the issue right before us right now, we do very, very short-term CR extensions that are always coupled with one reform, right? So what's the easiest reform that we can all agree on? Let's say body cams, right? So how about we do a two-week extension of DHS funding, and we add that one reform? And then if we want another two-week or another month extension, we add another reform that we all agree to. That way, at least incrementally, we make that progress and we get to where we need to be.DETROW: That is Republican Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Democratic Congressman Tom Suozzi of New York. They are co-chairs of the Problem Solvers Caucus. Thanks for talking to us.SUOZZI: Yeah, thank you.FITZPATRICK: Yeah, thanks.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Johnson was charged in Florida after receiving a full pardon from President Donald Trump for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n                \n                    Hernando County Sheriff's Office\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Hernando County Sheriff's Office\n    \n\n   \n   A Florida handyman who received a pardon from President Trump for storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, has been convicted of multiple state charges of child molestation and exposing himself to children, prosecutors told NPR. Andrew Paul Johnson, the pardoned rioter, attempted to bribe one victim with money he claimed he would receive as part of restitution for Jan. 6 defendants, police reported. The conviction is the latest case of a pardoned Capitol rioter committing new crimes after receiving a pardon.   On Tuesday, a jury in Hernando County, Fla., found Andrew Paul Johnson guilty of five charges, including molesting a child under 12 and another under 16, as well as lewd and lascivious exhibition. Johnson was acquitted of one charge of sending sexual material to a child.   \n   William Forgie, the chief assistant state attorney for the fifth judicial circuit in Florida, told NPR in an email that Johnson \"faces up to life in prison\" when he is sentenced in March. An attorney for Johnson did not respond to a phone message seeking comment.   \n   A police report from the Hernando County Sheriff's Office filed as part of Johnson's Florida case describes a pattern of abuse — including both physical sexual abuse and exposing his genitalia to children — that took place \"over a many-month span.\" One of Johnson's victims was 11 years old at the time of the abuse.   Johnson also attempted to keep one victim quiet by claiming he would receive $10 million from the Trump administration as restitution for former Jan. 6 defendants and would share the money with the victim in his will, according to the police report. Convicted rioters and their supporters have advocated for financial reparations since Trump returned to office, though it's unclear if the administration will take that step.   In 2024, Andrew Paul Johnson pleaded guilty to nonviolent charges for entering the U.S. Capitol through a broken window during the Jan. 6 riot and then cursing at police officers trying to clear the area. Prosecutors said Johnson described himself on social media as an \"American Terrorist\" and \"Proud J6er,\" and that he violated court orders by posing with a gun while his case was ongoing.   \n   Chief Judge James Boasberg sentenced Johnson to one year in prison, in part due to Johnson's lengthy criminal history, including drug possession, driving under the influence and resisting arrest.   \n   Trump has described the more than 1,500 people charged for their roles in the Jan. 6 attack as \"patriots,\" and argued that they were treated unfairly by the justice system. \"These were peaceful people, these were great people,\" Trump said in 2021.   Just months after Johnson received his prison sentence, Trump pardoned him along with virtually every other Jan. 6 defendant.   The White House has not answered NPR's questions about whether the administration intends to provide compensation to people charged for their roles in the attack on the U.S. Capitol, though some Trump administration officials have promoted the idea in the past.   Johnson is one of several former Jan. 6 defendants who have faced additional legal trouble after receiving pardons from Trump. New charges filed against former defendants have included possession of child sexual abuse material and breaking and entering.   \n   Last week, Christopher Moynihan pleaded guilty in New York state court to a misdemeanor charge of harassment after he was accused of threatening to kill Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the top Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives. \"I cannot allow this terrorist to live,\" Moynihan allegedly wrote in a text message. \"I will kill him for the future.\"   The White House did not respond to NPR's request for comment.\n",

In a blistering opening statement, ranking member Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., criticized the DOJ's handling of the Epstein files and the agency's treatment of survivors, highlighting that several were present in the hearing room. Raskin and Democrats on the panel have called for increased transparency, highlighting examples where they say redacted information in the documents benefits powerful individuals who may be implicated in Epstein's crimes, instead of omitting information that protects survivors.    \n   \"You're not showing a lot of interest in the victims, Madam Attorney General, whether it's Epstein's human trafficking ring or the homicidal governmental violence against citizens in Minneapolis,\" Raskin said, in reference to the two fatal shootings of U.S. citizens by immigration officers in the city last month. \"You're siding with the perpetrators, and you're ignoring the victims,\" he added. \"That will be your legacy unless you act quickly to change course.\"   Throughout the hearing, Bondi, a former Florida attorney general, defended the DOJ's handling of the files, touting the release of millions of documents. In her opening statement, she vowed to continue fighting for survivors, saying she was \"deeply sorry for what any victim, any victim, has been through, especially as a result of that monster.\"    But in response to Democrats' questions about the DOJ's handling of the Epstein investigation, Bondi repeatedly pushed back — sometimes with personal attacks directed at lawmakers.   When asked by Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., to apologize to survivors for the agency's \"absolutely unacceptable release of the Epstein files and their information,\" Bondi retorted: \"I'm not going to get in the gutter for her theatrics.\"   \n   Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., was one of the few Republicans to press Bondi on Epstein.    Massie has largely broken with his party for months in criticizing the administration on the issue. During the hearing, he demanded accountability from the DOJ for sharing survivor information and accused officials of \"over-redacting\" potentially incriminating information.    Bondi responded by calling Massie a \"failed politician\" with \"Trump derangement syndrome,\" and asked whether the congressman demanded the same level of transparency from former Attorney General Merrick Garland during the Biden administration. Massie went on to reject that argument.   \n   \"This cover-up spans decades, and you are responsible for this portion of it,\" he said.   Political divides on weaponization   The attorney general's appearance before the committee comes one year into her tenure atop the Justice Department, a tumultuous period marked by a striking departure from the traditions and norms that have guided the department for decades.   Since taking the helm, Bondi has overseen the firing of career prosecutors and FBI officials who worked on Capitol riot cases or Trump investigations, investigated and prosecuted prominent opponents of the president, and dropped prosecutions of his allies.   \n   Across the aisle, most GOP lawmakers used their time during the hearing to praise the attorney general's work, emphasizing DOJ efforts to combat violent crime and illegal immigration — issues Bondi has highlighted as major accomplishments during her first year.    \"What a difference a year makes,\" the committee's chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said in his opening remarks. \"The DOJ has returned to its core missions — upholding the rule of law, going after the bad guys and keeping Americans safe.\"   Bondi says she's made \"tremendous progress\" toward ending what she says was the department's weaponization in recent years against Trump and conservatives. Biden-era DOJ officials deny they politicized the department, and they point to the prosecutions of prominent Democratic lawmakers and even President Joe Biden's son Hunter as evidence.   For decades, the Justice Department has enjoyed a degree of independence from the White House, particularly in investigations and prosecutions, to insulate them from partisan politics.   Critics say that under Bondi, independence has disappeared and the DOJ has helped enact Trump's promised campaign of retribution against his perceived enemies, including bringing charges against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.   \n   Both cases have since been tossed by a federal judge. The Justice Department is appealing that decision.   Democrats tried to turn Bondi's claims of weaponization around, accusing the DOJ of carrying out Trump's political agenda.   \"You've turned the people's Department of Justice into Trump's instrument of revenge,\" Raskin said. \"Trump orders up prosecutions like pizza, and you deliver every time.\"   Other perceived opponents of the president or individuals standing in the way of his agenda have also found themselves under DOJ investigation, including Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff and former Obama-era intelligence officials James Clapper and John Brennan.   \n   Most recently, a handful of Democratic lawmakers faced scrutiny from the administration for appearing in a video last fall where they directed members of the military to refuse illegal orders — a decision that Trump called \"treasonous.\"   The administration has since suffered another legal setback in that fight. A grand jury in Washington, D.C., this week rejected an attempt by federal prosecutors to indict the lawmakers on federal charges.\n",

She credits her success to addressing national issues with New Jerseyans.   \"While my race was very much local — I was knocking on doors, I was making phone calls, I was at train stations — the discussions we were having were both local and national,\" Mejia told Morning Edition   Last Thursday, Mejia led by a narrow margin as polls closed in the district, and former congressman Tom Malinowski conceded earlier this week. Some mail-in ballots are still being counted, and the Associated Press has not yet made a call in the race.   \n   The crowded special primary race — one of the first elections in a year filled with midterm races — attracted national interest, as Democrats are trying to figure out the best way to win over voters and speak to their dissatisfaction with President Trump's second-term.   \"There is a national movement happening in our country,\" Mejia said. \"The American people can see that there is a democratic backslide. The American people can feel that our economy is leaving us behind. The American people also feel like our traditional politicians' response feels anemic — feels like we're not actually being heard.\"   Mejia concluded that the conversations she had with voters felt \"live\" for people, who want to hold elected officials accountable.

    "body": "\n      A contentious House hearing with senior immigration leaders did little to bring lawmakers closer on a deal to fund the Department of Homeland Security.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  The Department of Homeland Security faces a possible shutdown this weekend. Bipartisan talks have stalled over limiting President Trump's immigration enforcement agenda.STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  And in a few minutes, we will hear from one of the Democrats involved in the negotiations, Representative Mike Quigley. First, we have some sounds from Capitol Hill. Lawmakers in the House called up to the people leading the president's immigration agenda yesterday, and here are the facts.MARTIN: NPR's immigration policy correspondent Ximena Bustillo has been tracking all this, and she's with us now. Good morning, Ximena.XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Good morning.MARTIN: So tell us - who did we hear from, and what did they say?BUSTILLO: Officials from the three immigration agencies were on tap, all wanted to talk about how they were implementing President Trump's agenda, so that's reducing the number of people crossing at the southern border, increasing arrests and deportations and bringing more scrutiny to legal immigration. Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting director Todd Lyons faced most of the questions, even though his agency is not the only one conducting immigration law enforcement. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow faced the fewest questions, even though his agency has leaned into policing tactics and reviewing the status of more immigrants.MARTIN: That's interesting. OK, so Democrats have been demanding that agents be equipped with body cameras, for agents to identify themselves and to use judicial warrants when they go into people's homes. Those are some of the demands, but those seem to be the main ones. Did those come up yesterday?BUSTILLO: Yeah. Republicans asked about body camera availability, and Lyons said that ICE only has 3,000 cameras for 13,000 officers, and Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Rodney Scott noted that only half of 20,000 CBP officers have body cameras and not enough people to fully implement them. Here is Scott's plea to Congress.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RODNEY SCOTT: So fund the entire program so that we can be transparent and that we can make sure America knows what we're doing because that trust is critically important.BUSTILLO: Lyons promised to release body cam footage of enforcement in Minneapolis as well. But Lyons also said that he would not ask his officers to remove their face coverings. Both Scott and Lyons said that that could result in doxing for their officers. Republicans generally are still opposed to mandating that officers remove their face masks.MARTIN: OK, so the two sides, the Republicans and Democrats, do seem to agree about body cameras, at least the importance of body cameras. So were there any other areas where the two parties seem to be on the same page about what has been happening and what should happen next?BUSTILLO: Both Democrats and Republicans suggested ICE may have gone too far in recent actions. For example, one Republican, Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, said he believed, quote, \"roving patrols\" should be done at the border rather than in major cities of the United States. Ending these, quote, \"roving patrols\" is something Democrats also want. McCaul also applauded the leadership changes in Minneapolis, which removed border patrol commander Greg Bovino and sent in White House Border Czar Tom Homan to lead on-the-ground operations there. McCaul said this was, quote, \"returning to the original mission of ICE.\"MARTIN: OK. So at least one Republican seems to have some sort of alignment with the Democrats on these issues. So there is this funding deadline on Friday for the Department of Homeland Security. What could happen in the next few days?BUSTILLO: Well, all three are scheduled to be back on Capitol Hill on Thursday to do it all over again but this time before the Senate. I'm going to continue to keep an eye on what Republicans are asking for and how far apart the two parties are in their concerns. But if they can't come to an agreement, parts of DHS may see their funding slow down. Now, this would be particularly things like the Transportation Security Administration or disaster response. Now, border patrol and ICE got that infusion of cash last summer from Congress, so they can continue to dip into that and work and get paid, even if there is a shutdown to the agency.MARTIN: That is NPR's immigration policy correspondent Ximena Bustillo. Ximena, thank you.BUSTILLO: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

On Tuesday, 18 Democratic governors also announced they would boycott a traditional dinner at the White House.   \"If the reports are true that not all governors are invited to these events, which have historically been productive and bipartisan opportunities for collaboration, we will not be attending the White House dinner this year,\" the Democrats wrote. \"Democratic governors remain united and will never stop fighting to protect and make life better for people in our states.\"   \n   Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican who chairs the NGA, told fellow governors in a letter on Monday that the White House intended to limit invitations to the association's annual business meeting, scheduled for Feb. 20, to Republican governors only.   \"Because NGA's mission is to represent all 55 governors, the Association is no longer serving as the facilitator for that event, and it is no longer included in our official program,\" Stitt wrote in the letter, which was obtained by The Associated Press.   The governors' group, which is scheduled to meet from Feb. 19-21, is one of the few remaining venues where political leaders from both major parties gather to discuss the top issues facing their communities. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday that Trump has \"discretion to invite anyone he wants to the White House.\"   \"It's the people's house,\" she said. \"It's also the president's home, so he can invite whomever he wants to dinners and events here at the White House.\"   Representatives for Sitt and the NGA didn't comment on the letter. Brandon Tatum, the NGA's CEO, said in a statement last week that the White House meeting is an \"important tradition\" and said the organization was \"disappointed in the administration's decision to make it a partisan occasion this year.\"   \n   In his letter to other governors, Stitt encouraged the group to unite around common goals.   \"We cannot allow one divisive action to achieve its goal of dividing us,\" he wrote. \"The solution is not to respond in kind, but to rise above and to remain focused on our shared duty to the people we serve. America's governors have always been models of pragmatic leadership, and that example is most important when Washington grows distracted by politics.\"   Signs of partisan tensions emerged at the White House meeting last year, when Trump and Maine's Gov. Janet Mills traded barbs.   \n   Trump singled out the Democratic governor over his push to bar transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women's sports, threatening to withhold federal funding from the state if she did not comply. Mills responded, \"We'll see you in court.\"   Trump then predicted that Mills' political career would be over for opposing the order. She is now running for U.S. Senate.   The back-and-forth had a lasting impact on last year's conference and some Democratic governors did not renew their dues last year to the bipartisan group.\n",

    "body": "\n      The secretary of Veterans Affairs testified before a house committee today for just the second time during the Trump administration, to explain a national plan to drastically streamline VA bureaucracy.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  The secretary of Veterans Affairs appeared before a House committee today to explain a national reorganization plan to streamline its bureaucracy. This is a significant issue, considering the VA is the second largest in the federal government, after the Pentagon, in terms of scale. Lawmakers had questions, and so did NPR's Quil Lawrence, who covers veterans and the VA and is on the line now. Hey, Quil.QUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE: Hello.DETROW: What is the goal of this reorganization?LAWRENCE: Well, the VA is the largest health care network in the U.S., and the stated goal is to make the VA more - sort of more uniform across the board and have fewer big bosses. They want to cut the regional bosses that divide up the country from 18 down to five. But there's a lack of trust here, and Democrats say a lack of transparency. They see VA pushing toward spending more money or - on paying for private care outside the VA system while neglecting these chronic medical staff shortages at VA. And it got heated, like when California Democrat Mark Takano asked if this was all just a push to gut the VA workforce. He and VA Secretary Doug Collins had this exchange.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DOUG COLLINS: When I came before this committee last year, we were discussing an overall reduction in force across the government as a whole. At that point, as I told you in this committee, that we were - that our target would have been 83,000.MARK TAKANO: So...COLLINS: We ended up with about 30 - you either want an answer, or you don't.TAKANO: Is that a yes or a no?COLLINS: You either want an answer - I don't know the answer (ph).TAKANO: It's a yes or no question.COLLINS: I don't give yes-noes, and you know that.LAWRENCE: So as you can hear, it got kind of spicy. But the baseline here is that the VA's proposing maybe the most significant reorganization in at least 30 years and being kind of tight-lipped about what exactly they're going to do.DETROW: When we talked to you about this in January, you mentioned the VA-mandated reports that had not been released, including about prevention of veterans' suicide. Has that report now been released?LAWRENCE: Yes. It was months late - came out last week. Essentially, there has been no change in the veterans' suicide rate, really. It's still around 17 per day, which is tragic. But the VA is doing a pretty good job compared with the civilian sort of improvement of prevention of suicide rate. But this report, it was just - the first volume was just six pages of text, and last year's report was 38 pages, with graphs and charts and much more accessible information. I mean, some of the things that were missing, for example, following a Trump administration policy of not really discussing diversity, is there was less info about what populations are at higher risk, like by race and age, gender, sexuality. Experts say that you want to know - if you want to try and prevent suicide, you need to know which groups are most at risk. And they need that information.DETROW: And another report that you've been trying to keep tabs on is one about homelessness among veterans. Any information about that?LAWRENCE: No, and that's actually officially put out by HUD, but the VA has a hand, and they usually have it by November. It's not out yet. And there's been a real lack of information around the Trump administration's signature effort on this - an executive order that they were going to create a 6,000-bed facility in West LA on the VA campus out there. Initially, that made veterans' advocates in LA very happy. They've got the most homeless vets in the country out there. But there really hasn't been much information at all since then - no funding requests. And vets' advocates are worried. They say when they're not consulted, things don't always work out so well.I've covered six VA secretaries over five administrations now, and I think I can say this is the least access to the press and to Congress and veterans' groups. Half of the hearing today was just Democratic Congress members asking on camera for details that they said they'd requested in writing sometime last year.DETROW: That is NPR's Quil Lawrence. Thank you so much.LAWRENCE: Thank you.DETROW: And if you or someone you know may be considering suicide or is in crisis, call or text 988 to reach out to the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. Press one if you're a veteran.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Attorney General Pam Bondi testified on Capitol Hill Wednesday before House lawmakers in a frequently combative hearing.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Attorney General Pam Bondi testified on Capitol Hill today before members of the House. The hearing often turned combative as Democrats pressed Bondi on several issues, including the Jeffrey Epstein files and the Justice Department's targeting of President Trump's perceived enemies. NPR justice correspondent Ryan Lucas was watching the whole thing and joins us now. Hi, Ryan.RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Hi there.CHANG: OK, can we first talk about the tone of this hearing? What did you make of the tone?LUCAS: Well, look, I have watched a lot of congressional hearings. This one was really something else.CHANG: Yeah.LUCAS: It was almost like two different hearings rolled into one. And by that I mean, Bondi responded very differently, with a few exceptions, to questions from Republicans compared to how she responded to Democrats. With Republicans, she was friendly. She addressed the actual question. With Democrats, she was more often than not combative. She tried to change the subject, or she attacked the lawmaker directly. Democrats grew very frustrated at times. Here's one exchange between Bondi and the panel's top Democrat, Maryland's Jamie Raskin.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JAMIE RASKIN: You can let her filibuster all day long, but not on our watch, not on our time. No way. And I told you about that, Attorney General, before you started.PAM BONDI: You don't tell me anything, you washed up loser lawyer.RASKIN: Yeah, oh, I did tell you because we saw what you did in the Senate.BONDI: Not even a lawyer.CHANG: Wow.LUCAS: For the record, Raskin was a constitutional law professor. Georgia Democrat Hank Johnson described Bondi's testimony as a sort of Jekyll and Hyde act. He said she was nice to Republicans and then turned into Hyde on Democrats. Bondi did go after one Republican, though. That was Kentucky's Thomas Massie. And he's the Republican who helped spearhead the effort to get the Epstein files released.CHANG: Exactly. OK, so the Epstein files, one of the main topics during the hearing. Now, we know the Justice Department released more than 3.5 million records from investigations into Epstein. What more did lawmakers want to know from that document dump?LUCAS: Well, look, this has been a political weakness for the Trump administration, and so Democrats certainly were eager to focus on it today. Several times, Democrats, in fact, noted that there was a group of women in the hearing room who were victims of Epstein. At one point - several points, actually - they were even asked to stand up. But Democrats criticized the department for failing to produce all of the files by the deadline required by law.They also criticized the numerous problems that have been found with the redactions that the Justice Department made to the files. That includes redacting the names of Epstein's suspected coconspirators, and in some instances, not redacting the names or photos of victims. Here's how Raskin summed things up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RASKIN: You acted with some mixture of staggering incompetence, cold indifference and jaded cruelty towards more than 1,000 victims raped, abused and trafficked. This performance screams cover-up.CHANG: And how did Bondi respond to questions about DOJ's handling of the files?LUCAS: Well, more often than not, she went on the attack. Here, for example, is how she responded to Thomas Massie when he pressed her about the redactions.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BONDI: This guy has Trump derangement syndrome. He needs to - you're a failed politician.LUCAS: That's a Republican who was asking those questions. On several other occasions, Bondi accused lawmakers of theatrics, or she tried to change the subject. At one point, though, she did try to defend the department's handling of the files. She said the department worked hard to do the proper redactions, and she said they've taken action to address problems with those potential problems when they were brought to the department's attention.CHANG: OK, switching gears a little bit to another topic that has been a big deal during Bondi's tenure as attorney general. And that is the Justice Department's targeting of Trump's political opponents. How did that come up in the hearing today?LUCAS: Right. Well, Bondi said that ending the purported weaponization of the department was a major accomplishment of hers. Republicans agreed. Democrats, unsurprisingly, did not. And they pointed to a long list of the president's perceived enemies who have been investigated or prosecuted by the Justice Department. That includes former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and six Democratic lawmakers, who were part of a video urging U.S. military members not to follow unlawful orders.Several of these cases have faced challenges. The prosecutions against Comey and James were tossed by a court. And a grand jury just yesterday refused to indict the Democratic lawmakers in connection with the unlawful orders video.CHANG: That is NPR's Ryan Lucas.

The National Governors Association meets in Washington, D.C., every year with this year's meeting scheduled for next week. The traditionally bipartisan event is an opportunity for governors to meet with the president and discuss issues affecting their constituents. It's usually followed by a formal dinner. This year, the Trump Administration only invited Republicans to the meeting and disinvited some Democratic governors from the formal dinner scheduled to follow.   \n   Maryland Governor Wes Moore is one of the two disinvited governors. Moore said the decision sent the same message as the president's recent refusal to apologize for posting a racist meme of the Obamas.   \"This message of disrespect — of his own personal feelings of supremacy — I think, are things that are just deeply unneeded reminders of just how unstable his leadership continues to be,\" Moore said.   White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt addressed the exclusions at a press briefing on Tuesday.   \"It's the people's house,\" Leavitt said. \"It's also the president's home. And so he can invite whomever he wants to dinners and events here at the White House.\"   \n   Democratic leaders who were invited to the dinner have said they will skip the dinner. The National Governors Association said it won't \"facilitate\" events that don't include all governors, including next week's dinner.   Moore discussed the dinner and his state's redistricting with NPR's Michel Martin. This interview occurred before other Democratic leaders said they would skip the dinner and before Leavitt's press briefing.

They include the leaders of organizations that address digital hate and a former European Union commissioner who clashed with tech billionaire Elon Musk over broadcasting an online interview with Donald Trump.   Rubio's statement said they advanced foreign government censorship campaigns against Americans and U.S. companies, which he said created \"potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences\" for the U.S.   The action to bar them from the U.S. is part of a Trump administration campaign against foreign influence over online speech, using immigration law rather than platform regulations or sanctions.   The five Europeans named by Rogers are: Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate; Josephine Ballon and Anna-Lena von Hodenberg, leaders of HateAid, a German organization; Clare Melford, who runs the Global Disinformation Index; and former EU Commissioner Thierry Breton, who was responsible for digital affairs.   Rogers in her post on X called Breton, a French business executive and former finance minister, the \"mastermind\" behind the EU's Digital Services Act, which imposes a set of strict requirements designed to keep internet users safe online. This includes flagging harmful or illegal content like hate speech.   \n   She referred to Breton warning Musk of a possible \"amplification of harmful content\" by broadcasting his livestream interview with Trump in August 2024 when he was running for president.   Breton responded Tuesday on X by noting that all 27 EU members voted for the Digital Services Act in 2022. \"To our American friends: 'Censorship isn't where you think it is,'\" he wrote.   French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said France condemns the visa restrictions on Breton and the four others. Also posting on X, he said the DSA was adopted to ensure that \"what is illegal offline is also illegal online.\" He said it \"has absolutely no extraterritorial reach and in no way concerns the United States.\"   \n   Most Europeans are covered by the Visa Waiver Program, which means they don't necessarily need visas to come into the country. They do, however, need to complete an online application prior to arrival under a system run by the Department of Homeland Security, so it is possible that at least some of these five people have been flagged to DHS, a U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss details not publicly released.   Other visa restriction policies were announced this year, along with bans targeting foreign visitors from certain African and Middle Eastern countries and the Palestinian Authority. Visitors from some countries could be required to post a financial bond when applying for a visa.\n",

The outcome may determine which party controls the House after midterms.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  One of the big topics in politics this year has been redistricting. President Trump set off a race to reshape the voting map before next year's congressional elections. He's been pushing Republican lawmakers across the country to redistrict so their party can hold on to the House. That is key to his MAGA agenda. For a look at where it all stands, we're joined now by Andrew Schneider of Houston Public Media. Hi there.ANDREW SCHNEIDER, BYLINE: Hello.SUMMERS: So, Andrew, I want to get into the big picture, but let's start where you are in Texas. How did this all first start there?SCHNEIDER: Well, in the summer, President Trump called on Texas Republicans to redraw the voting lines to help the GOP win five more House seats. There's a heavily Republican legislature, a Republican governor, Greg Abbott. They were both eager to do it. You might remember Democratic lawmakers even left the state for two weeks to delay the vote, but eventually it passed, and the race was on. California Democrats countered. They held a special election last month where voters approved redistricting that could flip five seats there for Democrats. Republicans in North Carolina and Missouri also did it to favor their party. States normally redistrict at the start of the decade when the census comes in and shows how many seats each state gets based on their population. And experts we've talked with say the country hasn't seen a year with this much mid-decade redistricting since the 1970s, when the courts set out the rules for how it works now.SUMMERS: Can we say who's ahead at this point?SCHNEIDER: Well, so far, the GOP states, prompted by Trump, have used redistricting to get an advantage in flipping seven seats held by the Democrats. Then in Ohio, they had to redistrict this year because of a state law there. That could help them win two. So that's nine seats tilted towards the Republicans. Now, to the Democrats, they did those five in California. And in Utah, a court ordered a new map. That could help Democrats win a seat there. So that's six tilted towards the Democrats versus nine towards the Republicans. But something surprising has happened this month. The heavily Republican Indiana legislature rejected Trump's redistricting, even after Trump threatened a campaign against Republicans who didn't support it. Lawmakers in Kansas are also hesitating to do it.SUMMERS: Andrew, why would states oppose joining the scramble?SCHNEIDER: Well, the word many use for this is gerrymandering, where politicians are shifting votes around explicitly to help their party. Now, I spoke with Justin Levitt at Loyola Marymount University's Loyola Law School. He's a voting rights expert and an adviser on them in the Biden administration, and he says it's harmful.JUSTIN LEVITT: You take away people's ability to give a thumbs up or thumbs down on how their representatives have performed. And the more frequently you do that, the more you disconnect elected representatives from the people that they represent, the more you sever the relationship between we the people and our elected representatives. That's not a good thing for any of us.SCHNEIDER: Now, redistricting can also be risky because if a party goes for too many seats, it can actually make safe ones they hold more competitive, like swing districts. You don't know how people will actually vote. For example, in Texas, a lot of Latinos voted for Trump in 2024, and Republicans drew the lines based on that, but some Latinos might turn back to the Democrats in 2026.SUMMERS: Yeah, I mean, that's a fair point. We're not going to know how any of this turns out until people actually vote next November. Looking ahead, what could be coming up in 2026?SCHNEIDER: Well, Democrats in Virginia and Maryland are looking at redistricting to help their party, and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis says his state will try to tip seats towards the GOP. And there's a voting rights case before the U.S. Supreme Court that could allow more Republican states to redistrict. And like you said, it comes down to actual votes in November. So let's say Republicans gain an edge in a few seats through redistricting. That won't matter if there's a wave election with one party sweeping the vote around the country. But right now, Republicans only hold the House by a few seats. So if the midterms are close, that could make all the difference.SUMMERS: Andrew Schneider of Houston Public Media, thanks so much.SCHNEIDER: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Steve Inskeep speaks with Democratic Congressman Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, who is sponsoring legislation to prohibit President Trump from using federal dollars to wage war with Venezuela.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  All right. We heard Quil mention Iraq and comparisons to Iraq. Our next guest served four tours in the U.S. military in Iraq. Democratic Congressman Seth Moulton of Massachusetts is on the line. Good morning.SETH MOULTON: Good morning, Steve.INSKEEP: What do you think the president's goal is in Venezuela?MOULTON: Well, we really don't know. It seems to be regime change, something that he has said repeatedly he's against. He's against regime change wars, and yet he seems to be absolutely obsessed with Maduro to the point where he's putting a lot of U.S. service members' lives in potential danger here, trying to push him out of power, a country that's not even a national security risk to the United States.INSKEEP: A couple of things to follow up on there. First, I can name one data point. In the recent Vanity Fair interview with Susie Wiles, the chief of staff, it got attention for other things. But there is a description of a meeting with the president on November 4 of this year, and part of the agenda was, quote, \"forcing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from power.\" So we don't have a public statement by the president, but we have a description of a meeting in which this is what he wants to talk about.MOULTON: Well, it sounds like Iraq 2.0 to me.INSKEEP: What do you mean?MOULTON: You know, a president who's obsessed with just getting a foreign leader out of power and assembling or concocting a rationale to do so. Of course, we had faulty intelligence about weapons of mass destruction that draw - drew us into Iraq. In this case, the president has literally created weapons of mass destruction by declaring fentanyl a weapon of mass destruction and thereby trying to justify what he wants to do here.INSKEEP: Let me follow up on another thing you said. You said Venezuela is not a national security threat to the United States. I get it in the sense that we're not worried about Venezuela's military, but it would not be hard to find ways that Venezuela's misgovernment has harmed the United States. It seems to have created a massive refugee crisis. A lot of the refugees have ended up in the United States with huge social and also political effects, even damage for your party. Why is that not a national security threat?MOULTON: Well, by that rationale, you could invade half the countries in the world. The point is that this is about priorities, and China is the major national security threat to the United States of America. And by assembling this huge armada, as Trump describes it, he's taking pressure off China, which makes it more likely they'll start a war.INSKEEP: What do you mean by taking pressure off China? Just because we're distracted?MOULTON: That's exactly right. And it's a concern I've heard echoed from people who are focused on China throughout the globe, including talking to military commanders whose job is it is every single day to deter and prevent China from starting a war in the Pacific that could literally become World War III. Not to mention that Putin seems very intent on invading other countries in Europe. We got to keep pressure on Putin so that American troops don't get involved in a war there. So there are a lot of places in the world where our presence is trying to deter and prevent wars. Trump seems intent on starting a war right to our south.INSKEEP: I want people to know that you've introduced legislation that blocks the president from using federal dollars to engage in military action in Venezuela. But as you know very well, that goes nowhere without Republican support. Do you have any sense that any of your Republican colleagues are concerned?MOULTON: A lot of Republican colleagues are concerned. A lot of them have been publicly against regime change wars, against what happened in Iraq. But they're all just scared of Trump. I mean, this is political cowardice at its peak, and, of course, it starts with Speaker Johnson, whose job is to actually follow the Constitution and have a vote on going to war in Congress because that's our constitutional responsibility. Instead, he just does whatever Trump wants, which in this case, seems to be supporting his efforts to start a new war.INSKEEP: When you hear analysts look at the various moves of the administration and see a new foreign policy orientation, which, in a sense, is an old foreign policy orientation, where the United States focuses on the Western Hemisphere and tries further to dominate the Western Hemisphere even more than the U.S. already has, while perhaps leaving a little more space for Russia and China to do what they want in their areas of the world, that is one way that Trump's foreign policy has been perceived. Do you think that's correct and do you think that's wise?MOULTON: It's wrong and it's dumb. And that's why every administration, including Trump's first administration, had a totally different national security policy that recognized that the world is a complicated and interconnected place, and China may seem far away. Russia may seem far away, but they present real threats to us, to our allies and to our American service members. So rather than push American service members into a war we don't need in Venezuela, he's taking - he's not doing enough to prevent wars where our adversaries actually really want to start them. So this is a massive change in policy from what previous Democratic and Republican administrations have done.INSKEEP: Congressman Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, thanks very much for your time. Good to talk with you again.MOULTON: Thank you so much, Steve.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Trump has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection to Epstein though he had a well-documented friendship with the disgraced financier in the 1980s, '90s, and 2000s. This latest tranche gives more details on Trump's relationship with Epstein, including documentation of Trump flying on Epstein's private jet in the 1990s. Epstein's relationship with powerful politicians and businessmen – and in particular, to what degree Trump may have been aware of Epstein's crimes – has been a central question as the DOJ has continued to release the files.   \n   Congress required the Justice Department to make all files available by last Friday. The department has taken a piecemeal approach to releasing the files, which are expected to contain hundreds of thousands of pages.   In a Tuesday-morning social media post, the department said that the latest batch contains nearly 30,000 pages, adding that it includes \"untrue or sensationalist claims\" about Trump. When asked for comment on the newest files, the White House referred NPR to the Justice Department statement.   The latest set of files includes a 2020 email from an unidentified federal prosecutor saying that \"Donald Trump traveled on Epstein's private jet many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware).\"   The prosecutor said Trump was listed as a passenger on at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996, including four on which Ghislaine Maxwell – Epstein's co-conspirator and herself a convicted sex offender – was also a passenger. The prosecutor also wrote that one flight included only Trump, Epstein, and a 20-year-old whose name was redacted.   Flight logs included in the latest files show that Trump's flights were primarily domestic, between New Jersey, Palm Beach, and Washington, D.C.   President Trump has yet to respond directly to the latest document dump, but on Monday told reporters that he thinks the Epstein files are a distraction, and that they unfairly implicate innocent people.   \n   \"What this whole thing is with Epstein is a way of trying to deflect from the tremendous success that the Republican Party has,\" Trump said. \"A lot of people are very angry that pictures are being released of other people that really had nothing to do with Epstein, but they're in a picture with him because he was at a party. And you ruin a reputation of somebody.\"   The files also include a 2019 letter supposedly sent by Epstein to convicted sex offender Larry Nassar — the former U.S. gymnastics team doctor. But since releasing the letter, the Justice Department has said it is a fake.   The letter, which says Epstein sent it from a correctional facility in Manhattan, says that \"our president shares our love of young, nubile girls.\" A stamp on the letter says it was returned to sender.    The Justice Department posted on social media there were some inconsistencies with the letter, such as a Virginia postmark instead of a New York postmark and the return address listing the wrong jail for Epstein. After initially saying Tuesday they were \"looking into the validity\" of the letter, the DOJ said the FBI had concluded it was a \"fake.\"   \"This fake letter serves as a reminder that just because a document is released by the Department of Justice does not make the allegations or claims within the document factual. Nevertheless, the DOJ will continue to release all material required by law,\" the Justice Department said.    The FBI declined to comment.   Another document included is a 2021 subpoena to Trump's Mar-a-Lago club for employment records during the investigation into Maxwell.   NPR's Luke Garrett contributed reporting.\n",

A video posted by U.S. Southern Command shows splashes of water near one side of the boat. After a second salvo, the rear of the boat catches fire. More splashes engulf the craft and the fire grows. In the final second of the video, the vessel can be seen adrift with a large patch of fire alongside it.   \n   Earlier videos of U.S. boat strikes showed vessels suddenly exploding, suggesting missile strikes. Some strike videos even had visible rocket-like projectiles coming down on the boats.   \n   The Trump administration has said the strikes were meant to stop the flow of drugs into the U.S. and increase pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.   At least 105 people have been killed in 29 known strikes since early September. The strikes have faced scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and human rights activists, who say the administration has offered scant evidence that its targets are indeed drug smugglers and say the fatal strikes amount to extrajudicial killings.   Meanwhile, the U.S. Coast Guard has stepped up efforts to interdict oil tankers in the Caribbean Sea as part of the Trump administration's escalating campaign against Maduro.\n",

The Trump administration and Congress are in the process of overhauling everything from how much Americans can borrow to how quickly they have to pay it back.   Here's what to know as we head into a new year:   President Biden's SAVE Plan is ending   The U.S. Department of Education announced in early December that it had reached a proposed settlement agreement to end the popular, yet controversial Biden-era student loan repayment plan known as SAVE.   \n   The Saving on a Valuable Education Plan \"was the most affordable, generous and flexible plan for millions of student loan borrowers,\" says Persis Yu of the liberal advocacy group Protect Borrowers.   But it was so affordable, generous and flexible – with its fast-tracked loan forgiveness and monthly payments as low as $0 for low-income borrowers – that Republican state attorneys general sued the Biden administration for exceeding its authority.   Legal challenges put SAVE borrowers in limbo for months, during which they were not required to make payments on their loans. Interest began accruing in August.   This new agreement, pending court approval, would end the long legal battle by ending SAVE itself.   \"The law is clear: if you take out a loan, you must pay it back,\" Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement announcing the proposed agreement. \"American taxpayers can now rest assured they will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for illegal and irresponsible student loan policies.\"   Under the agreement, the Education Department would commit to moving the roughly 7 million borrowers still enrolled in SAVE into other repayment plans – though some of those plans are also in flux.   Whether you blame Biden or Republicans for SAVE's downfall, Betsy Mayotte, founder of the Institute of Student Loan Advisors (TISLA), says it puts borrowers in a real bind.   \n   \"People that made other financial decisions based on what they thought their payment was gonna be on the SAVE plan – they're in trouble,\" Mayotte says. \"A payment plan has never been challenged in court and has never been pulled out from existing borrowers.\"   Now, Mayotte says, those roughly 7 million SAVE borrowers will have to change plans and find a way to afford what will likely be higher monthly payments.   Complications for borrowers working toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness   Liz Kilty, an oncology nurse in Portland, Ore., has been on the SAVE plan from the start.   \"As soon as SAVE was an option, I signed up for it,\" says Kilty, who works in a public hospital and wanted to keep her monthly payments reasonably low on her way toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF).   Since 2007, PSLF has offered a path for borrowers who work in public service – including teaching, nursing and policing – to have their loan balances erased after 10 years on the job.   \n   Kilty has $36,000 in debt remaining, and 15 payments to go before she can qualify for loan forgiveness.   But SAVE's legal troubles have slowed her down: Since her payments were frozen, so too was any progress she could make toward forgiveness. \"I was like, 'Are you kidding me?' Like, 'This is the year I'm going to be done, and this is the year that they're going to screw things up?' I've been waiting a decade [for forgiveness] and now things could go awry, and you're just helpless.\"   Earlier this month, Kilty applied for the PSLF Buyback, to make her remaining 15 payments in one lump sum and finally qualify to have the remainder forgiven.   One reason PSLF is still an option for Kilty and other borrowers is because it was created by Congress.   The Trump administration doesn't have the authority to stop PSLF – but it has worked to change the rules. Effective July 1, 2026, the department says it will deny loan forgiveness to workers whose government or nonprofit employers engage in activities with a \"substantial illegal purpose.\" The job of defining \"substantial illegal purpose\" will fall not to the courts but to the education secretary.   \n   In November, the cities of Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and Albuquerque, N.M., sued the Trump administration over those PSLF changes.   The complaint argued that a city or county government's resistance to the administration's immigration actions, for example, could lead the secretary to exclude that government's public workers – including a local nurse, like Kilty – from loan forgiveness.   Repayment plans are changing    SAVE aside, trying to change repayment plans in 2026 is about to get weird.   \n   That's because, in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), Republicans also decided to gradually shut down two other popular, more affordable plans: Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) and Pay As You Earn (PAYE). Both base payments on a borrower's income, and both will end in mid-2028.   Current borrowers can still, technically, enroll in these plans – for now. Another income-adjusted plan to consider – one that's not going anywhere – is Income-Based Repayment (IBR).   You can find a handy list of all of these plans and compare your monthly payments on the Education Department's Loan Simulator.   Congress also used the OBBBA to create two new repayment plans, beginning on July 1, 2026, that, for new borrowers, will replace all of the current options.   1. The standard plan   Under this new standard plan, new borrowers would agree to a repayment window between 10 and 25 years, depending on the size of their debt, with what they owe being divided up, along with interest, into equal monthly payments, like a home mortgage.   Under this plan, borrowers with larger debts would qualify for a longer repayment period.   2. The Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP)    For borrowers worried they don't earn enough to cover the standard plan's rigid monthly payments, Republicans created the RAP for future and current borrowers alike.   Payments would, for the most part, be based on borrowers' total adjusted gross income (AGI), and the department will waive any interest that is left after a borrower makes their monthly payment. The result: Borrowers in good standing will no longer see their loans grow.   \n   In fact, Republicans want to make sure borrowers see their balances go down every month. For those whose monthly payments are less than $50, the government would match whatever they do pay and apply it toward the principal.   While other plans offer forgiveness of remaining debts after 20 or 25 years, the RAP would delay that to 30 years. That's a big difference, says Preston Cooper, who studies student loan policy at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute (AEI).   Borrowers with typical levels of debt \"and typical incomes for their degree level are almost always gonna pay off well before they hit that 30-year mark,\" Cooper says. \"So if you're going into RAP, I wouldn't be thinking about forgiveness because you're probably gonna pay it off.\"   Beginning July 1, 2026, new loans will be subject to new borrowing limits   We've covered big changes to repayment, but there are also big changes to how much graduate students can borrow in the first place. (Undergraduates won't see any changes.)   New limits will make it harder for lower- and middle-income borrowers to attend pricier graduate schools. Republicans are shutting down the current grad PLUS program, which allows students to borrow up to the cost of their degree.   \"Colleges could simply raise the price, pass the cost on to students, and the federal government would be required to write a check through the federal student loan program, \" Cooper says. \"That system was completely untenable, and I very much understand why Congress elected to end it.\"    After July 1, grad students' borrowing will be capped at $20,500 a year. Ideally, Cooper says, this will push some schools to lower their prices.   Until they do, though, Persis Yu, with Protect Borrowers, says many students will face a serious funding gap between their federal loans and the actual cost of graduate school.   \"Students are gonna have to make up that gap with some other type of funding,\" Yu says, \"and many students are gonna have to turn to the private student loan market.\"   \n   Mayotte, at TISLA, says she thinks some schools will abandon certain degree programs.   \"I got a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach when this law went through because I don't think it's gonna lower the cost of education like members of Congress think that it might,\" Mayotte says.   Borrowers working toward a professional graduate degree (think medicine or law) will have their borrowing capped at $50,000 a year.   Parents and caregivers who use parent PLUS loans to help students pay for college will also see new loan limits. They will be capped at $65,000 per child.   \"The precipice of a default cliff\"   Amidst all this change, data shows that millions of borrowers are struggling to keep up with their payments.   Preston Cooper at AEI recently published an analysis of the latest federal student loan data, and the results were sobering: 5.5 million borrowers in default, another 3.7 million more than 270 days late on their payments and 2.7 million in the early stages of delinquency.   \n   \"We've got about 12 million borrowers right now who are either delinquent on their loans or in default,\" Cooper says.   That's more than 1 in 4 federal student loan borrowers – a crisis raising bipartisan alarm.   Persis Yu, of Protect Borrowers, warns America is at \"the precipice of a default cliff.\"   Mayotte adds, \"I really do think we're headed for historic default rates, for a while.\"   Meanwhile, the Education Department confirmed it plans to resume wage garnishment for defaulted borrowers in early 2026.   And so, heading into 2026, the big question hanging over the Trump administration and Congressional Republicans is: Can all the changes they've made help bring these borrowers back into good standing? Or will the default numbers snowball into an avalanche?   Edited by: Nicole CohenVisual design and development by: LA Johnson \n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Steve Inskeep speaks with veteran Republican strategist Marc Short about the current state of the GOP and its emerging leaders.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  The chairman of the board at Mike Pence's think tank is his longtime adviser, Marc Short, who's on the line. Marc, good morning.MARC SHORT: Good morning, Steve. Thank you for having me today.INSKEEP: I'm glad you're with us. Are you actively recruiting Heritage Foundation staff?SHORT: You know, Steve, what happened in this case is that the leaders of those three divisions within Heritage that you just mentioned, the legal center, the Center for Data Analysis and the Free Enterprise Center, all approached us. And I think it's in part because they've seen Advancing American Freedom stand firm on conservative principles, which is a role that Heritage used to play. And I think in the absence of Heritage embracing big government populism, and I think most recently, sadly, perhaps even tolerating antisemitism, there was a desire to come back to a home where they could continue to advance true conservative policy. And so we're excited to add them. As your correspondent mentioned...INSKEEP: Yeah...SHORT: ...It nearly doubles the size of our organization. And I would imagine that hopefully there'll be more who want to be part of this team, too.INSKEEP: You just said big government populism. Will you define what you mean by that for people who aren't familiar?SHORT: Well, sure, I think that in the first Trump administration, President Trump was incredibly successful at adding a lot of new voters to the Republican Party. But he did it on the backbone of conservative policy. If you look at the First administration, there was obviously significant and historic tax relief and a deregulatory agenda, and a judicial effort that was looked at trying to limit the size and scope of government.INSKEEP: Yeah.SHORT: What you see today is basically now embracing state-owned enterprises, which is something that would be anathema to conservatives and something the whole conservative movement would have once upon a time spoken out against.INSKEEP: You're talking about...SHORT: And now additionally...INSKEEP: ...Things like saying that the government will take a stake in Intel and get profits from other businesses. That's what you're talking about, right?SHORT: Yeah, absolutely. Intel and Nvidia and in basically announcements of...INSKEEP: Oh, Nvidia. Yeah.SHORT: ...More even golden shares in things like the U.S. Steel acquisition. But additionally, you know, Steve, the entire trade agenda is one that basically picks winners and losers. By allowing those who have, you know, connections in lobbying to get exclusions for their companies and basically has central planners, I think, in the economy, trying to dictate who's going to win and who's going to lose. And I think that traditionally, conservatives have wanted basically a limited role of government in the economy and allowing the marketplace to thrive. And so I think those are some of the biggest challenges economically.INSKEEP: I...SHORT: And certainly, you know, I think when it comes to defense of Constitution, as well, I think there's a - there used to be, I think, a more limited role for judiciary than it appears to be today of wanting to pick winners and losers there as.INSKEEP: I guess we should note that Vice President Pence  - former Vice President Pence has also criticized the president's tariffs. But I want to ask about antisemitism, which you also mentioned. Kevin Roberts, the head of the Heritage Foundation, got a lot of criticism for appearing to defend Tucker Carlson, who, in turn, had interviewed Nick Fuentes, this famous antisemite. What is the proper approach to an influencer like Fuentes, who has a lot of followers in the conservative movement?SHORT: Yeah. I think there's a great question there, Steve, and that I think a lot of critics want to say, you know, it's not our job to have a cancel culture. That was something that the left was predominant at. And I think that at the same time, you can welcome debate, but also have a self-policing, you know, role that makes sure that ideas that are poisonous and hateful are those that are not really welcomed at the table. And, you know, back many, many years ago, there was a similar battle in the conservative movement when Bill Buckley spoke out against kind of the McCarthyism and what was, at the time, some rules of antisemitism. And so, you know, we've had these battles before, and I don't think it's exclusive to the right, Steve. I think that the left right now has a lot of battles confronting antisemitism also. But I think you want to have a marketplace that welcomes ideas, but also at the same time, when there are certain ideas that are so evil and we've been witnessed in history, I think you have to be careful that you're not embracing those.INSKEEP: Who do you see as emerging leaders of the Republican Party?SHORT: You know, I think our focus is less on trying to crown or ordain a person, and it's instead trying to hold firm to a set of ideas, Steve, and believing that that's the role of outside conservative groups. And it's not to become so enamored with any one individual that you follow them, regardless of the policies that they embrace. It's to hold them accountable to say, here's what conservatism is about.INSKEEP: Would you defend Mike Pence at all against that accusation that we heard earlier that he's just looking for a train back to relevance?SHORT: Oh. I mean, look, I think the reality is that there's a big reason why a lot of staff are coming to be a part of our organization. We can run steadily. The size of our budget continues to grow exponentially, and I think there's a hankering to have conservatism back. And I think that's what this is about.INSKEEP: Marc Short, former chief of staff to Vice President Pence and chairman of the board at his think tank. Thanks so much.SHORT: Thank you, Steve, for having me.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Kennedy, Jr., speaks during an event on prescription drug prices in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Friday, Dec. 19, 2025, in Washington.\n                \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Evan Vucci/AP\n    \n\n   \n   NEW YORK — A coalition of 19 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, its secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and its inspector general over a declaration that could complicate access to gender-affirming care for young people.   \n   The declaration issued last Thursday called treatments like puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries unsafe and ineffective for children and adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria, or the distress when someone's gender expression doesn't match their sex assigned at birth. It also warned doctors that they could be excluded from federal health programs like Medicare and Medicaid if they provide those types of care.   The declaration came as HHS also announced proposed rules meant to further curtail gender-affirming care for young people, although the lawsuit doesn't address those as they are not final.   \n   Tuesday's lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Eugene, Oregon, alleges that the declaration is inaccurate and unlawful and asks the court to block its enforcement. It's the latest in a series of clashes between an administration that's cracking down on transgender health care for children, arguing it can be harmful to them, and advocates who say the care is medically necessary and shouldn't be inhibited.   \"Secretary Kennedy cannot unilaterally change medical standards by posting a document online, and no one should lose access to medically necessary health care because their federal government tried to interfere in decisions that belong in doctors' offices,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led the lawsuit, said in a statement Tuesday.   \n   The lawsuit alleges that HHS's declaration seeks to coerce providers to stop providing gender-affirming care and circumvent legal requirements for policy changes. It says federal law requires the public to be given notice and an opportunity to comment before substantively changing health policy — neither of which, the suit says, was done before the declaration was issued.   A spokesperson for HHS declined to comment.   HHS's declaration based its conclusions on a peer-reviewed report that the department conducted earlier this year that urged greater reliance on behavioral therapy rather than broad gender-affirming care for youths with gender dysphoria.   \n   The report questioned standards for the treatment of transgender youth issued by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health and raised concerns that adolescents may be too young to give consent to life-changing treatments that could result in future infertility.   Major medical groups and those who treat transgender young people have sharply criticized the report as inaccurate, and most major U.S. medical organizations, including the American Medical Association, continue to oppose restrictions on transgender care and services for young people.   The declaration was announced as part of a multifaceted effort to limit gender-affirming health care for children and teenagers — and built on other Trump administration efforts to target the rights of transgender people nationwide.   \n   HHS on Thursday also unveiled two proposed federal rules — one to cut off federal Medicaid and Medicare funding from hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to children, and another to prohibit federal Medicaid dollars from being used for such procedures.   The proposals are not yet final or legally binding and must go through a lengthy rulemaking process and public comment before becoming permanent. But they will nonetheless likely further discourage health care providers from offering gender-affirming care to children.   Several major medical providers already have pulled back on gender-affirming care for young patients since Trump returned to office — even in states where the care is legal and protected by state law.   Medicaid programs in slightly less than half of states currently cover gender-affirming care. At least 27 states have adopted laws restricting or banning the care. The Supreme Court's recent decision upholding Tennessee's ban means most other state laws are likely to remain in place.   Joining James in Tuesday's lawsuit were Democratic attorneys general from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin, Washington and the District of Columbia. Pennsylvania's Democratic governor also joined.\n",

The gross domestic product — the broadest measure of the nation's economic activity — grew at an annual rate of 4.3% in the third quarter, much faster than the 3.8% expansion seen between April and June, according to the Commerce Department on Tuesday.   \n   Growth has picked up from the early months of 2025, when the U.S. economy actually shrank at an annual rate of 0.6% as President Trump prepared sweeping global tariffs.    The latest figures are already quite dated. Tuesday's report was originally due in late October but was disrupted by the historic government shutdown. And it now comes as polling increasingly finds Americans glum on President Trump's handling of the economy and the high cost of living.   Third-quarter data shows business and residential investment declining. Spending by state and local governments rose. The impacts of trade swings were more mixed in the latest report, compared to earlier in the year: imports of goods declined, while exports increased. Imports get subtracted from the government's measure of domestic economic activity, so they tend to depress GDP.    \n   Loading...\n   Americans continued to spend but are turning more cautious   Spending by consumers, who remain the key engine of the U.S. economy, increased in the third quarter, according to the Commerce report. People spent more on hospital and nursing home services, on prescription drugs and on \"information processing equipment,\" such as computer hardware, presumably as part of the AI boom.    Consumer spending has been resilient for much of the year; however, in recent polling, more and more people today are saying they're feeling down about their financial prospects. A new report on consumer confidence from the Conference Board on Tuesday found sentiment declining for the fifth month in a row, as Americans worry about inflation, the political environment and the future of the labor market.   Tuesday's GDP report also showed disposable personal income was flat in the quarter, as inflation continued to eat away at Americans' wages.   \n   'We're skating on past success because consumers have enjoyed a couple of consecutive years of strong wage gains,\" says Michael Zdinak, an economist with S&P Global Market Intelligence. \"Today's report shows that demand is strong and consumers are willing to spend money — if they're didn't have this sword of Damocles hanging over their head that, you know, AI is coming from their jobs or that mass layoffs are just right around the corner,\" he adds.   On average, workers' wages have been growing faster than prices. But those wage gains have slowed in recent months as the softening job market has chipped away at workers' bargaining power for higher pay. Wealthier shoppers have been propping up much of U.S. spending at stores and restaurants.    \n   Inflation has been cooling off notably, with consumer prices rising a modest 2.7% in November from a year earlier. Some food items have continued to drop in price, but not enough to offset the growing big costs, like rent, electricity and health insurance.     The latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll has found that only 36% of Americans approve of President Trump's handling of the economy, his worst mark in the six years that Marist has been asking the question.   NPR's Scott Horsley contributed to this report.\n",

The incoming administration shut down the app, which was created by the Biden administration to allow migrants to schedule appointments to gain entry into the United States.\n                \n                    John Moore/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        John Moore/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   More than 1.6 million immigrants have lost their legal status in the first 11 months of President Trump's presidency. The staggering number includes people who applied for and were accepted to come to the country on a wide variety of immigration parole, visa, asylum and temporary protected status programs. That number exceeds Philadelphia's entire population.   This is the largest effort to take away deportation protections for migrants who are in the country legally. Immigration advocates say it's very likely an undercount.   \"These were legal pathways. People did the thing the government asked them to do, and this government went and preemptively revoked that status,\" said Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us, an immigration advocacy organization that has been tracking the efforts to delegalize immigrants.   \n   \"There's nothing close to this. Like there's no president of either party who has said, 'Central to my effort is revoking the work authorization and legal status for millions of people.'\"   \n   Many of the immigrants who lost legal status have been in the country for years. Now, they fear what could happen should their immigration cases not process quickly enough. The administration has encouraged immigrants to leave the country as it gets rid of their legal authorization.   \"The American taxpayer will no longer bear the financial burden of unlawfully present aliens,\" U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said, in response to a request for comment about concerns that the administration is making more people deportable.    In another effort to eliminate existing legal pathways, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced last week that the Trump administration would be pausing the diversity visa lottery program. In a post on X, she said the man accused of carrying out a deadly shooting at Brown University — and of killing an MIT professor — came to the U.S. through the program in 2017 and was granted a green card. While the cancellation doesn't impact those already in the country, the lottery program faces an uncertain future going forward.   \n   The White House says scrapping prior legal pathways and protections is part of its goal.   \"The Trump administration has done more to limit migration, both illegal and legal, than any administration in history,\" Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said during a press conference this fall. She touted all the ways the administration has cut off these avenues, including by pausing and revoking visas.   \"Having a visa in the United States is not a right. It is a privilege and the secretary of state — if you are deemed contrary to our country's foreign national interests — has the right to revoke that privilege.\"   A look at canceled programs and permissions   Hours after being inaugurated, Trump signed an executive order slashing a program created by the Biden administration to temporarily allow the entrance of 530,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The decision to end the program was later upheld by the Supreme Court — paving the way for individuals to be eligible for deportation.   Most of the people who entered the U.S. under this humanitarian parole hail from Haiti. Migrants under the program have pushed against the narrative that they are abusing the system.   \n   Temporary protected status, or TPS, provides deportation protection and grants work permits to people from specific countries affected by war, natural disasters, political instability, or any other condition that makes the country unsafe for its nationals to return to. Each country's designation can last six to 18 months at the discretion of the secretary of homeland security.   Since January, the Homeland Security Department has ended TPS for 10 countries. Here is the breakdown, according to DHS, of how many people were affected:   Loading...\n   The agency moved forward with ending TPS for about 3,800 Syrians, though that effort is currently stalled in court. Lawsuits have also impacted the termination of Venezuela's TPS designation. While the program has been terminated, certain beneficiaries will keep their TPS through October 2026.   The Trump administration argues that parole programs like TPS are meant to be only temporary. But immigration advocates said that while the government can, and has, ended country-specific designations in the past, it typically must prove that conditions in the country have improved.   \n   Schulte, from FWD.us, points to recent comments from Trump denigrating the situation in countries like Afghanistan and Haiti, and actions against Venezuela, as evidence that the U.S. does not consider these countries particularly improved or stable.   With each cancellation, DHS has offered monetary incentives and a 60 days' notice to leave the country. DHS did not respond to questions about how many people have taken them up on the offer of a $1,000 cash payment.   There are several pending lawsuits challenging the terminations of their TPS, and some people may be able to apply for other avenues for protection against deportation.   \n   Eliminating CBP One, others   Another program that the Trump administration ended earlier this year is CBP One, a mobile app that allowed migrants to make appointments to seek asylum from inside the U.S.   From 2023 to January 2025, more than 936,000 people were allowed in the country. It's unknown exactly how many people entered the U.S. through the app and were still waiting on legal permissions when it was canceled.   In the spring, thousands of migrants who had entered the U.S. through the app and awaited asylum appointments received messages to leave. Many who entered with the app ended up getting detained in courthouses or in their neighborhoods.   \n   Grebi Suárez, a Venezuelan barber who entered the U.S. through CBP One in January right before Trump was inaugurated, told NPR that last week he finally received his work permit and Social Security number.   \"But I'm anxious and scared because some of my friends have received emails from the government telling them to self-deport,\" said Suárez, who was featured on an NPR story last year about his attempts to get to the U.S.   \n   The State Department has also assisted the administration's goals of canceling permissions to be in the U.S. This year, 85,000 visas of all categories, including more than 8,000 student visas, have been revoked, according to a State Department official. That is more than double the number the year before.   DUIs, assaults and theft are some of the top reasons why visas were revoked, together accounting for almost half of the revocations in the past year, the official said in a statement.   \"These are people who pose a direct threat to our communities' safety, and we do not want to have them in our country,\" the official said.   Earlier this month, the administration also moved forward with canceling the Family Reunification Parole of 14,000 people, mostly Central and South Americans. The program sought to make it easier for people with family-based petitions to be permitted to be in the U.S. while their immigration processes played out.   \n   Migrants brace for more cancellations in 2026   Several thousand more migrants are at risk of their programs ending next year.   Other TPS permissions that expire next year are for El Salvador, Lebanon, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. If their programs, along with Ukraine's, get canceled, the U.S. may have no one residing under such a temporary status for the first time since the program was created in 1990.   Ukrainians who came under the Uniting for Ukraine parole program have been concerned their program could be next in line for cancellation. TPS for Ukrainians, which allowed about 100,000 people to enter the U.S., also is set to expire next year unless the administration renews it.   \n   The Trump administration earlier this year paused the Uniting for Ukraine program and later resumed it. The pause affected thousands of Ukrainians, including Viktoriia Panova.   Her work permit expired in February, adding to the anxiety and uncertainty she's felt since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.   \"Ukrainians, we cannot create any plans for our lives because of this situation,\" Panova told NPR earlier this year. \"We cannot live a full life.\"\n",

Tim Walz pushed back on X, saying fraudsters are a serious issue that the state has spent years cracking down on but that this move is part of \"Trump's long game.\"   \"He's politicizing the issue to defund programs that help Minnesotans,\" Walz said.   \n   O'Neill referenced a right-wing influencer who posted a video Friday claiming he found that day care centers operated by Somali residents in Minneapolis had committed up to $100 million in fraud. O'Neill said he has demanded Walz submit an audit of these centers that includes attendance records, licenses, complaints, investigations and inspections.   \"We have turned off the money spigot and we are finding the fraud,\" O'Neill said.   The announcement comes one day after U.S. Homeland Security officials were in Minneapolis conducting a fraud investigation by going to unidentified businesses and questioning workers.   There have been years of investigations that included a $300 million pandemic food fraud scheme revolving around the nonprofit Feeding Our Future, for which 57 defendants in Minnesota have been convicted. Prosecutors said the organization was at the center of the country's largest COVID-19-related fraud scam, when defendants exploited a state-run, federally funded program meant to provide food for children.   A federal prosecutor alleged earlier this month that half or more of the roughly $18 billion in federal funds that supported 14 programs in Minnesota since 2018 may have been stolen. Most of the defendants in the child nutrition, housing services and autism program schemes are Somali Americans, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for Minnesota.   \n   O'Neill, who is serving as acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, also said in the social media post Tuesday that payments across the U.S. through the Administration for Children and Families, an agency within the U.S. Health and Human Services Department, will now require \"justification and a receipt or photo evidence\" before money is sent. They have also launched a fraud-reporting hotline and email address.   The Administration for Children and Families provides $185 million in child care funds annually to Minnesota, according to Assistant Secretary Alex Adams.   \n   \"That money should be helping 19,000 American children, including toddlers and infants,\" he said in a video posted on X. \"Any dollar stolen by fraudsters is stolen from those children.\"   Adams said he spoke Monday with the director of Minnesota's child care services office and she wasn't able to say \"with confidence whether those allegations of fraud are isolated or whether there's fraud stretching statewide.\"   Trump has criticized Walz's administration over the fraud cases, capitalizing on them to target the Somalia diaspora in the state, which has the largest Somali population in the U.S.   \n   Walz, the 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee, has said an audit due by late January should give a better picture of the extent of the fraud. He said his administration is taking aggressive action to prevent additional fraud. He has long defended how his administration responded.   Minnesota's most prominent Somali American, Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, has urged people not to blame an entire community for the actions of a relative few.\n",

And in his first term, he didn't really flex those muscles. But since returning to the White House, Trump has been on a remodeling spree.   \"I have two jobs,\" Trump said recently. Commander in chief is one, but his real passion appears to be the second. \"I have a construction job, which is really like relaxation for me because I have been doing it all my life.\"   There are many ways Trump has shaken things up in his first year back in office, including signing hundreds of executive orders and launching a global trade war. But somehow, he's also found the time to obsessively tweak decor and oversee several major renovations.   \n   During a recent dinner speech meant to salute Kennedy Center Honorees such as Gloria Gaynor and the band Kiss, Trump took a 9-minute detour to discuss his various renovations. He recounted asking someone whether he was a better builder or politician.   \"And they didn't know how to answer that question,\" Trump said with a laugh. \"I'm not sure how to answer it either, if you want to know the truth, but I actually get great relaxation out of fixing the White House and fixing the Kennedy Center.\"   He admitted this does take his time and attention, but insisted he can fit it all in because unlike other people, \"I don't really want to rest.\"   New projects   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The new sign outside of the \"John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts\" now includes \"The Donald J. Trump\" as seen on December 19, 2025 in Washington, DC.\n                \n                    Heather Diehl/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Heather Diehl/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   Since returning to office, Trump has bathed the Oval Office in gold, paved the Rose Garden, added giant flagpoles on the north and south lawn, weighed in on a restoration project at the Federal Reserve, replaced tile in the Lincoln Bathroom with marble, overseen a major overhaul of the Kennedy Center and even brought Trump-style luxury to a small passthrough at the White House known as the Palm Room.   In an interview with Laura Ingraham of Fox News, Trump explained that the old tile was cheap and broken. He replaced \"lanterns that were terrible\" with new chandeliers, and brought intense attention to every little detail.   \n   \"If you look at the air conditioner vent, it's book matched. Look at it,\" Trump said to Ingraham. \"I can do that because I know that, you know, it's even available that you could do that. Very few people can do it.\"   \n   Trump and members of his administration often refer to him as \"a builder\" and at a recent rally in North Carolina, Trump described himself as having strong opinions about the shape of the arms on chairs he put in his hotels. \"I am a very aesthetic person,\" he said.   That was also Trump's explanation for why he would be weighing in on the design of the new Navy battleships he was ordering up, the \"Trump class.\"   Trump even took time out from a speech to the United Nations General Assembly earlier this year to complain about long ago losing a contract to renovate the building.   \"They had massive cost overruns and spent between $2 and $4 billion on the building and did not even get the marble floors that I promised them,\" Trump said. \"You walk on Terraza, do you notice that?\"   Big changes   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Demolition work continues where the East Wing once stood at the White House on December 08, 2025 in Washington, DC.\n                \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   Much like his expansive use of executive power, Trump isn't slowing down or asking permission. Take his ballroom project. The entire East Wing of the White House was torn down in October to make way for it, even as images of excavators tearing into the building sparked public outcry. What started out over the summer as a $200 million project funded by private donors has now ballooned.   \"We're donating a building that's approximately $400 million,\" Trump shouted into a microphone at a recent Hanukkah celebration. \"I should do it for less. I will do it for less. But just in case I say 400. Otherwise, if I go $3 over, the press will say it costs more.\"   Many presidents have made small changes to personalize the White House. A swimming pool here, a basketball court there. The East Wing, West Wing and Truman balcony were all additions and all controversial at the time, says Kate Andersen Brower, author of The Residence about the staff who work at the White House.   \n   \"This is the most extreme, the biggest footprint, the most personal addition,\" said Brower.   Personal, she says, because it and all the other White House changes are so unmistakably matched to Trump's personal aesthetic.   \"This is about people 200 years from now knowing that he is president,\" said Brower. \"And it's going to be impossible to miss that ballroom.\"   Trump has said he has no plans to name the ballroom after himself.    But his name is now emblazoned on Kennedy Center, a performing arts center created by Congress as a memorial to the late President John F. Kennedy. A Democratic congresswoman who is an ex-officio member of the Kennedy Center board filed a lawsuit challenging the renaming of the memorial, calling the action \"unlawful\" because the original name was assigned by Congress.   \"It feels as though the president believes that this is his personal portfolio and not the portfolio owned by the American people,\" said Rebecca Miller, executive director of the DC Preservation League. \"The way the administration has been moving forward indicates that they don't have any guardrails that they have to run up against.\"   She says Trump is making so many changes to so many historic places so quickly it is hard to keep up.   \"President Trump is making the White House beautiful and giving it the glory it deserves at no cost to the taxpayer,\" said Davis Ingle, a White House spokesman. \"Only people with a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome would find a problem with that.\"   Information about the ballroom project is set to be presented to the National Capital Planning Commission next month. Though it is now controlled by the president's allies, which means that whatever Trump and his team propose is unlikely to meet much resistance.\n",

The complaint from the Legal Accountability Project against Judge Sarah Merriam of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit states that it is based on conversations with multiple former law clerks who fear retaliation if they come forward themselves.   \"She is a bully, in all the ways one might bully their employees: yelling, berating clerks, sending all-caps unhinged emails,\" said Aliza Shatzman, president and founder of the Legal Accountability Project.   \n   The Legal Accountability Project complaint, which has not been previously reported, was filed earlier this month and reviewed by NPR. The group says it marks the second publicly known complaint in four years about Merriam. Such complaints are not usually made public. Instead, they tend to be handled internally, by courts that police themselves, in part to protect the judiciary's independence and balance of power.   In a nearly yearlong investigation, NPR found a culture of fear about reporting judges and concluded that the courts' internal system often fails to result in meaningful change.   \n   In December 2023, an internal investigation into an unnamed judge on the 2nd Circuit by the court's judicial council found evidence that judge had an \"overly harsh\" management style. The investigation closed after that judge agreed to watch workplace conduct videos and receive counseling about how to manage staff in their chambers.   The investigation never named the judge, but a report from legal commentator David Lat in 2024 alleged that the judge in question was Merriam. The findings of that initial investigation resemble examples cited in the recent complaint against Merriam from the Legal Accountability Project.   Shatzman, from the Legal Accountability Project, said she's heard from clerks in 2024 and 2025 who spoke about the alleged abuses by Merriam, including from an unnamed clerk who quit this year after just one month on the job. Four others withdrew from offers to work for the judge, apparently after learning about the work environment, the nonprofit group said.   \n   An email to multiple officials at the 2nd Circuit appeals court did not receive an answer as of press time. A message left for Judge Merriam also went unanswered. A spokesman for the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts declined comment. Court officials typically decline to comment on misconduct complaints while they are pending.   \n   Merriam is a former federal public defender and longtime magistrate judge in Connecticut. President Joe Biden nominated her to a lifetime tenured District Court judgeship, where she was confirmed in October 2021. He then promoted her to the federal appeals court, to which she was confirmed in September 2022.   Concerns about Merriam represent the latest flash point in a long-running debate about the power imbalance between federal judges and the often young clerks who work for them. People who work for the courts don't enjoy the same kinds of job protections that most other American workers do.   To resolve the earlier complaint, the unnamed judge agreed that the workplace relations coordinator for the 2nd Circuit would \"check in\" with clerks, to make sure they had been treated with respect and were free from abusive conduct.   But the recent complaint from the Legal Accountability Project suggests that the concerns of clerks on the 2nd Circuit persist.   The filing of the complaint could prompt court officials in the 2nd Circuit to conduct interviews with people who have worked for the judge, and to seek answers from the judge herself.\n",

    "body": "\n      Detroit gets its first new mayor in a dozen years, as 38-year-old Mary Sheffield is sworn in. Sheffield also becomes Detroit's first woman mayor.   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  This week, Detroit gets its first new mayor in a dozen years as Mary Sheffield is sworn in. She is 38 years old. She's a Democrat, and she's taking over a city with a newly vibrant downtown and a rising national reputation. But she's got big challenges ahead, like spreading those wins across the city's many neighborhoods. NPR's Don Gonyea reports.DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Mary Sheffield takes office having been the overwhelming choice of Detroiters in the fall election, winning 77% of the vote. In her victory speech, she evoked the city's history, citing Motown and the Motor City.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARY SHEFFIELD: Let's not forget who we are.UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Yeah.SHEFFIELD: We are a city of innovators, of champions, of changemakers.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: That's right.SHEFFIELD: We put the world on wheels.GONYEA: She spoke of Detroit's role in the labor movement and in fighting for civil rights, and she highlighted her family connection to all of that. Her father is a pastor and community activist. Her grandfather was an early United Auto Workers organizer and union leader who marched with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Detroit.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SHEFFIELD: My grandfather, Horace Sheffield Jr...UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Yeah.(CHEERING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Yeah.SHEFFIELD: ...Stood on the front lines...UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Front lines.SHEFFIELD: ...During the Walk to Freedom, demanding jobs, dignity and justice for every Detroiter.GONYEA: Sheffield certainly has a mandate, but she's also got a tough act to follow. Outgoing Mayor Mike Duggan is very popular and leaves office after a dozen years. Early in his tenure, the city emerged from bankruptcy. He brought in new investments and oversaw a resurgence in Detroit's downtown. But Mayor Sheffield can also claim a share in that success, having served on the city council for 12 years, the past four as council president.Detroit's population is growing and crime is down, but poverty remains a major challenge. There's also a long-standing tension between downtown and the city's neighborhoods, which still feel neglected despite downtown's resurgence. Political analyst Mario Morrow notes that Sheffield campaigned heavily in neighborhoods.MARIO MORROW: She invested a lot of her time and platform on neighborhood development. So she's going to have to sit down and I guess have a come-to-Jesus meeting with the corporate leaders in Detroit to figure out how she's going to be successful with her goals and that big push to make neighborhoods viable.GONYEA: Reverend Charles Williams' church is in one of those neighborhoods. A Sheffield supporter, he says she needs to find partners in state and federal government. But dealing with the Trump White House, he says, is like walking a tightrope, especially given conflicts over National Guard deployments and immigration enforcement.CHARLES WILLIAMS: This is some of the political gamesmanship I guess you just got to have. Do we want to get in a fight with Donald Trump? No, not really. Do we want to get resources from the federal government so that we can continue on the prosperity and bring more prosperity to Detroit neighborhoods? Absolutely.GONYEA: Mayor Sheffield is Detroit's first ever woman mayor. It's a milestone many residents are applauding. She's also the first African American mayor in Detroit in a dozen years. Charlize Spanish is a student at Wayne State University in Detroit. She says both of those things are important to her.CHARLIZE SPANISH: As Black women, we have a bit of a struggle in society. So I feel like her being in this role would help bring up the Black woman and bring us together.GONYEA: With this new mayor in office, Spanish says she's hoping to feel seen and that the new administration can deliver for neighborhoods like hers. Mary Sheffield officially takes over as Detroit mayor on January 1, with a public swearing-in ceremony set for next week.Don Gonyea, NPR News, Detroit.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "\n      President Trump is meeting with Ukrainian Pres. Volodymyr Zelenskyy today and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tomorrow.   \n\n    DANIEL ESTRIN, HOST:  Two world leaders involved in two major conflicts are meeting President Trump this week. In a few minutes, we'll hear about what the Israeli prime minister may have planned for the president tomorrow. Today, Trump meets Ukraine's leader, and this time, not in the Oval Office. NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben joins us now. Good morning, Danielle.DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Good morning, Daniel.ESTRIN: So this afternoon, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is scheduled to meet President Trump in Florida. That's where Trump is spending the holidays. And Russian President Vladimir Putin set the stage this weekend - didn't he? - with missile and drone attacks on Kyiv this weekend.KURTZLEBEN: That's absolutely right. So the meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump is scheduled for 1 p.m. Eastern today at Trump's club, Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach. And there's been some real movement here since that infamous bitter Oval Office meeting you alluded to, featuring Zelenskyy, Trump and Vice President Vance earlier this year. Now, earlier this week, Zelenskyy released a 20-point plan to end the war, which, according to multiple outlets, it described security guarantees and a demilitarized zone between Russia and Ukraine, which would be one way to try to deal with that sticking point of territory disputes between the two countries. Zelenskyy also told Axios this week that he's willing to bring that plan up for a referendum in Ukraine, but only if Russia agrees to a 60-day ceasefire. Now, that's a big if, because, as you said, Russia bombarded Kyiv yesterday, and they may not be inclined to stop attacking.ESTRIN: Yeah. And meanwhile, Trump ordered missile strikes on targets in northern Nigeria on Christmas Day, and he's also keeping up the pressure on Venezuela and President Nicolas Maduro. So what exactly is Trump's aim in these two very different parts of the globe?KURTZLEBEN: Well, let's start with Nigeria here. Trump announced in a Christmas night social media post that the U.S. had launched strikes against ISIS in northwestern Nigeria. And we should add here that the Nigerian government says they gave the green light to this. Well, Trump implied that this was retaliation for armed militants attacking Christians, though experts have disputed claims of Christian persecution in that country, as the AP found earlier this year, militants there have killed Muslims and Christians alike. As far as the aim beyond what Trump said here, it may be to please his Christian base. For one thing, this topic is getting louder. Rapper Nicki Minaj, who has become friendly to MAGA, has been talking about this alleged Christian persecution.But then there's Venezuela, which you mentioned, where the administration has been striking boats that they say are carrying drugs and killing people in the process. Well, the endgame there has been in question for months now. For example, does Trump want regime change in Venezuela? Now, all of this certainly fits with how the Trump administration likes to talk about itself, being tough on terrorists and tough on drugs, but you're right that it raises that question of why is Trump taking all these actions all over the world? Because that question of why has created strife within his own party. You have former Trump ally, Marjorie Taylor Greene, a congresswoman from Georgia, who has asked, for example, if Trump is still America First.ESTRIN: And speaking of strife in the Republican Party, let's talk about the cultural battles happening on the right. These past few weeks in this country, the hot topic used to be antisemitism, and now there's a new controversy over what it means to be American.KURTZLEBEN: Yeah. This got more attention in particular after Ohio GOP gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, in recent days, he pushed back against this idea of heritage Americans, which is a concept among some on the far right, that there are people in the U.S. whose lineage can be traced far back in the U.S.' history, and therefore, they are heritage Americans, that your lineage determines your Americanness, which, of course, means race is central to this conversation. And so therefore, we've seen this topic inflame existing tensions, for example, between people like Ramaswamy and the white nationalist streamer Nick Fuentes.Now, all of this is important, not just in and of itself, because it's another intra-party faultline in the GOP. There's this question about what America First means, like I mentioned. Then here's this divide between outright racists like Fuentes, who has a large following, and other MAGA leaders. And then, like you mentioned, there's that fight over what constitutes antisemitism and how to reject that. So there's a real chance that these often really ugly divides are a major storyline in 2026 as the midterms approach and as the GOP grapples with its post-Trump future.ESTRIN: NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben.

The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that Trump has championed has mostly held, but progress has slowed recently. Both sides accuse one another of violations, and divisions have emerged among the U.S., Israel and Arab countries about the path forward.   \n   The truce's first phase began in October, days after the two-year anniversary of the initial Hamas-led attack on Israel that killed around 1,200 people. All but one of the 251 hostages taken then have been released, alive or dead.   Now comes the next, far more complicated part. Trump's 20-point plan — which was approved by the U.N. Security Council — lays out an ambitious vision for ending Hamas' rule of Gaza.   The two leaders also could discuss non-Gaza topics, including Iran, whose nuclear capabilities Trump continues to insist were \"completely and fully obliterated\" following U.S. strikes on its nuclear sites in June.   There are many key facets of the ceasefire's second phase that Israel's leader doesn't support or has even openly opposed, said Mona Yacoubian, director and senior adviser of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.   \"This is going to be a really tall order, I think, for President Trump to get Netanyahu to agree,\" she said.   \"How he does that, what kind of pressure he puts on Netanyahu, I think, is going to be important to watch for,\" said Yacoubian, who also said the two could exhibit \"a broader clash of approaches to the region.\"   \n   Next phase is complex   If successful, the second phase would see the rebuilding of a demilitarized Gaza under international supervision by a group chaired by Trump and known as the Board of Peace. The Palestinians would form a \"technocratic, apolitical\" committee to run daily affairs in Gaza, under Board of Peace supervision.   It further calls for normalized relations between Israel and the Arab world, and a possible pathway to Palestinian independence. Then there are thorny logistical and humanitarian questions, including rebuilding war-ravaged Gaza, disarming Hamas and creating a security apparatus called the International Stabilization Force.   The Board of Peace would oversee Gaza's reconstruction under a two-year, renewable U.N. mandate. Its members had been expected to be named by the end of the year and might even be revealed following Monday's meeting, but the announcement could be pushed into next month.   Netanyahu was the first foreign leader to meet Trump at the White House in his second term, but this will be their first in-person meeting since Trump went to Israel in October to mark the start of the ceasefire's initial phase. Netanyahu has been to Mar-a-Lago before, including in July 2024 when Trump was still seeking reelection.   Much remains unsettled   Their latest meeting comes after U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and the president's son in law, Jared Kushner, recently huddled in Florida with officials from Egypt, Qatar and Turkey, which have been mediating the ceasefire.   Two main challenges have complicated moving to the second phase, according to an official who was briefed on those meetings. Israeli officials have been taking a lot of time to vet and approve members of the Palestinian technocratic committee from a list given to them by the mediators, and Israel continues its military strikes.   Trump's plan also calls for the International Stabilization Force, proposed as a multinational body, to maintain security. But it, too, has yet to be formed. Whether details will be forthcoming after Monday's meeting is unclear.   \n   A Western diplomat said there is a \"huge gulf\" between the U.S.-Israeli understanding of the International Stabilization Force's mandate and that of other major countries in the region, as well as European governments.   All spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details that haven't been made public.   The U.S. and Israel want the force to have a \"commanding role\" in security duties, including disarming Hamas and other militant groups. But countries being courted to contribute troops fear that mandate will make it an \"occupation force,\" the diplomat said.   Hamas has said it is ready to discuss \"freezing or storing\" its arsenal of weapons, but insists it has a right to armed resistance as long as Israel occupies Palestinian territory. One U.S. official said a potential plan might be to offer cash incentives in exchange for weapons, echoing a \"buy-back\" program Witkoff has previously floated.   Questions about Gaza reconstruction   Israeli bombardment and ground operations have transformed neighborhoods in several Gaza cities into rubble-strewn wastelands, with blackened shells of buildings and mounds of debris stretching in all directions.   \n   Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey are pressing for a negotiated deal on disarming Hamas, and on an additional Israeli withdrawal from Gaza before moving to next elements of the plan. Those include deployment of the international security force and reconstruction, three Arab officials told The Associated Press.   That appears to run against ideas floated by U.S. officials to quickly start building temporary housing for Palestinians in parts of southern Gaza still controlled by Israeli troops. Three officials said the United Arab Emirates has agreed to fund reconstruction in Gaza, including new communities, although they said discussions are ongoing and plans remain unsettled.   A proposed map created by the U.S. and obtained by the AP shows an area labelled \"UAE Temporary Emirates housing complex\" inside an Israeli-controlled area of Gaza. The map shows a \"U.S. planned community area\" surrounding the UAE area.   \n   An Arab official said he was aware of the map, but said it was a suggestion from the U.S. and Israel that was put to the Emiratis and other countries.   The UAE did not respond to multiple requests for comment about whether it has agreed to the plans or to fund the communities. It is not known if the money would be contingent on gestures from Israel and Hamas, such as a commitment to Palestinian statehood or disarmament.\n",

By tradition, this is a formal introduction, the chance for a new congressperson to announce what he stands for.   Kim, a Democrat from New Jersey, told the story of his father's diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease just a few weeks prior. After the appointment, Kim said he sat in his car in shock, replaying the words of the doctor who warned him that his next year was going to be hell.   Kim said the costs of care have already been \"catastrophic\" for his family. \"Why is it so hard to provide care in this country?\" he asked. \"Why is providing care so insanely complicated?\"   \n   The takeaway: Family caregiving is so difficult that even a U.S. senator is overwhelmed.   And even a senator doesn't know how to fix it.   There's consensus that something needs to change. Kim chose to focus this high-profile speech on family caregiving because it resonates: An estimated 63 million Americans currently care for elderly or chronically ill adults, according to a survey from AARP and the National Alliance for Caregiving.    \n   And 79% of Republicans and 89% of Democrats agree that the government needs to do more to help people caring for their family members. In 2024, both presidential candidates promised to do something about it.   Since then, though, nothing much has happened at the national level. But a shift is underway, say policy-watchers and advocates for caregivers. The COVID-19 pandemic made family caregiving more visible and changed its image. Since then, care is increasingly perceived as a labor and economic issue — a social concern rather than just a family problem.    A broad coalition called Care Can't Wait brings together labor, aging and disability interests. It is pushing to put family caregiving on the national agenda by lobbying policymakers, organizing events, and raising awareness.   In the last few years, state governments have begun implementing policies to help caregivers, such as tax breaks, an innovative public long-term care insurance program, and new job protections for working caregivers. State-level policy experiments like these often build momentum for national-level change, say policy experts.   \n   \"There's been huge momentum in the last five years that I have not seen in the last 20,\" says Alison Barkoff, professor of health law at George Washington University and former assistant secretary of aging at the Department of Health and Human Services. \"I feel optimism that this is setting the stage for something big.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                U.S. Sen. Andy Kim.\n                \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Growing needs and a patchwork of support   The number of family caregivers for adults has already doubled since 2014. And older people are now the nation's fastest-growing age group.   Half of them will eventually need daily help with even simple tasks like cooking, getting dressed and keeping house. Some will need much more extensive care.   \n   That task will mostly fall to family and friends, because most people cannot afford to pay someone else to do it. Forty hours a week of paid caregiving help runs about $71,000 a year. The average annual nursing home bill is $110,000. Medicare covers almost none of it.   Family caregivers spend an average of $7,242 in out-of-pocket expenses every year, an AARP survey found in 2021. About a third dip into retirement savings or take on credit card debt to cover expenses like assisted living facility fees, home modifications, medical bills or adult day care.   \"The cost of long-term care is exponentially higher than things like childcare that get far more attention in national media,\" says Nicole Jorwic, chief program officer at Caring Across Generations, an advocacy group focused on care.   Currently, there's no nationwide system for family caregivers to find out what help might be available. Eligibility rules vary widely, and caregiving programs or assistance are administered by a profusion of entities, from state and local governments to the Veterans Administration and nonprofits. The programs do not connect with one another, so caregivers must research each separately.   And national policymakers have not acted to address the cash crunch or knit up the isolated sources of support into an actual safety net.   \n   The most consequential caregiving-related federal action in 2025 was to trim nearly $1 trillion from the Medicaid budget over the next 10 years, which experts predict will translate into cuts for some of the roughly 4.5 million family caregivers paid through the program. \"Even the patchwork that did exist is getting shredded,\" says Jorwic.   The states step in   The picture is more promising at the state level. Across the nation, lawmakers are trying out policies to defray costs or provide new forms of help. These experiments are rapidly spreading.   In 2023, Oklahoma and Nebraska were the first states to adopt tax credits for family caregivers. Since then, Georgia, Missouri, New Jersey, North Dakota and South Carolina have followed suit. Another dozen or so states are discussing similar bills, says Megan O'Reilly, vice president of health and family at AARP, which advocates for these laws. The credits reimburse family caregivers for expenses like home modifications or paid help, usually capped at around $2,000 to $3,000 a year.   Some states also subsidize respite care in the form of short-term paid caregiving or institutional care, so that family caregivers can take a few days off or deal with other obligations.   \n   About 60% of family caregivers also work; many states are modifying employment laws to help them manage both responsibilities. The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, which requires certain employers to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave, covers less than half of all American employees.   In the last few years, 13 states and Washington, D.C., passed laws requiring employers to offer up to 12 weeks of paid family leave. Similar programs in Maine, Delaware and Minnesota are rolling out now. In these programs, payroll taxes cover the costs, much like unemployment insurance. In ten other states, including Texas and Virginia, paid leave is optional, and employers can add the benefit by buying commercial insurance.   \n   In other states, laws that permit caregivers to take paid or unpaid leave now include in-laws, domestic partners, or even close friends. Other states, counties and cities like Delaware, Florida's Monroe County, and Battle Creek, Michigan created rules to explicitly protect against workplace discrimination, so workers can't be fired or demoted because of their caregiving responsibilities.   The most ambitious state caregiver support program to date rolls out in the next few days. In 2023, Washington workers started paying into a fund for universal long-term care insurance. In 2026, qualified workers will be able to tap into this pool to pay for in-home care, home modifications, and even meals and transportation, up to a lifetime limit of $36,000. Seven other states are considering similar programs, including big ones like California and New York.   Altogether, one or more of these policies apply to the majority of the nation's caregivers, covering 25 states and 31 cities.   The care movement to come   These new laws add more patches to the patchwork. At the federal level, administrative tweaks to Medicaid rules in the last few years have also made it easier for certain caregivers to get training and help. But a truly comprehensive caregiver support system will require vision, big-ticket policies and big budgets, say the policy experts and advocates who monitor long-term care.   For example, in 2021, Reps. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., and John Moolenaar, R-Mich., introduced a bill to create a national long-term care insurance program to cover catastrophic costs of care. Payments would kick in only after the family covers the bills for at least a year. The idea is not only to help families, but to reinvigorate the long-term care insurance market, which currently covers only about 5% of the cost of care nationwide. This bill is supported by the National Alliance for Caregiving, among others. It was reintroduced in 2025.   \n   The Care Can't Wait coalition's goals include a comprehensive paid family and medical leave law that would cover all working caregivers.   The coalition's biggest ticket item: Expanding Medicare to pay for long-term care, an idea that's been repeatedly proposed ever since the law was written in 1965. Kamala Harris' presidential campaign floated a modest version of this plan, with an estimated pricetag of $40 billion a year.   Ambitious national efforts like these might not currently be realistic, advocates concede. But the sheer number of struggling family caregivers and the value of their work — estimated at $600 billion a year in 2021 — will force change, especially as older and disabled populations continue to grow.   \"As a society, we are at a pivot point,\" says Jorwic. \"Economic forces are going to push solutions.\" The ultimate aim is to foster a new care movement — what Kim called for in his speech.   There are already subtle changes, says O'Reilly. When she and other AARP representatives meet with legislators, they no longer need to explain what family caregiving is and why it matters. Most often, someone on the staff has personal experience with it themselves.   \"People are connecting with the issue, and sharing their own stories,\" she says. \"That's a transformation from where we started this work.\"   Kat McGowan is a freelance writer in California focused on caregiving.\n",

The president's statements came after the two leaders met for a discussion that took place after what Trump described as an \"excellent,\" two-and-a-half-hour phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose invasion of Ukraine launched the war four years ago. Trump insisted he believed Putin still wants peace, even as Russia launched another round of attacks on Ukraine while Zelenskyy flew to the United States for the latest round of negotiations.   \n   \"Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed,\" Trump said during a late afternoon news conference following a meeting with Zelenskyy, whom he repeatedly praised as \"brave.\"   \n   Trump and Zelenskyy both acknowledged thorny issues remain, including whether Russia can keep Ukrainian territory it controls. After their discussion they called a wide group of European leaders, including Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, and the leaders of Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain and Poland.   Zelenskyy thanked Trump for his work. \"Ukraine is ready for peace,\" he said.   Trump and Putin will speak again   Trump said he'd follow the meeting with another call to Putin. Earlier Sunday, Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said the Trump-Putin call was initiated by the U.S. side, lasted over an hour, and was \"friendly, benevolent and businesslike.\" Ushakov said Trump and Putin agreed to speak again \"promptly\" after Trump's meeting with Zelenskyy.   But Ushakov added that a \"bold, responsible, political decision is needed from Kyiv\" on the fiercely contested Donbas region in eastern Ukraine and other matters in dispute for there to be a \"complete cessation\" of hostilities.   In overnight developments, three guided aerial bombs launched by Russia struck private homes in the eastern city of Sloviansk, according to the head of the local military administration, Vadym Lakh. Three people were injured and one man died, Lakh said in a post on the Telegram messenger app.   \n   The strike came the day after Russia attacked Ukraine's capital with ballistic missiles and drones on Saturday, killing at least one person and wounding 27, Ukrainian authorities said. Explosions boomed across Kyiv as the attack began in the early morning and continued for hours.   Trump said, however, that he still believes Putin is \"very serious\" about ending the war.   \"I believe Ukraine has made some very strong attacks also,\" Trump told reporters as Zelenskyy stood by his side. \"And I don't say that negatively. I think, you probably have to. I don't say that negatively. But I think, he hasn't told me that, but there have been some explosions in various parts of Russia. It looks to me, like, I don't know. I don't think it came from the Congo.\"   \n   Trump noted that it was possible that the negotiations will fall apart. \"In a few weeks, we will know one way or the other, I think. ... But it could also go poorly.\"   The face-to-face sit-down between Trump and Zelenskyy underscored the apparent progress made by Trump's top negotiators in recent weeks as the sides traded draft peace plans and continued to shape a proposal to end the fighting. Zelenskyy told reporters Friday that the 20-point draft proposal negotiators have discussed is \"about 90% ready\" — echoing a figure, and the optimism, that U.S. officials conveyed when Trump's chief negotiators met with Zelenskyy in Berlin earlier this month.   During the recent talks, the U.S. agreed to offer certain security guarantees to Ukraine similar to those offered to other members of NATO. The proposal came as Zelenskyy said he was prepared to drop his country's bid to join the security alliance if Ukraine received NATO-like protection that would be designed to safeguard it against future Russian attacks.   'Intensive' weeks ahead   Zelenskyy also spoke on Christmas Day with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law. The Ukrainian leader said they discussed \"certain substantive details\" and cautioned \"there is still work to be done on sensitive issues\" and \"the weeks ahead may also be intensive.\"   \n   The U.S. president has been working to end the war in Ukraine for much of his first year back in office, showing irritation with both Zelenskyy and Putin while publicly acknowledging the difficulty of ending the conflict. Long gone are the days when, as a candidate in 2024, he boasted that he could resolve the fighting in a day.   \n   After hosting Zelenskyy at the White House in October, Trump demanded that both Russia and Ukraine halt fighting and \"stop at the battle line,\" implying that Moscow should be able to keep the territory it has seized from Ukraine.   Zelenskyy said last week that he would be willing to withdraw troops from Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland as part of a plan to end the war, if Russia also pulls back and the area becomes a demilitarized zone monitored by international forces.   Putin wants Russian gains kept, and more   Putin has publicly said he wants all the areas in four key regions that have been captured by his forces, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory. He also has insisted that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in eastern Ukraine that Moscow's forces haven't captured. Kyiv has publicly rejected all those demands.   The Kremlin also wants Ukraine to abandon its bid to join NATO. It warned that it wouldn't accept the deployment of any troops from members of the military alliance and would view them as a \"legitimate target.\"   \n   Putin also has said Ukraine must limit the size of its army and give official status to the Russian language, demands he has made from the outset of the conflict.   Ushakov told the business daily Kommersant this month that Russian police and national guard would stay in parts of Donetsk -– one of the two major areas, along with Luhansk, that make up the Donbas region — even if they become a demilitarized zone under a prospective peace plan.   Ushakov cautioned that trying to reach a compromise could take a long time. He said U.S. proposals that took into account Russian demands had been \"worsened\" by alterations proposed by Ukraine and its European allies.   \n   Trump has been somewhat receptive to Putin's demands, making the case that the Russian president can be persuaded to end the war if Kyiv agrees to cede Ukrainian land in the Donbas region and if Western powers offer economic incentives to bring Russia back into the global economy.\n",

Pictures; NEON; Eddy Chen/Lionsgate; Warner Bros. Pictures\n    \n\n   \n   In 2025, a time of intense political turmoil and division, James L. Brooks released his first film in 15 years, a political rom-dramedy looking back on the year 2008 through wistful, Obamacore-clouded eyes. Despite a stacked ensemble that includes Jamie Lee Curtis and Albert Brooks, Ella McCay is easily one of the worst movies of the year for many reasons, not least of which is a line in which a character proclaims 2008 as \"a better time, when we all still liked each other.\" (Obvious follow-up question: Who is \"we\"?) Even more glaring is the fact that its protagonist, played by Emma Mackey, becomes the de facto Anyparty governor of Anytown, USA — her political party is never identified, the state she lives and serves in is never named.   \n   The revisionist non-specificity demonstrates zero interest in meeting The Moment, though plenty of other films released this year have at least attempted to engage with it more directly. This isn't to say all of them pulled off their aims. But before seeing Ella McCay, I'd been mulling what it even means for a film to be \"successful\" in tackling sociopolitical issues in this climate, when each new day conjures up utterly ridiculous and dystopian realities just as bizarre as any screenwriter might possibly imagine, if not more so. Brooks' film at least makes clear what definitely doesn't work in this space: nostalgia, and a posturing of neutrality.   \n   Beyond that extremely low bar, parsing how to assess work that engages in politics is hardly straightforward, and admittedly dependent on a wholly subjective perception of what The Moment is and requires. The output has been a mixed, yet fascinating bag. Entertaining mainstream movies like Wicked: For Good and The Running Man gestured overtly at radical ideas through their protagonists' anti-authoritarian struggles, but ultimately offered little besides oversimplified stick-it-to-the-man rallying cries. In contrast, two great movies which both happen to star Josh O'Connor — The Mastermind and Wake Up Dead Man — kept political themes simmering in the background but deployed them to meaningful emotional effect.   \n   Some of the more confounding and messy projects this year were made in the spirit of \"challenging\" the audience — getting the people going, as it were. This can usually be done a couple of ways: didactically or, as is the case with Luca Guadagnino's After the Hunt, obtusely. The thorny campus melodrama stars Julia Roberts as Yale professor Alma, who begins to unravel after her star student Maggie (Ayo Edebiri) accuses her colleague Hank (Andrew Garfield) of rape. It's deliberately ambiguous in nearly every aspect of its storytelling — to the point of incomprehension rather than subversion.   \n   Less vague but much weirder were Ari Aster's Eddington and Yorgos Lanthimos' Bugonia, which both truthfully depict the chaos that's gripped American politics in recent years. Eddington stars Joaquin Phoenix as the sheriff of a small, rural New Mexico town in the early months of the pandemic, and astutely captures the absurdities and discord of that time — the social distancing, the fights over masking, the dangerous online conspiracy theory rabbit holes that sucked many people in as they isolated. Bugonia, too, feels intimately ripped from real life, as Teddy (Jesse Plemons), a conspiracy theorist who admits to having cycled through \"the whole digestive tract\" of ideologies (alt-right, alt-left, Marxism, etc.), dictates his many grievances to Michelle (Emma Stone), the pharmaceutical CEO he's kidnapped, because he's convinced she's an alien. (It sounds completely unhinged, until you remember the hoopla around Pizzagate.)   Sometimes getting a vibe right — and in these cases, that vibe is the ball of utter confusion we're swirling in — is enough to carry a movie. But Aster and Lanthimos have made plain their intentions of puncturing the \"echo chamber\" with their respective projects, and neither fully pulls that off. (Fittingly, Aster is also a producer on Bugonia.) For one thing, expecting any movie to meaningfully shift someone's perspective about \"the other side\" is a tall order when the leader of one \"side\" — or at least, one of many — is disseminating A.I. slop videos trolling his critics. But in Eddington, as with After the Hunt, presenting uncomfortable scenarios and contemptible characters takes precedence over storytelling. (Eddington also shortchanges its sole Black character, a cop played by Micheal Ward, by relegating him to the role of one-dimensional stand-in for Black Lives Matter-era anxieties when the news of George Floyd's murder breaks.)   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Emma Stone in Bugonia.\n                \n                    Atsushi Nishijima/Focus Features\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Atsushi Nishijima/Focus Features\n    \n\n   \n   To its credit, Bugonia isn't ambiguous at all; the ending — spoilers incoming — follows the same basic plot twist as the Korean movie it's inspired by, Save the Green Planet!, revealing that Michelle the CEO is indeed an alien who was sent to earth to assess \"the human experiment\" and has deemed it a failure worthy of extermination. But its defeatist attitude nearly undoes everything that came before it, and contrary to feeling \"challenged,\" I was irked by how smug the conclusion felt. Is that all that there is?   \n   Other projects this year seemed to reflect filmmakers' attempts to look inward politically, and while they didn't always look hard enough, the results were still worth examining. Aziz Ansari's directorial debut Good Fortune, an enjoyable if clunky movie with a brilliant comedic turn from Keanu Reeves playing a guardian angel, is It's a Wonderful Life meets Trading Places. Ansari's character Arj, a struggling gig economy worker living out of his car in Los Angeles, swaps lives with Seth Rogen's wealthy tech bro Jeff, and the film mines comedy and occasional pointed commentary out of the many indignities Arj deals with as a courier and factory worker.   \n   For a middle-brow Hollywood comedy, there's a refreshing frankness about wealth inequality; it features unsubtle references to Amazon-related news stories, including a pro-union subplot. But the film clears a bare minimum and Ansari has readily acknowledged his situation is much closer to Jeff's than Arj's, which may account for why Good Fortune's critique ultimately lets the machinations of capitalism off the hook. Once Jeff and Arj's lives are switched back, the gig worker's financial circumstances are barely improved from the beginning of the movie, yet the message seems to be that Arj just needs to have a more positive outlook and channel it into activism. (Spike Lee's Highest 2 Lowest is undercut by a similar predicament in addressing wealth disparity.)   \n   That disconnect between filmmaking intent and impact is what keeps Paul Thomas Anderson's thrilling One Battle After Another from being as politically potent as some have argued it is. This is at least partially by design; he told the Los Angeles Times that he avoided \"put[ing] politics up in the front\" in service of presenting characters the audience would care about, and aptly noted that as timely as OBAA may seem, history is always repeating itself. (Fascism, he said, \"doesn't go out of style.\") Fair enough — but it's notable that he pointedly portrays white middle-aged malaise, an underground effort to shelter migrants from law enforcement agents, and a secret society of white nationalists.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Teyana Taylor in One Battle After Another.\n                \n                    Warner Bros. Pictures\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Warner Bros. Pictures\n    \n\n   \n   Less assured is his treatment of Black radicalism, which comes across as inadvertently disjointed or, less charitably, dismissive. In writing Perfidia (Teyana Taylor), a character who anchors the first third of the film before all but disappearing for the rest of it, Anderson pulls from markers of Blaxploitation and the sordid history of white men's fetishization of Black women to craft a thinly realized revolutionary — a figure whose hypersexuality is inextricable from her acts of rebellion. Taylor's magnetic and committed performance hints at how these tensions might have been more deeply explored, but it can't fully overcome the script's scattershot references and hurried characterization. (Here it also seems worth observing that while Anderson has been in a long-term relationship with Maya Rudolph, even casting her in small roles in Inherent Vice and Licorice Pizza, Black women characters have not been featured as prominently in his films before OBAA.)   \n   It seems the moment requires more than just presenting questions and what-ifs. It needs a stance, a commitment to an ethos and to the story it's ostensibly trying to tell, and an honesty about consequences. Ryan Coogler did this with Sinners, crafting a story that's richly entertaining while being acutely critical of the capitalistic and cultural forces that have leeched off Black Americans for centuries. Ditto Kleber Mendonça Filho's thriller The Secret Agent, a sprawling yet intimate film about political refugees living under aliases during Brazil's military dictatorship. In one scene, a resistance leader named Elza (Maria Fernanda Cândido) expresses sympathy toward former educator Marcelo (Wagner Moura) and his father-in-law Sr. Alexandre (Carlos Francisco) for the death of Marcelo's wife, and vows that Brazil will pay for it. \"I disagree,\" Sr. Alexandre replies plainly. \"With all due respect. It'll pay nothing. It won't pay s***.\"   \n   Of all these films, Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi's It Was Just an Accident may be the one most directly connected to the present moment, in no small part because the line between fiction and reality has been blurred by outside forces. Earlier this month, Panahi was handed a year-long prison sentence in Iran, as well as a two-year ban on all international travel. This isn't the first time Panahi, a longtime outspoken critic of the Iranian government, has been targeted; many of his films have been made in secret, including his 2011 documentary This Is Not a Film, which he shot while under house arrest and awaiting the results of an appeal of a six-year prison sentence and 20-year ban from making films.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Mohamad Ali Elyasmehr, Majid Panahi and Hadis Pakbaten in It Was Just an Accident.\n                \n                    ‎NEON\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        ‎NEON\n    \n\n   \n   In Accident, Vahid (Vahid Mobasseri), a former political captive, comes across a man he's convinced was one of his tormentors and kidnaps him to enact violent vengeance. (Plot details ahead.) The man, Eghbal (Ebrahim Azizi), insists he's got the wrong person, and Vahid, now unsure, enlists some of the other victims to see if they might help identify him. Panahi puts the concept of justice under a microscope as they debate his identity and the usefulness of retaliation. Eventually, the man finally confesses out of desperation, arguing that he was simply following orders. He also adds that he at first held a guilty conscience, but he \"got used to it with time.\"   \n   Time hangs over Accident like a dark cloud, and the astounding final scene suggests Vahid will never be able to get away from the traumas he's endured. Understood a different way, it may also imply Vahid's ultimate decision — to show his tormentor mercy — while morally admirable, may have been in vain. On an episode of the podcast Filmspotting, co-host Adam Kempenaar said of Accident, \"It's one of those films … that is fundamentally about asking those questions — asking big, moral and ethical questions, but it also has clarity. It has conclusions. It leaves open some interpretation at the end … but within that, there is also clarity in what we see the characters do.\"   This is the thing: the masks have come fully off in political discourse, with all the -isms and -phobias no longer cloaked under thin layers of coded language and niceties. Families are being torn apart, jobs are being lost for criticizing the current administration, governmental systems have been effectively dismantled and rendered useless. Nuance is always welcome, but now is not the time for vagueness or subtlety in art that dares to wade into these issues. The expectation is not for movies to change the world, but to help make sense of it, even just a little. The films that brought us closest this year are the most likely to withstand time.   \n",

At the same time, SNAP food benefits were suspended for weeks, and some food pantry shoppers are still playing catch up.   One of those people is Lisa Murphy. She's 61, disabled and relies on Social Security, and says it's important to have \"places like this that really help us.\"    \"I still owe my gas bill. I owe $298,\" Murphy says. \"It's hard to buy food and pay my bills, too.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Lisa Murphy grocery shops at The Market food pantry in Logan, Ohio. She's still behind on bills after SNAP food benefits were paused for two weeks during the recent federal shutdown.\n                \n                    Rich-Joseph Facun for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Rich-Joseph Facun for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A detail from Miller's grocery cart; signs tell clients the number of items that can be taken.\n                \n                    Rich-Joseph Facun for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Rich-Joseph Facun for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   But even as need grows with rising costs and unemployment, local anti-poverty groups like the one that runs The Market say their work has been threatened as never before amid the Trump administration's funding cuts, pauses and reversals targeting a long list of safety-net programs. The shutdown was only the latest disruption that forced them to scramble to keep operating.   And, they say, the year of chaos has left deep uncertainty over which programs may be hit next.   'Emergency response mode'   The Market in Logan, Ohio, is part of Hocking Athens Perry Community Action - HAPCAP for short - one of a thousand such agencies across the country that have been around since the 1960s. They connect some 15 million people with housing, health care, food aid and much more.   \n   At HAPCAP, services include Meals on Wheels, Head Start, a public bus system, employment help, and a food bank that serves 10 counties across southeast Appalachian Ohio.   It's an impressive range, but this year that's also made it a big target for federal funding cuts.    \"Eighty percent of our funding comes from federal grants,\" says executive director Kelly Hatas. The \"worst day\" of her career was back in January, when the Trump administration ordered a federal funding freeze, saying it wanted to shift priorities and promote efficiency.   \"When we got that news we were in immediate emergency response mode, like, what are we going to do?\" she says.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Kelly Hatas, executive director of Hocking Athens Perry Community Action (HAPCAP), talks with the child of a couple who are shopping at the food pantry. Hatas says the nonprofit has had to scramble all year as various safety-net programs were hit with federal funding cuts or pauses.\n                \n                    Rich-Joseph Facun for NPR/www.facun.com\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Rich-Joseph Facun for NPR/www.facun.com\n    \n\n   \n   The most urgent threat was to six Head Start centers.   \"Our Head Start director was on a call with all of her center coordinators telling them we're laying everyone off tomorrow,\" Hatas recalls. \"And then there was some secondary information that was like, 'Just kidding … Head Start is excluded.'\"   That whiplash shook people's trust. And the hits kept coming.   In March, the administration canceled or paused a billion dollars that helped food banks. In May, President Trump's budget called for zeroing out Head Start and heating assistance, along with major cuts to other safety-net programs like rental aid. He also proposed eliminating the $770 million dollar Community Services Block Grant that directly supports these anti-poverty groups, including it in a list of \"woke programs.\"   Congress eventually funded many of those programs, but the Office of Management and Budget took months to get out the block grant money.    \"OMB just decided not to spend it, totally usurping congressional authority,\" says David Bradley, who advocates for these local groups with the National Community Action Foundation.   He says they've long had strong bipartisan support.   \"So we've had two major fights with the administration,\" he says. \"We won them because Republicans helped.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                East Main Street in Logan, a small town in southeast Appalachian Ohio.\n                \n                    Rich-Joseph Facun for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Rich-Joseph Facun for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   In a statement, an OMB spokesperson said these anti-poverty programs fund \"radically partisan activities, like teaching toddlers to be antiracist and 'LGBTQIA+ welcoming.'\" It also criticized a program that combined affordable housing with clean energy \"in the pursuit of both economic and environmental justice.\"   \n   \"President Trump ran on fiscal responsibility and ending wasteful DEI spending in government,\" the statement says.\"The American taxpayer should not be made to fund critical race theory.\"   Health and Human Services spokesman Andrew Nixon said the agency \"administers CSBG consistent with the funding levels Congress provides to support services for low-income families.\"   Funding chaos and uncertainty   In Ohio, Hatas says the state has shifted money to help address federal funding crises as they've popped up to keep programs going. But the biggest challenge remains uncertainty.   \"The panic and the just day-to-day not knowing what's going to happen, is just really difficult,\" she says.   Because of that, HAPCAP has scaled back some plans, including for a new Head Start facility and a much-needed homeless shelter. It's also had to pull out of food distribution at schools because of a lack of staff. Some employees are leaving, worried about losing their jobs. Others have been laid off or had their hours trimmed.   \"It cut my paychecks completely in half,\" says Kelsey Sexton, who manages the front desk but was shifted to part-time in the fall. \"We have a mortgage, a car payment. With Christmas coming, my husband was like, what are we going to do?\"   She was bumped back up to full-time – but so far only temporarily – after the shutdown pause in SNAP payments brought a surge of people to the food pantry.   Losing a job can be extra tough in rural communities.   \"We don't really have jobs growing on trees … and so there's nowhere for these folks to go,\" says Megan Riddlebarger, who heads the Corporation for Ohio Appalachian Development (COAD) half an hour away in Athens.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Kelsey Sexton (left) had her hours as a desk clerk at HAPCAP cut in half. Megan Riddlebarger (right) heads the Corporation for Ohio Appalachian Development and says anti-poverty agencies are important for local economies in this rural region.\n                \n                    Rich-Joseph Facun for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Rich-Joseph Facun for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   She oversees federal funding for 17 antipoverty groups across the eastern part of the state, and says they're important for rural economies.   \"These aren't just, like, people volunteering for fun,\" she says. \"These are some of the biggest businesses in town, buying most of the products that are bought and sold in the town.\"   \n   Helping people stay warm and at home    Down a flight of stairs from Riddlebarger's office, five burly men at long desks take notes as Dave Freeman goes over how to properly install a water heater vent. It's a refresher training class for inspectors, part of a weatherization assistance program the White House also wanted to end.   Freeman says many older homes in the area are full of cracks and crevices with almost no insulation.   \"That house that you walk in (that) has the blanket at the stairway, so 'Oh, honey, I haven't been upstairs, it's so cold up there,'\" he says.   Weatherizing homes not only lets people live comfortably, it also saves them money.   \"Say their electric bill goes down or gas bill goes down, they might be able to buy a pizza on a Saturday night,\" Freeman says. \"And that's a big thing.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Adam Murdock (left) attends attends a training class for weatherization inspectors at the Corporation for Ohio Appalachian Development.\n                \n                    Rich-Joseph Facun for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Rich-Joseph Facun for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   But COAD's funding for weatherization was delayed months, which jeopardized staffing. \"You can get paid to do similar work in the private sector, and so retaining that staff is already a challenge,\" says Riddlebarger.   Most of the agencies she oversees were able to cover the gap until money finally came through in November. But she says it means squeezing what's supposed to be a year-long program into about half that time \"with the same expectations for performance reporting.\"   Diana Eads' volunteer job with COAD – which includes a small stipend – was also at risk earlier this year, when the Trump administration gutted AmeriCorps grants with little explanation. As part of the AmeriCorps Seniors companion program Eads visits and helps out low-income people.   \"My companions have been elderly, they're not able to get out,\" she says. \"They're just one-step away from nursing home care.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Diana Eads, 74, visits with elderly people as part of the AmeriCorps seniors program. When a funding cut threatened her small stipend for gas money, she told an 88-year-old woman who lives far away that she would keep visiting no matter what.\n                \n                    Rich-Joseph Facun for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Rich-Joseph Facun for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   If they were to land in a nursing home or assisted living, that could cost thousands of dollars a month in Medicaid spending. But Eads helps keep them at home for just $4 dollars an hour, to help cover gas or other small bills.   \n   \"Being rural, my one companion, it's 56 miles roundtrip,\" she says.   Riddlebarger managed to secure local philanthropic funding to keep operating, and after a legal challenge AmeriCorps federal funding was restored.   Through it all Eads reassured her companion, an 88-year old woman she'd been visiting for five years.   \"I told her no matter what happened, I would not stop visiting,\" Eads says. \"That was important.\"   A grim 2026 outlook   After a year struggling to keep serving those most in need, advocates say they don't see much relief in site. Republicans in Congress passed major cuts to Medicaid and SNAP food aid and those will start to take hold.   The Trump administration also is considering dramatic limits to rental assistance and has laid out major cuts to long-term housing for people leaving homelessness, a move that faces a legal challenge.   On top of that, the administration's mass firings and buyouts hit hard in offices that administer various safety-net programs.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Market runs a food pantry and helps connect people with other services.  In December, people seeking an appointment for heating assistance often line up  outside before dawn.\n                \n                    Rich-Joseph Facun for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Rich-Joseph Facun for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Riddlebarger says most anti-poverty funding already falls far short of the need, and making it even harder to help people is exhausting.   \"Not knowing which of our many services we are going to be able to keep operating makes us waste valuable capacity trying to plug holes that shouldn't be holes,\" she says. \"We're just breaking the wheel and reinventing it at a great cost to all parties.\"\n",

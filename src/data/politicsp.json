Trump has said the Cuban government is ready to fall, and that the island would receive no more oil shipments from Venezuela after a U.S. military operation deposed former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.   In its deepening energy and economic crisis, Cuba has relied heavily on foreign assistance and oil shipments from allies like Mexico, Russia, and — previously — Venezuela.   Mexico has sought to balance its long-term support of Cuba's government with pressure from Trump for Latin American leaders to fall in line with his vision for the region.   Sheinbaum said Tuesday that Mexico would continue to show solidarity with Havana, but didn't clarify what kind of support Mexico would offer.   Mexico has faced its own pressure from Washington, as Trump has threatened to take military action against Mexican drug cartels.   Mexico last week transferred dozens of suspected cartel members to the United States to face justice. They were sought by the Trump administration, but Sheinbaum used similar language at the time as she did Tuesday, saying the transfers were made on a sovereign and autonomous basis.   \n   Mexican oil has long acted as a key lifeline for Cuba. In its most recent report, Pemex said it shipped nearly 20,000 barrels of oil per day to Cuba from January through Sept. 30, 2025. That month, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Mexico City. Afterward, Jorge Piñon, an expert at the University of Texas Energy Institute who tracks shipments using satellite technology, said the figure had fallen to about 7,000 barrels.   Sheinbaum has spent weeks saying she would provide clear data on exports to Cuba, but has yet to do so. The Cuban government and Pemex did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   Piñon said that while the future of shipments from Mexico remains uncertain, what was clear is that Sheinbaum is \"walking a tightrope\" between her political rhetoric supporting Cuba and upcoming trade agreement negotiations with the U.S.   Analysts now expect further pressure from Washington to halt those shipments more permanently, given Trump's growing demands that Mexico deliver stronger results in the fight against drug cartels.   Meanwhile, dozens of drivers waited hours in long lines — common on the island — to fill up their cars with gasoline, saying they had heard the news. While some said they weren't particularly worried and said they would find a way forward, others expressed deep anxiety over what the future might hold.   Rolando Graña, 40, spent two hours of his day off in a gas line. For the airport employee, it was a hunt for fuel rather than a day of rest.   \"That's going to affect us a lot more now,\" Graña said.\n",

Kennedy Jr. and Administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Mehmet Oz look on during a rural health roundtable on January 16, 2026 in Washington, DC.\n                \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   A nationwide experiment to give health care in rural America a $50 billion makeover is underway.   The Trump administration, in a late December announcement, revealed how much each state will get under an ambitious 5-year initiative known as the Rural Health Transformation Program.   \"This is a massive effort to change an unfortunate reality that has occurred to rural health care in America,\" Dr. Mehmet Oz, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told reporters as the awards went out, \"which is that your zip code has started to predict your life expectancy.\"   Research shows people are more likely to die younger in rural communities compared to cities, and the disparity has grown over the last three decades.   \n   Congress created this new pot of money last summer. States were given just 52 days to pull together applications and outline how they would use the funding to improve outcomes, grow the rural health care workforce and drive innovation.   Each state is guaranteed $100 million a year over the next five years. The rest of the money was awarded based on a series of factors — including how rural a state is, what states propose to do with the money and whether the states adopt policies aligned with the administration's Make America Healthy Again priorities.   There's bipartisan excitement about rural health finally getting some attention and investment. Democrats and many health policy experts argue, however, that this temporary $50 billion infusion pales in comparison to the roughly $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and Obamacare, also passed by Congress last year.   \"There's a lot of great things in these proposals,\" said Kevin Bennett, director of the Center for Rural and Primary Healthcare at the University of South Carolina. \"But I think if we really wanted to transform [rural health care], they would have gone a lot further.\"   Bennett spoke on a panel about the new funding co-hosted by the healthy policy new organization Tradeoffs and the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics at the University of Pennsylvania.   \n   Here are a few other key things to know about the Rural Health Transformation Program:   Why was the Rural Health Transformation Program created?   Congress added the rural funding to President Trump's massive tax and spending bill — sometimes called the Big Beautiful Bill — passed by Republicans last July. At the last minute, Congress doubled the funds for the program from $25 billion to $50 billion.   The new funding was included in part to satisfy some Republicans lawmakers who feared that major cuts to federal Medicaid funding would threaten the viability of rural hospitals. Nearly 200 rural hospitals have closed since 2005, and another 432 are vulnerable to closure, according to a recent report.   But the Trump administration pushed states to think more broadly about rural health, telling them they can only use up to 15% of this new funding for direct payments to providers.   \"The purpose of this fund is not to pay operating expenses,\" Oz told reporters in December. \"The purpose of this $50 billion investment is to allow us to right-size the system and to deal with the fundamental hindrances of improvement in rural health care.\"   How much money did each state receive?   Awards for the first year range from New Jersey's $147 million to $281 million for Texas.   Large rural states like Texas, Alaska, California and Montana got the most money, but according to an analysis from the health policy research group KFF, some small states like New Jersey, Rhode Island and Massachusetts got significantly more per rural resident.   Paula Chatterjee, a physician and researcher at the University of Pennsylvania did an analysis ahead of the awards being announced that found what she called a \"mismatch\" in how funds were targeted compared to where the greatest rural patient needs are.   \"If you look at where funding per rural resident is going under this program, it's not going to states that have the highest rural mortality rates,\" Chatterjee said at the recent panel. \"It's not going to states that are projected to have the greatest reductions in federal Medicaid spending. It's not going to places that are losing the most hospital beds.\"   \n   How do states plan to use this funding?    A number of states went after the new money to fund more telehealth, deploy artificial intelligence and expand the rural health care workforce.   States took on workforce shortages from many angles. Delaware asked for money to launch a new medical school. Alaska plans to spend funds on housing and child care for its health care workers. California wants to invest in a workforce mapping and planning tool. Many states said they would create more residency and fellowships for doctors and make it easier for nurses, pharmacists and other health workers to do more.   \"A lot of the workforce proposals in these are tried and true methods,\" Bennett said. \"Pipeline development, incentive programs, loan repayment, all of those sorts of things we know can be effective.\"   Will new rural funding make up for expected federal Medicaid cuts?    The same legislation that created the Rural Health Transformation Program also cut federal Medicaid spending by nearly $1 trillion over the next decade. A KFF analysis estimates that $137 billion of those cuts will hit rural areas — nearly triple the amount of the new rural health fund.   Rural health advocates say the looming cuts will leave hospitals struggling to survive, making it difficult to fully take advantage of the rural funding opportunity.   \"It's really hard to think about transformation if you're trying to keep your doors open and employees employed and patients served,\" Bennett said.   What happens next?   CMS launched an Office of Rural Health Transformation, which will oversee the program and offer support to states, according to federal health officials. Most states are planning to have their health departments or Medicaid offices manage their new initiatives.   States are expected to start work on their implementation immediately, with awards for 2027 due to be announced in October 2026.   Some of the money comes with strings. States could get bigger awards by promising to adopt health policies highlighted by the administration in its call for proposals.. But if states fail to pass those policies, they will receive less money in future years and could be forced to repay funds they already received.   \n   According to federal health officials, 24 states promised to reinstate the Presidential Fitness Test in schools; thirty-three states said they already have or would add restrictions to their food assistance programs to make it harder for people to buy soda and other unhealthy items; and 18 states got points for repealing or limiting certificate of need laws, which require health care providers to prove to state regulators that new services or facilities are needed before they can open up shop.   Oz said he sees this as a tool for governors to push policies through potentially uncooperative legislatures.   \"This is not a threat,\" Oz said. \"This is actually an empowering element of the One Big Beautiful Bill.\"\n",

The sweeping changes were made to accelerate development of a new generation of nuclear reactor designs. They occurred over the fall and winter at the Department of Energy, which is currently overseeing a program to build at least three new experimental commercial nuclear reactors by July 4 of this year.   \n   The changes are to departmental orders, which dictate requirements for almost every aspect of the reactors' operations — including safety systems, environmental protections, site security and accident investigations.   NPR obtained copies of over a dozen of the new orders, none of which is publicly available. The orders slash hundreds of pages of requirements for security at the reactors. They also loosen protections for groundwater and the environment and eliminate at least one key safety role. The new orders cut back on requirements for keeping records, and they raise the amount of radiation a worker can be exposed to before an official accident investigation is triggered.   Over 750 pages were cut from the earlier versions of the same orders, according to NPR's analysis, leaving only about one-third of the number of pages in the original documents.    Loading... \n   The new generation of nuclear reactor designs, known as small modular reactors, are being backed by billions in private equity, venture capital and public investments. Backers of the reactors, including tech giants Amazon, Google and Meta, have said they want the reactors to one day supply cheap, reliable power for artificial intelligence. (Amazon and Google are financial supporters of NPR.)   Outside experts who helped review the rules for NPR criticized the decision to revise them without any public knowledge.   \n   \"I would argue that the Department of Energy relaxing its nuclear safety and security standards in secret is not the best way to engender the kind of public trust that's going to be needed for nuclear to succeed more broadly,\" said Christopher Hanson, who chaired the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from 2021 to 2025, when he was fired by President Trump.   \"They're taking a wrecking ball to the system of nuclear safety and security regulation oversight that has kept the U.S. from having another Three Mile Island accident,\" said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"I am absolutely worried about the safety of these reactors.\"   \n   The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment. But in a previous email, it said safety was its top priority.    \"The U.S. Department of Energy is committed to the highest standards of safety in the research and development of nuclear technologies, including the reactor designs utilizing the DOE authorization pathway,\" a department spokesperson wrote to NPR in December.   A new nuclear path   The origins of the changes can be traced to the Oval Office. In May of last year, Trump sat behind the Resolute Desk and signed a series of executive orders on nuclear energy.   \n   \"It's a hot industry, it's a brilliant industry, you have to do it right,\" Trump said as smiling executives from the nuclear industry looked on. \"It's become very safe and environmental, yes 100%.\"   Among the executive orders Trump signed that day was one that called for the creation of a new program at the Department of Energy to build experimental reactors. The document Trump signed explicitly stated that \"The Secretary shall approve at least three reactors pursuant to this pilot program with the goal of achieving [nuclear] criticality in each of the three reactors by July 4, 2026.\"    Loading... \n   In other words, the Department of Energy had just over a year to review, approve and oversee the construction of multiple, untested nuclear reactors.   That timeline has raised eyebrows.   \"To say that it's aggressive is a pretty big understatement,\" said Kathryn Huff, a professor of plasma and nuclear engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who served as head of the DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy from 2022 to 2024. Research reactors typically take at least two years to build from the point when construction begins, Huff said. Few — if any — have been built on the timescale laid out in the executive order.   Officials at the Energy Department knew the clock was ticking. In June, they met with the heads of several companies at the Nuclear Energy Institute, the nuclear industry's main lobby group in Washington, D.C. They briefed the gathering of CEOs, lawyers and nuclear engineers about the department's new \"Reactor Pilot Program.\"   \"One thing I do want to stress, this is not a funding opportunity,\" Michael Goff, the DOE's principal deputy assistant secretary for nuclear energy, said during the meeting, which was recorded. Rather than offering money, the Reactor Pilot Program was promising something else that the companies had long wanted — a pathway to quickly get new test reactor designs through regulatory approval.   \n   \"Our job is to make sure that the government is no longer a barrier,\" said Seth Cohen, a lawyer at the Department of Energy responsible for implementing Trump's executive orders.   The DOE was uniquely positioned to offer a speedy pathway to approval. The nation's commercial nuclear reactors are typically under the regulatory oversight of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Hanson says the NRC is independent and known for its rigor and public process.   Loading...\n   But since the NRC began its work in 1975, the Energy Department has retained the ability to regulate its own reactors, which have historically been used for research and nuclear weapons-related activities.   The rules governing DOE reactors are a mix of federal regulations and directives known as \"orders.\" Changes to federal regulations require public notice and comment, but DOE's orders can be legally changed internally with no public comment period. The orders have historically been made public via a DOE database.   Until now, the DOE's rules have typically applied to just a handful of reactors located on government property. The Reactor Pilot Program expands that regulatory authority to all reactors built as part of the program. Officials explained to the crowd in the June meeting that this includes DOE-contracted reactors built outside of the department's national laboratories.   And while broadening its oversight, officials said, safety personnel located primarily at Idaho National Laboratory would also rewrite the DOE's orders for these reactors.   \"DOE orders and standards are under evaluation as part of this regulatory reform,\" Christian Natoni, an official from DOE's Idaho Operations Office, told the gathering. \"What you will see in the near term is a streamlined set of requirements to support this reactor authorization activity.\"   Rules rewritten   The documents reviewed by NPR show just how extensive the streamlining effort has been.   The new orders strip out some guiding principles of nuclear safety, notably a concept known as \"As Low As Reasonably Achievable\" (ALARA), which requires nuclear reactor operators to keep levels of radiation exposure below the legal limit whenever they can. The ALARA standard has been in use for decades at both the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.   \n   Removing the standard means that new reactors could be constructed with less concrete shielding, and workers could work longer shifts, potentially receiving higher doses of radiation, according to Tison Campbell, a partner at K&L Gates who previously worked as a lawyer at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.   \"So the result could be lower construction costs, saved employment costs and things like that,\" Campbell said. \"That could reduce the overall financial burden of constructing and operating a nuclear powerplant.\"   Huff said that many people in the industry think the concept of ALARA has become overly onerous, and she agrees it's worth reconsidering the standard.   \"The argument against ALARA is that in a lot of cases it's been mismanaged and used overly stringently in ways that go beyond the 'reasonable,'\" Huff said.   But not everyone wants to rethink ALARA.   \"It certainly cost the industry money to lower doses [of radiation],\" said Emily Caffrey, a health physicist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. \"But I don't think it's been incredibly problematic.\"   In a memo issued earlier this month, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright gave approval to end ALARA, in part to \"reduce the economic and operational burden on nuclear energy while aligning with available scientific evidence.\" The existence of the memo was first reported by E&E News.   However, the orders seen by NPR suggest the department had already begun removing the ALARA requirement from the new rules as early as August, months before the secretary's approval was given.   ALARA is not the only safety principle that has been stripped from the orders. Gone too is the requirement to have an engineer designated to each of a reactor's critical safety systems. Known as a cognizant system engineer, the idea is to task one person to take responsibility for understanding each part of a reactor that could lead to a severe accident if it failed.   \n   The new rules also remove a requirement to use the \"best available technology\" to protect water supplies from the discharge of radioactive material.   \"Why wouldn't you be using the best available technology? I don't understand the motivation for cutting things like that,\" Caffrey said.   The revised orders leave out dozens of references to other documents and standards, including the department's entire manual for managing radioactive waste. Some lines from the 59-page manual have been integrated into a new 25-page order on radioactive waste management, but pages of detailed requirements for waste packaging and monitoring have been removed.   But perhaps nowhere are the cuts more obvious than in the new order on safeguards and security. Seven security directives totaling over 500 pages have been consolidated into a single, 23-page order.    Loading... \n   Gone are detailed requirements for firearms training, emergency drills, officer-involved shooting procedures and limits on how many hours security force officers can work in a day or week. Entire chapters specifying how nuclear material should be secured and what sorts of physical barriers should be built to protect it have been reduced to bullet points.   \"Security is an expense that the nuclear industry has long complained about,\" Lyman said. Paying for a guard force is costly and many companies would like to reduce the requirements, he said. \"They don't know why they have to pay so much money to protect against something they think is never going to happen.\"   Reviewing the new security rules, Lyman said he felt the general requirements are allowing companies \"to write their own ticket as far as security goes.\" He's especially concerned because several of the new reactor designs use higher levels of enriched uranium in their cores, which could make them targets of theft.   Loosening protections for the environment and workers   NPR's review of the new orders shows that, in certain cases, they also appear to loosen rules about discharging radioactive material.   \n   For example, the previous version of an order titled \"Radiation Protection for the Public and the Environment\" states that discharging radioactivity \"from DOE activities into non-federally owned sanitary sewers are prohibited,\" then provides a limited series of exceptions.   The new standard says only that radioactive discharges into sanitary sewers \"should be avoided.\" Similar language changes were made to soften restrictions on groundwater discharges, and protections for the environment.   Experts who were asked to review the changes by NPR agreed that the net effect was to loosen the standards.   \"Anywhere they have changed 'prohibited' or 'must' to 'should be' or 'can be' — that is a loosening of regulation. That's a big change in words, in meaning,\" Caffrey said.    Loading... \n   The changes constitute \"very clearly a loosening that I would have wanted to see exposed to public discussion,\" Huff told NPR. She calls the relaxing of environmental rules \"especially disappointing\" because the Idaho National Lab, where several of the reactors are due to be built, has been the site of ecological preservation activities in the past. \"I think some of those preservation activities have had a great positive impact on the ecosystem there,\" she said.   There are signs that the Energy Department is seeking to change safety rules beyond the orders seen by NPR. Last week, the department published a plan to exclude some worker safety standards in order to help the reactor program move more quickly. The proposed rule change would strip out some standards for things like respiratory protection and welding. Because the worker safety rules are part of the Code of Federal Regulations, the department was required by law to publish the proposed changes. The agency said in its notice that the changes \"present significant advantages that can enhance operational efficiency and safety for DOE contractors.\"   Concierge service   The new orders are now being used by around 30 experts across DOE and around a dozen experts on loan from the NRC to conduct design and safety reviews of 11 reactor designs being built by 10 private companies.   \n   Each company also has access to a \"Concierge Team\" to \"provide assistance to the applicant to ensure expeditious processing of its application,\" according to a memo also obtained by NPR, which has not been made public.   The team is made up of \"representatives from the Secretary's office, the Office of the General Counsel, the Office of Nuclear Energy\" and each team member reports directly to the secretary of energy — raising the possibility that senior officials could exert pressure on lower-level staff to speed safety evaluations of the new reactors.   Reactors by July   Ultimately, experts who viewed the new rules had doubts about whether they really would help the Reactor Pilot Program reach its goal of building three new reactors by July.   Hanson said he believes the numerous cuts to the new orders will not necessarily simplify the review process. One of the benefits of having things explicitly written down was that \"contractors and others knew how to comply with the rules,\" he said. \"If you take that away, you might have more flexibility, maybe, but it's also less clear how to do that.\"   The orders also clearly laid out the steps needed to ensure companies abided by other relevant laws, Campbell said. He worries that the rewrites that loosen rules on things like radiological discharges could actually lead companies to violate other environmental and safety laws. For example, radiological releases into public sewers might violate legal limits under the Clean Water Act.   Companies may not read those underlying laws, \"so I think you're setting them up to violate statutes or regulations that are going to remain in place,\" he said.   But above all, the fact that the rewrites were done without public knowledge could be the most damaging, said Huff. In the past, public distrust has been a huge barrier to the development of nuclear power, and transparency is an important way to counter that mistrust.   \n   \"In the best world, the public should expect as much openness from the government as is possible,\" she said. \"If it's possible to share with the companies at this point, then there's a really important question as to why it's not public.\"   \n",

Pretti's death at the hands of immigration officers escalated tensions surrounding the Trump administration's immigration enforcement surge, and has already prompted bipartisan calls for an investigation. Pretti was the second U.S. citizen killed by immigration officers in Minneapolis this month.   According to the preliminary assessment, Customs and Border Protection officers said Pretti resisted arrest before two officers shot him.   \n   But the assessment makes no mention of Pretti attacking officers or threatening them with a weapon — as the administration first described the incident. It also appears to more closely match multiple bystander video and witness testimony of the incident.   The preliminary assessment of Pretti's shooting, known as a death notification, was shared by congressional sources not authorized to speak publicly, and reviewed by NPR. It was based on body-worn camera footage and documentation from the agency, it said.   The CBP assessment describes how officers were initially confronted by two women who were blowing whistles while they conducted an immigration enforcement operation.   \"The [officer] pushed them both away and one of the females ran to a male, later identified as 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a US citizen. The [officer] attempted to move the woman and Pretti out of the roadway. The woman and Pretti did not move,\" the review states, adding that the officer then sprayed both with oleoresin capsicum spray, commonly known as pepper spray.   \n   CBP officers attempted to take Pretti into custody. Pretti resisted their efforts and a struggle ensued, according to the report.   During the struggle, an agent yelled, \"He's got a gun!\" multiple times, the review states.   Approximately five seconds later, one agent discharged his CBP-issued Glock 19 and an officer also discharged his CBP-issued Glock 47 at Pretti. After the shooting, an agent advised that he had Pretti's firearm in his possession, the review states.   Asked about the CBP report on Tuesday, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller in a statement said that the \"extra personnel sent to Minnesota for force protection should be used to create a physical barrier between arrest teams and the disruptors,\" and officials are are examining whether protocol was followed on the scene of Pretti's shooting.   \n   But right after the shooting, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was quick to describe Pretti's actions as \"domestic terrorism,\" saying Pretti was \"attacking\" officers and \"brandishing\" a weapon before he was killed. And Miller in a post described Pretti as a \"would-be-assassin.\"   \n   Multiple bystander videos and witness testimony contradict the government's initial portrayal of the incident. Pretti can be seen holding only a phone in his hand before at least six officers tackle him, pinning him face down on the ground and shooting him in the back, firing what sounds like 10 shots.   One eyewitness said in a court document that Pretti was not even facing agents when they grabbed him. \"It didn't look like he was trying to resist, just trying to help [a] woman up,\" they wrote.   Noem has come under bipartisan scrutiny for her quick characterization of the incident.   In Washington, Democrats are pushing to block funding for the Homeland Security Department, and several other agencies, after the shooting and the administration's response. Several Republicans, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and John Curtis of Utah, also criticized Noem's immediate effort to blame Pretti, and others called for an investigation.   \n   The assessment of Pretti's death was conducted by an internal Customs and Border Protection oversight office known as the Office of Professional Responsibility; it cautions that any information may be updated as more details come to light.   Homeland Security Investigations, a branch of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is investigating the incident. It's also under review by the Office of Professional Responsibility's Investigative Operations Directorate, which investigates employee misconduct.   The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General was also notified about Pretti's death, according to the assessment.\n",

Scott Applewhite/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Secretary of State Marco Rubio is testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about the U.S. military operation that ousted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and outlining Washington's strategy moving forward.   In his opening remarks Rubio pushed back on claims that the U.S. is at war with Venezuela.    \"There is no war against Venezuela, and we did not occupy a country. There are no U.S. troops on the ground,\" framing the mission as a targeted law enforcement action rather than a military occupation.   Rubio says the U.S. will help Venezuela transition from what he calls a \"criminal state\" into a responsible international partner and is closely monitoring the former vice president, now interim leader Delcy Rodríguez, who has pledged to open Venezuela's energy sector to American companies.    \n   But Rubio also signaled a hard line if cooperation breaks down. \"Make no mistake, as the President has stated, we are prepared to use force to ensure maximum cooperation if other methods fail,\" Rubio said.   Democrats on the committee are challenging the legality, cost, and fallout of the operation. In her prepared remarks ranking committee member Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., acknowledged Maduro's record but questioned the decision to seize him. \"Nicolás Maduro was bad for Venezuela, for the region and for the United States. The question is, was the raid to arrest him worth it?\"    Shaheen also criticized the ongoing U.S. naval blockade, saying it is costing American taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.   The hearing marks Rubio's highest-profile test yet on Venezuela policy, as lawmakers press for clarity on the long-term U.S. strategy in the region.   This is a developing story and will be updated.\n",

Minnesota strong.— Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) January 28, 2026 \n   \n   As Omar continued her remarks at the town hall, she said: \"We are Minnesota strong and we will stay resilient in the face of whatever they might throw at us.\"    President Trump, who has frequently derided Omar, accused her without evidence of staging the attack. \"She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her,\" he said in a phone interview Tuesday night with ABC News. Trump told ABC News' Rachel Scott that he had not seen video of the incident. \"I haven't seen it. No, no. I hope I don't have to bother.\"   Just three days ago, fellow Democrat Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida said he was assaulted at the Sundance Festival by a man \"who told me that Trump was going to deport me before he punched me in the face.\"    Threats against congressional lawmakers have been rising. Last year, there was an increase in security funding in the wake of growing concerns about political violence in the country.   According to the U.S. Capitol Police, the number of threat assessment cases has increased for the third year in a row. In 2025, the USCP investigated 14,938 \"concerning statements, behaviors, and communications\" directed toward congressional lawmakers, their families and staff. That figure represents a nearly 58% increase from 2024. \n",

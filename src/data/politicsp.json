Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the 6-3 opinion. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh dissented.    Writing for the court's majority, Chief Justice John Roberts said Trump lacked the peacetime authority to use IEPPA to pose tariffs.    \"In light of the breadth, history, and constitutional context of that asserted authority, he must identify clear congressional authorization to exercise it,\" Robert wrote, concluding Trump has not.   \n   Trump had argued persistent trade imbalances and the flood of fentanyl coming into the country presented national emergencies and pose a threat to national security.   During arguments before the court last year, Trump's lawyers had said the president possessed the authority to issue tariffs. Roberts rejected that argument. \"When Congress grants the power to impose tariffs, it does so clearly and with careful constraints,\" he wrote. \"It did neither here.\"   Justice Kavanaugh, who wrote the principal dissent, noted that the court's decision had opened up a can of worms.   \"The United Sates may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers who paid the IEEPA tariffs, even though some importers may have already passed on costs to consumers or others,\" he wrote.   As of last December, the government collected more than $130 billion in revenue from the tariffs. Kavanaugh pointed out that the \"Court says nothing today about whether, and if so how, the government should go about returning the billions of dollars that it has collected from importers.\"   At issue in the case was the implementation of Trump's campaign pledge to impose massive tariffs on foreign imports. After his inauguration, Trump issued an executive order that initially imposed a tariff of at least 10% on goods from most countries doing business with the United States. Goods from countries like China have been hit with much higher tariffs — up to 145%, though they have since come down. Imports from allies like Canada and Mexico have been taxed at 25%; Canada's rate was later increased to 35%.    \n   But the up-and-down, fluctuating tariffs around the world spooked American businesses, prompting a court challenge, contending that the president had exceeded his authority in imposing the tariffs.   In some two dozen previous cases, the Supreme Court has been largely receptive to Trump's claims of presidential authority, but those victories came on the Supreme Court's emergency docket, allowing Trump policies to take effect on a temporary basis while the litigation played out in the lower courts.   In contrast, the tariff cases are the real deal, with the court having ordered full briefing and expedited arguments in the case, and offering the justices the first real opportunity to say \"no\" to the president.     On Friday, the justices did just that.   This is a developing story and will be updated. \n",

Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, \"I don't know if they're real or not,\" and said of Obama, \"I may get him out of trouble by declassifying.\"   \n   In a post on his social media platform Thursday night, Trump said he was directing government agencies to release files related \"to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters.\"   Obama, who made his comments in a podcast appearance over the weekend, later clarified that he had not seen evidence that aliens \"have made contact with us,\" but said, \"statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there's life out there.\"   Trump told reporters Thursday that when it came to the prospect of extraterrestrial visitors: \"I don't have an opinion on it. I never talk about it. A lot of people do. A lot of people believe it.\"   Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump suggested this week that he was ready to speak about it, however, when she said on a podcast that the president had a speech prepared to deliver on aliens that he would give at the \"right time.\"   That was news to the White House. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded with a laugh when she was asked about it Wednesday and told reporters, \"A speech on aliens would be news to me.\"   \n   Public interest in unidentified flying objects and the possibility of the government hiding secrets of extraterrestrial life remerged in the public consciousness after a group of former Pentagon and government officials leaked Navy videos of unknown objects to The New York Times and Politico in 2017. The renewed scrutiny prompted Congress to hold the first hearings on UFOs in 50 years in May 2022, though officials said that the objects, which appeared to be green triangles floating above a Navy ship, were likely drones.   Since then the Pentagon has promised more transparency on the topic. In July 2022 it created the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, or AARO, which was intended to be a central place to collect reports of all military UFO encounters, taking over from a department task force.   In 2023, Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, the head of AARO at the time, told reporters he didn't have any evidence \"of any program having ever existed as a to do any sort of reverse engineering of any sort of extraterrestrial (unidentified aerial phenomena).\"   The information that has been made public shows that the vast majority of UFO reports made by the military go unsolved but the ones that are identified are largely benign in nature.   An 18-page unclassified report submitted to Congress in June 2024 said service members had made 485 reports of unidentified phenomena in the past year but 118 cases were found to be \"prosaic objects such as various types of balloons, birds, and unmanned aerial systems.\"   \"It is important to underscore that, to date, AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology,\" the report stressed.\n",

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The renovations are more modest in scale and scope than what President Trump has publicly outlined for the revamped arts center, and it is unclear whether or not these plans are the extent of the intended renovations.   The email was sent on Feb. 2 by Brooks Boeke, the director of the Friends of the Kennedy Center volunteer program, to tour leaders and some staffers at the arts complex. In a response to NPR emailed Tuesday, Roma Daravi, the Kennedy Center's vice president of public relations, wrote: \"The Trump Kennedy Center has been completely transparent about the renovations needed to restore and revitalize the institution, ever since these proposals were unveiled for Congressional approval last summer. The changes that the Center will undergo as part of this intensive beautification and restoration project are critical to saving the building, enhancing the patron experience and transforming America's cultural center into a world-class destination.\"   \n   The center's closure was announced after many prominent artists canceled their planned appearances, saying that the Trump administration had politicized the arts. The Washington National Opera, which had been a resident organization at the Kennedy Center, left its home there last month, citing a \"financially challenging relationship\" under the center's current leadership; The Washington Post, in an analysis of Kennedy Center ticket sales last October, reported that ticket sales had plummeted since Trump became the center's chairman – even before the complex's board renamed the venue as the Trump-Kennedy Center in December.   In her memo, Boeke cited Carissa Faroughi, the Kennedy Center's director of the program management office. Boeke said that upcoming renovations to the complex's Concert Hall will include replacing seating and installing marble armrests, which President Trump touted on his Truth Social platform in December as \"unlike anything ever done or seen before!\" Other changes include new carpeting, replacement of the wood flooring on the Concert Hall stage and \"strategic painting.\"   The planned changes to the Grand Foyer, Hall of States and Hall of Nations include a change of color scheme, from the current red carpeting and seating to \"black with a gold pattern.\" The carpeting and furnishings in these three areas and its electrical outlets were redone just two years ago, according to the Kennedy Center, and were accomplished without interrupting performances and programming.   \n   Other planned work on the complex include upgrades of the HVAC, safety and electrical systems as well as improving parking. It is unclear whether these plans are the extent of the intended renovations; Daravi declined to answer that specific question.   The scope of the project as outlined in the memo differs sharply from public statements by President Trump, who said earlier this month on social media and in exchanges with the press that he intends a \"complete rebuilding\" and large-scale changes to the Kennedy Center, and that the arts complex is \"dilapidated\" and \"dangerous\" in its current state.   \n   Earlier this month, Trump said that a two-year shutdown of the Kennedy Center is necessary to execute these renovations. This idea was echoed by the center's president, Richard Grenell. Grenell wrote on X that the Kennedy Center \"desperately needs this renovation and temporarily closing the Center just makes sense - it will enable us to better invest our resources, think bigger and make the historic renovations more comprehensive.\"   On Feb. 1, Trump announced his plans to close the center entirely for two years \"for Construction, Revitalization, and Complete Rebuilding\" to create what he said \"can be, without question, the finest Performing Arts Facility of its kind, anywhere in the World.\" He later said that the project would cost around $200 million. The announcement came after many prominent artists had canceled their existing scheduled appearances at the Kennedy Center.\n",

Opponents say the legislation would disenfranchise millions of voters.   The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act — now dubbed the SAVE America Act — narrowly passed the U.S. House last week, with all Republicans and one Democrat backing the bill.   Its approval came about 10 months after House Republicans last passed the SAVE Act.   The measure, which would transform voter registration and voting across the country, faces persistent hurdles in the GOP-led Senate due to Democratic disapproval and the 60-vote threshold to clear the legislative filibuster. Some Republicans have called for maneuvering around the filibuster to pass the legislation, but GOP leadership has been cool to the idea.   \n   The overhaul would require eligible voters to provide proof of citizenship — like a valid U.S. passport, or a birth certificate plus valid photo identification — when registering to vote. The new iteration adds a requirement that voters also provide photo ID when casting their ballot.   \"This bill takes a strong piece of legislation, the SAVE Act, and makes it even stronger in the SAVE America Act,\" Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis., chair of the Committee on House Administration, said in prepared remarks on Capitol Hill last week.   It's already illegal for non-U.S. citizens to vote in federal elections, and proven instances of fraud — including by noncitizens — are vanishingly rare.   But Steil and other Republicans say current law, which requires sworn attestation of citizenship under penalty of perjury, is not strong enough, and documentary proof is needed.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis., speaks during a House Rules Committee meeting about the SAVE America Act on Feb. 10. At right is Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y.\n                \n                    Samuel Corum/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Samuel Corum/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Some states already take steps to verify citizenship for newly registered voters. And three dozen states also require voters to show an ID to cast a ballot, with some mandating it be a photo ID, while others allow additional options, such as a bank statement.   Democrats and voting rights advocates say the new SAVE Act is even worse than the prior iteration, and that the legislation's two main identification requirements would make voting notably more difficult for tens of millions of Americans who don't have easy access to necessary personal documentation. About half of Americans didn't have a passport as of 2023, for instance.   \n   The measure's provisions would take effect immediately, a prospect that opponents see as placing an unfair burden on voters and election officials right before millions are set to cast midterm ballots, and without extra funding. Those election officials would also face criminal penalties, including imprisonment, for registering voters without proof of citizenship.   The bill's prospects appear slim in the Senate, even as Trump and members of his administration ramp up public messaging in favor of the overhaul — often by pointing to polling that shows 8 in 10 Americans support the proof-of-citizenship and photo ID provisions.   \n   Trump tried to overturn his 2020 election loss and has long railed baselessly about corrupt elections, and many of the president's opponents see the push for the SAVE bill as intertwined with his efforts to raise doubts about voting and interfere with this year's midterms.   Michael Waldman, head of the Brennan Center of Justice, which advocates for expanded voting access, described the measure as \"Trump's power grab in legislative garb.\"   Trump raised alarms by suggesting recently that Republicans should \"nationalize\" elections, and last week he teased a new executive order, writing on social media: \"There will be Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!\"   The U.S. Constitution grants states and Congress control over election rules, and a 2025 executive order from Trump, which sought to require proof of citizenship for voter registration, has been halted by federal judges who say the order's provisions exceed a president's authority.   Here are four new items in the new SAVE Act:   1. The photo ID provision only lists valid U.S. passports, driver's licenses, state IDs, military IDs and tribal IDs as acceptable. Voters who do not present one must vote provisionally and return in three days with an ID, or sign an affidavit that says they have \"a religious objection to being photographed.\"    \n   Notably, people who don't vote in person must also submit a copy of a valid photo ID.   2. The legislation includes new guidelines for name discrepancies in proof-of-citizenship documents. That includes, per the bill, \"an affidavit signed by the applicant attesting that the name on the documentation is a previous name of the applicant.\"    This nods at one criticism of the measure, which is that tens of millions of women changed their name after getting married, and so their current names don't match their birth certificate.   3. The measure provides exemptions for absent service members and their families.   \n   4. The bill requires each state to submit its voter list to the Department of Homeland Security for comparison with the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) system.   The Trump administration has overhauled SAVE, turning it into a de facto national citizenship system. Despite privacy and data accuracy concerns, a number of states have eagerly used the new SAVE tool to try to identify and remove noncitizens on their voter rolls. But SAVE has erroneously flagged U.S. citizens too.\n",

NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben reports he loudly promoted tariffs, a policy that half the country says is hurting them.DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Trump has been giving a series of speeches meant to show that he's working to ease the high cost of living. In this speech, he declared victory over it.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Do you notice, what word have you not heard over the last two weeks? Affordability. Because I've won. I've won affordability. I had to go out and talk about it.KURTZLEBEN: At a steel manufacturer in Rome, Georgia, Trump both talked affordability and touted his tariff policies, setting up conflicting messages, given that studies show U.S. consumers and businesses are overwhelmingly paying the tariffs. Trump talked about how his tariffs helped this manufacturer in particular.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: I imposed powerful 50% tariffs on foreign steel, where they were coming in and dumping crap all over our country. I ended every one of the Biden-era exemptions. And on August 18, I added new tariffs to cover 400 derivative products, including steel racks, which is what you make.KURTZLEBEN: But that message might not fly everywhere. Half of Americans, including around 2 in 10 Republicans, say they think Trump's tariffs affect themselves and their families mostly negatively, according to a recent Pew Research Center poll. Trump is nevertheless committed to his signature economic policy and seems nervous about how the Supreme Court will rule on it.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: And to think I have to be in the United States Supreme Court for many, many months, waiting for a decision on tariffs.KURTZLEBEN: The Supreme Court is set to rule on many of Trump's tariffs any day now. For the most part, the speech was a replay of Trump's greatest hits. He repeated baseless claims of election fraud. He promoted Republicans and slammed Democrats, calling House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries low IQ. And he promised that the economy is only going to get better.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: We brought back the American dream, and we have a country, I think, that within the next 12 months, maybe sooner, but within the next 12 months, going to be the greatest it's ever been.KURTZLEBEN: But Trump had little to say about further cost-lowering policies he has floated, like a cap on credit card interest rates. So while he promised an improving economy, he didn't say exactly how that will happen.Danielle Kurtzleben, NPR News.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The agency wants to ban families with any undocumented member from federally subsidized housing.\n                \n                    Kent Nishimura/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kent Nishimura/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   WASHINGTON, D.C. — The Department of Housing and Urban Development wants to ban families with any member who is undocumented from living in federally subsidized housing. A proposed rule also would require local housing authorities to report any tenant not eligible for rental aid to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.   It's part of a broader Trump administration crackdown on immigration, and in an opinion column in the Washington Post Thursday HUD Secretary Scott Turner called for \"ending the era of illegal aliens and other ineligible noncitizens exploiting public housing resources.\"   Undocumented immigrants do not get federal rental aid, but they can live with family members who do, including many U.S.-born children. In his column, Turner said roughly 24,000 such residents in are in HUD-subsidized housing. He and some other conservatives argue that is unfair, given limited funding and long waitlists for HUD housing.    \n   Most non-citizens with permanent legal status are eligible for housing aid. If the rule becomes law, housing authorities in large cities with lots of immigrants, like New York and Los Angeles, would see the biggest impact.   \"Trump's proposal runs contrary to federal law and is designed to instill fear and hardship on immigrant families,\" Shamus Roller, executive director of the National Housing Law Project, said in a statement. \"His administration deflects blame for the housing crisis onto immigrants so they can continue dismantling HUD's hallmark and lifesaving housing programs.\"   HUD proposed a similar rule change late in Trump's first term, to heated opposition from immigrant and housing advocates. It was not finalized before the COVID-19 pandemic shifted the Trump administration's focus, and the Biden administration rescinded it.   If the new proposal were enacted, a recent analysis by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities calculates nearly 80,000 people would face eviction, including nearly 37,000 U.S. citizen children.   Tens of thousands of U.S. citizen children could face eviction or family separation   Over the past year, Turner has repeatedly suggested that undocumented immigrants are taking advantage of public housing benefits and cheating Americans. The headline of the agency's news release announcing the proposed rule said, \"Illegals, Ineligibles and Fraudsters, Pack Your Bags,\" with emojis of a waving hand, a purse and a plane.   \n   Local housing agencies say they are following longstanding, bipartisan policy.    \"Public housing authorities are faithful stewards of taxpayer dollars,\" La Shelle Dozier, CEO of the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities, said in a statement to NPR. She added that they are committed to ensuring access to housing for \"America's most vulnerable families.\"   Such a change would leave families who've been in the U.S. for decades facing tough choices.   \"We were really planning on staying here,\" said one woman who lives in public housing in Los Angeles but asked that her name not be used for fear of being targeted for deportation. \"Our family is our kids, and this is where they grew up.\"   She and her husband came to the U.S. from Mexico nearly three decades ago. She cleans houses, her husband is a butcher, and she says they've been in the process of trying to legalize their immigration status. One son came with them when he was young, and that allowed him certain rights under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which has protected such people from deportation. But the Trump administration has been rolling those back, recently urging \"Dreamers\" to self-deport.   The woman said they've talked with their children about the possibility of being separated or having to move to her home country.   \"They've seen photos and videos and have spoken with family, but they don't really know anything about Mexico,\" she said. She's also not sure family members there would be able to house them.   She worries most for her younger kids, who are still teenagers and would not be able to stay on their own in the U.S.    \"They might not have a place to call home and to come back to,\" she said.   Conservatives say federal aid is so limited that housing people here illegally is wrong   The Republican policy guide Project 2025 put out by the Heritage Foundation called for the mixed-status rule, stating that \"HUD's statutory obligations include providing housing for American citizens who are in need.\" It suggested local governments or nonprofits could help noncitizens.   \n   Some conservatives argue it's not fair to house people who entered the country illegally, especially when federal rental assistance already falls far short of need. Only about 1 in 4 Americans who qualify for such aid are actually able to get it, and waitlists are often years-long.   \"It makes sense to change the policy for potential new tenants — both to be fair to those on waiting lists and to limit a financial incentive for illegal immigration,\" Howard Husock of the American Enterprise Institute wrote in the New York Post last year.   But he added that it's not practical to evict non-citizens currently living in subsidized housing, \"who were party to legal leases signed with public agencies. ICE agents have enough to do without raiding the projects.\"   The change would be costly since mixed-status families pay more   Immigrant and housing advocates point out that because undocumented tenants get no subsidy, mixed-status families pay significantly higher rent and effectively subsidize others.   \"The net result is to make more housing available for everyone, including people who are on the waiting list,\" says Marie Claire Tran-Leung with the National Housing Law Project, a housing law and advocacy center.   She also worries that evicting mixed-status families would worsen poverty and homelessness at a time when local governments already struggle with a record-high number of people living outside or in shelters.   Another public housing resident in LA, who also did not want her name used for fear of deportation, says it would be devastating if her family could not stay where they are. She's Mexican, her husband is Guatemalan, and all four of their children were born in the U.S.   \"The government doesn't want people living on the streets, but we won't have any other option,\" she said.   They applied for rental aid after the bathroom ceiling in their former apartment caved in, she said. Two children have health issues that keep her from working full time. Her husband is a day laborer, a job that's become more precarious since Immigrations and Customs Enforcement stepped up raids and arrests in Los Angeles.   \n   \"We have to focus on saving so that we can take care of our kids,\" she said.   Starting Friday, the HUD proposal will be open for public comment for 60 days. The agency is required to take comments into account before issuing a final version of the rule. In Trump's first term, Tran-Leung says 30,000 comments were overwhelmingly against the measure, which could factor into a potential legal challenge.\n",

Trump called the justices who opposed his tariffs \"fools\" and \"lapdogs,\" charging that they were acting because of liberal partisanship, though three of those ruling against him were appointed by Republican presidents and two were Trump appointees.   \"I think it is deeply disappointing, and I'm ashamed of certain members of the court, absolutely ashamed for not having the courage to do what's right for our country,\" he said.   The court, in a 6-to-3 decision, found that a law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not authorize the president to impose tariffs.   \n   The ruling was the president's most significant defeat at the Supreme Court since he returned to office, and it threatens to upend one of Trump's favorite and most powerful tools of his economic and foreign policy agenda.   The decision injects even more uncertainty into the future of tariffs, but Trump made clear that he has no plans on giving up on his agenda.   Calling it his \"favorite word in the dictionary,\" Trump has repeatedly credited his use of tariffs with helping him stop wars and pressure world leaders to bend to U.S. interests.   He boasted about the economic benefits. A recent Congressional Budget Office report found that tariffs were expected to help reduce the deficit by about $3 trillion over a decade. But that same report found that U.S. consumers — not foreign companies — were paying the vast majority of that money.   But while talking with reporters Friday, Trump sought to put a positive spin on the court decision. He said that it would provide certainty for the U.S. economy and that he plans to seek alternatives, which he laid out specifically.   \"Their decision's incorrect. But it doesn't matter, because we have very powerful alternatives that have been approved by this decision,\" he said.   \n   Trump cited a dissent written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who listed laws that the administration could pursue, including \"the Trade Act of 1974, sections 122, 201, 301, and the Tariff Act of 1930, section 338.\"   He acknowledged that those processes may be more cumbersome, but had stronger legal standing. He also cited Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which allows the president to impose tariffs to address trade deficits. But those tariffs are limited to 15% and for only 150 days, after which Congress would have to approve them.   \"While I am sure that they did not mean to do so, the Supreme Court's decision today made the president's ability to both regulate trade and impose tariffs more powerful and more crystal clear, rather than less. I don't think they meant that. I'm sure they didn't,\" Trump said.   And he said he would sign an executive order later Friday to continue certain tariffs under alternative authorities, including adding a \"10% global tariff.\"   That order would also eventually need approval from Congress, after 150 days, which could be difficult with an election approaching.   Republicans are facing pressure from constituents about high costs and a business community that is afraid to invest with all the economic uncertainty.   A recent NPR/Marist poll finds that a majority of Americans — 56% — feel tariffs or fees on imported products from other countries hurts the U.S. economy.   The former Senate majority leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell, praised the Supreme Court's decision.   \"Congress' role in trade policy, as I have warned repeatedly, is not an inconvenience to avoid,\" the Kentucky Republican said. \"If the executive would like to enact trade policies that impact American producers and consumers, its path forward is crystal clear: Convince their representatives under Article I\" of the Constitution.   But Trump, who has expressed frustration with gridlock in Congress, expressed confidence that he would continue to be able to employ tariffs unilaterally.   \n   \"Foreign countries that have been ripping us off for years are ecstatic,\" Trump said. \"They are so happy and they're dancing in the streets. But they won't be dancing for long. That I can assure you.\"\n",

Refugees must either get a green card within a year, or \"present themselves to the agency\" to avoid detention, according to a Feb. 18 memo from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.   The move marks yet another attempt from the Trump administration to further limit legal pathways to resettle in the United States. The administration last year set the lowest-ever cap for refugees it would admit into the U.S.   \n   And USCIS later announced that it would re-review the status of everyone who had been admitted into the U.S. as a refugee under the Biden administration, essentially reopening those cases and risking the loss of legal refugee status.   \"This policy is a transparent effort to detain and potentially deport thousands of people who are legally present in this country, people the U.S. government itself welcomed after years of extreme vetting,\" said Beth Oppenheim, CEO of HIAS, one of the resettlement organizations. \"They were promised safety and the chance to rebuild their lives. Instead, DHS is now threatening them with arrest and indefinite detention.\"   The memo was filed as a part of documents submitted in a federal court case tied to refugees who were arrested in Minnesota. In it, USCIS Director Joseph Edlow and ICE acting Director Todd Lyons direct their agencies to \"detain and inspect\" refugees who do not \"voluntarily return to DHS custody for inspection and examination\" to be a legal permanent resident at the one-year mark of being in the country.   \n   The policy rescinds prior guidance that did not treat the failure to apply for a green card as grounds for deportation. It also states that refugees may be placed in immigration detention while their application for a green card is being considered. The agency leaders say the new policy is needed to prevent immigration fraud, identify national security threats and vet people for criminal histories.   \"This detain-and-inspect requirement ensures that refugees are re-vetted after one year, aligns post-admission vetting with that applied to other applicants for admission, and promotes public safety,\" the memo states.   \n   DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the policy.   \n   The new policy sent shockwaves through an already weakened refugee resettlement system. In the past 12 months, the Trump administration has cut off key funding to organizations that assist refugees resettling in the U.S., including services that help with green card and citizenship applications. Refugees are required to apply for permanent residence, or a green card, after they've been in the country for at least a year.   Refugee resettlement organizations estimate this new policy could impact tens of thousands of refugees, mostly those who entered during the Biden administration. After going through extensive vetting to arrive in the U.S., they will now fear they could be affected by delays in processing at USCIS.   Shawn VanDiver, president of the organization AfghanEvac, called the memo \"a reckless reversal of long-standing policy\" that treats refugee admission as conditional.   \n   \"It breaks faith with people the United States lawfully admitted and promised protection,\" he said.   Groups that work with refugees warn there are several reasons why refugees may not have adjusted status quickly after arriving in the U.S., including a complex immigration system and backlogs at USCIS itself.   In fiscal year 2025, 38,000 refugees were resettled into the U.S. For this fiscal year, the Trump administration set a historic low ceiling for refugee admissions of 7,500, with the priority for admission going to white South Africans.   The memo was filed in Minnesota federal court as a part of an ongoing lawsuit over the revetting, arrest and detention of refugees who have not yet received a green card. Last month, a federal judge ordered the release of refugees in Minnesota and granted a temporary pause on detentions, which he said had been made \"without warrants or cause,\" while the case played out.   The arrests came after USCIS in January launched an investigation into 5,600 refugees in Minnesota, who had not yet received their green cards, and swiftly began referring cases to ICE.\n",

Today's top stories   President Trump convenes the first-ever meeting of the Board of Peace today at the Donald J. Trump U.S. Institute for Peace in Washington. The president says he created the group to oversee his Gaza ceasefire plan and that member states have already pledged $5 billion for Gaza's reconstruction. At today's event, Trump will address heads of state and top diplomats from around 40 countries, including the European Union.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                People snap photos outside the United States Peace Institute, with the recently added name of President Trump.\n                \n                    Allison Robbert/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Allison Robbert/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Today's meeting is significant because the next steps in the ceasefire deal that Trump pushed through last October remain unclear, NPR's Aya Batrawy tells Up First. Additionally, officials could unveil which countries made the initial pledges for reconstruction efforts. The $5 billion commitment is only a fraction of what Gaza needs. The money would go toward the Trump administration's vision for a new Gaza under Israeli control and not to the area where Palestinians are living, Batrawy says. Currently, Israeli forces occupy over half of Gaza, leaving some 2 million Palestinians in dire conditions in a sliver by the sea that Hamas governs. Among the topics that nations could discuss today is a crucial step in Trump's ceasefire plan, which involves the deployment of thousands of international troops into Gaza.   \n   U.K. police have arrested a man in his 60s on suspicion of \"misconduct in public office.\" U.K. media reports that this man is Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew. Police have investigated whether Mountbatten-Windsor shared confidential government information with his late friend, convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, while he was U.K.'s trade envoy. Mountbatten-Windsor admits to ties to Epstein and settled a lawsuit with one of Epstein's underage victims, but denies wrongdoing. The media spotted several vehicles at the royals' Sandringham estate this morning, NPR's Lauren Frayer, who is in London, confirms. Mountbatten-Windsor turns 66 today. He has been living at the estate since being evicted from his royal cottage on the grounds of Windsor Castle.   The U.S. has concluded another round of talks in an effort to end the war in Ukraine. While the White House pressures Kyiv to make concessions, it is negotiating with Moscow. Today, Russia's negotiator offered $14 trillion in deals if the U.S. drops its sanctions.    🎧 Russia is tempting the White House with huge potential profits because the Kremlin knows the Trump administration views diplomacy through a business lens, NPR's Charles Maynes says. Moscow suggests that lifting sanctions and achieving \"peace\" would unlock American investment in rare earth minerals, energy, and mining. Russia continues to insist its victory in Ukraine is inevitable, despite the glacial pace of its gains and heavy battlefield losses. Russia's talking points are designed to convince Trump that Ukraine's surrender serves everyone's interests. Ukraine continues to refuse demands to surrender territory.   \n   Trump is demanding billions of dollars from his own government by filing multiple claims against the Justice Department. He argues that past investigations and the leak of his tax returns years ago hurt him. Now, he has forced his own political appointees to decide whether to pay their boss with taxpayer funds. These claims amount to unfinished business for the president, says a White House official, who was not authorized to speak on the record.

The action prompted outcry over the racist trope. The White House deleted the post, and Trump deflected the blame to an aide. Scholars and civil rights advocates, steeped in the language and aesthetics of white nationalism, find the post to be part of an overtly racist trope. They say it fits a year-long pattern where extremist rhetoric, visual material and other media have found their way into public messaging from federal agencies.    ➡️ The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is behind the most notable examples of extremist themes in federal messages, some extremist researchers say. The agency has generated a body of propaganda in its effort to recruit large numbers of new federal agents.➡️ Researchers cite the characterization of immigration as an \"invasion,\" federal calls to \"defend the homeland\" and the promotion of \"remigration\" as examples where the administration has mainstreamed once-fringe concepts.➡️ The Trump administration dismissed connections between its messages and white nationalist movements. A DHS spokesperson suggested NPR is \"manufacturing outrage\" when responding to questions about the connections.

    "body": "\n      President Trump announces 10 billion dollars for rebuilding Gaza at the first meeting of his \"Board of Peace\"   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  President Trump has promised $10 billion from the United States to rebuild Gaza. And he says other countries are pitching in an additional 7 billion that will be managed by what he calls his Board of Peace. Trump held its first board meeting here in Washington today, just across the street from the State Department, at a building the administration calls the Donald J. Trump U.S. Institute of Peace. NPR's Michele Kelemen reports.MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: The stage was set like a television pledge drive. President Trump, at center stage, introduced many of the world leaders there, endorsing Hungary's Viktor Orban who faces a tough reelection campaign, and Argentina's President Javier Milei. Even the head of FIFA, the world soccer federation, was there to announce soccer fields for Gaza.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This is the most prestigious board ever put together. You know, I've seen some great corporate boards. I've seen some great boards, period. It's peanuts compared to this board.KELEMEN: The nearly 50-minute speech was meandering at times.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: I don't like young, handsome men. Women - it's - I like.KELEMEN: Trump said it was Secretary of State Marco Rubio who took over the venue, the U.S. Institute of Peace building, and put Trump's name on it.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Marco named it after me. I had nothing to do with it. I swear I didn't.KELEMEN: Once he got down to the focus of the day - Gaza - the president announced that the U.S. is giving $10 billion to the Board of Peace, though members of Congress question the legality of that. He also says he's raised 7 billion from nine other countries that joined his board, mostly in the Middle East and Central Asia. The Palestinian who's been tapped to lead a committee to administer Gaza, Ali Shaath, brought the conversation down to the reality on the ground.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ALI SHAATH: Large parts of Gaza Strip are severely damaged, destroyed, actually. The humanitarian needs are acute.KELEMEN: And there's no law and order. The Bulgarian diplomat and former U.N. Middle East envoy who's overseeing this, Nickolay Mladenov, says he's already starting to recruit Palestinian police officers for Gaza.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NICKOLAY MLADENOV: And just in the first few hours, we have 2,000 people who have applied to join a new transitional Palestinian police force to be formed in Gaza under the authority of the national committee, with the support of the Board of Peace, trained in Egypt.KELEMEN: Indonesia, Morocco, Albania, Kosovo and Kazakhstan are all planning to send troops and police to set up an international stabilization force, but it's not clear when they'll get there or what they can do while Hamas remains in control of part of Gaza, and the disarmament of the group is likely to be a long, drawn-out process. Still, there was a lot of talk about the valuable coastline in Gaza and the potential to build islands to develop as well. Trump's son -in-law Jared Kushner, who the president is now calling his envoy of peace, says he wanted this event to look like a corporate board meeting.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JARED KUSHNER: We cannot change the past, but I think that what you're seeing today is that we can potentially change the future if we focus and do this in the right way.KELEMEN: Amid all this talk of peace, the Middle East is preparing for a possible new war with Iran. President Trump says the Gaza ceasefire wouldn't have happened without the U.S. and Israel bombing Iran's nuclear sites last year.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: So now we may have to take it a step further, or we may not. Maybe we're going to make a deal. You're going to be finding out over the next, probably, 10 days.KELEMEN: Kushner and Trump's other Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, have been involved in those talks with Iran, as well as the administration's efforts to end Russia's war against Ukraine.

The former vice president was politically prominent from the 1970s until his death. We're also following elections on this Tuesday, on this last day of voting across the country today, from New Jersey and Virginia to California. It's just one of several tests President Trump is facing this week. NPR's senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith is with us now to walk us through it. Good morning, Tam.TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning.MARTIN: So let's start with the gubernatorial elections. How much can be read into the results?KEITH: Well, New Jersey and Virginia aren't exactly presidential swing states, but these races for governor are a first chance to see how voters are feeling almost a year into the Trump presidency. And President Trump put out several social media posts overnight last night, urging people to vote Republican and bashing the Democratic candidates, Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey. He has endorsed the Republican candidate in New Jersey, Jack Ciattarelli, but Trump hasn't endorsed the Republican candidate in Virginia, Winsome Earle-Sears, which led to some verbal gymnastics during a tele-rally that the president called into last night.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Vote Republican. You know, just - if I just cover one subject - your energy prices will go way down as opposed to your energy prices going through the roof. Just that one subject alone is so big. But every Virginia patriot should get out and vote and all Republican up and down the line. It's so important.KEITH: The race in New Jersey appears to be closer than the one in Virginia, which may explain why Trump is expending more political capital there.MARTIN: Talk briefly about California. What does Trump have on the line in that election?KEITH: Yeah. So California voters are considering a ballot measure to temporarily redraw the state's congressional district lines to give Democrats a bigger advantage. This was a response to the new maps in Texas that came at President Trump's request and gave Republicans more safe seats there. If the California measure passes - and it has overwhelming support in recent polls - it would at least partially offset Trump's effort to give Republicans a better chance in next year's midterm elections, which Trump says is key to keeping his agenda on track.MARTIN: There's another possible barrier to Trump's agenda this week. The Supreme Court hears arguments tomorrow about Trump's tariff policy.KEITH: Yeah. And we don't know how they will rule, but - right? - President Trump seems pretty concerned about this tool of raising taxes on imports, to extract concessions from other countries being taken away from him. He has said that it could lead to the ruination of our nation. And here's what he said on \"60 Minutes\" over the weekend.(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"60 MINUTES\")TRUMP: I think our country will be immeasurably hurt. I think our economy will go to hell. Look, because of tariffs, we have the highest stock market we've ever had. Because of tariffs, 401(k) is at the highest level that - and this is millions and millions of people - that we've ever had - 401(k)s. I think it's the most important subject discussed by the Supreme Court in a hundred years.KEITH: Of course, mainstream economists and many business leaders say the tariffs are driving up prices and creating uncertainty. So it's not clear that the president's dire predictions will come to fruition.MARTIN: What else are you watching?KEITH: Well, last night, President Trump turned to Truth Social to criticize the media for saying his poll numbers are low. He claimed falsely that he has the best numbers he has ever had. There's also some political risk for the president, as the government shutdown is about to break a record as the longest one in U.S. history. Polls indicate that, despite the president's best efforts, Democrats are not getting all the blame. Trump so far has refused to negotiate, though there is some movement on the Hill suggesting that the ice might be thawing.MARTIN: That's NPR's Tamara Keith. Tam, thank you.KEITH: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      As the shutdown enters its 35th day, NPR's Steve Inskeep talks with House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark to discuss how she sees the shutdown ending and whether her party has any leverage.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Representative Katherine Clark has been listening with us. She is the No. 2 Democrat in the House of Representatives, the Democratic whip. Welcome to the program.KATHERINE CLARK: Oh, good to be with you. Thank you for having me.INSKEEP: We are reporting throughout the morning on the death of Vice President Cheney, which we have learned - former Vice President Cheney. I'm sure as a Democrat, you did not agree with Cheney on many, many things. But at the end of his life, he agreed with you on one big thing. So what are your thoughts now?CLARK: Yes. You know, we extend our deepest sympathies and prayers to Dick Cheney's family and especially to our former colleague, Liz Cheney. And I do admire how Dick Cheney stood by her as she took on her own party and at great political cost to herself to expose the truth that Joe Biden won the election in 2020 and that we had a fair and secure election. Not an easy thing to do, and I admire that about both of them.INSKEEP: Is there something to be said about government service here as well? Cheney spent well over 30 years in senior positions in the government, again, often doing things you would disagree with, but doing them by his lights for the country.CLARK: You know, there is something to be said. And I hope that as we are in the very challenging time that we are facing in Congress that all of us remember the responsibility that is placed with us. And I think it is part of the moment that we are in that we have a president that demeans public service, that uses his office for his own enrichment and fosters and creates deep cynicism about government and wanting to serve people. So I hope this is a moment that my colleagues will reflect on why we're here in Congress, and that is to fight for the American people and to make life better for them.INSKEEP: Well, let's talk, if I can, about your work now. We heard Tamara Keith say something about maybe some signs of ice thawing in the shutdown. Any idea what she's talking about?CLARK: Well, I certainly hope that today is the day that House Republicans decide to come back to Washington, break their five-week vacation that they have taken and get to work. We need to end this shutdown. We need to make sure that we are addressing the health care crisis that the Republican Party has created and get some relief for people that are looking at sky-high premiums.INSKEEP: I want to ask about that, but I also want to check because you said you hope that today is the day. Is that just a hope, or do you have some information?CLARK: You know, it is a hope because as of right now, Speaker Johnson has said we are not in session this week. He has not come to the negotiating table once. We have a president who calls himself the great negotiator who not only left the country during a shutdown but has done anything but sit down with Democrats and negotiate.INSKEEP: Well, let's talk about that because President Trump was on \"60 Minutes\" over the weekend and was asked if he would help to end the standoff, as he tried to do during his first term. And here's some of his response. Let's listen.(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"60 MINUTES\")PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm not going to do it by being extorted by the Democrats, who have lost their way. There's something wrong with these people.NORAH O'DONNELL: So then what happens on November...TRUMP: Schumer is...INSKEEP: OK. Being extorted by the Democrats - that's how he describes your demand to restore or extend Obamacare subsidies. I'm recalling that during battles in the Obama administration, President Obama, after trying to negotiate with Republicans, finally said, it's up to you guys. Do your job. What would you say to the president effectively telling you, do your job?CLARK: You know, Donald Trump has said he is both president and speaker. He needs to tell Mike Johnson and Senator Thune to come to the table and negotiate. It is very hard. I'm a lawyer. I've been a lawmaker for some time. You cannot negotiate by yourselves. And the president has had one brief meeting before the shutdown with Democratic leadership, and that's it. That's not how negotiations work. Posts on Truth Social are not a substitute for putting the American people first. And he is so busy building ballrooms, holding \"Great Gatsby\" celebrations, sending $40 billion to Argentina while he's making the choice to withhold food. Talk about holding hostages. It's outrageous behavior that they will not come to the table to work on making life easier and less expensive for American families.INSKEEP: Got about 20 seconds here, but I just want to ask directly. I realize it's not your choice to be out of session for the past month-plus. But I've been thinking about this. I'm a taxpayer, which means I help to pay for Congress. Am I getting any value at all out of Congress at this time?CLARK: You know, it is a really hard case to make when we have federal workers who are showing up for work and not getting paid and we have Mike Johnson saying in the House, we are going to get paid and not show up for work. Isn't that sort of the basic of what they owe the American people? And today would be a good day to come to work and make sure we can get relief.INSKEEP: Representative Clark, Katherine Clark, thanks so much.CLARK: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "\n      There are several big races to watch this Election Day. New York City will elect a mayor, New Jersey and Virginia will pick a governor and California will decide a consequential redistricting ballot.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Voting ends today in a handful of high-profile elections, including for mayor of New York City and for governor in New Jersey and Virginia.STEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: It's a tradition to watch those three elections. They always come in the first year of a presidency, and people look for clues to what voters are thinking. This year, there's an extra big election to watch - a ballot measure in California that could influence who captures Congress next year.MARTIN: Here to talk us through these races is NPR political correspondent Ashley Lopez. Ashley, good morning.ASHLEY LOPEZ, BYLINE: Good morning.MARTIN: Let's start in California. It's a one-issue election - kind of unusual.LOPEZ: Yeah, kind of. It's a one-ballot measure on the ballot asking voters to allow state lawmakers to redraw their congressional map ahead of the 2026 election. California has an independent redistricting commission, which is something voters approved about 15 years ago. If passed, this measure would allow Democrats in the state to bypass that commission so that they can do a partisan gerrymander. That means they would draw up to five more seats that their party is favored to win in the midterms.MARTIN: But you can't think about California in isolation here because it's part of a national redistricting fight between Democrats and Republicans in a number of states. So in this case, this is Democrats in California responding to Republicans in Texas.LOPEZ: That's right. And Democrats went as far as saying that in the ballot language of this measure, Texas redrew its map at the request of President Trump and created five more favorable seats for Republicans in the state. And California basically wants to offset that edge that Trump wants. And this measure looks like it's likely to pass. I was actually in Southern California last week, and many Democratic voters told me they have, like, mixed feelings about bypassing the independent redistricting commission and allowing gerrymandering. But they think it's more important to fight back against Trump and Republicans, and this is one way they can.MARTIN: All right. Let's move to the other coast, to New York City. What should we know about the mayoral race there?LOPEZ: Right. So the frontrunner for that race is Zohran Mamdani, who is 34 years old, and he's a member of the New York State Assembly. He won the Democratic primary this summer, which surprised a lot of folks because he was relatively unknown when he entered the race. And he beat a former governor in that primary contest - Andrew Cuomo. Cuomo decided to stay in the race by running as an independent. In the last days of the campaign, Cuomo has gotten some big endorsements, including the president's. But this hasn't been an easy fight for him. Mamdani has a very energetic grassroots campaign that has engaged a lot of young voters in the city, especially on affordability issues.MARTIN: Also interesting that the president bypassed the Republican in the race to go to Cuomo as an independent. OK. So what should we keep an eye on when it comes to the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia?LOPEZ: Yeah. So Democrats are out of power in Washington, obviously, but governorships have been this area of government where they've been able to somewhat push back against the Trump administration. So the stakes of these races are particularly high for Democrats. In Virginia, Democrats have a decent shot. Abigail Spanberger, a former member of Congress, is pulling ahead in that race against Republican Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears. And there's a history of the party in power in the White House typically losing the race for governor in Virginia.MARTIN: And what about New Jersey?LOPEZ: Yeah. I mean, that race might be a little tougher for the Democratic Party. Besides the polling being close, history is not on the party's side like it is in Virginia. Voters have not elected the same party for governor for three terms in a row since the '60s, so Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill is seeking to defy that trend against Republican Jack Ciattarelli.MARTIN: So what, if anything, about tonight will you be looking for as a possible clue to the midterm elections next year?LOPEZ: Well, I'm going to be looking at how Democrats perform in these races. Yes, they're favored to win a lot of them, but there is a big difference among these candidates. Mamdani and Spanberger, for example, represent very different parts of the Democratic coalition. And results could tell us something about how voters are responding to different kinds of candidates and messaging as the party looks to next year.MARTIN: That is NPR's Ashley Lopez. Ashley, thank you.LOPEZ: Yeah. Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Do Democrats have an advantage going into Tuesday's elections? NPR's Steve Inskeep asks Faiz Shakir, chief political adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  The many voices we're hearing about this election include Faiz Shakir. He is the chief political adviser of independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. He directs the media organization More Perfect Union. He's come by Studio 31 this morning. We've got him some coffee with a little cream. Is that right? Did we get you - is it good?FAIZ SHAKIR: Thank you, Steve.INSKEEP: OK.SHAKIR: Good to see you.INSKEEP: It's the staff who brought it by. Glad it's according to your order. So how will you read first the New York results?SHAKIR: Well, already Zohran Mamdani has engineered a massive turnout. If you go back to the 2024 election, Steve, and you say, what were the challenges of the Democratic Party and the Harris campaign? It's that they didn't mobilize traditional constituencies and get new voters into the voting booths.INSKEEP: Yeah.SHAKIR: And it was a - one of the reasons why she didn't win. Here you have Zohran Mamdani almost answering for the problem. He's in the primary and now in the general - if you look at the early vote turnout in New York, already engineering massive turnout, particularly among constituencies - people of color, young people - who were least likely to vote in the last election cycle. And that's good news.INSKEEP: There's a couple of different ways I could think about Mamdani's appeal, and one is he's a Democratic socialist and he has a certain set of policies. But another way to think of him maybe is just that he's young and he's talented and different, and so he's interesting to younger people. Which do you think it is?SHAKIR: He's all of those, and he has an agenda that speaks affirmatively at a time when I think one of the struggles of the Democratic brand is, what are you going to do if I put you into power? What are the answers to the solutions that you want to bring? Here comes Zohran Mamdani saying, hey, buses fast and free, child care universal, new grocery stores to service underserved populations. Here comes taxes that - we tax more on the rich. These are affirmative visions of a society that we want to have. And I think Mamdani has tried to hopefully urge a lot of other Democrats to say, campaign on the back of something, not just against Donald Trump.INSKEEP: Just to be clear, you're saying these are not symbolic promises. People will expect him to deliver those exact things if he is elected.SHAKIR: Thankfully, Mamdani is impressive in this way that he understood the tools that the mayor actually has. When he says freeze the rent, he knows that that's a power that the mayor has. When he talks about expanding bus lanes...INSKEEP: Yeah.SHAKIR: ...That's something he has already done. So I think he's been grounded in what are the actual authorities that the mayor has, and how can I use them to do something for you?INSKEEP: Although, I think I just want to pause on this for a moment. I mean, the mayor does have the authority to freeze the rent. The city government messes with rent all the time in New York, and the rent is still too damn high. I mean, rent control doesn't seem to have worked in New York City. Is there...SHAKIR: Because what...INSKEEP: ...A danger in making these promises that maybe you can't do much with?SHAKIR: Well, one of the challenges of a candidate at this moment - any candidate - is integrity. When you say you're going to fight for somebody, is it in your bones? Is it in your DNA? One of the reasons I think Mamdani's succeeding and so many people - Bernie Sanders is so popular right now is that there's a sense that while corruption is all abound around us in politics - Trump is certainly leading the way in the most corrupt government we've seen in our modern lifetimes - here comes people with integrity saying, we may disagree, but the North Star solution is improving your life. And know that when I'm in office, I won't forget about you. I am wholly focused on it. You can trust me.INSKEEP: I want to underline another aspect of this that I'm sure you're very familiar with. Mamdani has become a big star on Fox News, possibly the biggest star short of Sean Hannity. He's on all the time. People are warned about him continuously. He actually went on Fox News and took some questions, of course. But I'm curious if you think that kind of intense attention by Republicans helps him or hurts him.SHAKIR: Well, you know, nationally, it's a challenge because Zohran Mamdani is a New York City mayoral candidate, and he has done a fantastic job of making himself aware to the people of New York City. Now, if you live in Nebraska or if you live in California, if you live in Arizona, you know, why does Zohran Mamdani matter to you? Not much. But Fox News has decided and the right has decided, well, I want to tell you that this is scary - a scary proposition. And I suspect that one of the lessons that comes out of the Mamdani campaign is that people in Arizona, Nebraska, California will have to figure out the way that they speak to their own constituencies that learn some lessons about the successes that Mamdani's had, both in how he's communicated but the fact that he's got a substantive agenda that people believe and trust in and want desperately. Especially as Trump - you know, leading our economy, I think, right now, as polling has suggested, he's the least popular he's ever been on the economy - 70% disapproval.INSKEEP: Let me ask about that because Trump is unpopular right now, and Democrats seem to be even more unpopular. And it's a close race, at least in New Jersey. We don't know what's going to happen there. Does it bother you that Democrats have not been able to take so much advantage of Trump's unpopularity?SHAKIR: We'll see. I mean, I - you know, you'll find out what the results of this were. If you look at 2024 election, Kamala Harris wins both of those states by six points. So that's the baseline heading into this election cycle. If you go back to how Trump - how we did in the first Trump term, you know, Virginia - I think the gubernatorial candidate there was a Democrat, Ralph Northam. He won by nine points. In New Jersey, they won by double digits in Trump's first term. So I think you can overperform the baselines of plus-six if that's the way you're looking at it.INSKEEP: I guess I'm just thinking Democrats don't seem to have a very coherent national message at this point.SHAKIR: Well, yes. You're right. And I - you know, that's one of my challenges and problems and frustrations right now, is that you should go into this election cycle saying, here's three, four, five things that we as Democrats want to do. That said, there's an energy and enthusiasm out there among the public that is incredible. Already in the - Trump's second term, you're seeing more activism and action and grassroots engagement than you did in Trump's first term.INSKEEP: Faiz Shakir, chief political adviser to Bernie Sanders, thanks so much.SHAKIR: Thank you, Steve.

Spanberger, who previously served three terms in the U.S. House, defeated her Republican opponent, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. She'll be Virginia's first woman governor.    Loading... \n   The contest received national attention as one of the first major tests of voter sentiment in response to the Trump administration's policies.   Virginia is home to around 320,000 federal workers and hundreds of thousands of federal contractors. On the campaign trail, Spanberger argued that federal layoffs, cutbacks by President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), tariffs, and the federal shutdown were an attack on the Virginia economy — and pitched herself as a way for voters to push back.   \"We need a governor who will recognize the hardship of this moment, advocate for Virginians, and make clear that not only are we watching people be challenged in their livelihoods and in their businesses and in communities, but Virginia's economy is under attack,\" Spanberger said at a stop on a campaign bus tour late last month.   That message resonated with Haley Morgan Wright, a voter whose husband is a federal employee currently working without pay during the federal shutdown. She wants Spanberger to use her platform as governor to uplift the stories of civil servants like him.   \n   \"He cares about his country, he wants to serve his country and has opted to do it in this way,\" she said after casting a ballot in the Northern Virginia exurbs. \"He's not superfluous.\"   Spanberger was backed by national Democrats   National Democrats had looked to Spanberger and Virginia Democrats for a boost heading into the 2026 midterms. Former President Barack Obama had campaigned for her and the party backed her in what was one of just two governor's races this year.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Voters cast their ballots at Huguenot High School on Tuesday in Richmond, Virginia.\n                \n                    Ryan M.

Malcolm Kenyatta at a meeting for party volunteers in Northern Virginia. \"Because we know that what you all do and the momentum that is going to come out of your victories is going lead to us flipping the House of Representatives in 2026.\"   In 2021, Republican Glenn Youngkin defeated Democrat Terry McAuliffe with 50.6% of the vote to 48.7%. Virginia governors are limited to one four-year term.   Spanberger, who served in the CIA before running for Congress in 2018, has cultivated a reputation as a pragmatic centrist. The theme of her run for governor was \"affordability\" — speaking to Virginians' concerns about rising costs of housing, utility bills, pharmaceutical drugs, and the economic uncertainty she blamed on Trump's tariffs and federal layoffs.   \n   Earle-Sears, meanwhile, portrayed herself as an example of the American dream — a Jamaican immigrant who became a U.S. Marine and small business owner.   She accused Spanberger of backing policies on transgender rights that she said are a threat to girls' safety in school bathrooms and locker rooms.    \"Love is not having my daughter having to be forced to undress in a locker room with a man. That's not love,\" Earle-Sears said at a rally in late October. \"Love is making sure that our girl children have opportunities in sports and are not forced to play against biological males.\"   Earle-Sears' stance on transgender students in girls' bathrooms sounded good to Elizabeth Drake, a voter who said she works with youth at a church in Loudoun County.   \"I feel like we're actually going back and setting ourselves back a lot by endangering women,\" she said. \"I'm not saying that that doesn't mean we can have alternative spaces for people, but the women's locker rooms, women's bathrooms, women's safe homes are not it.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Winsome Earle-Sears, currently Virginia's lieutenant governor, in the Virginia General Assembly last month.\n                \n                    Shaban Athuman/VPM News\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Shaban Athuman/VPM News\n    \n\n   \n   The race was jolted by late-breaking events   She also attacked Spanberger for supporting Biden administration policies. She vowed to continue business-friendly polices of outgoing Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. While she backed Trump's policies, Trump did not endorse her.   Several developments impacted the final weeks of the race. The federal shutdown shadowed the final month of early voting, with both campaigns blaming the other party for the stalemate.    Virginia lawmakers began considering a plan to redistrict the state's congressional districts to favor Democratic candidates in the 2026 midterm elections, as President Trump pushes Republicans in other states to move to favor their candidates. That could be an issue facing the next Virginia governor.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Former President Barack Obama campaigned for Spanberger over the weekend.\n                \n                    Steve Helber/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Steve Helber/AP\n    \n\n   \n   And Republicans seized on revelations of text messages by Democratic candidate for attorney general, Jay Jones, in which he described the hypothetical shooting of a Republican lawmaker.

Today, his Brooklyn tech company makes a free app for people on the federal government's anti-hunger Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.   About 5 million people use Propel's app to check their SNAP balances, and get coupons and discounts on groceries. That gives Chen a pretty good view into how they're being affected by the federal government's unprecedented delay in sending out November payments.   \"Their budgets are already extremely tight. There's usually not a lot of wiggle room,\" Chen says. \"So a delay of even a few days on an expected deposit ends up being a really, really huge deal.\"   \n   Now his company is trying to bridge that gap, joining other private businesses, nonprofits, and individuals scrambling to offset the government's delayed SNAP payments. On Saturday, Propel started giving payments of $50 to people using its app, prioritizing those with children and little or no income.   \n   \"We understand that $50 is not enough,\" Chen says, adding that Propel is trying to reach the largest number of families and \"provide an amount that gives them a little bit of breathing room.\"   The company has identified about 230,000 users who fit this \"high need\" profile. It has donated $1 million of the total $10 million it needs to fund $50 payments to most of them, and is hoping to beat that target.   Looking for partners   Propel has also lined up some donations from its corporate partners, including the New York anti-poverty nonprofit Robin Hood and ecommerce platform Babylist. It also set up a crowdfunding campaign with the nonprofit GiveDirectly, which runs similar programs all over the world and which has worked with Propel in the past.   GiveDirectly says it's raised a total of $6 million, including Propel's contributions, so far.   \"The sheer scale and volume of this need is so immense. We're talking about millions of low income Americans who are at risk of not getting this assistance,\" says Sarina Jain, GiveDirectly's senior program manager focused on U.S. disaster responses.   \n   Even as they've scrambled to launch this donation program, Chen and Jain acknowledge that all of the efforts from non-profits and private companies can never replace the federal government, which spends $8 billion every month on the country's largest anti-hunger program.   \"At the end of the day, the single biggest thing we can do in this country is to get SNAP back online, depositing on a predictable schedule to the people who receive it,\" Chen says.   42 million SNAP recipients face delayed payments    Almost 42 million people rely on SNAP. Now they're waiting for payments that the government stopped making on Saturday — and they're facing delays that could stretch into months.   After two federal judges ruled that freezing SNAP payments is unlawful, the Trump administration on Monday said it would restart partial SNAP payments.   But the government added that states would only receive about half the amount of federal funding they usually get. It plans to use money from an Agriculture Department contingency fund, which contains only $5 billion — well short of the $8 billion it costs to provide full SNAP benefits each month.   The government also warned that it could take some states \"anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months\" to process the reduced payments.   That could be disastrous for many SNAP recipients, such as Shenita Melton. The 37-year-old lives in rural Anson County, North Carolina, and relies on SNAP to help feed her four children.   Propel connected NPR to Melton, who said last week that she was already starting to scramble to find enough food for her kids — especially her three teenagers, who \"eat a lot.\"   There aren't many food banks in the rural area where she lives. The few that do exist only allow people to pick up groceries once or twice a month.   Melton also says that many of the groceries at those food banks are expired.   \n   \"I'm kind of scared to give my kids expired food,\" she says. \"But sometimes you have to do what you have to do.\"\n",

A special election in California allows the state's voters to weigh in on what is now a cross-country redistricting battle between the two major parties ahead of next year's midterm elections.   \n   Here are details on that contest and three others we're watching this Election Day. (And when polls close, find results for these key races here.)   California redistricting   Proposition 50 would replace California's current congressional lines with a map favoring Democrats.   The maneuver is Gov. Gavin Newsom's answer to President Trump pushing Texas and other GOP-led states to redraw their congressional maps to give Republicans a better chance of hanging onto the party's slim majority in the U.S. House.   \n   If voters approve Prop 50 — which appears likely — the new districts could help Democrats win up to five more House seats in the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections. The proposition is written to expire after the 2030 election, returning line-drawing power to the state's existing independent citizens' redistricting commission.   — KQED's Guy Marzorati      New York City mayor   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                New York City mayoral candidates former New York Gov.

His primary win energized portions of the party's base, while making him a foil for Republicans across the country.   \n   Cuomo opted to stay in the mayor's race by running as an independent. He's criticized Mamdani as too inexperienced to deal with Trump. Cuomo has also argued that the state legislator's campaign platform, which includes free buses and universal childcare, can't be delivered.

    "body": "\n    DAVE DAVIES, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies. If you watched the televised hearings of the select congressional committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, you probably remember the dramatic testimony of former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson. Officials of the U.S. Department of Justice who were investigating Donald Trump's alleged interference in the 2020 election were watching, too. But at the time, they had no idea who Cassidy Hutchinson was.That's one of many striking revelations you'll find in the new book by our guests, veteran investigative reporters Carol Leonnig and Aaron Davis. Leonnig and Davis write about Donald Trump's powerful impact on the Justice Department, including his efforts to protect friends and punish those he considers enemies. But much of the book focuses on the Biden years, when Trump wasn't in charge and the Justice Department pursued investigations into the violence on January 6 and, eventually, into Trump's alleged interference in the 2020 election and his retention of thousands of government documents.Their account is a bracingly clear explanation of why those efforts failed to get either case against Trump in front of a jury before his reelection rendered them moot. It's largely a story of officials acting in good faith, trying to adhere to standards of fairness and nonpartisanship - perhaps too rigorously at times. The authors say Trump's targeting of prosecutors and FBI agents in his first term in office likely played a role in the department's caution.Carol Leonnig worked for 25 years at The Washington Post. She's won or shared in five Pulitzer Prizes and has written two books about Donald Trump and another about the U.S. Secret Service. Leonnig left The Post earlier this year and is now a senior investigative correspondent for MSNBC. Aaron Davis is an investigative reporter for The Washington Post. He's won two Pulitzer Prizes and reported from 14 countries. He was lead reporter and writer for an investigative series on the January 6 attack, which won the George Polk Award and, with other Post coverage, the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. Leonnig and Davis' new book is \"Injustice: How Politics And Fear Vanquished America's Justice Department.\" We recorded our conversation last Thursday.Well, Carol Leonnig, Aaron Davis, welcome to FRESH AIR. You know, Trump was charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States and related charges, you know, related to his alleged interference in the 2020 election. We will never know what a jury would have made of the charges and the evidence because it never went to trial. But part of that is because the Department of Justice didn't get moving on that investigation quickly - not really until well into 2023. But it's interesting. I learned in your book that very early after the election, before the January 6 attack, a woman in government, Waleska McLellan, flagged what looked like a coordinated campaign to subvert the election results. Tell us who she was, what she did.CAROL LEONNIG: I'm impressed, Dave. That is a good find in the book and a scoop that Aaron and I were both really struck by when we came across it in reporting for this book. Waleska McLellan was a top investigator in a little-known inspector general's office for the National Archives. And in December of 2020, after Donald Trump has lost the election to Joe Biden, she is presented with a series of certificates from people that are not the secretary of state in various states - swing states - in which unusual signatures are given that suggest there are alternate electors who are going to challenge whether Biden actually won the election in their swing state.And she begins to review these with her fellow investigators and then decides the best thing to do is to go to the Justice Department, a prosecutor team that she knows in D.C., and ask them, doesn't this look funny to you? Doesn't this look coordinated? Because all of the certificates kind of have a boilerplate, ticky-tacky similarity, and they are not official. And she's wondering, is this a conspiracy? Is this a crime?DAVIES: Right. And she's from the National Archives, right? So these are obviously very important official government documents. She sees they look fishy, and she talks to the prosecutors. Looks like maybe this is not one or two people. There was a coordinated effort here. What does she hear from the prosecutors?LEONNIG: She goes to a prosecutor that she knows from a previous briefing named J.P. Cooney. And he says, sorry, sorry, I've been busy. I'll connect you with one of my team. And the prosecutor underneath J.P. Cooney tells Waleska McLellan, you know, this just doesn't seem like something that we would pursue. Of course, that office of prosecutors in D.C. are completely slammed with what? Investigating the violent attack on the Capitol and pursuing hundreds of people who were engaged in either breaching the Capitol and also violence, violent acts against police officers that day. They are swamped, and they basically turn her down and tell her maybe she should pursue this with some state investigators.AARON DAVIS: Just to add to what Carol said, these fake elector documents were really important in that moment, in January 6, because Donald Trump uses this as a pretense to say that Vice President Pence can actually do something different and not certify Joe Biden that day. And it's part of the thing that some of the rioters are talking about in the crowd - you know, Pence should do this. And so these were - this was a real, live issue, and, you know, here it was that Waleska had seen this and spotted it beforehand.DAVIES: There was another point not that much later when departments who were looking into the January 6 attacks began to see evidence which suggested coordination between some extremist groups and close allies of Donald Trump, like Roger Stone, for example. And they wanted to look further into this, subpoena records. What were they hoping to do?DAVIS: Well, this is a really interesting point, right? So right after Biden is successfully inaugurated - and it's hard to go back and think about this, but there was even some concern inside the Department of Justice as to whether that could happen peacefully. They wanted to arrest as many of these rioters as they could beforehand, worrying that there would be violence on that day.But once they get through that inauguration, there's a group of prosecutors inside the U.S. attorney's office in D.C. who say, we should really form a task force to broaden this beyond the rioters, to look at what is the connective tissue between the people who went in the building that day and the people around Trump who were talking about needing, you know, to go tell the members of Congress to have some backbone and do what they needed to do that day. And so they put together a PowerPoint presentation. And again, this is - Cooney is one of the prosecutors in the room.DAVIES: That's J.P. Cooney, who is an aggressive prosecutor. Yeah.DAVIS: Yeah. J.P. Cooney presents to FBI agents a plan to, you know, look at people like Roger Stone, who is in the and outside the Willard Hotel the night before the January 6 attack with members of the Oath Keepers and begin to question, what are they doing there? What are they doing? Were they talking? Who else were they talking to?And this is immediately met with some pushback by the interim team that Joe Biden has put in charge of the Department of Justice. And they say, way, whoa. We're not going to investigate people. We're investigating this crime of the riot that just happened outside the Capitol. And that is a moment that really sets the tone and sets the direction of this investigation for a long time to come, after Garland is seated a couple months later. But they really are opposed to looking at people and want to look at what happened at - in the crowd in the riot and work their way back up from there.DAVIES: Right. And these prosecutors wanted to do things like who was booked at the Willard Hotel during what days. And, you know, there are kind of issues of, well, privacy. If somebody wasn't engaged in a crime, you know, where they stay overnight isn't necessarily anybody's business. And then maybe First Amendment concerns. I mean, you know, it's legal to advocate even strongly against the government.DAVIS: Yeah, this comes up at one point in time with then the head of the Washington Field Office in the FBI, who says exactly that. You know, what if we catch somebody having a tryst at this hotel? I'm not going to subpoena. He literally says, I'm not going to subpoena the frigging Willard Hotel. I don't want to collect all this information and be accused of looking too broadly.DAVIES: We need to take a break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Carol Leonnig and Aaron Davis. They are both veteran investigative reporters. Their new book is titled \"Injustice: How Politics And Fear Vanquished America's Justice Department.\" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF THE INTERNET SONG, \"STAY THE NIGHT\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with veteran investigative reporters Carol Leonnig and Aaron Davis. They have a new book which looks at Donald Trump's impact on the U.S. Department of Justice, and in particular, why the case against Trump charging interference in the 2020 election never went to trial.This is a pattern that we see for the coming months where at various times, investigators and prosecutors see connections that might suggest a wider conspiracy, even the president being involved, in trying to deliberately subvert the results of the elections. And there's resistance. And, you know, one element of this might be the new Attorney General Merrick Garland, who, you know, he had strong feelings about the independence and fairness of the Justice Department. Tell us about his approach and how it affected all this.LEONNIG: Merrick Garland was an extremely respected jurist for his many years - I believe 24 years - on the federal bench, had a wealth of experience in the law, was fastidious and methodical. But as attorney general, even the people who really admired him and worked for him, some of them told us they were concerned about how allergic he seemed to even the whiff of looking like anything he did was political. And he said this publicly. I'm paraphrasing him a little, but he said, you know, it's not enough to be apolitical. We also have to be sure people believe and that we appear to be above politics. That guided everything in that first year. Garland believed that looking directly at Trump or Trump allies would create that improper whiff.He wanted to go back to a playbook created in the wake of Watergate in which the Department of Justice siloed itself from the White House, siloed itself from politics and tried to have this incredibly pristine, almost priestly independence. The problem was that not looking at this evidence delayed things for a long time. He kept saying he wanted to find out if there was some connection between Trump and the riot. And ultimately, when the Department of Justice finally agrees to launch this investigation, it's not based on evidence that they gained in the riot probe. It's based on evidence that had been public, at least that's what they formally cite in their documents. Evidence that had been public since December of 2020, January of 2021, February of 2021.DAVIES: Yeah, so what changed in the year?LEONNIG: The critical change was the House select committee. News was leaking out of that unusual team of very, very aggressive prosecutors like a sieve. And in January, there were a host of stories about the committee figuring out that these fake elector certificates were critical and that they were coordinated, or appeared to be coordinated, by Rudy Giuliani and members of Trump's campaign. And that discovery was extremely embarrassing to the Department of Justice, Aaron and I learned in our interviews. And we uncovered an email exchange in which a federal prosecutor, who had been belatedly assigned alone to look into this potential linkage to Donald Trump's allies, reaches out to that Waleska McLellan days after these barrage of stories are raising questions. Where is the Department of Justice on this investigation? That happened in January of 2022, a year after Waleska McLellan had been turned down.DAVIES: This was Thomas Windom, who was transferred in from Maryland and suddenly said, we've got to look into a potential conspiracy here, right?LEONNIG: That's right.DAVIES: Yeah. You know, it's interesting that, you know, I've covered a lot of federal criminal cases. And I've always found defense attorneys can be chatty. They can be good sources. I never could get anything out of federal prosecutors that wasn't in the public record. You talked to a lot of agents and a lot of former prosecutors. Was it easy to get them to open up? Were they angry about what had happened?DAVIS: You're right, Dave. It's never easy to get federal prosecutors...LEONNIG: (Laughter).DAVIS: ...To talk about just about anything. I will say, just on the broad picture for a second, it's the fact that we were able to tell some of these stories, that people wanted to talk about this kind of speaks to this moment and how important folks in law enforcement feel this is and what's going on inside the department. They're largely, I'd say, on the FBI side especially, a group that leans more conservative. And here, they're the ones telling us what is going on inside the department, what's been going on these many years we really need to, as a country, stand up and take a look and pay attention to. You know, we did not, still, even in that, have an easy time with prosecutors talking to us and telling us things. You know, we are very careful to protect sources in this book because, you know, in this current environment, anyone is a target.That said, there are some scenes that are pretty wild. And we found that you do end up with Thomas Windom on a park bench meeting with the head of the investigation for the House select committee. And they're comparing notes at one point in time with, you know, the head of the House select committee saying, you know, I'd like to start a relationship here so that we can share with you what we've found. You know, Thomas does not offer anything in that moment. But it goes to this point of, there was this period where, unbelievably almost, a year after January 6, Thomas Windom is the only prosecutor with the mandate to investigate if Donald Trump had done anything wrong in relation to January 6, and nobody knows it. He's like secretly, like, the most interesting man in Washington for a time. And, you know, we follow him in the book as he goes around and begins that investigation.DAVIES: Right. And the interesting thing is that once he, you know, takes on that task, he does impanel a grand jury, but he doesn't have an army of investigators, right? No agents assigned. And in order to get agents' permission - right? - to subpoena witnesses and records, there's a whole nother battle - right? - to get the FBI to go along.LEONNIG: Yeah, that's right. There is a incredible - I apologize for my language here - sphincter-tightening in the FBI, just such anxiety about launching on this probe. You know, when Thomas Windom goes to the Washington field office and meets with Steve D'Antuono, the head of that office, he says, look, this is the investigation now I'd like you to potentially join me in. And D'Antuono knows that, hey, this is actually a crime I can investigate, which is fascinating, since nobody saw that when Waleska McLellan proposed it.But he's thinking, OK. This is basic potential wire fraud, mail fraud. People sent in things. They actually signed them from various states and claimed to be the electors for their states when they were not, clearly. So he's seeing, like, OK. There's a potential crime. But at headquarters at FBI, Chris Wray, the director, his general counsel, their deputies are all poring over the documents of, how are we going to later justify in writing that we are investigating Donald Trump?And here's the killer on that one. What we learned and nobody had reported at the time was that the anxiety was so high, they ultimately concluded they wouldn't name Donald Trump as a subject. But they would name Donald Trump's campaign as a subject, along with Rudy Giuliani and some other advisers that they knew were involved in this coordination.DAVIES: And I wonder how much of this, you know, arguably excessive caution on the part of senior FBI officials and some senior justice officials is attributed to the experience during Trump's first term when he - you know, he intervened directly. I mean, he wanted them to indict, you know, the former deputy director of the FBI, and he wanted them to give Roger Stone a lower sentence, and there were real battles over that. People felt bruised, I guess.DAVIS: It's really true. You know, it's - we're so far from it, but this is a big reason of why we started to report and work on the book, which is that we had written a couple stories, Carol and I, back in 2023 about some of the slow start. And we didn't have the whole picture then, but we had some pieces of it. And, you know, we got some blowback from people inside the Department of Justice who said, hey, you don't know what it's been like in here during the first Trump term. And so as we set about writing a book, we said, well, let's try to capture that.And we went back over those years of the first Trump term. And as bad as it was and we saw in the headlines then, it was actually worse. I mean, there was more arm-twisting. There was more, you know, cajoling and trying to get, you know, prosecutors to sign things and go against what they thought was the right reading of the law. And the same on the FBI side as well. We got to a place where we wanted to be able to have everyone who reads the book understand, what is the Department of Justice - the condition that it's in - as the sun comes up on the morning of January 6? And if you can grasp that, then you can understand why they're so reticent and careful and slow in the years afterward.And when it comes to this particular point of really digging into the fake elector scheme and all the politicians around the country that become, you know, involved in that, you know, there is a - suddenly a recognition inside the department when they look at this and say, this is actually the heart of the scheme. And if we're going to go forward with this, there's going to have to be a lot of hands on the knife, is one of the quotes from inside a meeting inside DOJ - that, you know, everybody has to have buy-in. If we're going to go back and open an investigation into the president and the people around him, we have to have full buy-in here.DAVIES: We need to take a break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Carol Leonnig and Aaron Davis. They're veteran investigative reporters. Their new book is \"Injustice: How Politics And Fear Vanquished America's Justice Department.\" I spoke to them last Thursday. We'll hear more of our conversation after this short break. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF JESSICA WILLIAMS' \"BIRKS WORKS\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies. We're listening to the interview I recorded last Thursday with veteran investigative reporters Carol Leonnig and Aaron Davis. Their new book is a detailed look at Donald Trump's impact on the U.S. Department of Justice. Much of the book focuses on Justice Department investigations during the Biden administration into Trump's alleged interference in the 2020 election and his allegedly illegal retention of government documents when he left the White House after his first term. The authors explore the reasons neither case made it to trial before Trump's reelection rendered them moot. Leonnig and Davis' book is \"Injustice: How Politics And Fear Vanquished America's Justice Department.\".You know, while the Justice Department was gearing up an investigation into the possibility of a conspiracy by Donald Trump and allies to undermine the results of the 2020 election, the congressional Select Committee on January 6 was moving full steam ahead, headed by, you know, Liz Cheney and Bennie Thompson of Mississippi. The Justice Department's prosecutors were way behind. At some point, when they realized they really wanted to investigate this, they approached the committee's staff and said, how about sharing with us all of your interviews with people so far? What was the response?LEONNIG: The clients, so to speak, meaning the lawmakers, the House members who were on the committee, did not want to share. And they made that very clear to their chief counsel, Tim Heaphy. They felt like, look, we're about to have televised hearings where we're going to report our findings after interviewing hundreds of people, being way ahead of the Justice Department. And we don't want to give up our scoop, so to speak, to the Department of Justice, which has been lagging.You know, the investigators on this team - Aaron and I found it so fascinating when we really pulled back the curtain on this team. There is this incredible group of investigators on the congressional team - mostly former prosecutors, a few lawyers - who Heaphy hires to help him figure out what happened. And the pace at which they are moving is devastatingly fast, especially compared to the Department of Justice. It's like the little U.S. attorney's office that could.Tim Heaphy, who is the chief counsel, is a former U.S. attorney with the Department of Justice. So his goal all along was, let's treat this like a real investigation. Let's get to the facts. And he actually has a conversation with Bennie Thompson, where - before he takes the job, where he goes, I'm not going to be comfortable if politics is going to influence the end results. I want our facts to drive the day. But in the end, those clients, the lawmakers - they do not want to turn over the goods. And they stiff-arm the Department of Justice, which now is trying to play catch-up.DAVIES: I remember moments in those televised hearings of the select congressional committee, like when we heard about these dramatic meetings in the Oval Office in December of 2020, when Donald Trump was trying to reverse the results of the election. And he wanted to appoint Jeffrey Clark, this conservative attorney who didn't really have the experience to lead the Justice Department. He wanted to make him attorney general, and a whole bevy of career lawyers threatened to resign en masse and shut that down. This was some amazing stuff. When the Justice Department investigators were watching all this on television, had they talked to those folks? Was this news to them?DAVIS: On that particular one, they'd talked to a couple of those folks for various reasons. But you are right that they were behind and, in some ways, learning a lot of what had happened in and around Donald Trump in the weeks before January 6 as they were watching television, much like the rest of America was. It was a very odd situation where you had a Department of Justice that had not yet really engaged with this investigation, and certainly not at the level and the intensity that the House select committee had done.So, you know, prosecutors are usually the ones who want to have the first interview with anyone involved in investigation. Here, you had a very complicated situation because House select committee investigators had been the first ones to go in and interview. And so it was a bit of a black hole - that the Justice Department didn't know what they were going to find and what was going to be said in some of these hearings when they became public.DAVIES: You know, normally, when federal prosecutors and their colleagues in the FBI investigate a - you know, a big white-collar case, they take their time. They build the facts. You know, they work from the inside to the out of a conspiracy, and they don't worry about time. In this particular case, the time that it would take mattered a lot. And, I mean, I just know from covering these things that major white-collar criminal cases take a long, long time to get to trial. These were experienced prosecutors. They knew that. Were they concerned that they were going to get to the point where Donald Trump's, you know, burgeoning presidential campaign, you know, for a second term was going to run into this trial schedule?LEONNIG: You know, Dave, Merrick Garland, the attorney general, really set the tone on this, which was, we're not doing anything because there's an election coming up. And we're not motivated or girded or pressed by an election calendar and the fact that Donald Trump is readying himself and making a lot of noise about running for reelection.Now, inside, Aaron and I learned that there were prosecutors worried about how much time was left on the clock. And this is a great moment to sort of compare Garland and the special counsel he would end up picking later, when Trump really did announce that he was going to run for reelection in November of 2022, because Jack Smith, that special counsel, said literally within the first week of meeting his new team, we got to set a calendar. How about in three months, we decide whether or not we can indict? That was on the classified documents case. In the others, he said, we have to triage to this. We have to get moving.His motivation was, as he articulated it to many people we interviewed - was, we can't let the American public sit out there with these incredible allegations of a potential coup, of a president potentially stoking violence to overturn a free and fair election. We can't let that wither out there in the countryside without resolving it in a fair court. And he also felt that it was really important for Donald Trump to not have those allegations laying out there. And so he was moving at a pace I have actually never seen in any DOJ prosecution of a complex case, much less one involving a former president.DAVIES: Right. And of course, Jack Smith was appointed after Donald Trump formally announced his candidacy for a second term.We need to take another break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Carol Leonnig and Aaron Davis, two investigative reporters. Their new book is \"Injustice: How Politics And Fear Vanquished America's Justice Department.\" We'll continue our conversation after this break. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF MARCO BENEVENTO'S \"GREENPOINT\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with investigative reporters Carol Leonnig and Aaron Davis. Their new book is a detailed look at Donald Trump's impact on the U.S. Department of Justice, and in particular, why the case against Trump charging interference in the 2020 election never went to trial.You know, the other moment here that's interesting is in September of '22, when the investigation is finally underway, Merrick Garland, the attorney general, freezes both investigations. Well, you explain why.DAVIS: Well, this was one. You know, there are delays that were known about how slow and cautious and careful things had been under Merrick Garland. But this is a new one. And that is, heading into the midterm elections - this is before Donald Trump announces that he's going to run for reelection. This is, you know, with members of Congress on the ballot. Merrick Garland decides that in effect, Donald Trump is now the de facto head of the Republican Party.And so for that reason, we should not continue with these investigations in an active way where any steps that we take could become known publicly or people could be seen coming into a grand jury room. And so we're going to take a pause. And this is a very common pause. It's actually a regulation, kind of, you know, best practice within the Department of Justice that for 60 days before an election to kind of have a quiet period and then not do anything that could impact voters as they go to the polls.LEONNIG: But not typically for a person who's not an actually named candidate.DAVIS: Exactly.DAVIES: Right. But what that meant was that, you know, dozens and dozens of agents, the spadework of, you know, filing subpoenas and interviewing witnesses, all that had to stop for a couple of months.DAVIS: There were a couple interviews that, you know, folks who are aware of this situation told us that, you know, they by that point in time did know and had indications that Donald Trump had shown people classified documents that he had retained in Mar-a-Lago, had been talking to people about them. And they wanted to go forward with these investigations and knock out those interviews as quickly as they could. And some of those did not take place then for months during that quiet period.DAVIES: So Garland eventually names Jack Smith as special counsel because once Donald Trump is a candidate, we can't have the attorney general of the guy he's running against trying to put him in jail. I mean, that appears to be a conflict. And I got to say, the stuff in the book about Jack Smith is very interesting, how when he's hired, he's in a hospital in - where was it, the Netherlands? He had a terrible leg injury and then manages to just push himself through and get all this done. They filed the election interference case in August of 2023. Now, that's a few months before the presidential election. And the judge, Judge Chutkan, sets a trial date for April of 2024, which is right in the middle of the primary campaign. That's just really not a good look, is it?(LAUGHTER)LEONNIG: No, it turns out to be a weapon that Donald Trump uses very effectively against the Justice Department and against Jack Smith. I mean, I want to underline something, if you don't mind, from what you said earlier, Dave, which is about Jack Smith when he's appointed. His leg is broken in multiple places. He's in so much pain that he's literally waking up other people in the hospital with some of his screams and he has to be moved out of that ward. And during this time, Garland calls him and says - would you take the job if I offer it to you tomorrow? - not realizing how damaged, how devastated, really, physically Jack Smith is.And there's a question about whether or not Jack can take the oath of office under all these painkillers he's taking. And he decides on his own to dismiss himself from the hospital, against medical advice, and stops taking the medication so he can properly take the oath without any question about his faculties. He goes on to push his team with incredible rigor to bring these cases. But back to your other point about this isn't a good look. It ends up being really terrible because even though Jack Smith and his team are sprinting to make decisions and to bring the cases they think are justified, Donald Trump is falsely claiming that the only reason he's being prosecuted now in 2023 with a trial in 2024 is because a left-wing, radical DOJ wants to help Biden block him from winning reelection.DAVIES: You know, on that point, you know, we haven't yet really talked about the documents case that grew from President Trump's taking a lot of documents from the White House, and then when asked for them back by the National Archives, you know, delaying and dissembling and misleading. And eventually, after a lot of painful soul-searching, they execute a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago. Nobody really knows how much effort they went to try and avoid that, but they do that. And, you know, Trump and his allies went crazy about, you know, this gestapo invading Donald Trump's private residence because he's their political target. And even agents of the FBI in many offices are sending angry emails. What are we doing, right? The Justice Department really kind of needed to explain itself.DAVIS: Well, Dave, this is a really interesting part of the book where you see just how different internally the election interference case is from the classified documents case. And the night after they do that search of Donald Trump's residence in Mar-a-Lago, the then Assistant Attorney General for National Security Matthew Olsen convenes this hasty conference call to talk about the documents that they've just gotten. And there's, you know, dozens of these and hundreds of pages.And he turns to this woman who's kind of considered the encyclopedia of the Justice Department when it comes to mishandled and classified documents, Julie Edelstein. And he says, what do we do now? And Julie turns to him and says, if it was anybody else, we would arrest him tomorrow. And it just kind of for me crystalized how the FBI, the agents, you know, these grizzled agents, who did not want to go back and step into an investigation against Donald Trump after everything that happened through a crossfire hurricane, felt compelled and had no choice in their minds to go forward with his investigation, that there was just too many really important documents, secrets of the government that had been left in the wind down there in Florida.DAVIES: The election interference case really went off the rails when the Trump team challenged the whole case by arguing that because Donald Trump was president when the alleged offenses occurred, he is immune from prosecution 'cause he was pursuing his official duties. The trial judge disagrees. An appeal court disagrees. But the Supreme Court kind of agrees, right? They say that if he was executing actions in pursuit of his core functions - this is rough language - that he is immune from prosecution. Now this, of course, could be further litigated, but essentially it means the end, right? Why?LEONNIG: You know, it's such a critical moment, and I think I'd like to take you into a couple of the rooms where it happened here because the Supreme Court, first off, immediately accelerates one case and postpones another. They accelerate a case in this junction in 2024 to hear an argument about whether or not Donald Trump should be disqualified and struck from the Colorado state ballot for reelection because he's been accused of insurrection, of being engaged in an insurrection and that insurrectionists can't run for president. The Supreme Court accelerates on an emergency basis hearing that case, but they decide at the same time not to rush on hearing the immunity case.And this causes consternation inside the Department of Justice, inside Jack Smith, the Special Counsel's office, and inside the chambers of trial Judge Tanya Chutkan, who's supposed to hear this case. She and her chief judge have been planning security for the event. But when they see the Supreme Court is slow walking a decision on immunity, she knows that there's going to have to be an appeal again of whatever decision they have. And they stop worrying about having a trial at that moment. They conclude that it's very unlikely, and they stop having their security meetings.The immunity decision, again, is really interesting by how it reverberates when it comes down in July of 2024 because inside Attorney General Merrick Garland's office, he is just shocked by the opinion and conveys to his aides, because he knows these justices personally, that they have to know that what they've written is wrong.DAVIS: That has - another effect of that decision is that there was by that point in time a document inside Jack Smith's office. There was a 100-page plan for how they were going to try Donald Trump for election interference. And so the folks in his office have to go back through and begin to red line and take out everything that they think could, you know, no longer be brought. And there were a lot of interesting things that they had, some that the public's never really heard about before. We have some details of the things that were taken out of that case that were going to be presented at trial.And that included a meeting way back at the beginning of COVID when Donald Trump was in a room with a bunch of Homeland Security and Election Security folks and they were telling him about all the improvements they'd done in election security. And by the accounts of people in that room, he says, great, we should have a press conference and tell everybody how secure the 2020 election is going to be. And obviously the COVID hits and press conference never happens, but it goes to the point of, you know, his understanding of election security evolved a whole lot over the course of 2020 and how secure it was after he ended up on the wrong side of the ballot numbers.DAVIES: So Donald Trump, you mean, he didn't want to declare that the election was secure.DAVIS: He never did. Yeah. They never had that press conference that was - that they had talked about and encouraged his administration to have.DAVIES: We need to take another break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Carol Leonnig and Aaron Davis, two investigative reporters. Their new book is \"Injustice: How Politics And Fear Vanquished America's Justice Department.\" We'll continue our conversation after this break. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF THE BUDOS BAND'S \"INTO THE FOG\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with investigative reporters Carol Leonnig and Aaron Davis. Their new book is a detailed look at Donald Trump's impact on the U.S. Department of Justice. The book is titled \"Injustice: How Politics And Fear Vanquished America's Justice Department.\"You know, as I looked over the book and looked at kind of the fact that the election interference case against Donald Trump, you know, it ultimately didn't get developed in time to come to trial. The delay was critical. But when you look at how and why it happened, in a lot of times it's just normal human stuff. I mean, like, the Justice Department was overwhelmed trying to prosecute the January 6 attackers and so, you know, it was distracted. And the Michigan attorney general had a problem with pursuing it maybe because she was a Democrat seeking reelection. There are just a lot of factors and considerations that imposed caution and led to the delay. But I'm wondering, you know, as you talk to FBI leaders about this now, do any of them express regret? Do they say, yes, we should have moved with urgency?DAVIS: I think the short answer is yes. There's several folks we've talked to for the book who feel terribly about how things have gone. You know, I think you have to stand back and realize that in so many ways, Donald Trump benefited from a very cautious, very cross your Ts and dot your Is Justice Department, benefit from the very things that are not now part of how the Justice Department operates, and that certainly, you know, he said he has no interest in affording his political enemies, that they're - you know, he calls them criminals and they should be subject to prosecution.There no doubt were a whole lot of human moments in the last many years where, you know, Merrick Garland comes into office thinking that - and telling people close to him that he feels like finally the fever of Trump in the first term has burst, you know, in the wake of January 6 and the country is finally going to turn as it did after Watergate and be ready to move forward together. And that was the moment he came into, and that's really, as best of our reporting shows, what he firmly believed. And so he felt like he had a lot of time, you know, that the country was heading in a different place.And so quickly it shifted. And Trump, his base rallied behind him. And so it was a very moving target that he was - the time that he was living through. But there's no doubt that it's a tragic point in time and, you know, in the calculus here of where things are, it's a point where you have to say that the Department of Justice is really only as good and as stable as the people who are there running it. And, you know, that has whiplashed a lot over the last 10 years of the period we cover.DAVIES: I want to ask a question that might be a little outside your lane, and you can pass if you want to, but I'm curious about it. You know, it strikes me that the American people deserved a chance to hear the evidence that the Justice Department had developed about Donald Trump's alleged interference and make a judgment. I mean, a jury, of course, would also make a judgment, you know, given the constraints of the trial and the legal arguments and all that. But it would have been a useful thing for the American public to really hear their case about what happened and hear Trump's defense. That didn't happen.But on the other hand, I think, realize, you know, anybody who saw the January 6 congressional hearing, you know, I don't know how you could see that and not be appalled by it. And it seemed there was a very persuasive case that Trump sought to overturn the results of a fair election. But it sure doesn't seem that a majority of American voters believe that, right? I mean, and I just wonder, do you think it would have made a difference in terms of his electability, in terms of how the American people feel about him if there had been a trial?LEONNIG: You know, we actually - at the Washington Post, when I was there, there was a decent amount of polling we were doing trying to talk to our readers and also just citizens across America about whether or not an indictment and a trial would impact their view of Trump if they were already Trump supporters. And some of them said it would change things for them to see that evidence. But remember, we're reporters who weren't rooting for a particular president. We weren't trying to push for one thing or another. But we know from our reporting how devastating the failure to get this before the American people was just based on facts being provided to the public.And the person who said that best - we learned about a private meeting of judges where a Republican appointee was meeting with others in the D.C. bench, where the case would have been heard. And he's very, very well respected. Judge John Bates served as the chief of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for many years and has a broad support among Democrats and Republicans, or I should say appointments by Democrat or Republican judges. Very down the middle. And he said, in this group setting, this was a huge failure of the American justice system that these trials never saw a courtroom.DAVIES: Well, Carol Leonnig, Aaron Davis, thank you so much. Congratulations on the book and thanks for speaking about this.LEONNIG: Thank you.DAVIS: Thank you.DAVIES: Carol Leonnig is a senior investigative correspondent for MSNBC. Aaron Davis is an investigative reporter for the Washington Post. Their book is \"Injustice: How Politics And Fear Vanquished America's Justice Department.\" We recorded our conversation last Thursday.On tomorrow's show, we talk with Misty Copeland, the first Black woman to become a principal dancer with American Ballet Theatre. She'll talk about her final performance, the personal and physical pain she endured through her life and artistry, and how Prince changed her perception of herself.

The cause was complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, the statement said. Cheney had dealt with a history of heart problems.   \"Dick Cheney was a great and good man who taught his children and grandchildren to love our country, and to live lives of courage, honor, love, kindness, and fly fishing,\" the statement said. \"We are grateful beyond measure for all Dick Cheney did for our country. And we are blessed beyond measure to have loved and been loved by this noble giant of a man.\"   In a statement, former President George W. Bush, who picked Cheney as his vice president, said the death \"is a loss to the nation and a sorrow to his friends. Laura and I will remember Dick Cheney for the decent, honorable man that he was.\"   Bush added that Cheney \"was a calm and steady presence in the White House amid great national challenges. I counted on him for his honest, forthright counsel, and he never failed to give his best.\"   \n   An inauspicious beginning   There was little in Cheney's early life to foreshadow the immensely influential role he would one day play at the highest levels of American politics. Born the son of a government conservation worker in Lincoln, Neb., in 1941, he would flunk out of Yale University and work as a lineman for a power company in his new home state of Wyoming. Toss in a pair of drunken-driving convictions, and it's an inauspicious young adulthood.   But turn it around Cheney did: marriage to his high school sweetheart, Lynn; two children; a college degree at the University of Wyoming; graduate school at the University of Wisconsin.   While Cheney was turning his life around, the U.S. was caught in the throes of the Vietnam War. Cheney supported that war but never fought in it. He received five military deferments. Critics would seize upon this decades later, as Cheney helped lead the U.S. into another controversial war — this one in Iraq.   Ordinary to extraordinary   The future vice president began his political career as a congressional intern in 1969. That same year he went to work for a future partner in the Bush administration — Donald Rumsfeld, who ran an economics office in the Nixon White House.   \n   Cheney left the White House before Nixon's resignation, but in 1974 he was back working for the new president, Gerald Ford. Cheney moved up quickly, becoming Ford's chief of staff at the age of 34.   It was then that he began to develop a philosophy that would come to full flower in the White House of George W. Bush. His belief was that the power of the presidency must be not only protected, but also restored. In the 1970s, he watched as Congress enacted reforms in response to Watergate and to Vietnam.   \"We've seen the War Powers Act, an anti-impoundment control act, and time after time after time, administrations have traded away the authority of the president to do his job,\" he said in a 2002 interview on Fox News. \"We're not going to do that in this administration. The president is bound and determined to defend those principles and to pass on this office, his and mine, to future generations in better shape than we found it.\"   \n   War, a recurring theme   In 1978, Cheney ran for Congress in Wyoming and won. That was also the year he suffered the first of a series of heart attacks. He served in Congress for a decade and finally gave up his seat to become secretary of defense for President George H.W. Bush.    This job brought Cheney's first confrontation with Saddam Hussein, when he directed Operation Desert Storm in the Middle East. The war ended quickly after Iraqi troops were evicted from Kuwait. At the time, there were some who felt the U.S. should continue all the way to Baghdad and topple Saddam's regime. President Bush declined; in 1994, Cheney defended that decision.   \"The notion that we ought to now go to Baghdad and somehow take control of the country strikes me as an extremely serious one in terms of what we'd have to do once we got there,\" he said. \"You'd probably have to put some new government in place. It's not clear what kind of government that would be, how long you'd have to stay. For the U.S. to get involved militarily in determining the outcome of the struggle over who's going to govern in Iraq strikes me as a classic definition of a quagmire.\"   \n   Cheney left the Pentagon when the first President Bush lost to Bill Clinton. Two years later, he flirted with a presidential run of his own but instead headed to the private sector, joining the giant energy services company Halliburton.   \n   Changing the vice presidency — and foreign policy   The job made Cheney a wealthy man, but he stayed involved in conservative politics. In 2000, he was asked by Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush to lead the search for a running mate. Bush later made a surprise announcement that he had chosen none other than Cheney.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Dick Cheney and George W.

Cheney also redefined the office of the vice president. He became President Bush's closest adviser and a dominant player in shaping policy. Critics alleged that Cheney was really the man in charge at the White House.    The events of Sept. 11, 2001, only reinforced this notion. While Bush was in Florida that day, Cheney was at the White House. He was literally carried by Secret Service agents to an underground bunker. In an interview years later on NBC's Meet the Press, Cheney said it was he who told Bush not to return to the White House.   \"I said, 'Delay your return. We don't know what's going on here but it looks like, you know, we've been targeted,'\" Cheney said, adding that \"things that we did later on that day tied directly to guaranteeing presidential succession.\"   \n   After the Sept. 11 attacks, Cheney advocated an aggressive new foreign policy in which potential threats would be met with swift, preemptive action. No longer would the U.S. wait for an enemy to strike first. He helped sell the Iraq War by issuing dire warnings to the American people. At the same time, he famously predicted that the mission itself would be relatively easy.   On Meet the Press, Tim Russert, who then hosted the show, asked Cheney if the American people were ready for a long, bloody battle.   \n   \"I don't think it's likely to unfold that way, Tim, because I really do believe we will be greeted as liberators,\" Cheney said.   As the war dragged on, Democrats seized that statement as evidence of how Cheney's determination to go to war had clouded his judgment. There was talk that his views had changed from his earlier days in politics.   Controversy follows Cheney   While Cheney's disposition was never particularly sunny, critics assailed the vice president as a relentlessly grim figure. Late-night comics called him Darth Vader. Even President Bush had fun with his vice president's image on Halloween one year.   \"This morning I was with the vice president,\" Bush told reporters. \"I was asking him what costume he was planning. He said, 'Well, I'm already wearing it,' and then he mumbled something about the dark side of the force.\"   There were other controversies that dogged Cheney as the Bush administration's popularity plummeted in its second term. In 2007, his chief of staff and top adviser, Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, was convicted of perjury in an investigation into the leaking of the name of covert CIA operative Valerie Plame. Cheney was not implicated in the case legally, but he was tainted by the scandal nonetheless.   \n   Then, in what was one of the more bizarre incidents involving someone as high-ranking an official as Cheney, he accidentally shot and wounded a friend, attorney Harry Whittington, in the face and chest with birdshot pellets during a 2006 weekend quail-hunting trip at a Texas ranch.   Even in a strange story like this, some of the classic Cheney traits, such as secrecy, were on display. The story didn't come out for two days, and when it finally did, Cheney himself took days longer to speak about it, finally doing an interview with Fox News.   On Cheney's final day in office, he sat in a wheelchair, the result of an accident, bundled up against the frigid cold, and watched as President Barack Obama was sworn in.   \n   Out of office, he emerged as a frequent and outspoken critic of the Obama administration, even accusing the president of not understanding that the U.S. was at war.   In February 2010 he made a surprise appearance at CPAC, the conservative political action conference in Washington. The crowd erupted.   It was one of the last moments of big public adulation for Cheney. With the rise of Donald Trump, Cheney's brand of politics and his interventionist foreign policy fell out of favor in the party. Trump would often lambaste Cheney for launching what he called \"forever wars.\"   It carried into the next generation as Trump attacked Cheney's daughter, former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), when she voted for Trump's impeachment after a riot at the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.   Trumps relentless criticism of her contributed to Liz Cheney's defeat when she ran for reelection in 2022. Along the way, her feather appeared in television spots on her behalf.   \"In our nation's 246-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,\" Dick Cheney said in the ad.   It was his last big public moment in the political arena. Two years later, he would endorse Democrat Kamala Harris over Trump for president.   In the end, the power of the Cheney name was greatly diminished in GOP politics. His legacy became one of contradictions: Trump supporters despised him, while some Democrats embraced him — if reluctantly — and still many others would always condemn him as a war criminal for his role in Iraq.   Now Cheney has died, with a legacy in government service, foreign policy and the balance of power between the branches of government. No matter his contradictory legacy, he leaves behind a personal stamp on a presidency greater than any vice president before him.\n",

In a court filing, officials said depleting that fund means \"no funds will remain for new SNAP applicants certified in November, disaster assistance, or as a cushion against the potential catastrophic consequences of shutting down SNAP entirely.\"   Starting Nov. 1, SNAP benefits did not hit accounts as expected after the USDA, which administers SNAP, froze funding, citing the federal government shutdown. The shutdown is now in its 35th day.   \n   It is unclear when low-income families who depend on SNAP will receive these partial funds. The Trump administration said it anticipates long delays — \"anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months\" — before benefits arrive in the hands of registered SNAP recipients.   President Trump threw the plans into further uncertainty by posting on Truth Social that benefits \"will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!\" It is unclear if that means the government will not follow what it stated in court filings.     Last week, two federal judges ordered the Trump administration to use emergency funding to provide SNAP benefits for the 42 million people who rely on the program to feed their families. U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston ruled the Trump administration has until Monday to decide whether to pay at least partial SNAP food benefits but did not issue a temporary restraining order. In Rhode Island, U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. granted a temporary restraining order and said the Trump administration must submit a plan on how it would comply with his order, or \"at least an update,\" by noon on Monday, Ocean State Media reported. Both judges were appointed by former President Barack Obama.   \n      Are you worried about your SNAP benefits? NPR wants to hear your story      SNAP, the country's largest anti-hunger program, dates back to the Great Depression and has never been disrupted this way. Most recipients are seniors, families with kids and people with disabilities.   Food banks are stretched thin   In the few days since SNAP funding elapsed, food banks across the country have experienced a surge of people in need of their services, leading to long lines and widespread worries about how they will meet the escalating demand in the coming weeks. Some food bank administrators warn that it may soon amount to a public health crisis.   Small grocery stores, local farmers, and other retailers authorized to accept SNAP benefits are also bracing for changes as many of their usual customers are without the means to pay for food this month.   Some local communities have set up informal systems to support their neighbors in need of food assistance. In several cities, food banks have collaborated with government officials to connect residents with food resources. Others put out calls for volunteers to support their work.   While many food banks have previously dealt with difficult situations like natural disasters that strained their operations, the scale of this nationwide shutdown represents an unprecedented national food crisis. Senior citizens may be disproportionately impacted.   — Anusha Mathur, NPR   Read more: 'The helpers need help'. Food banks brace for impact as SNAP cliff looms   Reporters from the NPR Network are covering the uncertainty and lapse in benefits in states across the country.   Here's what we know so far.      State-specific impacts:   Alabama   Roughly 749,000 people are enrolled in SNAP in Alabama, according to the USDA. In 2024, SNAP assistance reached 15% of the state population (1 in 7 people). Alabama's Department of Human Resources (DHR), the agency responsible for SNAP in the state, says on its website that individuals can still apply for SNAP benefits during the suspension and DHR will continue to process applications and determine eligibility. Benefits will not be issued until the suspension is lifted.Current SNAP recipients, however, \"must continue to recertify their benefits, report as they normally would, and submit all documentation that would normally be required for them to continue in the program,\" DHR says. This is necessary so that each SNAP recipient can more quickly use their November funds in the grocery stores.   \n      Alaska   Roughly 66,000 people are enrolled in SNAP in Alaska, according to the USDA. The Alaska Department of Health said on Oct. 31 that it had not received funding for November's SNAP benefits [Alaska Public Media]Officials say the division will continue adding SNAP beneficiaries during the shutdown and Alaskans who lost food because of Typhoon Halong in western Alaska can apply to get October SNAP benefits re-issued.

[Alaska Public Media]Sen. Lisa Murkowski told NPR's Scott Detrow that she hopes that contingency funding can be used to help pay out SNAP benefits, particularly for those impacted by Typhoon Halong. \"I have seen different statements indicating that these contingency funds need to be reserved for disasters,\" she said on Friday. \"For those SNAP recipients in Alaska who have suffered this disaster, yeah, we want to make sure that they have some level of assistance or relief there.\"      Arizona   More than 887,000 people are enrolled in SNAP in Arizona, according to the USDA. Indigenous communities, including the Navajo and Cherokee Nations have been hit particularly hard.

The agency is awaiting further guidance from USDA.Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders directed $500,000 to six food bank networks across Arkansas, blaming Democrats for the shutdown and the impact on SNAP beneficiaries in her state: \"The simplest, fastest solution remains for Democrats to reopen the government and fund programs like SNAP, but in the meantime, my administration will work with our legislators, churches, and food banks to help feed Arkansans.\"Arkansas' DHS is pushing SNAP recipients to find local food pantries, churches and other organizations for temporary food assistance and to check for eligibility of other food programs. As the benefits run dry, some community members have established informal systems to foot their neighbors' grocery bills.

Richard Blumenthal sharply critiqued the Trump administration for the shutdown and resulting impact on SNAP: \"Millions of Americans are struggling to put food on the table — a harsh reality that President Trump has abjectly failed to recognize, and Republicans have made worse by refusing to work with Democrats on reopening the government and providing access to health care.\" [CT Public]Meanwhile State Sen. Stephen Harding, Connecticut's Senate Minority Leader blamed Democrats: \"Bottom line: Democrats need to join Republicans in voting to reopen the government and resolve this crisis.\"[CT Public]Shortly after the latest shutdown began, some Connecticut legislators asked if the state — which has enjoyed unprecedented budget surpluses averaging more than $1.8 billion since 2017 — could again pump some of its own resources into SNAP benefits. But if EBT cards are shut off that could prove ineffective. Officials say  they are exploring options to expand emergency aid to food pantries and food banks and other nonprofit nutrition assistance services.

Lindberg, the founding director of Sweden's V-Dem Institute, which monitors democracy across the globe, says the U.S. has already crossed the threshold and become an \"electoral autocracy.\"   Steven Levitsky, a professor of government at Harvard University and co-author of How Democracies Die, agrees.   \"I would argue that the United States in 2025-26 has slid into a mild form of competitive authoritarianism,\" Levitsky said. \"I think it's reversible, but this is authoritarianism.\"   Under competitive authoritarianism, countries still hold elections, but the ruling party uses various tactics — attacking the press, disenfranchising voters, weaponizing the justice system and threatening critics — to tilt the electoral playing field in its favor.   \n   Levitsky cited what he considers two strikingly autocratic moments that occurred in September. First, the Trump administration threatened ABC's parent company, Disney, following Jimmy Kimmel's comments on the killing of Charlie Kirk.   \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Brendan Carr, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, warned.   A week later, President Trump proposed that U.S. generals use American cities as training grounds for their troops.   \"We're under invasion from within,\" Trump said to a gathering of military brass in Quantico, Virginia. \"No different than a foreign enemy, but more difficult in many ways because they don't wear uniforms.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Protesters throw trash and objects as they clash with federal agents and police during a \"National Shutdown\" protest against Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Los Angeles on Jan. 30, following the shooting deaths of two U.S. citizens by federal agents in Minneapolis.\n                \n                    Patrick T. Fallon/AFP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Patrick T. Fallon/AFP\n    \n\n   \n   Levitsky said this is the kind of language dictators in South America used in the 1970s — leaders like Augusto Pinochet in Chile.   A smaller number of scholars reject the portrayal of Trump as a would-be autocrat. They say he is expanding executive power to address the excesses of his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.   Jonathan Turley, a professor at George Washington University Law School, says Trump is pressuring news organizations and universities to address problems with liberal bias.   \"There are legitimate objections that have been raised by the Trump administration,\" said Turley, the author of Rage and the Republic. \"That does not justify some of the means, but there is a long-standing need for a debate within these institutions.\"   \n   Other political scientists say the U.S. system of government is battered but still democratic. Kurt Weyland, who researches democracy and authoritarianism at the University of Texas at Austin, says he's increasingly confident that the U.S. can withstand Trump's sweeping attempt to expand executive power.   Weyland said that for the first months of his second term, Trump was like a \"steamroller\" and faced little containment or opposition. But Weyland, who wrote Democracy's Resilience to Populism's Threat: Countering Global Alarmism, says that has changed.   For instance, Kimmel was yanked off the air but soon returned and continues to routinely mock Trump. Weyland also said the president's attempt to tilt the electoral playing field through mass redistricting hasn't worked out as he might have hoped.   \"If the guy had succeeded in seriously skewing [future] elections in the House, that would've gone to the core of democracy,\" said Weyland, \"but he didn't. He got barely anything.\"   Weyland also said federal agents shooting two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis last month was disastrous for the president. Border czar Tom Homan said last week that the immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota is ending. Weyland thinks the public blowback to the killings limits Trump's ability to deploy such aggressive tactics going forward.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Demonstrators spell out an SOS signal of distress on a frozen lake in Minneapolis, in the aftermath of the shooting deaths of Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents.\n                \n                    John Moore/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        John Moore/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The next big test for American democracy could come in November's midterms. The Trump administration is suing states to hand over voter data, which worries Kim Scheppele, a Princeton University sociologist who has studied the authoritarian tactics of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.   In 2014, Orbán's government messaged Hungarian voters living in the United Kingdom to go to one polling place and then switched to a different location on Election Day.   \"They disenfranchised almost all the Hungarians in the U.K., most of whom were oppositional to Orbán,\" says Scheppele.   This month, Steve Bannon, a close Trump ally, proposed that the administration deploy Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to polling places to root out undocumented migrants trying to vote — which is statistically rare.   \n   White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said she'd never heard the president discuss such a plan — and federal law prohibits it.   But Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College, worries that such a move would drive down participation by people of color and naturalized citizens who fear harassment by ICE. If ICE were deployed, Nyhan hopes it would spark even more people to vote.   \"But even contemplating that kind of interference is, I think, a really substantial threat,\" said Nyhan. \"The way Election Day works in this country, there are no do-overs.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      Sen. John Cornyn is seeking Texas Republicans' nomination for a fifth term, in a contest that has seen bitter and expensive attacks on all sides.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Texas Senator John Cornyn is running for a fifth term, and he's facing a tough Republican primary. Early voting starts Tuesday. Houston Public Media's Andrew Schneider reports.ANDREW SCHNEIDER, BYLINE: If you're in Texas and anywhere near a TV, it's hard not to notice all the attack ads. Cornyn is fighting for his political life against challenges from his own party - State Attorney General Ken Paxton and Houston area Congressman Wesley Hunt.(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character) Ken Paxton enriched himself, lied on loans, funded pro-amnesty groups.UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character) They're perfectly in step. Crockett calls Cornyn her best partner in the Senate.UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #3: (As character) Wesley Hunt backed Hillary, abandoned Trump and abandoned Texans.SCHNEIDER: Hunt is attacking Cornyn both for supposedly not being conservative enough and for his age. Cornyn is 74 and Hunt 44. Here's Hunt in a recent appearance on Newsmax.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)WESLEY HUNT: President Trump understands that we're going to need leadership for the future, not just now, but for the next eight, 12, 16 years.SCHNEIDER: Many of the arguments in the Republican Senate primary seem to boil down to the question of who's the true conservative and which candidate will most support President Trump. Here's Paxton talking about Cornyn on \"The Mark Davis Show.\"(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE MARK DAVIS SHOW\")KEN PAXTON: He's never liked Trump. He didn't want him to win in 2016. I've got clips of that. He didn't want him to win in 2024. He suggested he was a criminal. There's nothing about John Cornyn that's real right now. It's all fake to win a primary 'cause he knows that the voters like Donald Trump.SCHNEIDER: But Cornyn himself stresses his legislative record is one of near-total support for the president.JOHN CORNYN: There's a lot at stake with President Trump's second term of office. I'd like to continue to help him accomplish his priorities and goals.SCHNEIDER: Cornyn, who spoke with Houston Public Media recently for the story, voted to acquit Trump in both of his Senate impeachment trials. He says he's concerned about the prospects of a third Trump impeachment if Democrats recapture Congress. Cornyn points to Paxton's baggage from past and ongoing scandals that could hurt him in the general election.CORNYN: He claims to be a victim, but strangely enough, most of the things that has happened to him, like his impeachment, like a referral by his own senior staff to the FBI for interfering in a criminal investigation, and blowing up basically his own family, are the result of his own mistakes and misdeeds.SCHNEIDER: That's a line that Cornyn and his supportive political groups have been pushing since Paxton entered the primary. Paxton was acquitted in his impeachment trial on corruption and abuse of power charges in 2023. He's currently in the midst of a messy public divorce. But Bill Miller, an Austin-based political consultant, says it's not gaining much traction with likely GOP primary voters.BILL MILLER: The striking thing about Ken Paxton is all these events, and if you add them individually or collectively, they haven't changed his ability to win elections. Not just win, but win handily.SCHNEIDER: Both Paxton and Hunt declined to be interviewed for this story. As for who ultimately benefits from all the negative politics, Miller says the answer may be the Democrats.MILLER: I think that's the best thing that they can hope for is that the Republicans self-destruct or destructive toward one another during the primary and weakens him immeasurably for the fall. That's how you win the race if you're a Democrat these days in Texas.SCHNEIDER: A recent survey shows none of the Republicans polling a clear majority among likely primary voters. That means the GOP primary race could go to a runoff between the top two vote-getters on May 26. By that point, the Democratic contest between Dallas Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett and Austin state Representative James Talarico is likely to have been decided for more than two months.For NPR News, I'm Andrew Schneider in Houston.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

    "body": "\n      The shutdown at the Department of Homeland Security is the latest example of bipartisan negotiations unraveling in the wake of a crisis that captures national attention.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  The third partial shutdown of the U.S. government in three months is having less obvious effects than the others.LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Funding ran out for the Department of Homeland Security, though key employees like airport security remain on the job. Coming up, we'll speak with a former FEMA administrator about the shutdown's impact on operations at the disaster relief agency. First, let's take a closer look at how missed funding deadlines are becoming routine and how that's making it harder for the government to think ahead.INSKEEP: NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas was listening to lawmakers as they didn't work things out over the past several days. Sam, good morning.SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: Hey, Steve.INSKEEP: Why does this keep happening?GRINGLAS: Yeah. So this latest effort seems to be following, I guess, a familiar cycle. A crisis captures national attention - in this case, the deadly shootings of two U.S. citizens by immigration agents in Minneapolis or, recently, health subsidies expiring and spiking premiums. A number of Democrats and Republicans suggest that they will respond, like when Republican Senator Bernie Moreno said last month that a bipartisan deal to save the subsidies was in the red zone only for talks to fizzle, leaving both sides pointing fingers.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BERNIE MORENO: Shouldn't we be here trying to figure out how to solve problems rather than trying to figure out how to score political points for the purposes of the next election?INSKEEP: Well, is that a fair assessment that Congress can't get anything done?GRINGLAS: Yeah. Some lawmakers would push back, like Republican Senator Susan Collins. I asked her why bipartisan talks seemed to keep crumbling. And she rejected that idea, pointing to all the spending bills that Congress has agreed to.SUSAN COLLINS: I don't know how you could possibly describe that as crumbling. That's Congress reasserting its power of the purse.INSKEEP: OK. That's an interesting argument. Congress has been very, very obedient over the last year, and she's saying, actually, no, now we're pushing back and funding things the way we want to. But why is it difficult for Congress to act on these hot-button issues that get a lot of public interest?GRINGLAS: I put that question to former Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp, and she told me that once the shock of a crisis wears off, lawmakers go back to their corners, and while bipartisan deals have always been delicate, many lawmakers today see less incentive as politics becomes more tribal.HEIDI HEITKAMP: The base on both sides, their willingness to reward compromise is greatly diminished.GRINGLAS: And Democratic Senator Tim Kaine says that on some issues, finding consensus is just really hard.TIM KAINE: On health care, on immigration, the parties are in fundamentally very, very different places.INSKEEP: OK. So let's circle back to this DHS shutdown, the partial shutdown. Any progress toward an agreement over the weekend?GRINGLAS: The White House and Democrats have been trading offers, but Democrats have described Republican proposals so far as insufficient, and Republicans are calling Democrats' demands unreasonable, like requiring judicial warrants for some enforcement operations. And judging by how fast lawmakers left D.C. last Thursday for a weeklong recess, the two sides are still far apart.INSKEEP: Could this shutdown last long enough that we could feel some effects?GRINGLAS: Members have been told to be ready to come back this week if there's a deal. Meanwhile, immigration enforcement will continue. Congress already gave ICE billions of dollars last year. Disaster response has money to work with for a while, and TSA agents won't miss a paycheck for a few weeks. So most Americans may not notice this shutdown unless it drags on.INSKEEP: OK. We'll see what happens in days to come. NPR Sam Gringlas. Thanks so much.GRINGLAS: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

He struck a less aggressive tone than Vice President JD Vance did in lecturing them at the same gathering last year but maintained a firm tone on Washington's intent to reshape the trans-Atlantic alliance and push its policy priorities.   Kallas alluded to criticism in the U.S. national security strategy released in December, which asserted that economic stagnation in Europe \"is eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilizational erasure.\" It suggested that Europe is being enfeebled by its immigration policies, declining birth rates, \"censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition\" and a \"loss of national identities and self-confidence.\"   \n   \"Contrary to what some may say, woke, decadent Europe is not facing civilizational erasure,\" Kallas told the conference. \"In fact, people still want to join our club and not just fellow Europeans,\" she added, saying she was told when visiting Canada last year that many people there have an interest in joining the EU.   \n   Kallas rejected what she called \"European-bashing.\"   \"We are, you know, pushing humanity forward, trying to defend human rights and all this, which is actually bringing also prosperity for people. So that's why it's very hard for me to believe these accusations.\"   In his conference speech, Rubio said that an end to the trans-Atlantic era \"is neither our goal nor our wish,\" adding that \"our home may be in the Western hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe.\"   He made clear that the Trump administration is sticking to its guns on issues such as migration, trade and climate. And European officials who addressed the gathering made clear that they in turn will stand by their values, including their approach to free speech, climate change and free trade.   British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Saturday that Europe must defend \"the vibrant, free and diverse societies that we represent, showing that people who look different to each other can live peacefully together, that this isn't against the tenor of our times.\"   \n   \"Rather, it is what makes us strong,\" he said.   Kallas said Rubio's speech sent an important message that America and Europe are and will remain intertwined.   \"It is also clear that we don't see eye to eye on all the issues and this will remain the case as well, but I think we can work from there,\" she said.\n",

Of those, Jamaat won 68, a record high. It had never before won more than 18 seats. The student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) won six and the remainder went to minor parties.   The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won a landslide 212 seats, giving it the two-thirds majority and setting Tarique Rahman, who hails from a powerful political family, on course to become prime minister. Developments in Bangladesh are being closely watched beyond its borders. It is the world's eighth-most populous country and second-largest garment exporter after China, supplying major brands to Europe and the United States - a position the BNP will be keen to protect.   \n   The country's other major party, the Awami League, was banned from taking part in the polls. Its leader, former autocratic prime minister Sheikh Hasina, fled the country after the deadly 2024 student-led uprising that toppled her government and paved the way for this vote.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                People offer Friday prayers on a road outside a mosque a day after the national parliamentary election in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Friday, Feb. 13, 2026.\n                \n                    Anupam Nath/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anupam Nath/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Jamaat-e-Islami's leader, Shafiqur Rahman, who is not related to the BNP's Tarique Rahman, initially claimed there had been irregularities during voting. He later conceded defeat and said in a statement: \"We recognize the overall outcome and we respect the rule of law. We will serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition, holding the government to account.\"   A surprising result after decades on the periphery   Jamaat's result has come as a shock to many, in part because the party opposed Bangladesh's independence in 1971 and sided with Pakistan during the war.   \n   At the time, its leaders were accused of committing widespread atrocities, including rape, torture and murder — accusations the party has consistently rejected.   Some of its senior members were tried and found guilty of those crimes in a specially formed court from 2010 to 2013, when the Awami League was in power. Some were given death sentences, while others received life imprisonment. Jamaat maintains that the trials were politically motivated.   The party was also banned at various times, most recently by the Awami League in 2023. The ban was lifted following the 2024 uprising, allowing Jamaat to reemerge as a major electoral contender.   \n   \"Many voters are young, and they don't like to live in the past. They want to build their future. Jamaat has been saying things that seem more practical and achievable,\" Maimul Ahsan Khan, a retired law professor of law at Dhaka University, told NPR.   However, he added, \"I think Jamaat would have got even more seats if it did not have the past baggage of affinity to Pakistan and 1971.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Women queue up to cast their vote at a polling station during Bangladesh's national parliamentary election, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Thursday, Feb. 12, 2026.\n                \n                    Mahmud Hossain Opu/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mahmud Hossain Opu/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Observers say the result may mark just the first step for Jamaat in rebuilding its political influence.   \"With 77 seats, we have nearly quadrupled our parliamentary presence and become one of the strongest opposition blocs in modern Bangladeshi politics. That is not a setback. That is a foundation,\" said Shafiqur Rahman.   Civil rights concerns   While more than 90 percent of Bangladesh's population is Muslim, its political system ensures equal rights for minority religions.   Although Jamaat has Sharia — or Islamic — law enshrined in its constitution, it has recently softened its public image, taking a more moderate tone on religion and saying it will respect Bangladesh's political system.   It fielded one Hindu candidate during the election but no women, and Shafiqur Rahman has publicly said no woman can lead the party.   However, Jon Danilowicz, an independent political analyst and retired former diplomat who served in Bangladesh, told NPR that violence against minority groups in Bangladesh has a long history and is often driven by factors besides ideology alone.   \"Often it's driven by economics and other issues,\" he says, and minority groups have \"been equally victimized by the BNP and Awami League.\"   Danilowicz says that in regards to the party's treatment of women, \"they frame it as protection and safety and in terms of family and preserving the role of women within a family structure.\"   Jamaat's first tests are to demonstrate that it can hold the new government accountable and to implement the July National Charter — a set of reforms to prevent a return to autocracy — which could help to reassure millions of Bangladeshis who still distrust the party.\n",

And with that bar set about as low as it can be, Rubio cleared it — barely. A year ago, Vance attacked Europe for allowing what he saw as out-of-control migration.   \n   But Rubio took a different approach: He said that immigration had become a challenge in the U.S. as well. And he said that together, the U.S. and Europe in the postwar era had \"a dangerous delusion\" that they had entered \"the end of history\" and that \"every nation would now be a liberal democracy, that the ties formed by trade and by commerce alone would now replace nationhood.\" But the end result was that \"an unprecedented wave of mass migration that threatens the cohesion of our societies, the continuity of our culture, and the future of our people.\"   \n   Throughout his speech, Rubio drew Europeans closer to the destiny of the United States, outlining the contributions from European countries to the construction of the New World. \"Our frontiers were shaped by Scots-Irish, that proud Hardy clan from the hills of Ulster,\" Rubio said. \"That gave us Davy Crockett and Mark Twain. And Teddy Roosevelt and Neil Armstrong. Our great Midwestern heartland was built by German farmers and craftsmen who transformed empty plains into a global agricultural powerhouse.\"   \n   Rubio also cited the contributions of the Italians, French and Spanish to the formation of the United States, but he neglected to mention the Native Americans who many of these groups left devastated. He didn't mention how these groups exploited African slaves, or the Chinese who helped build the railway in the American West, or the contributions of so many other cultures who have made the United States what it is today.   \n   And when Rubio was finished, the European leaders assembled inside the Hotel Bayerischer Hof rewarded him with a standing ovation. Conference organizer Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to the U.S., took to the stage and said Europe was \"breathing a sigh of relief,\" referring to the leaders present, whose countries have long depended on American security guarantees and trade, and who were painfully accepting they were being pulled away.    One official not impressed with Rubio's cherry-picked history of the early United States was European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, who wore a look of horror and was one of the few people in the room who did not immediately stand during the applause.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas gives a speech at the 62nd Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15.\n                \n                    Thomas Kienzle/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Thomas Kienzle/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"Contrary to what some may say, woke, decadent Europe is not facing civilizational erasure,\" she said on stage on the final day of the conference.   \n   Kallas was not alone in her reluctance to be reassured by a member of the Trump administration. One of the most consequential speeches of the three-day conference came from a leader who typically is not known for rousing, unifying oratory: German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.    Merz's no-nonsense speech, delivered on Friday, the opening day of the conference, noted that the theme of this year's conference, titled \"Under Destruction,\" was a grim outlook on an international rules-based order.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                German Chancellor Friedrich Merz speaks with Wolfgang Ischinger (not pictured), chairman of the Munich Security Conference, after delivering his speech at the conference on Feb. 13.\n                \n                    Johannes Simon/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Johannes Simon/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"But I'm afraid that we have to put it in even harsher terms: This order, as flawed as it has been in its heyday, no longer exists,\" he said.   Merz blasted the bullying nature of \"big power politics\" waged by the U.S. under President Trump, China and Russia. \"Great power politics turns away from a world in which increasing connectivity translates into the rule of law and peaceful relations between states,\" said Merz. \"Natural resources, technologies and supply chains are becoming bargaining tools in the zero-sum game of the major powers. This is a dangerous game.\"   Merz told conference attendees that Germany and the rest of Europe had learned the lessons from World War II about \"big power\" governance and he urged European countries to unite their resources to resist these big powers, and to build a new European economy that will rival these big powers but maintain democratic values.    \"Russia's GDP is currently about 2 trillion euros, but that of the European Union is almost 10 times as high,\" said Merz, \"but still Europe is not 10 times as strong. Our military, political, economic and technological potential is huge, but we haven't tapped into this potential for a very long time, so the most important thing is to turn the switch in our minds now.\"   Merz acknowledged that the current geopolitical climate has forced Germany to implement changes to how it funds its military so that it is able to operate at \"full speed,\" but he said harnessing that pressure to create something new and good is now all of Europe's responsibility.   \n   And while European leaders may give visiting Trump administration officials standing ovations when they hear a rekindling of hope for the trans-Atlantic relationship, the tenor of this year's Munich Security Conference showed that these displays of appreciation are just that.    Europe is moving on.\n",

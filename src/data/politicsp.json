Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., listens to testimony during a House Judiciary Subcommittee on Oversight field hearing on violent crime in Charlotte, N.C., Sept. 29. In a recent interview on Morning Edition, Kiley discusses his decision to continue working during the government shutdown.\n                \n                    Nell Redmond/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Nell Redmond/AP\n    \n\n   \n   As the government shutdown drags on, most House members have gone home at the direction of Speaker Mike Johnson. But one Republican, Rep. Kevin Kiley of California, still reports to his Capitol Hill office each morning.   \"I'm looking for any and all constructive conversations toward getting us out of this mess,\" Kiley told Morning Edition's Michel Martin. \"The good news is, I've had a number of those from folks on both sides of the aisle. The bad news is, the government is still shut down.\"   Kiley, who represents California's 3rd District, which includes Yosemite and Death Valley National Parks, has criticized Johnson's decision to recess the House while the shutdown continues.   \n   \"It's all the more urgent given the fact that the government is shut down and we're starting to see people losing their food assistance benefits. We're seeing flight delays and all of the other compounding costs to the American people,\" he said.   Kiley says the pause has frozen normal work.   \"We have 20 committees in the House of Representatives, countless subcommittees that were supposed to be doing things each of the last four weeks,\" Kiley said.   Johnson argues keeping lawmakers home pressures the Senate to act on a seven-week funding bill. Kiley disagrees.   \"Clearly, it's not working,\" he said. \"Sometimes you have to work with people who have a different position in order to find common ground.\"   Democrats have criticized Johnson's handling of the standoff, accusing the speaker of using the recess to delay the swearing-in of Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, who won a special election to fill the seat of her late father, Rep. Raúl Grijalva of Arizona. Johnson has rejected that claim, saying the delay is unrelated. Kiley said he supports seating Adelita Grijalva without delay.   \"She won her election. I don't know why this is even an issue,\" he said.   He added that he's open to negotiating over the expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies — a key reason Democrats have refused to support the current funding bill.   \n   \"There's enough interest on both sides for a deal,\" Kiley said. \"I don't see why we're not talking about that now.\"   For now, he's continuing to show up to his office each morning, an act to remind colleagues that Congress should still be working.   \"We should have a functioning House of Representatives,\" Kiley said.

The reinstallation on Saturday was a follow-through of an earlier National Park Service announcement that the federal government intended to restore the statue, which it says had been damaged in \"riots.\"   The monument to Pike was first erected in 1901, but has long been a contentious issue within the nation's capital.   The Pike statue is the only monument within Washington, D.C. to honor a Confederate general – but it does not mention his military history. Pike, who was a Freemason and was pardoned by President Andrew Johnson, has also been identified by historians as possibly having been involved with the development of the Ku Klux Klan in the period after the Civil War.   \n   The plaque at the base of the statue, which was originally mounted by the Freemasons, calls Pike an \"author, poet, scholar, soldier, jurist, orator, philanthropist and philosopher.\"   Members of the D.C. Council, the district's legislature, have been calling for the statue's removal since 1992.   \n   In an unsigned statement sent to NPR on Monday, the National Park Service wrote: \"The National Park Service announced on Aug. 4, 2025 that it will restore and reinstall the bronze statue of Albert Pike, which was damaged and vandalized during the Black Lives Matter riots in June 2020. The restoration aligns with federal responsibilities under historic-preservation law and recent executive orders to beautify the nation's capital and restore pre-existing statues.\"   In a statement released Monday, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) objected to the statue's reinstallation, calling it \"an affront to the mostly Black and Brown residents of the District of Columbia and offensive to members of the military who serve honorably.\"   \"Pike himself served dishonorably. He took up arms against the United States, misappropriated funds, and was ultimately captured and imprisoned by his own troops,\" Norton continued. \"He resigned in disgrace after committing a war crime and dishonoring even his own Confederate military service. Confederate statues should be placed in museums as historical artifacts, not remain in parks or other locations that imply honor. Pike represents the worst of the Confederacy and has no claim to be memorialized in the Nation's capital.\" In August, Norton introduced a bill to remove the Pike statue permanently.\n",

On the trail, he attacked the media and the elites, raged against measures to combat climate change, vowed to cut income taxes and gas prices, and even expressed support for President Trump's policies.   It might seem surprising then to now see Ford — who is in charge of Canada's largest province — taking the lead in opposing Trump's harsh tariffs as Prime Minister Mark Carney scrambles to manage the fallout from U.S.-Canada trade tensions.   In recent months, Ford's criticism of Trump has been growing, most recently in the form of a television ad featuring the words of President Ronald Reagan warning in a 1987 radio address against the perils of protectionism. The ad has attracted Trump's ire and appears, at least temporarily, to have derailed trade talks between the two countries.   \n   Who exactly is Doug Ford and what accounts for this political 180?   Three generations of the former businessman's family have served as elected officials, and Ford began his political career on the Toronto City Council from 2010 to 2014.   \n   The period was marked by the dramatic fall from grace of his younger brother, then-Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, who admitted to smoking crack cocaine and then was dogged by evidence of a string of other abusive behavior.    In the same year that Rob Ford publicly admitted to drug use, The Globe and Mail published an exposé that said the brothers had dealt hashish in the 1980s.   Rob Ford died from a rare form of cancer in 2016.   Moving from the right to the center   Just two years after his brother's death, Doug Ford's political fortunes blossomed. He and his right-of-center Progressive Conservative Party won a majority in Ontario, riding discontent against the Liberal Party, who were coming off 15 years in power in the province.   \"Doug Ford got elected in large measure to get rid of a very unpopular government,\" says Steve Paikin, a long-time political analyst and host of the Paikin Podcast, a weekly current affairs podcast in Canada.   Paikin says after Ford's success in 2018, he made the mistake of assuming Ontario had voted for his agenda, when in fact the Progressive Conservatives' election success was mostly about removing the Liberals.   \n   \"He got into office practicing a kind of disruptive, robust populism on steroids, which made his government, frankly, the most unpopular I had ever seen,\" Paikin says.   That's when he decided to tack to the center. In the years that followed, Ford reached out to Canada's left, including the now-prime minister. He also won praise even from critics for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic response in Ontario.   \"COVID saved him. When the COVID crisis hit, he suddenly realized that all the kind of populist, anti-science, anti-expertise, 'we're just going to wing it by the seat of our pants,' that wasn't going to work,\" Paikin says. \"He suddenly realized, I need to rely on experts.\"   NPR reached out to Ford's office for an interview with the premier, but received no response.   From Trump enthusiast to \"Captain Canada\"   When former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he would step down in March this year, just as the White House was preparing its April 2 \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, Ford moved in to fill the vacuum, emerging as the voice of the anti-tariff response.   \n   By the time of his second reelection bid earlier this year, Ford's early enthusiasm for Trump had long faded. On the campaign trail, he donned a baseball cap that mocked the red \"Make America Great Again\" hats — Ford's blue cap, worn at a news conference in January, read \"Canada is not for sale.\"   \"President Trump is promising steep and sweeping tariffs that will devastate our economy and put hundreds of thousands of people out of work,\" Ford told voters. \"Whether he imposes tariffs next week, next month or waits a year, President Trump's threats are not going away. With a strong mandate from the people, I will do whatever it takes to protect Ontario.\"   After winning reelection in February, Ford threatened to cut off electricity to homes in the U.S. in retaliation for the tariffs and Trump's threats to annex Canada. Ford also canceled a $100 million contract with Elon Musk's SpaceX to provide Starlink services to the country.   \n   Ford's stance won him the sobriquet \"Captain Canada.\"   \"Bad cop\" to Carney's \"good cop\"   Trump announced Friday that he was ending all trade negotiations with Canada over the ad featuring Reagan. Ford subsequently said that after talking with Carney, he had decided to pause the advertising campaign, calling it a success for having reached U.S. audiences.   In an X post on Friday, Ford wrote: \"Canada and the United States are friends, neighbours and allies.\" In a statement later, he said: \"Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses.\"   \"We've achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels,\" he added.   Paikin suggests that because of their close relationship, Carney and Ford are playing a game of \"good cop, bad cop\" with the anti-tariff ads – Ford gets to ramp up the rhetoric as Carney plays deal maker.   \"Mark Carney ran on a platform of elbows up and ever since he became the prime minister, the elbows have definitely been down,\" Paikin says. \"He's trying to take a more muted approach.\"   \"The other side of the coin is [that] Doug Ford is free to do whatever he wants.\"\n",

After initially hesitating to have a child, Pohjola says she realized in her mid-30s that she wanted to become a mother, and Blomberg agreed.\n                \n                    Sarah McCammon/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Sarah McCammon/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Families in the U.S. and around the world are having fewer children as people make profoundly different decisions about their lives. NPR's series Population Shift: How Smaller Families Are Changing the World explores the causes and implications of this trend.      On a clear but chilly autumn day, Poa Pohjola and her partner Wilhelm Blomberg are relaxing in their Helsinki apartment while their baby naps outside on the balcony, in traditional Finnish style.   \"They sleep very well outside, in colder degrees, I think,\" Pohjola said with a laugh. \"Or, that's how I grew up thinking.\"   \n   Pohjola is 38 and Blomberg is 35. They've been together for about three years, and they started talking about having a baby early on - even though Pohjola had once thought she might never have kids.   \"I think I was denying that for myself because it seemed [like] something that would be impossible to have,\" she said.   \n   In her 20s, Pohjola says she struggled to figure out what she wanted from life. By the time she met Blomberg, she knew the window of opportunity to become pregnant was closing because of her age.   But one night, the couple talked about their wishes for their future, and she told Blomberg she thought she wanted a baby. He agreed.   Blomberg says they both felt ready to be parents.   \"One, in a way, convincing argument was that both of us have had time to, like, roam around and do what we want in life,\" he explained.   Researchers say Finnish people are increasingly delaying having children, or not having them at all. The nation's \"total fertility rate\" — a technical term used by demographers — has fallen to historic lows in recent years. Although there have been some signs of a possible rebound in recent months, the number remains less than 1.3 children per woman — well below the replacement level of 2.1 needed to maintain a steady population.   \n   That's despite the Nordic region's reputation for providing paid time off for both mothers and fathers, along with childcare and other support. As families around the world are having fewer children, even Europe is seeing a major drop in birth rates despite those generous, publicly funded benefits.   Among other things, that means less demand for Finland's iconic baby boxes.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Eeva Patomeri, a spokesperson for Kela, Finland's taxpayer-funded social insurance agency, says the government has been distributing \"baby boxes\" filled with clothing and other infant supplies since the 1930s. But she says the demand has declined along with the birth rate.\n                \n                    Sarah McCammon/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Sarah McCammon/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"It has loads of winter clothes, loads of summer clothes, loads of baby care items, something for moms,\" said Eeva Patomeri, a spokesperson for Kela, Finland's taxpayer-funded social insurance agency.   They've been handing out the boxes since the 1930s and there's a new edition of the box each year. But many new parents were still getting last year's box well into 2025 because Kela still had so many left over from 2024.   \"Sometimes the box, we start delivering it in spring, and now it was August, and that's because of low birth rates,\" Patomeri said, adding more parents are choosing cash payments in lieu of the box, too.   \n   Benefits for Finnish parents go far beyond free baby clothes and blankets. Both mothers and fathers receive government-subsidized parental leave through Kela, low-cost childcare and national healthcare.   Kela's research manager, Anneli Miettinen, says historically, leaders of the Nordic countries: Finland, along with Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, thought these policies were helping to support relatively stable birth rates.   \"So we cannot really any longer say that it's our good family policies that explain good fertility in the Nordics,\" she said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Along with Finland's iconic baby boxes filled with supplies, Finland's government offers new parents taxpayer-funded benefits including paid parental leave, low-cost subsidies, and national healthcare.\n                \n                    Sarah McCammon/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Sarah McCammon/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Births have fallen across the region, with Finland's falling to the lowest rate among the five nations — down by a third since 2010.   \"What is puzzling researchers, is how this could be true, because all of these countries are relatively good in providing support to families,\" Miettinen said, \"but there aren't really very good explanations for the very low fertility rates at present.\"   \n   Immigration has offset some of the decline, but officials in Finland, like many other countries facing this global trend, are still worried about an aging population, a shrinking workforce and pressure on the pension system.   Anna Rotkirch, with the nonprofit Family Federation of Finland authored a report last year commissioned by the Finnish government, which outlined possible causes and policy solutions. Rotkirch says her research suggests a gap between what young people say they want from life and the families they ultimately form.   \"We go to schools; you talk to 17-year-olds, and we are like, 'What would be your ideal family? If you want a family at all, what would be your ideal life?'\" she explained.    \"You get these, surprisingly, in a way, normative perceptions,\" she added. \"You know, 'I want a small house with a dog and a garden and a spouse and three children.'\"    \"And it really breaks my heart, because I'm like, that's not going to happen. If the world goes on like it's now, you know, half of you, this is just not going to happen,\" she said.    \n   Disconnected and financially uncertain amid family planning   Rotkirch says there appear to be many possible reasons for this decline. Many young people are focusing on their education and careers. Those who have children are having them later. Rotkirch says young people also are having a harder time forming relationships, and some researchers think technology is partly to blame.   \"Screens are away from actual physical, embodied interactions, and it's in those interactions that babies get made and also people fall in love,\" she explained. \"The physical part of our humanity is obviously at stake.\"   Milla Tuokkola, a 34-year-old television writer in Helsinki, says she's tried dating online. But too often, she says, she's been harassed and subjected to degrading language.   \"They're just very porn-brained…objectifying,\" she said of the men she's meeting online and on dating apps. \"I feel like they're being radicalized online when they're young.\"   Tuokkola is divorced. Sometimes, she thinks she'd like to have a child, but she's had trouble meeting the right partner.   \"They don't seem a safe, reliable option to have a child with,\" she said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Milla Tuokkola, 34, a television writer in Helsinki, says she's open to having a child but she has struggled to find the right partner\n                \n                    Sarah McCammon/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Sarah McCammon/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Some young adults say when they think about having children, they also worry about the larger state of the world, whether climate change or the economy.   Anselmi Auramo, 28, is a student in Helsinki. He's engaged to be married, and plans to become a father one day, but says he's not sure when he'll be financially ready. He believes financial concerns cause many young people to think twice about having children.    \"Whether it's [the] American dream or Finnish dream or whatever it is, it seems so distant, and you expect to have that in order to have the family,\" he said.   Answering a global question   Finland's struggle to boost family size matches what many other countries are experiencing. From authoritarian regimes like China and Russia to progressive nations like Canada and Finland, governments have tried a range of policies designed to encourage higher birth rates.   \n   But experts say even the most expensive attempts at policy solutions have shown limited or no success.   Miettinen, with Kela, says there's not one, single reason why young people are having fewer children, and there won't be a single solution to reversing the trend, either.   \"These types of policies may not be enough any longer, but we need to invent something else to support young adults,\" she said.   \n   Rotkirch, with the Family Federation, says ultimately, these decisions are in the hands of younger generations.   \"But what we can do as the elderly generations and what the policy makers can do is really prioritize this,\" Rotkirch said. \"Prioritize listening to young people - their wishes for family formation - and support them.\"   For Poa Pohjola and Wilhelm Blomberg, the couple with the new baby, there are fears about the future. Pohjola remembers Finland's financial crisis in the early 1990s, and worries about economic stability.   Blomberg says he thinks about climate change and rising authoritarianism around the world.   \"We are in such turbulent times, and it's hard to, like, have a sense that you can control things,\" he said. \"And one thing you can control is whether you're having a baby or not, as it's so hard to predict what the future will bring.\"   Still, they're talking about having another child; Blomberg has a brother he's very close to, and he'd like to give their son a sibling, too.   Pohjola is slightly more hesitant.   \"When I start overthinking it, I'm like, 'Okay, we would need to have this child quite soonish, and then we have a toddler and a baby,\" she said. \"And okay, we won't be sleeping, so it's gonna be a lot of work.\"   But, now that she's had one baby, she said, she's inclined to have another.

NPR's legal team privately questioned the CPB's longtime chief executive, Patricia Harrison, under oath earlier this month, according to the radio network's legal filings, and is scheduled to do so publicly at a court hearing Tuesday morning.   In court documents, NPR has presented evidence to bolster its case that the board of the nonprofit corporation first approved a multiyear, multimillion-dollar contract for NPR to operate a satellite distribution system for public radio stations. Then, NPR alleges, CPB unlawfully yielded to political pressure by yanking the contract just days after President Trump warned that NPR should receive no more federal dollars. NPR contends it is yet one more example of a major institution yielding to the president's whim.   \n   CPB rejects that, saying that it awarded the contract to a different group to better serve the nation's diverse array of public radio stations. NPR and CPB each declined comment for this story, citing the litigation.   The two institutions — along with PBS — have stood together at the core of public media for more than a half century. They formed a united front, at least publicly, as they lobbied lawmakers against clawing back the $1.1 billion already approved by Congress and signed into law by the president for the broader public media system.   \n   Behind the scenes, however, CPB and PBS officials signaled they would not object to pulling funding for NPR, which has drawn the lion's share of Republicans' accusations of liberal bias.   A White House budget official warns CPB of her \"intense dislike for NPR\"    NPR's legal documents offer the following chronology: In late March and early April, Trump called NPR and PBS \"monsters\" and demanded Congress eliminate federal funds for them.   On April 2, CPB's board directed officials to negotiate the fine print of a contract with NPR to operate the satellite for the next three years, according to NPR's filings. The radio network has operated the system, through which local radio stations receive and share programs, podcasts and other content, for four decades.   \n   Two days later, a senior White House budget official met with three CPB executives.   \"It would be a shame to throw the baby out with the bath water,\" the administration official, Katherine Sullivan, said, according to accounts from CPB officials cited by NPR in its legal filings. She suggested CPB could salvage its future and relayed her \"intense dislike for NPR,\" Harrison wrote to NPR CEO Katherine Maher a few days later, according to NPR's recent filings in the case.   Harrison expressed deep fears that the White House could take an ax to CPB and public media more broadly. \"These rumors have potential to turn into boy who cried wolf,\" Harrison wrote in her email to Maher. \"Except the wolf is really coming.\" Within days, CPB's board moved to direct executives to refashion the terms of the contract so it could only be granted to an entity that stood entirely apart from NPR.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Patricia Harrison, right, accepts the Governors Award on behalf of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) from Henry Louis Gates Jr. during the Television Academy's 2025 Creative Arts Emmy Awards on Sept. 7, 2025.\n                \n                    Phil McCarten/Phil McCarten/Invision/AP/Invision\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Phil McCarten/Phil McCarten/Invision/AP/Invision\n    \n\n   \n   Even as they moved to sever the NPR contract, and linked the decision privately to the political climate, court documents show several CPB executives told a newly hired Republican consultant they could not simply announce they were withdrawing the satellite contract from NPR to appease the White House.   \"There are obvious political challenges, but we can't 'own that' outright,\" Debra Sanchez, CPB's chief of staff, wrote to the Republican consultant, Carl Forti, in one of several such exchanges captured in NPR's court filings. \"So we are in a tight spot sort of. What are the strongest messages we can make about the 'why' or the 'because?'\"   For all those efforts, when Trump and his Republican allies in Congress stripped public media of subsidies, it was the beginning of the end of CPB. The nonprofit laid off most of its staff last month and expects to shut down in January. Layoffs also have ensued at PBS and many public media stations.   \n   NPR and CPB are battling in court over a separate pot of money, worth tens of millions of dollars, to operate the satellite system.   CPB argues NPR and public media stations may have separate interests   CPB argues that NPR is wrongfully acting as though it is entitled to operate the satellite in perpetuity. Its legal team has waved off NPR's arguments that it acted due to political pressure. Instead, CPB contends that, with the elimination of federal subsidies, the radio network's interests may diverge from those of local public media stations. CPB's lawyers say the decision to grant the contract to another group is intended to ensure that stations' long-term interests are protected.   \n   The offer pulled from NPR — a three-year contract worth nearly $36 million — pales in comparison to the new one announced in September. That one is valued at $57 million over five years. CPB has awarded it to a consortium that includes New York Public Radio, American Public Media, the National Federation of Community Broadcasters and a consulting firm called the Station Resource Group, among them. It is called Public Media Infrastructure, reviving the dormant nonprofit Public Radio International.   Earlier this month, Harrison told officials at public media stations receiving a final round of federal grants that she would be compelled to reveal unflattering critiques of NPR's leadership as a result of the litigation.   \"As this lawsuit moves forward, CPB will be required to place into the public record evidence of its concerns and the concerns of others about NPR's management, its resistance to innovation and reforms that many in our system have urged it to undertake, and its repeated dismissal of the importance of the federal appropriation that sustains public media,\" Harrison warned Oct. 13 in an email to station officials.   In court filings, CPB says the April decision came \"after decades of studies by outside consultants\" and embodied \"a strategy of having an independent entity that was more inclusive of the broad range of public media entities across the country\" than NPR.   \n   NPR alleges political pressure behind a change of mind   By NPR's telling, the allegations represent a case study in what happens when institutions wilt under the president's unprecedented exercise of executive authority. CPB and the Trump administration are co-defendants in this case, which was filed by NPR and three Colorado public radio stations over Trump's executive order which sought to simply order the ending of all federal funding for public media. Yet CPB earlier sued Trump over his efforts to oust its board members, calling that unconstitutional.   As CPB pulled back from the contract understanding with NPR, Sanchez hired Forti, the Republican consultant. On his first day on the job, April 10, he wrote a memo defining CPB's challenge as he saw it: \"BIAS: Belief both in Administration and among general public that the media is biased against conservatives and more specifically against Trump. NPR is high on those lists.\"   That same day, Trump posted online: \"NO MORE FUNDING FOR NPR, A TOTAL SCAM!\"   On April 14 — the same day that news broke that Trump would formally request Congress to rescind all future funding for CPB — CPB Chief Operating Officer Kathy Merritt called her counterpart at NPR, Ryan Merkley, to say the board had changed course. It would no longer award federal money to operate the public radio satellite and distribution system unless it were spun off NPR.   On Capitol Hill, as Trump's push to eliminate all federal subsidies for public radio, CPB executives mapped out a strategy to appeal to Republican Senators John Barrasso of Wyoming and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia — red states where statewide public media networks carry broad appeal. (CPB's board chair had previously headed Wyoming PBS.)    But it was to no avail. The senators voted along with all but two of their Republican colleagues to successfully eliminate all funding for public media — helping to seal the fate of CPB.   \n   Disclosure: This story was reported and written by NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Michel Martin speaks with former Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell about President Trump's visit to Asia, where he's looking to make deals and contain the rising influence of China.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  For more on possible outcomes of President Trump's Asia trip, Kurt Campbell joins me now. He was a deputy secretary of state during the Biden administration. He cofounded and chairs The Asia Group, which advises companies working in the region. Good morning. Thanks so much for joining us.KURT CAMPBELL: Good morning, Michel. It's great to be with you. Thanks.MARTIN: So as we just heard from Mara, a lot of deals were at stake during this trip. Many countries in the region have been unhappy about how the Trump administration has handled their partnerships. You know, you're out of government now, but you're still working on Asia issues. Does this matter? Is there any indication that this unhappiness is going to - is there going to be any pushback to the president's demands?CAMPBELL: Well, we just heard a great report about how China is pushing back, but many of these other countries are in a more delicate position. I think almost all the countries in Asia want the United States to remain engaged. So this trip has brought with it some anticipation, but a lot of apprehension because clearly President Trump's favorite tool dealing with a lot of these countries in trade terms is coercion. And so they all want to try to get the best possible deal so that they can keep the United States around but keep their economies humming.MARTIN: You know, the president attended the signing of a peace treaty between Thailand and Cambodia yesterday. The two countries agreed to a ceasefire following a border dispute after Trump threatened them with higher tariffs. Does this deal increase his sway in the region? Does it foretell anything about how he might function going forward?CAMPBELL: Well, you know, Michel, this is kind of a recreation. This was a deal that was struck last year. The tensions remain. I think the president does want to highlight his peacemaking abilities. And so there is a theatrical dimension to this trip, and that was on full display there and also when he was dancing at the airport when he arrived.MARTIN: OK, so the highlight of the president's trip will undoubtedly be his meeting with the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping. It's set for later this week. What are you expecting to come out of these talks?CAMPBELL: Well, you know, I think what Mara laid out is exactly right. But I think if you look behind this idea of a trade truce, I think you see a couple of dynamics at play. I believe what the president wants in the short term is a trade deal that will boost largely agricultural products, ranch products, perhaps airplanes, in the short term to Beijing. I think he wants that for political purposes. Those parts of the country, you know, have been hurt, particularly folks that produce some agricultural stuff.And I think at the same time, the Chinese want restrictions lifted on certain key technologies. And I think, as you've heard, many people are concerned that that's not a good deal for us, and that those areas, AI chips, semiconductor capabilities, those are our high card. And the president is actually, I think, contemplating trading that away for short-term political benefits that might be good for him in next year's election.MARTIN: You've written that the U.S. foreign policy establishment has developed a tendency to underestimate China's strengths at its own risk. Do you think that President Trump is following that pattern?CAMPBELL: You know, I think actually both countries tend to see the other as weaker. I think China looks at us as in decline. I actually think that's quite dangerous. But I think one of the things that has become quite clear over the course of the last couple of months, China's prepared to use its leverage with rare magnets, other kinds of things to make clear that they're not going to lay down for the United States. I think President Xi has recognized, during the first Trump presidency, China was very much off-balance. This time around, they have mixed sort of hard and soft approaches. They've been respectful to the president, but they've played hardball in negotiations. And they're going to really extract a heavy price if that's what the president wants.MARTIN: Before we let you go, we have about a minute left. President Trump has suggested he might extend his trip to meet with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, if Kim agrees. If this does happen, what do you think might come out of such a meeting?CAMPBELL: Look, you know, the circumstances have changed since the meetings in the first term. President Trump clearly has a fascination with these different leaders from Russia, China, and North Korea. North Korea is now fully aligned with both Russia and China. It has troops fighting in Russia. They've indicated that they have really not that much interest in engaging with the United States unless the United States recognizes North Korea as a nuclear state. My deep hope is the president won't go down that path.MARTIN: That is Kurt Campbell. He's chairman and cofounder of The Asia Group. Mr. Campbell, thank you so much for joining us.CAMPBELL: Great to be with you. Thank you so much.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Californians vote on whether to draw new congressional districts next month. Their decision might come down to how they feel about Gov. Gavin Newsom's confrontation with President Trump.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Across this state, we're seeing lots of political ads ahead of next week's election. Californians are being asked to approve new congressional maps, and the result could determine who wins control of the House in next year's midterm elections. Now, that vote could hinge on how Californians view Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom versus how they view President Trump. From member station KQED in San Francisco, Marisa Lagos reports.MARISA LAGOS, BYLINE: Newsom and fellow Democrats are asking voters to throw away the maps created by an independent redistricting commission just a few years ago and approve districts aimed at giving Democrats five more seats in Congress next year. The measure is known as Prop 50.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)GAVIN NEWSOM: Why is Prop 50 called the Election Rigging Response Act? It's in response to an unprecedented assault on midterm redistricting.LAGOS: In an interview with KQED on Friday, the governor says the measure was placed before voters because President Trump is getting Texas and other Republican-led states to redraw their maps to give the GOP an advantage.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)NEWSOM: This was not - again, this was not the fight we wanted to have.LAGOS: Trump started the unusual mid-decade redistricting race, but there are political implications for Newsom, who acknowledged this weekend on CBS that he'll think about a presidential run in 2028. The outcome of next week's redistricting vote could impact his appeal to Democrats. He says this is about an assault on democracy by Trump and Republicans, noting Trump's Department of Justice announced Friday that it's sending election monitors to California and New Jersey, where there's a governor's race.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)NEWSOM: They're rigging the election. They're creating the pretext that after we're successful with Prop 50, that they can suggest somehow these were fraudulent. These elections were rigged against them. This is a preview of 2026. Wake up, everybody.LAGOS: In a statement, the DOJ said the monitors were being sent to, quote, \"ensure transparency, ballot security and compliance with federal law.\" Newsom's comments underscore how the Prop 50 campaign is making sure to tie that measure to national Republicans, President Trump and the MAGA movement. And that strategy is similar to four years ago when Newsom beat an attempt to boot him out of office in a recall election. But Jessica Millan Patterson, who's chairing the campaign opposed to the proposition and who previously ran the state Republican Party, says that approach is tired.JESSICA MILLAN PATTERSON: They don't have a playbook. Like, they have one play, and they play that every single time.LAGOS: Patterson says a large swath of the electorate remains undecided, and a range of voters, including disaffected Democrats and independents, are open to the argument that opponents are making.PATTERSON: This is far less partisan, despite what the yes side is trying to do. We talk about these lines that have been drawn by Democrats in a back room. That is when people are like, this is fishy, this is shady, and I don't want anything to do with it.LAGOS: GOP strategist Rob Stutzman, who's not involved in either campaign, says both tactics make sense. Democrats, who hold a 20-point registration advantage over Republicans in California, are simply trying to turn out their base he says.ROB STUTZMAN: So this is a, we don't want to do this, but they're forcing us to do this. If they're going to play dirty, then we got to play dirty.LAGOS: But Stutzman says he wouldn't count out the no side who are relying in part on a strategy that uses Newsom the same way Democrats use Trump.STUTZMAN: Newsom isn't just unpopular with Republicans. He actually triggers them.LAGOS: Newsom says Democrats across the nation are excited about Prop 50, and the campaign has received small dollar donations from all 50 states.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)NEWSOM: Because people understand what's at stake and they want to see people stand up and have their backs and fight.LAGOS: So while voters here are deciding whether to approve new maps, it may feel more like a choice between Newsom and Trump.

Regional observers will monitor the situation to ensure fighting doesn't restart.   \"We did something that a lot of people said couldn't be done,\" Trump said. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet called it a \"historic day,\" and Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said the agreement creates \"the building blocks for a lasting peace.\"   The ceremony was Trump's first event after arriving at the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, hosted in Kuala Lumpur. The trip, which will continue with visits to Japan and South Korea and a potential meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, is an opportunity for Trump to burnish his reputation as an international dealmaker at a time when his tariffs have scrambled the international economy and he's feuding with Democrats over a government shutdown back home.   \n   Trump touched down in the Malaysian capital shortly before 0200 GMT, where he performed his trademark campaign trail dance with local performers and waved an American flag in one hand and a Malaysian flag in the other.   \n   The president signed economic agreements with Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia, some of them aimed at increasing trade involving critical minerals. The U.S. wants to rely less on China, which has limited exports of key components in technology manufacturing.   \"It's very important that we cooperate as willing partners with each other to ensure that we can have smooth supply chains, secure supply chains, for the quality of life, for our people and security,\" said U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.   Trump reengages with a key region of the world   The president attended this summit only once during his first term, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth seemed unfamiliar with ASEAN during his confirmation hearing in January.   But this year's event was a chance for Trump to reengage with a collection of nations that has a combined $3.8 trillion economy and 680 million people.   \"The United States is with you 100%, and we intend to be a strong partner and friend for many generations to come,\" Trump said. He described his counterparts as \"spectacular leaders\" and said, \"everything you touch turns to gold.\"   \n   The summit also allowed Trump to play global peacemaker with Thailand and Cambodia, which have competing territorial claims that result in periodic violence along their border. Some of the worst modern fighting between the two countries took place over five days in July, killing dozens and displacing hundreds of thousands of people, some of the worst modern fighting between the two countries.   Trump threatened, at the time, to withhold trade agreements unless the fighting stopped in a display of economic leverage credited with spurring negotiations. A shaky truce has persisted since then.   \"The fact that Trump was holding the tariff card was actually very, very significant,\" said Ou Virak, president of Phnom Penh's Future Forum think tank. \"That's probably the main reason, if not the only reason, but definitely the main reason why the two sides agreed immediately to the ceasefire.\"   Now, he said, \"there's a ceremony for Trump to be in front of cameras\" so he can be \"seen as the champion that brings an end to wars and conflicts,\" giving him \"more ammunition for his bid for Nobel Peace Prize.\"   Trump has explicitly campaigned for the honor, continuously adding to a list of conflicts that he either helped resolve or claims to have ended.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                U.S. President Donald Trump attends the ceremonial signing of a ceasefire agreement between Thailand and Cambodia on the sidelines of the 47th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Sunday, Oct. 26, 2025.\n                \n                    Mohd Rasfan/POOL AFP/ AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mohd Rasfan/POOL AFP/ AP\n    \n\n   \n   Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim praised the agreement between Thailand and Cambodia during opening remarks at the summit, saying, \"it reminds us that reconciliation is not concession, but an act of courage.\"   Thai foreign ministry spokesperson Nikorndej Balankura described the deal on Saturday as a \"joint declaration\" that will show Thailand and Cambodia \"are committed to renewing their relations.\"   \"It's not an end in itself,\" Nikorndej said. \"Work has just begun.\"   Tariffs are in focus on Trump's trip   Trump is expected to sit down with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva while he's in Kuala Lumpur, but not Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. The U.S. leader is angry with Canada because of a television ad protesting his tariffs, and on his way to the summit, announced on social media he would hike tariffs on Canada because of it.   \n   Another trade war is front and center on Trump's trip — this one, with China. Trump told reporters traveling with him on Air Force One that he was optimistic his meeting with Xi, expected to take place in South Korea, could yield progress on a range of issues. Fentanyl trafficking and soybean sales are among Trump's priorities.   \"I think we have a really good chance of making a very comprehensive deal,\" Trump said. \"I want our farmers to be taken care of. And he wants things also.\"   It remains to be seen whether Trump's dealmaking addresses longstanding issues or puts them off for another day.   U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested Sunday that Washington and Beijing could step back from their confrontation instead of pushing forward with higher tariffs by America and export restrictions on rare earth elements by China.   When asked if the two countries could extend the trade truce from earlier this year, Bessent said: \"I would say yes.\" However, he emphasized that the final decision would be up to Trump.   Trump has expressed confidence about the prospect of finalizing trade agreements with Japan and South Korea, two longstanding allies and trading partners, during the trip.   \"We have deals with a lot of people and they're very good deals,\" he told reporters traveling with him on Air Force One.   One leader who was absent from the summit in Kuala Lumpur is Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Although he was close with Trump during his first term, the relationship has been more tense lately. Trump caused irritation by boasting that he settled a recent conflict between India and Pakistan, and he has increased tariffs on India for its purchase of Russian oil.\n",

    "body": "\n      President Trump visits Asia this week to work on trade deals with allies and to try pushing a deal with China.   \n\n    AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:  President Trump is in Asia this week, leaving behind a government shutdown and a demolition site at the White House. The East Wing has been torn down to make room for something Trump says he really wants - a new massive ballroom.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sir, this is the White House. You're the president of the United States. You can do anything you want.RASCOE: That's Trump earlier this month on what advisers told him about making this project happen. Joining me now is NPR senior political correspondent Mara Liasson. Good morning, Mara.MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning.RASCOE: So before we get into the Asia trip, you saw the White House up close this week. What are you going to miss about the East Wing?LIASSON: The East Wing was beautiful and historic. It was a magical way to enter the White House for a Christmas party or another event. But that clip you just played, where Trump was talking to donors at a dinner to thank them for the funds to make his ballroom dreams come true, pretty much sums up his approach to power. He says, when you're president of the United States, you can do anything you want, and this is what he wants to do.RASCOE: Well, another thing he wants to do is finalize trade deals with Japan and South Korea this week and make a deal with China's leader, Xi Jinping. The two are set to meet at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea. How hard will it be for Trump to get an agreement with Xi?LIASSON: It could be hard. This is the most high-stakes meeting Trump has had this term, with the potential to benefit the U.S. economy or make it worse. And China is a very powerful interlocuter. As Trump would say, China has a lot of cards, and they've been playing them - refusing to sell raw earth materials, not buying any soybeans from the United States.And on Air Force One on his way to Asia, Trump said, they'll have to make concessions, and we will, too. And the big question is, which concessions will Trump make? Will he let China buy more advanced semiconductor chips, which some national security experts say would be dangerous? Or would he say the U.S. opposes Taiwanese independence? China wants that. He's already held up a $400 million arms package to Taiwan. And what would he get in exchange? Would China start buying soybeans again? Would it resume rare earth material trade?And today on - this week on ABC, treasury secretary Scott Bessent said what he thinks will happen - what will be in a deal - he said that China had, quote, \"threatened to put a global exporting license regime on rare earths\", and he said, I believe they are going to delay that for a year while they reexamine it. Now, the Chinese readout of that meeting between Bessent and Chinese officials did not say there would be a delay in the rare earth pause. So we don't have any details yet.RASCOE: Trump has been focused on foreign relations lately. And he did something unexpected last week. He put sanctions on two Russian oil companies. What more can you tell us about why Trump decided to do this now?LIASSON: He decided to do it 'cause he was frustrated with Vladimir Putin. This is the first time in this term that he's done anything to pressure Russia other than just rhetorically. Sanctions will hurt the Russian economy, but they're not as powerful as Tomahawk missiles. That's what Ukraine wanted from the U.S., and the president appears to have ruled that out.RASCOE: I wanted to ask you about the redistricting push President Trump kicked off this year by getting Texas to redraw its maps to favor Republicans. Now it looks like Virginia lawmakers are holding a special session tomorrow to talk about redrawing its congressional maps to favor Democrats.LIASSON: That's right. Trump really kicked of a kind of cycle of tit for tat in partisan gerrymandering. California Democrats already are taking their redistricting plans to voters. Illinois and Maryland, two more blue states, are considering options to give Democrats more advantages. And that follows successful Republican efforts to redraw maps in North Carolina and Missouri. More red states are going to do the same.And I think all of this could mean that this mid-decade redistricting or partisan gerrymandering becomes a new normal. And in this game, the Republican party has the advantage because they control more governorships and state houses in the same state and because Republican voters are sprinkled more efficiently for electoral purposes throughout the heartland. Democratic voters tend to be more clustered inefficiently for electoral purposes in urban areas and along the coast, so they are much easier to gerrymander.RASCOE: OK, today is the 26th day of the government shutdown. That's the other big thing happening. And still no movement toward negotiations. This is now the second-longest shutdown in U.S. history. What are your thoughts?LIASSON: I have never covered a shutdown where both sides sincerely believe they have the political advantage.  One of them has to be wrong. Polls show more voters do blame Republicans for the shutdown. They are the party in power, but the Republicans are confident that they can pin this on the Democrats.As far as where do we go from here, there is no more center anymore in Congress. There's no kind of overlap between a group of conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans. In the past, that's where deals were hashed out between the parties. The only solution now is if President Trump calls Democrats to the White House for negotiations, but he says he is not going to do that until they vote to open the government.RASCOE: That's NPR senior national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thank you, Mara.LIASSON: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Any agreement would be a relief to international markets even it does not address underlying issues involving manufacturing imbalances and access to state-of-the-art computer chips.   \n   Beijing recently limited exports of rare earth elements that are needed for advanced technologies, and Trump responded by threatening additional tariffs on Chinese products. The prospect of a widening conflict risked weakening economic growth worldwide.   China's top trade negotiator, Li Chenggang, told reporters that the two sides had reached a \"preliminary consensus,\" while Trump's treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said there was \"a very successful framework.\"   Trump also expressed confidence that an agreement was at hand, saying the Chinese \"want to make a deal and we want to make a deal.\" The Republican president is set to meet with Xi on Thursday in South Korea, the final stop of his trip through Asia. Trump reiterated that he plans to visit China in the future and suggested that Xi could come to Washington or Mar-a-Lago, Trump's private club in Florida.   \n   Bessent told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that the threat of additional higher tariffs on China was \"effectively off the table.\" In interviews on several American news shows, he said discussions with China yielded initial agreements to stop the precursor chemicals for fentanyl from coming into the U.S., and that Beijing would make \"substantial\" purchases of soybean and other agricultural products while putting off export controls on rare earths.   The progress toward a potential agreement came during the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, in Kuala Lumpur, with Trump seeking to burnish his reputation as an international dealmaker.   Yet his way of pursuing deals has meant serious disruptions at home and abroad. His import taxes have scrambled relationships with trading partners while a U.S. government shutdown has him feuding with Democrats.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                United States Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent reacts during a meeting between President Donald Trump and Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Sunday, Oct. 26, 2025.\n                \n                    Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Trump attends ceasefire ceremony between Thailand and Cambodia   At the summit, Thailand and Cambodia signed an expanded ceasefire agreement during a ceremony attended by Trump.

This year's event was a chance for Trump to reengage with nations that have a combined $3.8 trillion economy and 680 million people.   \"The United States is with you 100%, and we intend to be a strong partner and friend for many generations to come,\" Trump said. He described his counterparts as \"spectacular leaders\" and said that \"everything you touch turns to gold.\"   Trump's tariff threats were credited with helping spur negotiations Thailand and Cambodia. Some of the worst modern fighting between the two countries took place over five days in July, killing dozens and displacing hundreds of thousands of people.   The president threatened, at the time, to withhold trade agreements unless the fighting stopped. A shaky truce has persisted since then.   Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim praised the agreement between Thailand and Cambodia, saying at the summit that \"it reminds us that reconciliation is not concession, but an act of courage.\"   Tariffs are in focus on Trump's trip   Trump met Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in Kuala Lumpur, who was also attending the summit. There has been friction between them over Brazil's prosecution of Jair Bolsonaro, the country's former president and a close Trump ally. Bolsonaro was convicted last month of attempting to overturn election results in his country.   During their meeting, Trump said he could reduce tariffs on Brazil that he enacted in a push for leniency for Bolsonaro.   \n   \"I think we should be able to make some good deals for both countries,\" he said.   While Trump was warming to Lula, he avoided Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. The president is angry with Canada because of a television advertisement protesting his trade policies, and on his way to the summit, announced on social media he would raise tariffs on Canada because of it.   One leader absent from the summit was Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Although he was close with Trump during Trump's first term, the relationship has been more tense lately. Trump caused irritation by boasting that he settled a recent conflict between India and Pakistan, and he has increased tariffs on India for its purchase of Russian oil.\n",

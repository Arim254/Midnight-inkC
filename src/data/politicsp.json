The measure would fund much of the government through Jan. 30 and provide funding for some agencies through the end of next September.   But the shutdown will not end right away. The U.S. House of Representatives must also pass the legislation, which is not guaranteed, before President Donald Trump can sign it into law.   Seven Democrats and one independent senator voted with nearly every Senate Republican to approve the stopgap funding bill after a more than monthlong impasse that resulted in missed paychecks for millions of federal workers, delayed food assistance benefits and air travel disruptions.   \n   Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was the sole GOP no vote.    Over the weekend, a bipartisan group of senators reached an agreement to end the shutdown after holding a series of on-again, off-again talks over the last several weeks. A procedural vote to advance a funding bill achieved the required 60 votes late Sunday night, setting up Monday's vote.   The funding package includes language to reverse reductions in force of federal employees by the Trump Administration during the shutdown, protections against further layoffs through the end of January, backpay for federal employees and a trio of appropriations bills, including one that will fully fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, through Sept. 30, 2026.   A deal without Democrats' health care demands   But the deal does not include an extension of subsidies for Affordable Care Act health insurance premiums that are set to expire later this year. Most Democrats have refused to vote for a funding measure that did not include a concrete path to preserve the subsidies.   \n   Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Sunday that he would hold a vote by mid-December on a bill of Democrats' choosing to extend the expiring subsidies. Thune has said throughout the shutdown that Republicans would only negotiate on the subsidies once the government was open.   \"This deal guarantees a vote to extend Affordable Care Act premium tax credits, which Republicans weren't willing to do,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., wrote in a statement. \"Lawmakers know their constituents expect them to vote for it, and if they don't, they could very well be replaced at the ballot box by someone who will.\"   \n   But the majority of Senate Democrats disagreed that this was the best deal they could get, doubting that Republicans would agree to extend the subsidies without the pressure of an ongoing shutdown. After Democratic victories on Election Night last week, some senators said it was a mistake to back down.   \n   \"As long as there is still any time left to reverse the MAGA health care hike, I believe we must do everything we can to force Republicans to the negotiating table,\" wrote Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee that negotiated the three full-year funding bills.   The full-year funding measures include money for agriculture, military construction and veterans affairs and the legislative branch. Those are just three of the 12 appropriations bills Congress needs to pass before the continuing resolution would run out again at the end of January.   On to the House   House leadership alerted members Monday morning that they would have 36-hours notice to return to Capitol Hill for a vote. The House has not conducted official business since the chamber passed its version of a continuing resolution in mid-September. While Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has held near-daily press conferences at the Capitol, many rank-and-file have not been in for weeks.   \"At the very moment that they do that final vote, I will call all House members to return as quickly as possible,\" Johnson told reporters Monday and, noting the ongoing shutdown-related air travel delays, told members, \"You need to begin right now returning to the Hill.\"   \n   Moving the measure through the House could require some arm-twisting. Many Democrats have indicated they will not support the deal, and some hard-line Republicans may not be inclined to vote for it either.   But Johnson projected confidence Monday that the measure can pass and said Trump is ready to sign it. The speaker, though, has so far declined to promise an ACA vote in the House should a bill pass the Senate.\n",

John Fetterman, D-Penn., about his vote to end the longest government shutdown in history.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman was one of a handful of Democrats who voted to reopen the federal government late last night. It's not a surprise. Fetterman has been against his party's gamble since the beginning. He has said he wants to extend the health care subsidies at the heart of the impasse, but not at the cost of cutting SNAP benefits or the other consequences of the shutdown. Fetterman paid a visit to NPR's D.C. studio late this morning. I asked him about why he's been at odds with the majority of his party on the shutdown.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)DETROW: You called it a failure when you put out a statement last night, you know, leading up to this vote to begin the process of reopening the government. You've been clear that that's been your point of view all along. Walk us through why. Why were Democratic leaders and other members in your party wrong to push forward with this?JOHN FETTERMAN: Well, we were - as a committed Democrat, it's always been wrong for us to shut the government down. Rightly, they criticize the Republicans when they've shut the government down all the time. It's wrong. It's reckless. You can pull up all the quotes that would confirm that. So now that's - you know, now it might be us driving it. That makes it wrong too.I absolutely support extending those tax credits. But for me, the kinds of chaos and holding our government hostage is unacceptable. And you can have priorities, but it's wrong to go shutting our government down, and that's where we're at.DETROW: I wanted to get your response to some of the thinking from other members of the party. I want to quote you something from Ezra Klein, the New York Times columnist who isn't in Congress, but I think he kind of represents a lot of the mainstream thinking here. And the quote is this - \"Shutdowns are an opportunity to make an argument, and the country was just starting to pay attention. If Trump wanted to cancel flights over Thanksgiving rather than keep health care costs down, I don't see why Democrats should save him from making his priorities so exquisitely clear. And I worry that Democrats have just taught Trump that they will fold under pressure. That's the kind of lesson he remembers.\"What do you make of that general argument?FETTERMAN: Well, it's just - like, that's actually not a fold. That's realizing that it's the kind of chaos that might care more about the kinds of impacts that it's going to have on 42 million people. Like, if you depend on them to eat, that's not a political game. And it's not a political game, as Mr. Klein seems to refer to it as, you know? It's really about our bigger priorities.And now, in a longer conversation here, remind us (ph), Democrats designed those tax credits to expire at this year. That's the Democratic Party. That's not something they're taking away. They're saying, we can have a conversation to extend them. And I do hope we should. And I think many of their constituents are going to be impacted too. And that's why I think it's a way forward to find that without dropping our entire country into this kinds of chaos.DETROW: Part of the agreement is that there's a promised vote on these health care subsidies, extending them. How confident are you that actually happens, that gets to the president's desk?FETTERMAN: I do believe John Thune is an honorable man in the arena. And Trump, I would like to remind everyone with the border deal. And I assumed we'd get rolled for that, and we did. And you can't control what Trump's going to decide, ultimately. But for me, it's a choice of do you really want to risk the kinds of mass chaos that we are quickly descending in? And after 40 days, how much longer? And now it's a fact, too, flying is becoming more and more chaotic, and that probably also means dangerous more than it should be. Yes, I want health care, but not to create this kinds of stress in our system.DETROW: That was Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman, who is also out with a new memoir this week. Our wide-ranging conversation continues on that, his place in this party, his health and U.S. policy on the war in Gaza. That's Tuesday on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      The Senate is expected to vote as early as today to approve a spending package that would end the longest federal government shutdown in history.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  The longest government shutdown in U.S. history may be coming to an end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARRY BLACK: Eternal God, we thank you for the progress we have made on this journey to reopen the government.SUMMERS: That is Barry Black, chaplain of the U.S. Senate, where lawmakers are soon expected to vote to do just that. But that does not mean that the government will reopen immediately. NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas is tracking the latest from Capitol Hill. Hi.SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: Hey, Juana.SUMMERS: So Sam, just start by unpacking the substance of the deal for us. What did the Senate actually agree to?GRINGLAS: At the core is a resolution funding parts of the government through the end of January. The Senate has been voting on a version of that for weeks now. What's new is this stopgap is now paired with three full-year appropriations bills that would fund some agencies, including ones providing food assistance and services for veterans. The package also has a provision to reverse the firings of federal employees during the shutdown. That same section would prevent more layoffs through January 30. Senate Majority Leader John Thune has also promised a vote on expiring health insurance subsidies.SUMMERS: Well, Sam, Congress has been sort of stuck and at this impasse for 41 days now. How did we get to this breakthrough?GRINGLAS: So for weeks, Democrats held out on supporting a Republican-backed funding bill, hoping they could win an extension of those expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies. Democrats won big in the elections last Tuesday. Trump partially blamed the shutdown, and Democrats thought the president, you know, would feel compelled to bring Republicans to the table, but that did not happen. And meanwhile, food assistance benefits were still not flowing, and thousands of flights were being canceled or delayed because of staffing shortages. Talks picked up again among a small bipartisan group of senators, and they emerged Sunday with a deal backed by seven Democrats and one independent who caucuses with them, just enough to let this package advance, meaning each of those votes was crucial.SUMMERS: Not a vote to spare there. I mean, this is far from overwhelming support from Democrats. What have they got to say?GRINGLAS: Well, there's a real conflict here over whether those eight did the right thing. Independent Angus King explained his thinking this way.ANGUS KING: There was zero chance of dealing with the ACA issue as long as the shutdown continued. Now - I don't know - 50/50?GRINGLAS: King said he would take some chance over no chance any day and said the pain of the shutdown was just becoming untenable. But many Democrats are angry that their colleagues relented. This is House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Well, I don't have much to say about those individuals, and they're going to have to explain themselves to their constituents and to the American people.GRINGLAS: Three of those eight senators voting yes are retiring after next year. Meanwhile, the most vulnerable Senate Democrat up for reelection, Jon Ossoff of Georgia, he voted no.SUMMERS: And then, Sam, what happens if this bill gets through the Senate?GRINGLAS: The package now has to pass the House before President Trump can sign it into law. The House, though, has not been in for weeks. But today, Speaker Mike Johnson told members to start making plans to come back.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE JOHNSON: To all my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats in the House, you need to begin right now returning to the Hill. We have to do this as quickly as possible.GRINGLAS: House passage, though, is not a sure thing. It might require some arm-twisting, though Johnson, he projected confidence it will get done.SUMMERS: Sam, last thing, if President Trump ultimately signs this into law, is it finished? Is this the end of the saga?GRINGLAS: No. There are still a lot of questions about that promised health care vote next month, like exactly what will be voted on and will enough Senate Republicans support it? And if they do, will Johnson even bring it up for a vote in the House? And remember, with some of the government is now funded for the next year, much of it is still only funded through the end of January, so Congress could be back at another impasse in just a few weeks.SUMMERS: NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas, thank you.GRINGLAS: Thanks, Juana.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Ailsa Chang talks with Republican strategist Mike Ricci about the deal to end the government shutdown.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  The Senate is now voting on a bill that would fund the government through January, ending the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. Late last night, a handful of Senate Democrats broke with their party and sided with Republicans on this bill. For more, we're going to turn now to Republican strategist Mike Ricci. He worked with several congressional Republicans, including former speakers John Boehner and Paul Ryan, and he was on the Hill for government shutdowns in 2013 and 2018 going into 2019. I spoke with Ricci before the Senate vote today.CHANG: OK. So we love to say government shutdowns feel like a movie that just keeps on...MIKE RICCI: (Laughter).CHANG: ...Replaying. Has this shutdown felt any different to you?RICCI: Well, to your point, you know, you go into these trying to have a sense of how they'll end. And your job is to kind of know kind of how to get to the ending, the denouement, if you will. And this shutdown, there just never was a sense of, you know, how are they going to land this plane? How are they going to stick this landing?CHANG: Yeah.RICCI: And, you know, instead, we got kind of this underwhelming, you know, exit last night and tonight. They're kind of rushing out of there. So it's hard to believe that after such a long ordeal that it's happening so abruptly.CHANG: I was going to ask you what you thought of the deal. You find it totally underwhelming?RICCI: Well, I think, again, you know, perception is destiny for these leaders. And so you want to - if you're going to go into a big fight like this, you want to have a sense of - you know, there's a lot of showmanship involved, and you want to sell the deal. And you want to - you know, you can win by losing and saying, look, we got more than we thought we could, than Republicans thought we could. And, you know, instead, it was kind of a handful of Senate Democrats, nobody in leadership really, at a press conference last night instead of, you know, leadership's Chuck Schumer, especially, kind of dictating the pace of things. And again, it's just very much underwhelming after such a long ordeal.CHANG: Yeah. Well, let's talk about blame because this shutdown...RICCI: Sure.CHANG: ...It's another example of how both parties blame each other for some problem.RICCI: Yeah.CHANG: Who do you see getting the blame here? - because, yes, Republicans are in control of Congress, but, you know, here's a small faction of Democrats breaking away from their leaders to make this deal. Who do you think is going to be held responsible for the last several weeks?RICCI: Well, I think I'm going to punt a bit and say that we're kind of in a runoff, if you will, here to see what happens in the next 30 days or so with the health care subsidies. And if Democrats can figure out - 'cause they said they would get a vote on these subsidies. And so if everything is about the cost of living now, as we saw in last week's elections, and you can frame the next 30 days around health care and around the cost of living going into the holidays, then Democrats have a chance to shift the blame back to President Trump and Republicans.But if this becomes about the division among Democrats that we're seeing play out on social media, once again, as we have time and again, then, you know, Democrats will miss an opportunity here to really keep Republicans on the defensive. So, you know, I think there's going to be a bit of an overtime period here, if you will, to really see how it lands. And, you know, obviously, we didn't see the worst of it with SNAP benefits or even with, you know, air travel.CHANG: Yeah...RICCI: But...CHANG: ...With Thanksgiving coming up.RICCI: ...You know, that probably would have been where the blame really would have set in, but perhaps they've cut that off here at the pass.CHANG: Well, I'm asking about blame because blame obviously most matters when there's an election. How much do you...RICCI: Yeah.CHANG: ...Think voters will remember this fight a year from now when they're voting in the midterms?RICCI: Very little.CHANG: (Laughter).RICCI: I was part of the shutdown in October 2013, and I thought it was going to be the end of everything. And we won the next election 13 months later. You know, we could - if you - if I - you know, you could point out things that happened two, three months ago that you forgot almost happened. So I think very little, but it does affect the dynamics of how these parties, you know, get together, how they have a coherent message for the midterms. You know, a lot of Democrats are going to be having conversations in the next few days of whether Chuck Schumer should still be, you know, one of their leaders, and that obviously takes away time and energy from...CHANG: Yeah.RICCI: ...Fighting in the election.CHANG: Well, last question for you. I mean, obviously, we're seeing fault lines among Democrats, at least in the Senate. What kind of tensions are you seeing among Republicans right now?RICCI: So, you know, Speaker Mike Johnson took the extraordinary step of keeping the House away now for, I think, almost 50 days, and bringing them back, that'll be a bit of a - there'll be a bit of venting and a bit of decompression there. And we'll see how much Republicans resented that and how much, you know, they're able to get back together on the same page. Again, Democrats kind of fighting with each other probably convinces them that they got a good win here, and maybe that's a way to move past last week's elections. But those first 24, 48 hours, when the House comes back, you're going to want to watch closely what members are saying and how much theatrics there are towards the speaker there.CHANG: That is Republican strategist Mike Ricci. Thank you very much.RICCI: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Senate lawmakers voted late Sunday on a measure that would reopen the government, with enough moderate Democrats joining Republicans to support the initial vote.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  A group of Senate Democrats have defected to agree to a deal with Republicans to end the government shutdown.STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  In a few moments, we will speak with one of the Democratic senators who voted to reopen the government. This measure received 60 votes in the Senate last evening - exactly enough. John Thune, the Republican leader, is looking to work through Senate procedures in days to come.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN THUNE: I am optimistic that after almost six weeks of this shutdown, we finally - we'll finally be able to end it.INSKEEP: Most Democrats still voted no, saying the agreement gives them no assurance on their central demand, which was extending subsidies for health insurance.FADEL: NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales has been following this and joins us now. Good morning, Claudia.CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila.FADEL: OK. So for weeks, we've seen fits and starts of talks, blame games, both sides dug in. Now this group of rank-and-file Senate Democrats is breaking with leadership to move this deal forward. What's actually in the agreement?GRISALES: Well, the package includes a stopgap measure to fund the government through the end of January. It also includes full-year appropriations funding plans for some federal agencies and services. It will pause planned cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, and also reverses federal worker layoffs installed by the Trump administration during the shutdown and protects the workforce from more cuts for a few months, to the end of January. Democrats who defected also got a promise of a vote on health care. As you remember, the party has fought a Republican stopgap measure to reopen the government to address expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies that's spiking premiums, but they didn't quite get there.FADEL: OK, but that was the main demand, right? I mean, how...GRISALES: Right.FADEL: ...Did this group of Democrats get to yes if they didn't get their top demand to protect Affordable Care Act credits?GRISALES: Right. They've been separately negotiating with Republicans for some time now, and they said that they could not get this deal from Republicans. They were pretty adamant. So the impacts and the chaos growing for federal agencies or workers, and then we saw flight delays and cancellations across the country - this also created new pressures for Democrats, these who defected. And the group also argued that growing numbers of people were being hurt, and the plan includes a long list of wins for their party. So in the end, seven Democrats and one independent joined Republicans to get this plan across this key procedural hurdle.FADEL: But they broke with leadership, right? And most Democrats voted no. And what did the rest of the party say then about what they did?GRISALES: Well, some were pretty furious. This defection came after an hourslong meeting for Senate Democrats. And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who voted no - he argued that regardless of the outcome, Democrats have put a spotlight on health care.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHUCK SCHUMER: We are going to fight legislatively, fight back home, fight in the courts and bring this fight in the elections.GRISALES: You could also say there's a political calculus here with Schumer and other leaders voting against this deal. They're hoping they're insulated from blowback from their party, but that remains to be seen after Democrats left that meeting last night. I heard the angriest response from Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren. She said this was a terrible mistake. And when she was asked if Schumer did a good job leading the caucus on this, she said, I think the American people want us to stand and fight for health care. Obviously, that is not happening. So this was always going to be an ugly ending. Democrats could come out of this pretty bruised, but some would argue Republicans will not be left unscathed either.FADEL: So what happens next? When can travelers expect to see their flights resume and people's food benefits to be paid in full?GRISALES: Well, the Senate still has a few more hurdles before final passage. But if that happens, the House will take it up in the coming days, and we could see those flights and food benefits get back to business in the coming week or so.FADEL: That's NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Steve Inskeep speaks with Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada about the latest efforts in the Senate to end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Democratic Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada was among eight Democrats and independents who voted in favor of the deal to end the shutdown. She had, in fact, voted to open the government sooner. Senator, good morning.CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: Good morning.INSKEEP: What, if anything, did Democrats gain from the past six weeks of the government shutdown?CORTEZ MASTO: Well, let me just say a couple of things. One, and as you pointed out, I was one that have voted that we shouldn't have shut it down. But let me just say this. I can honestly say that the Democrats are united in this fight, which is a fight against the bad policies of this administration and to address the looming health care crisis that we have. You know, Jacky and I are fighting for Nevadans, and we have different tactics about doing it, but this is a fight to ensure that people have access to health care and can afford it.We are seeing people in our states - premiums are increasing already. And so there are many people that rely on this health care. I know families that need this health care because of children with rare diseases. And so it is important that we continue this fight. And let me just say this. Democrats are united that we need to get this done because we are seeing this in our states and all states across the country, including in Republican states. And if Republicans choose not to come to the table to address this issue, then they own the disastrous premium increases that this will bring. And they have to be responsible to their constituents why they are not addressing the affordability issue that is an issue in this state for many families and individuals across the country.INSKEEP: You mentioned Jacky. Of course, you mean Jacky Rosen, your fellow Nevadan...CORTEZ MASTO: Correct.INSKEEP: ...Senator who had been voting differently on this. It sounds like, though, based on your votes, you did feel that the Democrats picked the wrong tactic, the wrong fight.CORTEZ MASTO: No. Listen, I'm not going to criticize my colleagues because we are all in this fight against the bad policies of this administration. Everybody's going to have a way of fighting in their states and showing that fight, and we have to. It's - what this administration is doing with the tariffs - and a failure to - lack of - address the affordability issue in this country is important. We - I see it in my state all the time. And this administration said on Day 1 that they were going to address the cost and have done nothing.And I've got small businesses closing. I've got people that can't afford groceries at the grocery store or clothes for their kids when they get ready to go to school. And now we have a health care crisis that we could address simply by coming to the table and passing these subsidies, but the Republicans and this administration refuse to do so. And let me just be very clear...INSKEEP: I just want to ask though...CORTEZ MASTO: But let me just be very clear...INSKEEP: Very quickly.CORTEZ MASTO: ...Because these are the policies of this administration. They would rather harm people. They would rather make sure that people can't access SNAP programs, essential funding and food, just to harm individuals to prove a point and play politics. That's where the Democrats are here.INSKEEP: I want to acknowledge that in this battle, you've had an opportunity to raise these issues. It's created a lot of political conflict and a lot of news stories, and there's been a lot of discussions. So you did get that out of this. However, elsewhere in the program today, we spoke with Congressman Ritchie Torres of New York. He's in the House of Representatives. He is not at all in favor of this agreement. And I said, well, we're going to hear from Senator Cortez Masto, who's voting for it. What question would you have for her? And here's what he said.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)RITCHIE TORRES: I would ask, why does the deal fail to extend the tax credits for 24 million Americans? I mean, that was the whole objective that Democrats were pursuing. By that standard, it's not mission accomplished. It's mission failure.INSKEEP: Is he right?CORTEZ MASTO: Again, it goes back to this idea of where we think our tactics can be as still fighting for Americans. Let me just - let me counter that with this. Governor Spanberger just won - governor-elect - in Virginia.INSKEEP: Right.CORTEZ MASTO: And she won on the issue of affordability. And she said the government needs to be open. And she focused on the affordability issue not because the government was shut down. So we can still - and this is a misnomer, and I just have to say this so many times. We can have the government open, fight for people to make sure that our kids are not dragged into losing access to SNAP - essential SNAP funds and meals, or seniors lose their meals. We can make sure they have those and still fight on the affordability issue. And by the way, this is on the Republicans. We've got a vote in December...INSKEEP: Right.CORTEZ MASTO: ...To decide whether or not they're going to be with us to address this issue on the premium tax credit. Now they're going to own it. They can step up to the plate and help us address this issue for Americans across the country who are losing access to health care or they could be a part of the problem.INSKEEP: You've been talking to Republicans. Do you think that any of them might vote with you in December?CORTEZ MASTO: We're going to find out. Let me say, we're going to find out. There's - we will find out. Part of the agreement that we entered into, and you heard it, was leader Thune said he would come to the table on a health care once the government was open, and now he's got to follow through. He gave us a December date. And now they've got to follow through. And the American public will see where, at the end of the day, Republicans lie. Do they really care about this issue, or do they want to cause more affordability issues for Americans across the country?INSKEEP: I want to ask about the side issues that are part of this agreement. There are some appropriations bills that go through. There's a provision that furloughed workers will be paid, which, under the law, they already should have been paid. Fired workers will be rehired. Mass firings will not continue. These are the agreements, but it now goes to the administration, which has taken the view that any restriction on the president's power to fire people is unconstitutional and that they will ignore it. That has been their position in the past. Given that, is that part of the agreement worthless?CORTEZ MASTO: Well, that's like saying, Steve, then, because - and I agree with you. This administration is lawless, and they ignore everything. But then that's like saying, then we shouldn't just do anything. Then we shouldn't do our jobs here, and we shouldn't appropriate. We shouldn't come together to demand certain things in the appropriations bills or demand from our Republican colleagues any type of guarantee from them that they will stand united with us because the administration's not going to be there. Then we might as well just shut down and give them everything. So this is part of holding Congress' role here and our Republicans accountable. They've said that they're going to stand with us on these issues and fight for federal workers. And now they're - we'll see if they stand true to that.INSKEEP: Oh.CORTEZ MASTO: They've got to be a part of the solution and be a backstop to this administration.INSKEEP: You think that the Republicans who are voting with you here will not only agree to these measures, but actually try to do something if the administration ignores them?CORTEZ MASTO: I am telling you that what the Republicans have agreed to is just what you talked about - the rifts and the reductions in force and to protect that workforce. If they go back on their word in this agreement, then the American public will know where the Republicans who are control in Congress - where they stand. Do they really care about Americans at the end of the day and addressing the affordability issue and making sure people have jobs?INSKEEP: Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada. It's a pleasure talking with you. Thank you so much.CORTEZ MASTO: Thanks, Steve.INSKEEP: Have a good morning.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

U.S. pardon attorney Ed Martin posted the pardons on X, clearing people for, quote, \"conduct relating to their efforts to expose voting fraud.\" Rudy Giuliani and former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows are among those named in the proclamation. And joining us now to talk about this is NPR voting correspondent Miles Parks. Hi, Miles.MILES PARKS, BYLINE: Hey, Leila.FADEL: OK. So this pardon applies to at least 77 people. Are there any other notable names here?PARKS: Yes. So many of the names will be familiar, both to people who were paying attention after the 2020 election and to anyone who monitored the many investigations into the January 6 riot. Attorneys Sidney Powell, Kenneth Chesebro, Jenna Ellis and John Eastman are all named. And then the rest of the names are names you may not have heard of. These are people who met oftentimes in secret after the election in 2020, to make up alternate slates of electors that could have potentially impacted the correct certification of the presidential election in 2020. Importantly, though, none of these people have actually been charged with federal crimes. Many have been charged in state court, but a federal pardon has no impact on those cases.FADEL: OK. So where do the cases stand against the people who have been charged in their states?PARKS: So many of them have run into roadblocks.FADEL: OK.PARKS: In Michigan, a month or two ago, a judge recently dismissed charges against 15 people there who signed false electoral certificates. The case in Georgia was severely undermined after a court ruled that the DA's office should be removed from that case. And then the biggest case of all here, that did get tossed, was in federal court. That was the federal election interference charges that were dropped against President Trump after he was reelected. So all of this adds up to a landscape where very few people have faced criminal repercussions for the plot to overturn the 2020 election, and these pardons just kind of guarantee that.FADEL: OK. It's been five years, and President Trump still seems very focused on the 2020 election and claiming it was fraudulent. Where does this go from here?PARKS: I mean, looking forward, Trump and people in his circle are using their claims about election fraud as justification for all sorts of federal election policies that frankly would have been unheard of under many other Republican presidents, considering how ardently that party has fought for states to have control over their elections, not the federal government. We've seen the Justice Department make unprecedented requests for election data, as well as to investigate local voting machines, and the president has tried to enact change with executive orders, with an executive order in March that mostly at this point, has been blocked by the courts. But I should note that today's pardon does seem to indicate that the president is still taking cues from the, you know, fraud-focused, the election denial wing of the Republican Party.FADEL: Right.PARKS: For instance, Cleta Mitchell, who's a Republican attorney who's built a sort of grassroots network of election integrity groups across the country, she'd been posting on X a bunch recently, explicitly asking for these pardons. And this morning, she called the news an answer to those prayers.FADEL: Has the White House said anything about these pardons yet?PARKS: White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has confirmed the pardons in a statement to NPR. She said, \"these great Americans were persecuted and put through hell by the Biden administration for challenging an election, which is the cornerstone of democracy,\" end quote. I should note that no one in the administration in the five years since this election has provided proof that the election was actually tainted by widespread fraud, and numerous audits and investigations have confirmed the results of the 2020 election.FADEL: Right, of course. NPR's Miles Parks. Thank you, Miles.PARKS: Thanks, Leila.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The Syrian president entered the building through West Executive Avenue, adjacent to the White House, rather than on the West Wing driveway used for other foreign leaders' arrivals. He left the White House about two hours later and greeted a throng of supporters gathered outside before getting into his motorcade.   It marked the first visit to the White House by a Syrian head of state since the Middle Eastern country gained independence from France in 1946 and comes after the U.S. lifted sanctions imposed on Syria during the decades the country was ruled by the Assad family. Al-Sharaa led the rebel forces that toppled Syrian President Bashar Assad last December and was named the country's interim leader in January.   \n   Trump and al-Sharaa — who once had ties to al-Qaida and had a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head — first met in May in Saudi Arabia. At the time, the U.S. president described al-Sharaa as a \"young, attractive guy. Tough guy. Strong past, very strong past. Fighter.\" It was the first official encounter between the U.S. and Syria since 2000, when then-President Bill Clinton met with Hafez Assad, the father of Bashar Assad.   White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday's visit is \"part of the president's efforts in diplomacy to meet with anyone around the world in the pursuit of peace.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa looks on during a press conference in Ankara, Turkey, Feb. 4.\n                \n                    Francisco Seco/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Francisco Seco/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Trump, a Republican, has recently said that al-Sharaa is \"doing a very good job so far\" and that a \"lot of progress has been made with Syria\" since the U.S. eased sanctions.   \n   One official with knowledge of the administration's plans said Syria's entry into the global coalition fighting the Islamic State group will allow it to work more closely with U.S. forces, although the new Syrian military and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the country's northeast had already been fighting the group.   Before al-Sharaa's arrival in the U.S., the United Nations Security Council voted to lift sanctions on the Syrian president and other government officials in a move that the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Mike Waltz, said was a strong sign that Syria is in a new era since the fall of Assad.   \n   Al-Sharaa comes into the meeting with his own priorities. He wants a permanent repeal of sanctions that punished Syria for widespread allegations of human rights abuses by Assad's government and security forces. While the Caesar Act sanctions are currently waived by Trump, a permanent repeal would require Congress to act.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Motiah Boustany, of Charlestown, W.Va., holds a banner depicting Syria's President Ahmed al-Sharaa outside of the White House, as al-Sharaa meets with President Donald Trump, Monday, in Washington.\n                \n                    Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n    \n\n   \n   One option is a proposal from Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, that would end the sanctions without any conditions. The other was drafted by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a hawkish Trump ally who wants to set conditions for a sanctions repeal that would be reviewed every six months.   But advocates argue that any repeal with conditions would prevent companies from investing in Syria because they would fear potentially being sanctioned. Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, likened it to a \"hanging shadow that paralyzes any initiatives for our country.\"\n",

Today's top stories   A bipartisan group of senators reached a deal last night to reopen the government and end the longest shutdown in U.S. history. The vote on the first procedural step was 60 to 40, with seven Democrats and one independent joining most Republicans on the measure. The agreement would fund the government through Jan. 30.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) speaks to reporters following a vote on Capitol Hill on Nov. 9, 2025, in Washington, D.C. The Senate convened for a rare Sunday session in an attempt to end the government shutdown.\n                \n                    Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Along with the stopgap measure to fund the government, the Democrats who defected received a promise of a vote on health care, NPR's Claudia Grisales tells Up First. Some of the Democrats who voted no were furious about the defection. Sen. Elizabeth Warren stated that the defection was a terrible mistake and that the American people want them to fight for health care. The Senate has several hurdles to clear before the measure can be passed, and even then, it will need to pass the House.   The Trump administration now has two days to increase SNAP benefits from 65% to 100% after a federal appeals court refused a request to pause a lower court's orders to do so. The administration could ask the U.S. Supreme Court to get involved in the matter for the second time in just a few days. Another battle is unfolding involving states that have already paid out full benefits after a federal judge ordered it, but before the higher court said 'not so fast,' NPR's Tovia Smith says.    \n   🎧 Much of these legal battles could be rendered moot with the expectation that when the government reopens, Congress can appropriate SNAP funding for the fiscal year. Smith says there is no certainty as to when families will receive the benefits after the shutdown ends, but in the past states motivated to get benefits flowing did so within a matter of days. When speaking with Americans who receive SNAP benefits, Smith has heard a sense of relief from some that they could soon receive the funds, and others have been cautiously hopeful.   World leaders are gathering in Brazil for the United Nations' annual climate summit, COP30, to negotiate the ongoing response to climate change. The event is expected to last about two weeks. This year, the United States will not take an active role in the discussions.    🎧 Some world leaders may be relieved that the U.S. might not show, as some are concerned that its presence could hamper the talks, according to NPR's Julia Simon. The U.S. is the second biggest polluter and will eventually need to come on board to help reach the climate goals. When it comes to tackling climate change, there are two major driving forces: politics, as exemplified by this summit, and economics, says Simon. The green economic transition is where a lot of good news for the planet is currently happening, from electric vehicles to solar power.   \n   Cost of living   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Getty Images/Emily Bogle/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   NPR's series Cost of Living: The Price We Pay is examining what's driving price increases and how people are coping after years of stubborn inflation.    The price of electricity has increased 40% since February 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The rise in demand for electricity is partly due to the proliferation of new data centers that support the growing artificial intelligence industry. Additionally, the price of natural gas, which is used to generate electricity, has gone up. Here's what else we know:    💡 Demand for electricity is expected to grow 2.2% this year and 2.4% next year, according to the Energy Department.💡 Utilities projects that building new power supplies and a more resilient grid will exceed a trillion dollars over the next five years. If data centers receive a price break, residential customers may take on some of their costs.💡 Electricity costs can be reduced by adjusting consumption times and locations. The highest rates occur during peak demand, such as on the hottest days of summer.   Listen to why AI is partly to blame for your electricity bill going up.

A study published in 2024 found that one of the strongest predictors of a child's screen time is their parents' screen time. While it can be challenging for parents to limit screen time due to much of the work to manage the home being online, practicing moderation can set a positive example.    \n   📱 If you are with your family and would prefer to be off your device, ask yourself if that task is urgent. If it is not, save that to-do for another time.📱 Focus less on assessing the quantity of your screen time, but the quality. After your observations of what is actually beneficial, identify how you can make healthier tweaks to your screen time.📱 Create device-free zones in your home and schedule. Many parents ban devices during mealtime. You can also implement this rule during a movie night or on vacations.

It comes after recent clemency grants from Trump to former U.S. Rep. George Santos and an ex-CEO of a cryptocurrency exchange.   \n   While former President Joe Biden still holds the record of 4,245 clemency actions, Trump's second-term pardons and commutations are notable for their political and personal connections to the president, says Bernadette Meyler, a professor of constitutional law at Stanford University.   \"There's more of a sense of the insider pardon than we've seen previously,\" Meyler said.   In mid-October, Trump commuted the prison sentence of Santos, the disgraced New York Republican who pleaded guilty to wire fraud and identity theft last year.   Days later the president handed a full and unconditional pardon to Changpeng Zhao, the former CEO of Binance, who pleaded guilty to money laundering charges. Binance has ties to the Trump family's cryptocurrency business, but Trump said in an interview with 60 Minutes that he does not know who Zhao is.   \n   U.S. presidents are given broad authority to nullify convictions or sentences for federal crimes without the involvement of Congress or the Supreme Court. The legal principle is a holdover from English law, in which the king had what was known as the \"prerogative of mercy\" as early as the seventh century.   While Trump has granted clemency to a wide range of people convicted of federal crimes, from nonviolent drug offenders to white-collar criminals, his first term in office was also marked by several notable pardons of political allies and grants of clemency to people whose cases were advocated for by celebrities or friends. Both of those trends have been amplified during his second term, Meyler said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Former U.S. Rep. George Santos arrives at federal court in Central Islip, N.Y., for sentencing on April 25. His sentenced was commuted by Trump in October.\n                \n                    Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n    \n\n   \n   \"He's much more explicit about making political statements through the use of the pardon power,\" Meyler said of Trump's second-term pardons and commutations. She said that includes granting clemency for people who have supported his political career as well as public statements he's made about why a particular crime shouldn't be punished.   Trump's pardons align with his politics …   Trump is by no means the first president to show leniency to a political ally. President Bill Clinton pardoned Mark Rich, a former hedge-fund manager whose ex-wife had donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Democratic National Committee, the Clinton Presidential Library and Hillary Clinton's New York Senate campaign. And President George W. Bush commuted the sentence of Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney.   \n   During his first four years in office, Trump pardoned his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, commuted the sentence of his friend and political confidant Roger Stone and pardoned Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law, Jared.   In his second term, Trump \"has taken the same norm-busting approach to pardons as he has in other areas,\" Jeffrey Crouch, a professor of American politics at American University, told NPR via email.   \n   Crouch pointed to Trump's move on inauguration day this year to pardon some 1,500 defendants (and commute the sentences of several others) convicted of taking part in the Jan. 6, 2021, siege on the U.S. Capitol in support of Trump's effort to overturn his electoral loss the previous fall. For comparison, Trump granted a total of 238 acts of clemency in his first term, according to the Pew Research Center.   Crouch said many presidents have waited until the \"lame duck\" period at the end of their terms to issue potentially controversial clemency grants — but not Trump. \"He did not shy away from granting early or controversial pardons and commutations in his first term, either.\"   Politics have always been entwined with the U.S. clemency process, but past presidents have often used pardons as a way to heal political divisions. George Washington pardoned some of those involved in the Whiskey Rebellion, while Jimmy Carter granted a blanket pardon to people who had evaded service in the Vietnam War.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Trump pardoned former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, who pleaded guilty to money laundering charges, in October. Binance has ties to the Trump family's cryptocurrency business, but Trump said in an interview with 60 Minutes that he doesn't know who Zhao is.\n                \n                    Jason Redmond/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jason Redmond/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The Trump administration has used clemency to benefit some of its political backers. In May, Trump pardoned former Virginia Sheriff Scott Jenkins, an ardent Trump supporter who was convicted of taking bribes from local businessmen in exchange for auxiliary deputy badges. The day the pardon was announced, U.S. Pardon Attorney Ed Martin posted on X: \"No MAGA left behind.\" And when Trump pardoned Santos earlier this month, the president said on social media that Santos had \"the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\"   \n   The founders envisioned impeachment as one check on what is otherwise a nearly absolute presidential power, but Trump has faced virtually no criticism from fellow Republicans for his pardons and commutations.   Past presidents have also taken flak from voters for their clemency decisions. Gerald Ford's approval rating fell by more than 20 points after he pardoned Richard Nixon in 1974, and he lost the presidential election two years later to Carter.   … and his political frustrations   While Santos and Jenkins are both Trump supporters, they also fall into another category of criminal that comes up with some regularity in Trump's clemency choices: public officials of both parties convicted of corruption.   \n   Trump in February issued a full pardon for former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, after having commuted Blagojevich's prison sentence during his first term as president. Former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld received his own pardon in May following his conviction on federal bribery and attempted extortion charges in 2022. Both men are Democrats.   Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington said in June that Trump had pardoned a total of 16 former elected officials convicted of corruption charges.   Meyler, the Stanford professor, said Trump, who has characterized his own recent prosecutions as politically motivated, may view the cases of political corruption against other politicians as similarly unjust.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich signs an autograph outside his Chicago home after speaking to the press about his pardon from President Trump in February.\n                \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Scott Olson/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   \"Maybe it's not too much of a stretch to think that Trump feels that he was prosecuted for similar kinds of offenses and then is kind of looking out at the landscape of political figures who have been prosecuted and, you know, potentially identifies with the plight of some of them,\" she said.   In an emailed statement to NPR, the White House contrasted Trump's approach to the clemency process with former President Joe Biden's, alluding to criticism from Trump and his allies over Biden's use of an autopen to issue pardons and sign other official documents. (In June, Trump ordered an investigation into Biden's use of the autopen.)   \n   \"It's not difficult to be more involved in the pardon process when your predecessor was an autopen,\" said White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson. \"President Trump has exercised his constitutional authority to issue pardons and commutations for a variety of individuals.\"   \n   Jackson also alluded to the lame-duck pardon Biden granted to his son Hunter, as well as Biden's commutations of 37 federal death row prisoners. Biden said he made those commutations due to his objections to capital punishment at the federal level — and his worry that Trump would lift the moratorium he put on federal executions.   \"And the only pardons anyone should be critical of are from President Autopen, who pardoned and commuted sentences of violent criminals including child killers and mass murderers – and that's not to mention the proactive pardons he 'signed' for his family members like Hunter on his way out the door,\" Jackson added.   What is the clemency process under Trump? Getting his ear may help   Though it's not the only path to securing a pardon or commutation, the official process for seeking clemency is to submit a formal application to the U.S. pardon attorney.   \n   Martin, the current pardon attorney, was appointed by Trump after the president withdrew his nomination to be the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia in the face of Republican opposition. The Trump administration fired the former pardon attorney, Liz Oyer, in March after she refused to restore the gun rights of actor and Trump supporter Mel Gibson, who had been convicted of domestic violence.   Mark Osler, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas, said it's unclear whether the formal process is currently resulting in clemency grants in any significant numbers. \"Right now we know that there's still a mailbox, and that there are petitions going into that mailbox,\" he said. \"What we don't know is what happens after that.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                In 2018, Trump commuted the sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, after she served 21 years in prison for cocaine trafficking. He later pardoned Johnson and made her his \"pardon czar.\"\n                \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   Osler said concerns about the clemency application process — or lack thereof — predated Trump's second term. He said Biden also issued pardons to political allies and personal connections he thought Trump may target, including his son Hunter.   \n   \"So those norms were being strained and broken before Trump took office, but he certainly has continued that trend,\" he said.   Osler, who runs a clinic where he and his students file petitions for people seeking clemency, said it's raising questions among those seeking clemency about their odds of success by following the traditional path to obtain a pardon or commutation.   \n   \"I think people are focusing very much on how upset they are about who's receiving grants,\" he said. \"But we need to focus as well on who's not getting grants — those people who have done a long term in prison, who have rehabilitated themselves, often done incredible things in prison. And they're being ignored in their plea for mercy.\"   Trump appointed Alice Johnson as his \"pardon czar\" in February. Johnson was pardoned for a nonviolent drug offense by Trump during his first term after her story got the attention and advocacy of celebrities such as Kim Kardashian.   Johnson said she was going to \"fight for those who are still incarcerated, who don't have a voice like I have right now.\" She told Fox News in May that she'd sent more than 100 clemency petitions to the White House and \"over 46 people really were able to get a second chance in life.\"\n",

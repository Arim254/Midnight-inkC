They did their sentence, but committed no crime.   A president, not a Queen, will again inexplicably \"pardon\" two turkeys, with no criminal record, in one of the strangest and most misunderstood of American traditions.   Let's clear some of it up:   This year's Turkeys are Gobble and Waddle    After the ceremony at the White House, the birds are headed back to the Tar Heel state, where they will spend whatever days they have left at North Carolina State University, a place that's been used before – in 2022 for \"Chocolate\" and \"Chip.\"   \n   A long history ... of sending turkeys to presidents    People have been sending turkeys to presidents since the late 19th century, but for decades, they were always meant to be eaten.   Lots of shenanigans took place, like the college student from Texas A&M in 1940 who hitchhiked 2,000 miles to Washington, D.C., with a turkey from Cuero, Texas – to give to the president. He stayed in a hotel that let the bird stay in a bathroom – until a maid let it out.   They found the turkey, gave it to the president, and it became such a thing, that members of Congress plucked feathers for souvenirs.   Sounds like a hoot… or a gobble.   The Turkey lobby takes over in 1947   The reason turkeys sit on tables in front of cameras with a president interacting with them is because of the National Turkey Federation, aka, Big Turkey.   Harry S. Truman was the first to be presented with one from the federation – and it started in protest. To save grain in a post-war conservation effort, Truman had established \"Poultryless Thursdays.\"   In protest, the poultry industry and others sent crates of chickens to the White House, in an effort known as \"Hens for Harry.\" It ended with the turkey federation mending fences and giving Truman a 47-pound turkey.   \n   Now, paid for by the turkey federation, the birds get to stay in – and mess up – an otherwise lovely hotel room in what has become days of photo ops before they are subjected to sometimes painful presidential jokes and looking like they'd rather be anywhere but there.   President Kennedy technically pardoned the first Turkey in 1963   But that wasn't the intention, and the president didn't use the word.   \"We'll just let this one grow,\" President John F. Kennedy said, looking at the bird, with a sign around its neck that read, \"Good eating, Mr. President.\"   The L.A. Times headlined the event as a \"presidential pardon.\"   President Reagan was the first to use the word pardon in relation to a turkey   But it wasn't a formal pardoning ceremony and it was a deflection from the Iran-Contra scandal.   In 1987, President Ronald Reagan was presented with a turkey, Charlie, but legendary ABC News correspondent Sam Donaldson took the opportunity to yell a question. He asked whether Reagan would pardon Oliver North and John Poindexter, who were involved in the arms deal.   \"If they'd given me a different answer on Charlie and his future,\" Reagan joked about the bird that was about to be pardoned, \"I would have pardoned him.\"   President George H.W. Bush formalized the modern-day event in 1989   Finally, the tradition became formalized with these words from the nation's 41st president:   \"[L]et me assure you and this fine tom turkey, that he will not end up on anyone's dinner table,\" George H. W. Bush said, \"not this guy — he's presented a presidential pardon as of right now—and allow him to live out his days on a children's farm not far from here.\"   For one more day, at least, the turkeys can feel like they are the champions.\n",

    "body": "\n   Utah Gov. Spencer Cox is comfortable bringing his faith into politics. He is less comfortable with a trend he perceives: \"Politics is replacing religion.\"   Cox drew widespread attention in September after the assassination of the activist Charlie Kirk in Utah. After briefing the public on the arrest of the suspect, the governor added a personal appeal for Americans to think about politics differently. \"I would encourage people to log off, turn off, touch grass, hug a family member, go out and do good in your community,\" he said.   Just before the Thanksgiving holiday, NPR sat with Cox for a conversation on the state of the country. He addressed the aftermath of the Kirk shooting in a divided nation — and discussed other issues, from nuclear power to artificial intelligence, that he sees as connected to those divisions.   \n   The conversation appears across several NPR platforms — on Morning Edition, in a special episode of Up First podcast, and in a video you can watch above or on YouTube.   Below are some key points from the conversation.   He says people heard and embraced his message in September   \"We have to decide: Is this an off-ramp?\" Cox said, adding that he believes some people are taking it. \"Here we are months later, and the response continues to be overwhelmingly positive.\"   He described meeting a mother whose son, she said, wanted to redirect his life, after hearing the governor's remarks. Cox also said he heard about the comments as far as New Zealand, where he traveled as part of a trade delegation.   A conservative Republican, Cox governs a state whose voters have sometimes been willing to tolerate criticism of President Trump. He describes his faith as \"core\" to how he approaches politics.   He remains concerned about a divided nation   Cox has made a signature issue out of \"disagreeing better,\" as he puts it: treating political opponents with civility.   \"We keep thinking if we just win this election, we'll never have to work with those people,\" he said. But the Constitution requires that \"we will always have to work with those people. That's how this gets done. We have to build coalitions.\"   \n   \"We're looking for tribes somewhere,\" he said. \"And we're finding that in politics. Politics is replacing religion.\"   He questions Trump's promise to investigate liberal groups   Cox said if groups really are encouraging violence, then \"we should hold them accountable.\" But after the Kirk assassination, \"every single Democrat I know that I talked to about this was just appalled.\"   He said he preferred to focus on one gunman who was responsible.   \"In my faith, we believe in agency. We believe that we are responsible for our own decisions and that other people aren't responsible for those. And so to try to attack an entire group of people or an ideology because of one person isn't right and isn't fair.\"   \n   His critics include some on the right   Cox spoke at the first gathering of Kirk's organization, Turning Point USA, after the assassination. Some in the crowd booed him. Kirk had previously called for Cox to be expelled from the Republican party in 2022 after the governor vetoed legislation banning trans athletes from girls' sports in schools.   Cox said he thought it was worth going before a crowd that differed with him, and once he explained his reasons for the veto, the crowd applauded. He has argued that the legislation targeted just a handful of athletes, was poorly conceived and would simply lead to lawsuits.   He says Trump hasn't taken up the opportunity to unify the nation   Cox said he didn't vote for Trump in 2016 or 2020, but endorsed him in 2024 after an assassination attempt in Butler, Pa. He called Trump's survival a \"miracle\" and said that only he could unify the nation. Asked whether this has happened, Cox said: \"I think if you were to ask him that question, he would say no. I don't think that's happened.\"   He nevertheless said the endorsement was valuable because \"I have an opportunity to have a relationship with the president. And I think that's very important to me. It's very important to Utahns.\"    \n   Cox said Trump called him after the Kirk assassination and praised his appeal for unity, even though Trump \"hasn't modeled that, and he sees the world a little differently than I do.\"   The radio version of this interview was produced by Taylor Haney and edited by Arezou Rezvani.\n",

This is the first time, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee says, that it's had a program specifically dedicated to engaging rural voters.   Suzan DelBene, who chairs the DCCC and represents Washington's 1st Congressional District, said Democrats see an opportunity to engage rural voters as President Trump's economic agenda, particularly tariffs, becomes less popular.   She said rural voters see the \"damage\" being done by GOP policies that have led to \"costs going up, health care being gutted,\" and Democrats can provide an alternative.   \n   \"I think Republicans are turning their back,\" DelBene told NPR. \"They've been actively hurting rural communities with the policies they've put in place. Democrats are fighting to improve the lives of rural Americans and farmers.\"   Trump has defended his economic agenda and plans to bring the message out into the country soon, an administration official recently told NPR.   \n   Democrats' spending in rural communities is part of an \"eight-figure investment,\" according to a DCCC press release first shared with NPR. DelBene said the DCCC has a full-time staffer who will be focused on \"strategic rural engagement across the country\" for the midterms. She said the party has begun working with rural community groups and leaders in key competitive districts — including in newly redrawn districts in South Texas.   \"When we look at the swing districts across the country, the districts that are going to determine the majority in the House of Representatives, we know that rural voters are key in those districts,\" DelBene said.   Anthony Flaccavento, co-founder and executive director of the Rural Urban Bridge Initiative, said economic frustration among most voters could provide an opening for Democrats, and that rural voters tend to align with economically populist policies.   \"It's very clear to us that a progressive, populist economic stance is what is needed,\" he said. \"It's what is needed in substance. Like we need the anti-monopolies, antitrust, pro-union-and-investment-in-infrastructure-type things that go with that.\"   \n   But it is an open question whether an economic message will help Democrats win back parts of a voting bloc that has been abandoning the party in droves.   Winning back rural voters could be \"hard as hell\"   According to the Pew Research Center, in last year's presidential election Trump won 69% of voters who describe their communities as rural, compared with just 29% for Kamala Harris.   Flaccavento said winning back at least a slice of those rural voters is likely to be \"hard as hell\" for Democrats. But, he said, it's a problem the party needs to confront head on.   \"We focus on rural, but because there's so much overlap in why people have left the Democrats and why they have so much disillusionment, it's a lot of commonality between working-class folks in small towns and cities and rural people,\" Flaccavento said. \"When you put those two together, rural voters and blue-collar, working-class voters, then you have the biggest voting bloc in the country.\"   Flaccavento, a small farmer in southwestern Virginia who's a self-described liberal Democrat, ran twice to represent Virginia's 9th Congressional District. He said he had high hopes for his run in 2018.   \"We held over 100 in-person town hall meetings with close to 7,000 people attending. We had great social media. We raised a million bucks. We did everything right,\" he said. \"And I still got annihilated at the voting box 2 to 1.\"   Flaccavento said the negative perception of Democrats in the countryside has long been hard to overcome as the party dismisses concerns that working folks and rural people have had.   \"Primarily economic concerns,\" he said. \"They've been downplayed.\"   Nicholas Jacobs, a political scientist at Colby College in Maine, said Democrats haven't just dismissed the concerns of rural voters, he said the party has \"actively push[ed] them away.\"   Jacobs said the party began clawing back campaign investments in rural America when Democrats abandoned their 50-state strategy. Instead, he said, the party focused on mobilizing their base voters in big cities, and persuading independent-leaning voters in the suburbs.   \n   \"Ultimately, what you get is a complete buy-in to the approach articulated no better than Chuck Schumer himself did, that 'for every rural working-class person we lose, we'll pick up two more in the suburbs,'\" he said, paraphrasing the Senate Democratic leader. \"And as 2016 showed, it was a foolish approach, but it didn't seem to change anything for the next eight years.\"   Flaccavento agreed it's been \"a losing strategy\" for the party.   But he said it will take more than targeted investments in a few swing districts to really shore up some of the support that has been lost in rural America.   \"My hope would be that it's a serious commitment, not a token commitment, and that it's a commitment that goes beyond a handful of targeted races,\" he said. \"We have to start long-term investment and long-term work across every rural congressional district. It might be five or 10 years or more before some of them become competitive, but we've got to start that work now.\"   Jacobs said he hopes Democrats have started to \"wake up\" to the fact that rural areas cannot be neglected.   \"If you are going to build a national party and compete at a national level, you need to represent the entire nation and all of its wonderful and complex messiness,\" he said. \"And that includes how rural Americans fit into your idea of the nation.\"\n",

Mark Kelly, a retired U.S. Navy fighter pilot and NASA astronaut, for possible violations of military law after he appeared in a video with other Democratic lawmakers urging active duty military and intelligence personnel to refuse \"illegal orders.\"   \n   In the case of Kelly, the Pentagon put out a statement saying that it had \"received serious allegations of misconduct against Captain Mark Kelly, USN (Ret.),\" and that \"a thorough review of these allegations has been initiated to determine further actions, which may include recall to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures.\"   The statement, posted on X, said: \"This matter will be handled in compliance with military law, ensuring due process and impartiality. Further official comments will be limited, to preserve the integrity of the proceedings.\"   \n   The move comes as the Trump administration faces legal questions surrounding its deployment of National Guard troops to U.S. cities and deadly airstrikes on boats suspected of drug smuggling in the Caribbean.   Last week, Kelly, a Democrat elected in 2020, joined five other House and Senate Democrats who also served in the armed forces or an intelligence branch in a video on X. In it, Kelly and the others said: \"This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence intelligence community professionals against American citizens. Like us, you all swore an oath to protect and defend this Constitution.\"   \"Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders,\" the video said.   \n   The video included appearances from Sen. Elissa Slotkin, a former CIA analyst, Colorado Rep. Jason Crow, a former Army Ranger who fought in Iraq, two Congress members from Pennsylvania -- Rep. Chris Deluzio, a former U.S. Navy officer, and Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, a former Air Force officer -- as well as Rep. Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, a former U.S. Navy intelligence officer.   After the video's release, President Trump posted on Truth Social that it amounted to \"seditious behavior\" that was \"punishable by death.\" Although the president later clarified that he was \"not threatening death,\" he posted again on Truth Social Sunday (in all caps): \"IT WAS SEDITION AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL, AND SEDITION IS A MAJOR CRIME. THERE CAN BE NO OTHER INTERPRETATION OF WHAT THEY SAID!\"   \n   After Trump's post, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in response to a question about the video on Thursday that any incitement to \"defy the chain of command, not to follow lawful orders\" was \"a very dangerous thing for sitting members of Congress to do, and they should be held accountable, and that's what the president wants to see.\"   Shortly after Trump's initial post on Thursday, House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters: \"For a senator like Mark Kelly or any member of the House or Senate to behave in that kind of talks is to me so just beyond the pale.\"   \"I'm not going to say anything more on it,\" he added.   Speaking on CBS' Face The Nation over the weekend, Kelly said Republicans in Congress had not spoken out after the president's threat. \"We've heard very little, basically crickets, from Republicans in the United States Congress about what the president has said about hanging members of Congress.\"   Reacting to the Pentagon on Monday, Kelly said that a post on X from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth \"is the first I heard of this.\"   \"I also saw the President's posts saying I should be arrested, hanged, and put to death. If this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable, it won't work,\" Kelly said in a statement emailed to NPR.   Only Kelly, who is formally retired from the Navy with the rank of captain, could be recalled to active duty for court-martial. Such a move by the Pentagon is exceedingly rare and it's unclear if defense officials will follow through on the threat.   Kevin Carroll, a retired colonel and military lawyer who served in the first Trump administration, told NPR that the only similar example he can think of dates back to 1925, when then-Army Col. Billy Mitchell was convicted by court-martial of insubordination. Mitchell, who later became famous for his singular focus on the need for the U.S. to build military airpower, made \"extremely strong statements, very critical of military leadership,\" Carroll said.   \n   But Mitchell was active duty. Because Kelly is retired and a sitting senator and possible 2028 presidential candidate, his situation \"is really a horse of a different kind,\" Carroll said.   In an email to NPR, Mick Wagoner, a retired Marine Corps lieutenant colonel who was a military lawyer for 17 years and deployed to four war zones, described such a move by the Pentagon as \"very rare\" and \"politically charged.\"   \"This is a real stretch by the administration,\" he said. \"This has generally applied for events that happened on active duty and were discovered post [active-duty] service.\"    \"It is hard to see it going forwards\" because of Constitutional protections for speech  \"made in the act of their official duties,\" he added.   Kelly is married to former Arizona Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords, who was nearly killed in 2011 in an assassination attempt. As a naval aviator, he flew combat missions over Iraq before being selected as an astronaut by NASA. He went on to fly two Space Shuttle missions as a pilot and two more as commander. His twin brother is former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly.   NPR correspondents Tom Bowman and Quil Lawrence contributed to this report.\n",

That prosecutor is Lindsey Halligan, a 36-year-old former insurance attorney who served as one of President Trump's personal lawyers after his first term and joined his second administration as a White House aide.   Trump appointed Halligan as acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia in late September, the day after her predecessor, Erik Siebert, resigned under pressure from the president to bring charges against Comey and James.   \n   In his announcement, Trump called Halligan a \"tough, smart and loyal attorney\" who \"has the strength and determination to be absolutely OUTSTANDING in this new and very important role.\"   But Halligan's tenure has been mired in controversy, reaching new highs on Monday when U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie ruled in dual opinions that Halligan's appointment was unlawful.   The judge found that Halligan's appointment violated a federal statute that limits interim U.S. attorneys to 120 days in the role, because Siebert had been in that acting role since January. After 120 days without a Senate confirmation, only district courts — not the Attorney General — can fill a vacancy.   \n   Currie wrote that Halligan, whom she describes as \"a former White House aide with no prior prosecutorial experience,\" had \"no lawful authority to present the indictment\" against Comey or James. Because Halligan's was the only signature on those documents, they are rendered invalid.   \"All actions flowing from Ms. Halligan's defective appointment, including securing and signing Mr. Comey's indictment, were unlawful exercises of executive power and are hereby set aside,\" Currie wrote.   The ruling leaves the door open for the Justice Department to appeal, which White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it will. In an interview Monday on Fox News, she downplayed the decision as a \"technical ruling\" and defended Halligan's authority.   \n   \"We believe that the attorney in this case, Lindsey Halligan, is not only extremely qualified for this position but she was in fact legally appointed,\" Leavitt said.   Here's what to know about the prosecutor at the center of this latest political storm.   Halligan got her start in insurance law    Halligan grew up in Broomfield, Colo., a suburb about halfway between Denver and Boulder. She played softball and basketball and competed in several Miss Colorado USA pageants, earning third runner-up in 2009.   She studied politics and broadcast journalism at Regis University, the Jesuit school in Denver that Erika Kirk also attended. According to one professional biography, Halligan developed an interest in law while interning at the Denver City Attorney's Office in college.   She got her law degree from the University of Miami in 2013, interning at the Miami-Dade Public Defender's Office and the law school's Miami Innocence Clinic along the way. She began her legal career at the Florida firm Cole, Scott & Kissane, which specializes in insurance defense litigation.   \n   Halligan became a partner at the firm in 2018 and, the following year, won praise for defeating a $500,000 property damage claim involving a leaky roof (\"George and Lindsey presented evidence that the roof was old and just past its normal life expectancy,\" the firm said in a news release at the time).   Halligan told the Washington Post earlier this year that she first met Trump at a November 2021 event at his golf club in West Palm Beach — months after his first term ended, as he was under investigation by both the Justice Department and New York State.   \"I saw the same thing that I saw when I interned at the Innocence clinic: someone who was getting railroaded by the system,\" Halligan told the newspaper.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Lindsey Halligan, then part of Trump's personal legal team, leaves a court hearing in West Palm Beach, Florida, in September 2022.\n                \n                    Marco Bello/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Marco Bello/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Halligan went from personal lawyer to the president's assistant   Halligan joined Trump's personal legal team in 2022.   \n   \"As a Partner at the biggest Law Firm in Florida, Lindsey proved herself to be a tremendous trial lawyer, and later represented me (and WON!) in the disgraceful Democrat Documents Hoax, as well as MANY other major, high profile cases,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social in September.   Halligan and Trump have both said that she was at his Mar-a-Lago residence in August 2022 when the FBI raided the property as part of its investigation into his retention of classified documents. She helped defend him in that case, both in court and on TV.   A Trump-appointed federal judge ultimately dismissed it in July 2024, ruling the prosecutor had been unlawfully appointed, and the Justice Department dropped its appeal after Trump was reelected.   When Trump returned to the White House in January 2025, Halligan joined his administration with two titles: White House senior associate staff secretary and special assistant to the president.   Halligan remained visible, frequently appearing with him in the Oval Office and at the U.S. Open.   One of her most visible White House contributions was leading its controversial review of more than half a dozen Smithsonian Institution museums to \"ensure alignment\" with Trump's cultural directives. The Organization of American Historians has called the order, which was issued in August, an \"unacceptable instance of ongoing executive overreach.\"   Halligan has defended and taken credit for it, telling The Washington Post that when she moved to D.C. ahead of Trump's inauguration, some of the museum exhibits she visited struck her as \"weaponizing history.\"   \"And so I talked to the president about it,\" Halligan said, \"and suggested an executive order, and he gave me his blessing, and here we are.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Lindsey Halligan stands next to other White House aides including Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller and staff secretary Will Scharf as President Trump speaks with reporters in the Oval Office in February.\n                \n                    Alex Brandon/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Brandon/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Halligan is accused of missteps in the dropped cases   While the Comey and James cases were thrown out because of Halligan's lack of authority, their lawyers — as well as outside legal experts — accused Halligan of legal missteps in her effort to prosecute Trump's political enemies.   \n   Halligan's predecessor, Siebert, had resisted bringing charges against both officials because of insufficient evidence. At the time, his office had already opened an investigation into James over bank fraud allegations related to a 2020 mortgage application for a Virginia property. Siebert's resignation came hours after Trump told reporters that he wanted the prosecutor \"out.\"   \n   Trump announced Halligan's appointment the following day. That's also the day Trump posted — and later deleted — a message on social media appearing to pressure Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate his political rivals: Comey, James and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California.   Bondi's office issued an order authorizing Halligan for the interim U.S. attorney job less than 48 hours later, on Sept. 22. Halligan's office announced on Sept. 25 that a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Comey with making a false statement and obstruction over 2020 Senate testimony.   That announcement came five days before the statute of limitations would have expired in Comey's case — and on Halligan's fourth day on the job.   \"She started on a Monday — this was a Thursday — and tried to get this indictment in a case,\" former federal prosecutor Elie Honig told NPR's Morning Edition. \"I will tell you, if I went into a grand jury on my fourth day on the job and tried to indict a complicated, high-stakes case like this too, I'm sure I would've screwed up as well.\"   \n   In the weeks since, the grand jury process has been the subject of growing legal questions. Earlier this month, a magistrate judge took the unusual step of ordering the Justice Department to turn over all grand jury materials to Comey's defense team, citing a \"disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps.\"   Scrutiny further increased after a hearing last week, at which Halligan confirmed that the full grand jury never reviewed the final indictment against Comey — a shocking revelation that could be enough to get the case dismissed, though a prosecutor at the hearing downplayed it as a \"paperwork error.\"   \n   Halligan initially sought three counts against Comey, but the grand jury rejected one of them. Then Halligan or someone else created a new indictment with renumbered charges but didn't bring that back to the grand jury for a vote, a step that Honig said \"any semi-experienced prosecutor\" would know not to skip.   \"It would take 10 minutes,\" he added. \"Instead, she just brings it to the judge with two grand jurors with her, which is not enough. And now she's created this problem for herself out of a sheer lack of competence.\"   Days later, a judge threw the case out for an entirely different reason.\n",

But there are lots of signs that support has evaporated. Democrats won big victories earlier this month in elections across the country – with large margins among Latinos. Poll after poll has shown Hispanics declining in support for Trump since he was sworn in for a second term.   And a new, major Pew poll of more than 5,000 Latinos across two surveys underscores this point.   \n   There were some eye-opening findings, including:   Seventy percent disapprove of the job President Trump is doing.    A majority — 55% — said they very strongly disapprove.    Among those who voted for him, Trump is down 12 points. At the beginning of his second term, 93% of Latinos who voted for him approved of the job he was doing. Now, it's 81%.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Pew Research Center\n    \n\n   \n   The economy is a major concern; 4 in 5 see it negatively, and they blame Trump.   The economy was a main reason so many Latinos crossed over to vote for Trump in 2024, but they are really down on how they view it now — 78% rated economic conditions today as only fair or poor. Trump does not escape blame, either. Sixty-one percent said his policies have made economic conditions worse; just 15% said they have made things better.Critically, half of poll respondents said that in the past year, they have struggled to afford food, housing or medical care.    Two-thirds disapprove of Trump's approach on immigration.   71% said Trump is doing too much when it comes to deportations, up 15 points since March.   More than half worry that they, a close friend or family member will be deported.   \n   More than two-thirds say the situation for Latinos has worsened.   That's up 42 points from when it was last asked in 2021. That includes 31% of Trump-voting Hispanics.    While Democrats feel this more strongly, the result is not driven by partisan identity. In two decades of conducting this major poll of Latinos, Pew notes that it has never seen Latinos say their situation is worse than the year before.   Four in 5 said Trump's policies have been harmful to Latinos, including a third of those who voted for him.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Pew Research Center\n    \n\n   \n   Most have serious concerns about their place in America.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Pew Research Center\n    \n\n   \n   Fifty-five percent said they have those serious concerns, up from 48% last year.   Remarkably, a third said they have contemplated leaving the country in the last six months.   Forty-six percent said that's because of the political situation in the country.   Twenty-six percent said it would be to find somewhere with a lower cost of living.\n\n\n",

That's a huge reversal for Trump, who did better with Latinos in 2024 than any other Republican presidential candidate in history. NPR's senior political editor and correspondent, Domenico Montanaro, has dug into the numbers. Domenico, good morning.DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Steve.INSKEEP: OK. What are the numbers?MONTANARO: Well, you know, 70% of Latinos surveyed say that they disapprove of the job Trump is doing. And remember, this is someone who won almost half of Latinos who voted in 2024.INSKEEP: Yeah.MONTANARO: You know, he's also down 12 points with Latinos who voted for him. You know, when he came into office, they had a 93% approval of him. Now that's down to 81%. And that's of those who voted. Nonvoters who are eligible to vote give him just a 27% approval rating. That's down 15 points from when he was sworn in for his second term. So generally, what we're seeing is that a lot of Latinos gave Trump a chance but are now souring on him.INSKEEP: This is really interesting because just a few months ago, Republicans were thinking and talking about realigning the parties in this way. What's causing their decline?MONTANARO: Yeah. I feel like a broken record, but it's the two issues that we've been talking about throughout Trump's second term - affordability and immigration. You know, the economy, specifically the cost of living, was the No. 1 issue for Latino voters in the 2024 presidential election. It's why so many crossed over to vote for Trump. But they're not feeling great about Trump's economy. Four in 5 view it negatively. Sixty-one percent say Trump's economic policies have made conditions worse. Just 15% say that they've made things better. And this is a real issue hitting home for a lot of people. Half of Latinos surveyed say that in the past year, they've struggled to afford food, housing or medical care.INSKEEP: Let me bring up immigration because we've been reminded that Latinos don't just care about immigration. Interviews over the past couple of years have shown us - we've heard on the program - some people who are Latino don't like illegal immigration, feel they came here legally, resent the people who skip the line, as they see it. So there was room for Trump, but now they're seeing how he is enacting his immigration ideas. What's the poll finding about the response?MONTANARO: Yeah. And again, cost of living is the top issue, but two-thirds disapprove of Trump's approach to immigration. Most importantly, 71% say that he's doing too much when it comes to deportations. You know, that's up 15 points from March. And it's really quite stunning here that half also say that they're worried that they, a close friend or a family member might be deported. That's up sharply since Trump started his second term, and many Latinos are left questioning where they fit in the American story right now. Fifty-five percent say that they have serious concerns about their place in the country. One in 3 say that they've thought about leaving the country in the last six months...INSKEEP: Wow.MONTANARO: ...Whether it's because of politics, which was the plurality, or because of the cost of living. It's really remarkable, considering America's long been seen as a destination to work and create a new life for a family.INSKEEP: I want to be clear. These people thinking about leaving the country - these are citizens who are voters, right?MONTANARO: Yeah.INSKEEP: OK. What does this mean for Trump and Republicans for next year?MONTANARO: I think that it means, for either party, Latinos are not a guaranteed vote. I mean, a lot of Hispanic voters felt for a long time that the Democrats took them for granted, but many are certainly feeling estranged from the Republican Party. And with Trump in charge and the cost of living being what it is and the way deportations are being conducted, it looks worse for the GOP. Four in 5 say Trump's policies have been harmful to Latinos. Even a third of those who voted for him say that.INSKEEP: NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Thanks so much.MONTANARO: You're welcome.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Mark Kelly in the wake of a video of Democratic lawmakers urging servicemembers not to comply with \"illegal orders.\"   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth says the Pentagon is looking into remarks made by Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly. Last week, Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers with military or intelligence backgrounds released a video saying that U.S. troops must not follow illegal orders.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARK KELLY: You can refuse illegal orders.ELISSA SLOTKIN: You can refuse illegal orders.CHRIS DELUZIO: You must refuse illegal orders.SLOTKIN: No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our constitution.SUMMERS: President Trump responded on social media that this was, quote, \"seditious behavior punishable by death.\" But now one of the senators is facing the threat of court-martial by the Pentagon. NPR's Quil Lawrence is here to explain. Hi there.QUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE: Hi.SUMMERS: Quil, start by reminding us exactly what that video was about. Why are all of these Democrats talking about illegal orders?LAWRENCE: Well, there are two areas here. Judges have been ruling that some of the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops against the will of state governors is illegal. But there's also the ongoing lethal strikes against boats allegedly carrying drugs to the U.S. And that's another case where legal scholars and some European allies have said that they don't think these killings are legal. So this is six Democratic veteran lawmakers who are reiterating what troops, and especially officers, learn, is that you don't have to follow illegal orders and that, importantly, just following orders is not a defense for doing something illegal.SUMMERS: Right. So do you have a sense of why the Pentagon is specifically focusing on Senator Kelly?LAWRENCE: Yeah. Secretary Hegseth was very clear about this. Of all those six, Kelly is the only one who is formally retired from the military, and as such - he's a former navy captain, former combat pilot - so he can be recalled to active duty to face court-martial. But this would be unprecedented, I think. I spoke with military lawyer Kevin Carroll, who's a retired colonel, who served in the first Trump administration, and he said, the last thing even similar he could think of was in 1925 - so 100 years ago - but that was an active-duty officer. This is very different. And it seems, Carroll said, to be an attempt to silence political dissent.KEVIN CARROLL: Doing this to a retiree who also happens to be, you know, a senator who was considered for the vice presidency and might potentially be a presidential candidate in 2028 is really a horse of a different color.SUMMERS: Quil, has there been any response from Senator Kelly at this time?LAWRENCE: Yes. He put out a statement. I'll quote it partially. He said, \"Secretary Hegseth's tweet is the first I heard of this. I also saw the president's post saying I should be arrested, hanged and put to death. If this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable, it won't work.\" He also posted a photo on social media of his dress uniform with a chest full of medals, which I think largely is seen as a trolling of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth who doesn't have any of the sort of combat medals that usually would be expected for someone of his position.SUMMERS: Any sense of where all of this goes from here?LAWRENCE: Well, the Pentagon said it was reviewing this. It's not clear they'll actually charge him or call him back to court-martial him, especially because all these Democrats did was state U.S. military code, but it's a tough spot for troops right now. NPR and others have reported that the Department of Justice has determined these boat strikes are legal, so these troops have to follow their orders. But already, the head of Southern Command has left his - is going to be leaving his post shortly. Four-star Admiral Alvin Holsey reportedly had qualms about these strikes. That's according to U.S. officials who are not authorized to speak publicly.SUMMERS: NPR's Quil Lawrence. Thank you.LAWRENCE: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

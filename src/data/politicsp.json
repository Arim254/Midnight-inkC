Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche says Friday's release means the DOJ is now in compliance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which Congress passed last November and which legally required the DOJ to release all the files.   Members of Congress who passed the law had earlier complained that the DOJ had failed to meet its deadline of mid-December to release all the files.      Never miss a big story. Sign up for the NPR Politics newsletter, sent weekly      \n   Blanche at a press conference on Friday morning said more than 500 lawyers and others worked through weekends and holidays to comply with the law, while making sure to protect victims' information. He said they had to review more than 6 million pages — \"two Eiffel Towers of pages\" — to decide what to release. They're continuing to withhold documents that depict violence or involve attorney-client privilege, he said. The department also said it discarded any duplicates or unrelated materials.   \"I take umbrage at the suggestion, which is totally false, that the attorney general or this department does not take child exploitation or sex trafficking seriously, or that we somehow do not want to protect victims,\" Blanche said.   He also said the DOJ wasn't seeking to protect President Trump while releasing the files, though some of the files contained sensational and false claims about the president and others.   \"Through the process, the Department provided clear instructions to reviewers that the redactions were to be limited to the protection of victims and their families,\" the DOJ said in a statement. \"Some pornographic images, whether commercial or not, were redacted, given the Department treated all women in those images as victims. Notable individuals and politicians were not redacted in the release of any files.\"   \n   Epstein files political saga   The release of the Epstein files is the latest development in a political saga that has dogged Trump's second term in office and caused bipartisan backlash against Trump's conflicting and shifting commentary on the subject.   Trump amplified conspiracy theories about the files relating to his onetime friend Epstein on the campaign trail, vowing to publicize information about the financier's crimes and ties to powerful people that he alleged was being covered up by the government. But once he returned to the White House, Trump fought efforts by lawmakers and his supporters to release those files.   \"There's this mantra out there that, oh, you know, the Department of Justice is supposed to protect Donald J. Trump,\" Blanche said on Friday. \"That's not true. That was never the case. We are always concerned about the victims.\" He said Trump has directed the DOJ to \"be as transparent as we can.\"   Separately, Blanche said the Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation into the death of Alex Pretti, a U.S. citizen who was shot by two immigration enforcement officers last weekend in Minneapolis. The investigation is being led by the FBI, but it is also coordinating with the DOJ's civil rights division, which is led by Harmeet Dhillon.   He also said the investigation was being done in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security.   \"I don't want the takeaway to be that there's some massive civil rights investigation that's happening; I would describe this as a standard investigation by the FBI, when there's circumstances like what we saw last Saturday,\" Blanche said.   This is a developing story and will be updated.\n",

Pretti was shot multiple times Jan. 24 as Border Patrol officers tried to arrest him while he was recording immigration officers on his phone.   Blanche says the probe is separate from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's shooting investigation of the incident.   \n   \"It means talking to witnesses. It means looking at documentary evidence, sending subpoenas if you have to,\" Blanche told reporters at a news briefing Friday on multiple topics. \"And the Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division has the best experts in the world at this.\"   Blanche gave no investigation timetable nor did he commit to the release of body camera footage of the agents. He said the department's investigation would encompass events of that day as well as the days and weeks that preceded the Pretti shooting.   Under questioning, Blanche said the fatal shooting of Good isn't receiving similar DOJ scrutiny.   \"There are thousands, unfortunately, of law enforcement events every year where somebody is shot,\" he said. \"The Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice does not investigate every one of those shootings. There has to be circumstances or facts, or maybe unknown facts, but certainly circumstances that warrant an investigation.\"   Federal officials have excluded Minnesota investigators from assisting with reviews of both shootings, leading to a state lawsuit that seeks to require evidence of the Pretti shooting be maintained. State authorities haven't ruled out bringing charges against federal officers after completing their own investigations.\n",

The suit, filed in a Florida federal court Thursday, includes the president's sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. and the Trump organization as plaintiffs.   The filing alleges that the leak of Trump and the Trump Organization's confidential tax records caused \"reputational and financial harm, public embarrassment, unfairly tarnished their business reputations, portrayed them in a false light, and negatively affected President Trump, and the other Plaintiffs' public standing.\"   \n   In 2024, former IRS contractor Charles Edward Littlejohn of Washington, D.C. — who worked for Booz Allen Hamilton, a defense and national security tech firm — was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to leaking tax information about Trump and others to news outlets.   Littlejohn, known as Chaz, gave data to The New York Times and ProPublica between 2018 and 2020 in leaks that appeared to be \"unparalleled in the IRS's history,\" prosecutors said.   The disclosure violated IRS Code 6103, one of the strictest confidentiality laws in federal statute.   The Times reported in 2020 that Trump did not pay federal income tax for many years prior to 2020, and ProPublica in 2021 published a series about discrepancies in Trump's records. Six years of Trump's returns were later released by the then-Democratically controlled House Ways and Means Committee.   Trump's suit states that Littlejohn's disclosures to the news organizations \"caused reputational and financial harm to Plaintiffs and adversely impacted President Trump's support among voters in the 2020 presidential election.\"   Littlejohn stole tax records of other mega-billionaires, including Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk.   The president's suit comes after the U.S. Treasury Department announced it has cut its contracts with Booz Allen Hamilton, earlier this week, after Littlejohn, who worked for the firm, was charged and subsequently imprisoned for leaking tax information to news outlets about thousands of the country's wealthiest people, including the president.   \n   Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at the time of the announcement that the firm \"failed to implement adequate safeguards to protect sensitive data, including the confidential taxpayer information it had access to through its contracts with the Internal Revenue Service.\"   Representatives of the White House, Treasury and IRS were not immediately available for comment.\n",

Journalists, press advocates and Democratic lawmakers accused the Trump administration of attempting to intimidate independent accountability reporting.     The actual criminal charges have not been unsealed. Protesters interrupted a religious service at the church, where a A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official serves as a pastor.    Lemon had followed the protesters in as they demonstrated. In his live-streamed video, he says he is there as a journalist. He interviewed the pastor and others present, as well as protesters.    \n   Some of President Trump's supporters argued he had participated in the disruption.    In a statement posted on social media, Lemon's attorney, Abbe Lowell, called the arrest an \"unprecedented attack on the First Amendment and transparent attempt to distract attention from the many crises facing this administration.\"   Amnesty International demanded the release of Lemon and Fort, calling their arrests \"a critical threat to our human rights.\"   \n   \"Reporting on protests isn't a crime — its protected by the First Amendment,\" said Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. \"The Justice Department should drop these prosecutions or they should be thrown out.\"    Media executives and press rights advocates have been on heightened alert over a series of actions taken by the Trump administration: formal investigations of most of the nation's leading broadcasters, including ABC, CBS, NBC, NPR and PBS; threats by President Trump to hold up big corporate transactions involving media companies; Trump's personal lawsuits against major news outlets including the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal; and, most recently, the FBI's seizure of computers and devices from Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson without warning, said to be part of an investigation of the leak of national security documents. Typically prosecutors contact news organizations to give them a chance to identify relevant materials and to challenge the need to hand them over in court.   \n   Justice Department celebrates Lemon's arrest   On Friday morning, Justice Department officials celebrated the arrest of Lemon in California after failing twice to secure arrest warrants for him in Minnesota.    \n   U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi took personal credit, posting on X the arrests occurred at her direction \"in connection with the coordinated attack on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota.\"  The two other people arrested early Friday are local activists.    \"You have the right to worship freely and safely,\" she said in a video. \"And if I haven't been clear already, if you violate that sacred right, we are coming after you.\"   Bondi's spokesperson Gates McGavick posted a meme of the attorney general with laser beams emanating from her eyes.    U.S. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon posted on X that the church was \"a space protected from exactly such acts by federal criminal and civil laws! Nor does the First Amendment protect your pseudo journalism of disrupting a prayer service. You are on notice.\" Dhillon, who oversees the civil rights division of the Justice Department, also reposted a tweet referring to Lemon as one of \"today's klansmen.\"   Three others were previously charged in connection with the church protest, accused of violating a law that prevents people from obstructing places of worship or abortion clinics.   A federal magistrate judge previously declined to approve Lemon's arrest, citing a lack of evidence. And the chief federal appeals court judge in Minnesota rejected a prosecutor's appeal of the decision, writing there was \"no evidence\" of any criminal behavior in their work.     The Washington Post reviewed the videos of Lemon at the protest.    \"The footage shows that he was with activists before the protest and followed them to the church, where he spent approximately 45 minutes and spoke with four parishioners and five protesters,\" the Post wrote. \"In all but one instance, the exchanges appear to be calm. The footage does not show him participating in the chants that disrupted the service. A pastor at one point asks him to leave. Seven minutes later, he exits the church building.\"   \n   'Pure authoritarian bile'   Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer denounced the arrest on the Senate floor, saying it \"is a dark message to journalists everywhere: if you dare criticize this administration, watch your back.\"   \"That is not democracy,\" Schumer said. \"That is a police state and that is pure authoritarian bile.\"   This morning, Fort posted a video on social media saying federal agents were at the door of her home in Minnesota. Fort said in the post that she was reporting when she filmed the church protest. She is a known quantity in Minnesota press circles. According to the National Association of Black Journalists chapter in Minnesota, Fort has won regional awards and served as an officer of the group.     Lemon, who now appears on YouTube, Substack and other social media platforms, left CNN in 2023 after 17 years at the cable network, amid criticism that he made sexist comments about women and aging.    CNN was among those outlets and institutions that weighed in against Lemon's arrest, saying it \"raises profoundly concerning questions about press freedom and the First Amendment.\"   \n   In the statement, shared with NPR by a spokesperson, the network said the Constitution protects \"journalists who bear witness to news and events as they unfold, ensuring they can report freely in the public interest, and the DOJ's attempts to violate those rights is unacceptable.\"   CNN's parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery, is in the process of trying to sell itself to Netflix, though CNN and other cable channels would be spun off. Antitrust regulators at the Justice Department will get to review the deal if it is approved by shareholders.  Trump has said he wants a say in who owns CNN next. \n",

Today's top stories   President Trump plans to nominate Kevin Warsh to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve, replacing Jerome Powell when his term expires in May. Trump has repeatedly complained that Powell has been too timid about cutting rates. Here's what to know about Warsh.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Kevin Warsh (center) is President Trump's pick to lead the Federal Reserve.  Warsh is a former Fed governor who has echoed the president's call for lower interest rates.\n                \n                    Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Border czar Tom Homan is planning to pull some of the thousands of federal immigration agents out of Minnesota. After arriving in Minneapolis to oversee the government's immigration crackdown, Homan acknowledged some problems with operations, which led to federal agents fatally shooting two Americans this month.   🎧 Homan says he is revamping immigration enforcement to make it safer, more efficient and by the book. But these plans hinge on state and local level cooperation, says NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán. Homan explained that this would require the administration to have greater access to prisons and jails, which would mean fewer agents on the streets. Martínez-Beltrán says currently it feels like nothing has changed since Homan arrived. He has not provided a timeline for the drawdown, and federal agents continue to make arrests across the state.➡️ Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar announced yesterday that she is running for Minnesota governor. Her bid comes at a time when immigration enforcement is a key issue for the state, and several Republican leaders have entered the race.   \n   The Senate reached a deal last night to prevent large portions of the government from shutting down, while allowing time to negotiate changes to the Homeland Security bill. The deal, which Trump endorsed, would give Congress a two-week extension for negotiations. However, for this to work, the Senate will have to vote on these changes and send the measure back to the House.    🎧 The House is in recess until early next week, making a short-term shutdown all but inevitable, NPR's Ximena Bustillo tells Up First. It remains unclear whether the House will approve the new package. Bustillo says that if lawmakers act fast, they could minimize the effects of a shutdown because most federal offices are closed over the weekend.   The FBI has seized hundreds of thousands of 2020 election ballots from Fulton County, Ga., which includes most of Atlanta. The county is a hub of baseless fraud claims from that election cycle. Trump still falsely claims he won the 2020 election. The FBI's actions have sparked concerns surrounding the 2026 midterm elections.    🎧 NPR's Stephen Fowler covered Fulton County's 2020 election and its aftermath. He says he witnessed several conspiracy theories that have since been debunked — including that ballots cast before Election Day were fake. The county is one of the several places where Trump faced criminal charges for his efforts to overturn the election. The case was dropped last year. The Trump administration is inserting itself in election data in multiple ways, including using Social Security data to hunt for noncitizen information. Fowler says the administration's actions are intensifying tensions with state and local election officials who are worried about what steps the federal government will take this year.   \n   Today's listen   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                XX\n                \n                    Ryder / @ryd.der\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Ryder / @ryd.der\n    \n\n   \n   Destin Conrad has earned his first Grammy nomination for best progressive R&B album with his debut album, Love on Digital.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Leila Fadel speaks with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., ahead of a possible partial government shutdown Friday.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Let's take a closer look now at the deal struck between Democratic Senators and the White House with one of those lawmakers, Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. Good morning, Senator, and welcome back to the program.RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Good morning to you. Thanks for having me.FADEL: So this deal is ultimately an extension to negotiate on the reforms your party wants when it comes to ICE. I mean, do you think you will get the reforms you want and get this bill passed, given all the hurdles ahead, 'cause it will have to go back to the House, etc?BLUMENTHAL: I believe that we're on a path to avoid a shutdown but still have strong, strict reforms and restraints on an out-of-control, lawless and reckless agency that is inflicting physical violence and violation of rights, not only in Minneapolis, but all across the country. And the country is rightly outraged and angry. I am angry at what I have seen on the streets and neighborhoods and communities of America. So I think we will avert a shutdown and have two weeks as an opportunity to impose these kinds of reforms and restraints. But let me be very clear. If we don't get them, DHS will be shut down. I would shut down this agency.FADEL: When you say shut down this agency, you won't vote for any funding for it?BLUMENTHAL: I would deny any funding for it if the demands - I view them as demands - are not met because essentially, we are seeking to require masks off, body cameras on, basic respect for constitutional rights and accountability for when those rights are violated, just as would be applied to any use of force standards in state or local law enforcement.FADEL: Now, President Trump is publicly supporting this deal. Is he supporting the demands that you just lined out, you just outlined there?BLUMENTHAL: I have no great assurance that he will support these demands. But be very clear that a failure to meet these demands means that the Department of Homeland Security would be shut down. At least my vote would be to end funding for it. What we've done is to separate the other departments like transportation and the Department of Defense, so that Republicans can't make the issue paying our military or enabling passengers to fly safely. The focus will be on DHS and its lawless, unconstitutional actions, including avoidance of judicial warrants and the random sweeps, the draconian break-ins and trashing of people's homes, detention and arrests without judicial warrants. This kind of absolute lawlessness cannot be permitted in America.FADEL: Is two weeks enough to get - enough time to get everyone on the same page when it comes to DHS and immigration enforcement? I mean, what will these two weeks do?BLUMENTHAL: I believe that two weeks is more than adequate time for Republicans to agree with us on these strict reforms. And we cannot rely on executive branch action because, frankly, Donald trust - Trump is not to be trusted. He has not agreed to all of these reforms or even any of the significant ones. And so we have actually fought down the period of time to weeks. They wanted longer, but these kinds of overhauls of the agency are readily doable within that amount of time. And a first indication of their good faith is whether there will really be an independent investigation immediately.FADEL: An investigation into Alex Pretti's killing and Renee Good's killing?BLUMENTHAL: An investigation into the Pretti and Good killings and other kinds of physical assaults that essentially violate the law.FADEL: Do you get a sense of - I mean, give me a sense of how many of your Republican colleagues agree with these restrictions on ICE that you're seeking or you believe will come on side.BLUMENTHAL: You know, that's a great question, and I won't have the answer until I see what they're actually willing to agree to because, you know, we've seen a lot of talk. We now need action. The president is talking about downsizing the force in Minneapolis. We've yet to see it. The kinds of...FADEL: Well, actually, the president said he doesn't have plans to do that, and Tom Homan said that they do. So it's not even clear that that's the case.BLUMENTHAL: Well, let's see what happens in Minneapolis and whether Republicans are willing to agree to these reforms because if they don't, DHS would be shut down.FADEL: That's Richard Blumenthal, Democratic senator of Connecticut. Thank you for your time.BLUMENTHAL: Thank you.FADEL: We have asked Trump administration officials and Republican leaders in Congress to join us for an interview.

    "body": "\n      Senators have reached a deal they hope will avoid a lengthy government shutdown and allow time to negotiate reforms to the Department of Homeland Security.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  All right, the Senate is scrambling to finalize a deal that will keep funding flowing to much of the government and address bipartisan distress over President Trump's immigration enforcement tactics. But even as senators say that they have an agreement to do that, a partial government shutdown is still all but inevitable, at least for a short time. NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas joins us now from the Capitol. Hi, Sam.SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa.CHANG: OK, so what exactly has been agreed to at this point?GRINGLAS: OK, so Congress already approved several spending bills. This deal focuses on six of them that have not been approved yet, but these bills that are left account for huge swaths of the government, including the Pentagon, Health and Human Services and Homeland Security, which includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection. So what the Senate is going to do is vote to fund almost everything through September. But Homeland Security funding will be extended only for two weeks, and that'll allow lawmakers to negotiate some guardrails for federal immigration enforcement. Senate Republicans and Democrats are on board, and President Trump tonight posted that he is, too.CHANG: OK, so there is a deal, but, Sam, that usually means a shutdown is averted. So explain why that is not the case here.GRINGLAS: The deadline to do all of this is at midnight tomorrow, but the House has to sign off again once the Senate completes its work because they sent all the spending bills over to the Senate tied together, and so the House has to approve this plan, too. The problem is that the House is on recess until Monday, and it's not clear if they could come back any earlier. So funding to all the agencies in the middle of this is going to stop, at least for a little bit.CHANG: At least for a little bit. That's where we are. OK, so do we know what the actual impact of even a very short shutdown would be?GRINGLAS: So you know how I mentioned that a handful of spending bills were already done? That means, for example, the Department of Agriculture is funded, and so food aid won't be affected this time around. But at stake right now are still some really key agencies like the Pentagon and Health and Human Services. Though if the shutdown is short, it is less likely that we're going to see, you know, federal workers missing paychecks like we did last time.CHANG: Absolutely. OK, explain more about, like, why did Republicans come around to a deal, and why were Democrats willing to risk a shutdown?GRINGLAS: You know, just a week ago, Congress was on track to easily approve all these final spending bills. But the second deadly shooting in Minneapolis by federal immigration officers really upended that. You know, Democrats, who still had heartburn from the shutdown last time over health subsidies in the fall, including those who voted with Republicans to end it, now said that they would be willing to withhold their support for the funding without these policy changes to immigration enforcement. Democrats think the public is on their side here and that the issue has captured their attention, you know, even more than that health debate did last fall.CHANG: Yeah.GRINGLAS: And, you know, more Republicans have also acknowledged that what was unfolding in Minneapolis just couldn't be ignored and saw their party losing ground on an issue that they felt like they used to really own.CHANG: OK, so once the House approves this plan, that leaves - what? - just two weeks before Homeland Security funding runs out again.GRINGLAS: Yep.CHANG: Am I right?GRINGLAS: Yep, yep. So lawmakers will have this very short window then to agree on some, you know, knotty policy questions like should the law expressly require immigration agents have judicial warrants? Should officers be required to wear body cameras? And how should incidents be investigated, and how should officers be held accountable? So a lot to wrap up in just two weeks.CHANG: Yeah. That is NPR's Sam Gringlas. Thank you so much, Sam.GRINGLAS: Thanks, Ailsa.(SOUNDBITE OF DELUSIONALPATH AND RETROCANON'S \"V12 (432HZ)\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Scott Applewhite/AP\n    \n\n   \n   With the government on the brink of a partial shutdown, the Senate is scrambling to keep funding flowing and address bipartisan distress over President Trump's immigration enforcement tactics.   But even with an agreement to fund the government, a short-term partial shutdown appears all but inevitable. The Senate still needs to vote on a plan announced by Senate Democrats, and then the House, which is in recess until Monday, needs to sign off, too.   The agreement reached Thursday night and endorsed by Trump will fund much of the government through the end of September and temporarily fund the Department of Homeland Security for two weeks while lawmakers negotiate provisions to rein in federal immigration agents.   \n   Just a week ago, Congress was on track to approve nearly $1.3 trillion in spending for defense, health, transportation, housing and more before government funding expires at midnight.   But the second deadly shooting of a U.S. citizen in Minneapolis by federal immigration officers on Saturday upended those plans, as Democrats pledged to withhold support for the funding package without policy changes on immigration enforcement.   And unlike the shutdown standoff last fall over expiring health insurance subsidies, more Republicans acknowledged that what was unfolding in Minneapolis was an inflection point that could not be ignored.   Democrats are demanding changes to how immigration officers carry out arrests and incidents are investigated, as well as mandating the use of body cameras and other reforms.   Some of the recommendations could attract Republican support. But there is still an arduous road ahead for any of them becoming law.   Why some Republicans are alarmed   In an era when congressional Republicans rarely criticize the Trump administration, the killing of 37-year-old Alex Pretti in Minneapolis sparked unease from unexpected corners of the caucus.   \"Initial rushes to judgment did not meet the standard that Americans should expect from their government officials,\" Sen. Ted Budd, R-N.C., wrote on social media, referring to remarks by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and others who had swiftly labeled Pretti a \"domestic terrorist.\"   \n   \"Enforcing our immigration laws makes our streets safer. It also protects our national security,\" Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., wrote in a statement the day after the shooting. \"But we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble.\"   Several Republicans called for hearings and an independent investigation; DHS leaders are expected to testify in back-to-back oversight hearings next month and Noem is now due to testify in March. Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., more frequent Trump critics, have called for her resignation.   Tillis told reporters that the images coming out of Minneapolis were souring the public on the Trump administration's handling of immigration more broadly.   \"It is regrettable that the issue that Republicans always lead on, we're losing on,\" Tillis told NPR.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen.

Katie Britt, R-Ala., an appropriations committee member.   But divides continue to persist within the Republican Party.   \"We're not going to keep ICE from doing their job,\" said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla. \"The American people wanted the president to enforce law and order and ICE is doing their job.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen.

James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican who sits on the homeland security committee, said he did not see a need for any further policy changes. He noted that the current DHS funding bill awaiting a vote already includes additional funding for body cameras and oversight.   \"I don't see one that's needed above and beyond what's already there,\" Lankford said.   What Democrats want: judicial warrants, masks off and cameras on   Democrats secured a handful of wins in the current version of the spending bill, such as reducing funding for immigration enforcement and reducing capacity at detention centers. But in the wake of Pretti's death, they say further reforms are needed.   \n   Senate Democrats have outlined three buckets of policy changes they are pursuing.   Democrats want rules around the kinds of warrants immigration officers can use to enter homes and an end to so-called \"roving patrols\" when officers conduct broad searches and stops of people they suspect of being in the country illegally.   An ICE memo unveiled in a whistleblower complaint first reported by the Associated Press last week detailed how Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were using administrative warrants as opposed to judicial warrants, which are signed by a judge.   These administrative warrants, according to the whistleblower report, are signed by immigration agents and deportation officers.   In a letter to DHS, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said these kinds of warrants are an unlawful method of entering private residences. Administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance, have defended the approach as lawful, saying administrative warrants are still warrants.   The broad authority DHS is using has alarmed some Republicans.   \"I am not a big fan of administrative warrants. I think warrants to enter someone's house should be Fourth Amendment warrants,\" said Senate Homeland Security Committee Chair Rand Paul, R-Ky.   Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, had called for an end to the large-scale operation in her state, which resulted in the arrest of over 100 people in what ICE dubbed, \"Operation Catch of the Day.\"   \"I have been urging Secretary Noem and others in the Administration to get ICE to reconsider its approach to immigration enforcement in the state,\" Collins said in a statement, writing that she had spoken to Noem and the operation there was no longer ongoing.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem speaks during a news conference following the death of Alex Pretti. Noem and other administration officials have faced criticism, including from some Republicans, for accusing Pretti of domestic terrorism.\n                \n                    Al Drago/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Al Drago/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   But Democrats want guardrails to prevent similar \"roving\" operations in other places.   Democrats want to make it easier to pursue legal action against immigration officers and \"independent investigations\" into ICE and other federal enforcement misconduct.   Democrats have previously raised questions about the efficacy of DHS oversight mechanisms to investigate employee misconduct and critics have pointed out that the department, which houses ICE, is investigating itself in the most recent deadly incidents.   \n   In the aftermath of the shooting of Renee Macklin Good, the 37-year-old killed by an ICE officer earlier this month, the Federal Bureau of Investigations and ICE announced they would run parallel investigations and not conduct a joint investigation with state officials.   The move prompted backlash from local officials, like Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who argue that the investigation may not be fair since agency leaders were already defending the officers' conduct.   Democrats want to mandate that agents display clearer identification, not cover their faces and wear body cameras.   DHS leaders have defended the use of masks arguing that there is an increased threat of doxxing and physical threats to identified agents and their families.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A member of the U.S. Border Patrol confronts the driver of a vehicle that was following them on Jan. 29, in Minneapolis. Democrats want immigration officers to not cover their faces and wear body cameras, among other changes.\n                \n                    Stephen Maturen/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Stephen Maturen/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Body camera requirements have also come into focus after the two shootings in Minneapolis. DHS has long said it does not have enough body cameras for every single agent.   To address concerns about the lack of body cameras, the current version of the DHS spending bill, which has already passed the House, includes $20 million for cameras for ICE and Customs and Border Protection. But the bill only mandates the money be spent — it does not mandate the use of the cameras.   \"Funding them without wearing them means nothing,\" Blumenthal told NPR.   Why Democrats feel emboldened    After a record 43-day shutdown last fall, many Democrats were weary of even a short funding lapse.   But that environment changed this week. Even five of six Democrats who broke with their party to end the last stalemate now said the risk of another shutdown was something they were willing to take on.   \"ICE is out of control, Donald Trump is out of control,\" said one of those Democrats, Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada. \"Our Constitution, not a suggestion, our Bill of Rights, not a suggestion.\"   \"I think if we're fighting for these reforms, we're exactly where the American people want us to be,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who early on urged his colleagues to oppose homeland security funding.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Healthcare workers attend a vigil for VA nurse Alex Pretti at VA NY Harbor Healthcare System Thursday in New York City.\n                \n                    Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Drew Hammill, who worked for former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who as the House minority leader helped direct Democrats' strategy during the 2018-2019 shutdown over border wall funding, said the debate over ICE tactics cuts much closer to home for most Americans.   \n   \"From a debate about a distant wall to your own neighborhood, your own backyard, the safety of your community — that's a different scenario,\" Hammill said. \"Voters want and expect a fight. And I think this is one of the few opportunities with a lawless president to have any impact.\"   Republican Capitol Hill veteran Antonia Ferrier says her old boss, former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, used to describe shutdown standoffs as box canyons — narrow gorges with no exit on the other end. \"You're making demands and there is no way out,\" Ferrier said.   But she says Democrats may feel emboldened because this moment is spurring anger and passion on both sides of the aisle that strikes at something more fundamental about the direction of the country in a way that the health subsidies debate did not.   \"What I think we're seeing right now is markedly different,\" she said. \"It was a very significant inflection point, and I think now there is just so much attention and outrage that many Republicans agree there has to be some kind of changes made.\"\n",

As she oversees the network's parent agency, critics say her comments violated the spirit and perhaps even the letter of federal law that seeks to safeguard Voice of America's editorial independence.\n                \n                    Voice of America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Voice of America\n    \n\n   \n   Kari Lake, who oversees the parent agency of the Voice of America, has hit legal and political roadblocks in her drive to dismantle the government-funded broadcaster.   She has instead accelerated her use of the U.S. government-owned network to promote President Trump and his views — in possible violation of federal law and policies.   To mark the completion of Trump's first year in office last week, Lake was interviewed on Voice of America's Persian-language service through an interpreter. During the five-minute segment, she praised Trump repeatedly.   Lake lauded Trump's actions toward Iran, called him \"the president of peace\" and reiterated Trump's tenuous claims he had ended eight wars and conflicts.   \n   Lake said Trump was \"putting out fires\" throughout the world with a policy of \"peace through strength.\" She also castigated judges who ruled against Trump and the administration, citing an \"out-of-control judiciary,\" and she trashed former President Joe Biden's record, which she termed \"horrific.\" NPR reviewed her original remarks in English and the interpretation offered to viewers in Iran, the service's target audience.   \"VOA is telling the story of the brave Iranian people and their fight for freedom,\" Lake says in a written comment to NPR. \"That story cannot be told without sharing statements from President Trump or the support the Iranian people have for him.\"   The segment, part of a glowing one-hour special on Trump's first year back in the White House, was also broadcast on Voice of America's Chinese language service, in which her remarks could be heard in English.   Lake is a familiar pro-Trump guest on such conservative news outlets as Fox, Newsmax and OANN, where she shares baseless claims of election fraud and comments on topics like immigration and Venezuela. None of them have any direct link to her federal job.   Given Lake's role overseeing the parent agency of Voice of America, her appearance last week was a sharp departure for the network.   \n   In separate interviews, 11 current and former Voice of America journalists and officials at its federal parent, the U.S. Agency for Global Media, said they could not recall anything like it. Most spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing professional retribution, given ongoing links to the agency, its broadcasters or the federal government.   By law, the chief executive of the U.S. Agency for Global Media is required to respect what is often called a firewall, designed to shield editorial staffers and their news decisions from politics. Since late July, Lake has periodically fashioned herself as the agency chief, though she is currently signing her official emails as deputy CEO.   Critics say her recent appearance on Voice of America tramples on that firewall.   \"These are precisely the reasons why you would have a charter and why you would have to adhere to the highest principles of journalistic ethics — to avoid these kinds of situations,\" says David Kligerman, the former general counsel of the U.S. Agency for Global Media under both Trump and Biden.   During Trump's first term, Voice of America host Greta Van Susteren interviewed then-Vice President Mike Pence and twice interviewed President Trump during foreign trips, all in 2018. No one objected: Trump and Pence were powerful public officials. The interviews were newsworthy.   Veterans of the agency and Voice of America tell NPR that having their boss on the air in a partisan role is different.   \"It seems to contradict the spirit and the sense of the firewall,\" says Rick Stengel, the former top editor of Time magazine, who sat on the agency's governing board while serving in the U.S. State Department during the Obama administration.   \"Listening to Kari Lake, she sounded more like a press secretary for the president than the head of an independent news service,\" Stengel says. \"We never wanted it to sound like a state broadcaster in an authoritarian country that would air hagiographic biographies of the Dear Leader.\"   \n   After losing elections, Lake rises at broadcast agency   Lake is a former local TV news anchor turned unsuccessful MAGA candidate in Arizona, where she ran for both governor and U.S. Senate and lost. Early last year, Trump installed her atop the U.S. Agency for Global Media. But Lake's ability to lead the agency is being challenged in court.   Before taking office, Trump announced he wanted to name Lake to be the director of the Voice of America.   According to two journalists at the network with knowledge, Voice of America editors were nervous enough about her arrival that they half-jokingly discussed offering Lake her own show in hopes of saving the network from evisceration or being turned into a pro-Trump propaganda channel. (Those people spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.)   Yet Trump does not have the legal authority to appoint the agency's chief executive. That power rests with a bipartisan oversight board whose members are confirmed by the U.S. Senate, under laws designed to insulate the network from political interference.   Upon entering the White House, Trump dismissed the board members. That meant there was no legal way for him to install Lake or anyone else atop Voice of America.   Instead, last March, Trump issued an executive order that the agency be reduced to the bare minimum required by law. He named Lake as senior advisor to the U.S. Agency for Global Media. She testified that she held all but five percent of the power the agency's CEO would normally wield.   \n   Lake moved swiftly to lay off 85% of the workforce in response to Trump's executive order. Those staffers have been whipsawed by a series of court rulings that reinstated their jobs, followed by fresh rounds of layoffs.   Last July, the White House named Lake deputy CEO at her own urging, according to her testimony in court.   Lake said in a sworn affidavit that she became acting CEO in late July, though the White House made no formal announcement of it.   Trump has not nominated her to be CEO, which would require confirmation from the U.S. Senate. As NPR has reported, under the law it's not clear she is eligible to hold the position of acting CEO, either.   \n   Neither the U.S. Agency for Global Media nor the White House has responded to NPR's numerous requests for documentation of her appointment as acting CEO. Nor has Lake, for that matter.   \n   U.S. District Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth, who is presiding over a series of cases challenging her actions at the agency, has questioned Lake's honesty and the validity of the administration's legal defenses. He has ordered her to bring back enough employees to meet the expectations set by Congress when it put money aside for the agency. He has not yet ruled on the legality of Lake's authority.   Compelled to bring back some VOA journalists, Lake has emphasized the Persian-language service   In recalling some journalists to work, Lake has put a special emphasis on the Persian-language service, given the current upheaval and crackdown in Iran.   Lake's choice to run that service is a veteran former Voice of America journalist, Ali Javanmardi, who left the network in 2019, according to current and former colleagues. Javanmardi also has praised Trump on the air: \"Perhaps for the first time,\" Javanmardi told viewers this month, \"the leader of the free world is standing alongside the people of Iran.\" His X (formerly Twitter) feed and his LinkedIn profile display in the background a photograph of a bloodied but undaunted Trump just after the unsuccessful assassination attempt on his life in Butler, Pa.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The LinkedIn profile for Ali Javanmardi, who is overseeing the Voice of America's Persian-language service, features a photograph of President Trump moments after the unsuccessful assassination attempt in Butler, Pa. Under Javanmardi's leadership, the service has promoted Trump and kept his critics off the air.\n                \n                    AliJavanmardi's LinkedIn account/LinkedIn\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        AliJavanmardi's LinkedIn account/LinkedIn\n    \n\n   \n   Javanmardi has urged editors and producers not to book guests who may be critical of Trump, according to colleagues who spoke on condition they not be named. (They cited fears of workplace retaliation.)   NPR has also reviewed a text from a Voice of America journalist who said the Persian-language service canceled an appearance by a former Trump foreign policy adviser, Elliot Abrams, because he had been critical of the president on Iran. (Abrams did not respond to an email seeking comment.)   \n   In another instance, a journalist for Voice of America Persian told a foreign policy commentator that the network's management could not allow any critique of the president. The commentator declined to appear on air, the text exchange shows.   During the hour-long special on which Lake appeared, Voice of America Persian host Payam Yazdian offered effusive praise of Trump's return to the White House. Yazdian called Trump's first year back \"the start of an exciting period of national success, and the return of global respectability.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Voice of America Persian anchor Payam Yazdian presented a one-hour program last week that presented a glowing assessment of President Trump's first year in office for viewers in Iran. Kari Lake, who is running the network's federal parent agency, repeatedly praised the president in her appearance on the show.\n                \n                    Voice of America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Voice of America\n    \n\n   \n   Additionally, Javanmardi has discouraged coverage of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's last shah, according to two journalists with knowledge of events who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing concerns of professional reprisals.   Pahlavi has become a rallying point for some of those opposed to the current regime, even as the repressive record of Pahlavi's father repels many Iranians and Iranian-Americans.   \"Ignoring or sidelining [Pahlavi] is not neutrality, it's an editorial failure,\" wrote former BBC journalist Ali Hamedani, who runs his own Persian-language radio service in London.   Javanmardi blames the Iranian government for online criticism of his work.   \"In my new job at VOA, my primary mission is to ensure it aligns with the US foreign policy and conveys @POTUS's support for the people of Iran,\" he wrote in a social media post on Jan. 18.   Lake is backing him up.   \"We are not in the business of selecting Iran's political leadership. That would be irresponsible of any outside news organization,\" she writes in the statement to NPR. \"That decision belongs solely to Iran's 93 million citizens, who have a right to self-determination.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Iranians gather while blocking a street during a protest in Tehran, Iran on Jan. 9. The nationwide protests against failing government economic policies started in Tehran's Grand Bazaar in late December. The demonstrations spread to universities and other cities.\n                \n                    MAHSA/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        MAHSA/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Like Lake, Javanmardi's legal authority to direct news coverage appears shaky.   He has been described on the network's airwaves as a senior adviser overseeing Voice of America's Persian, Kurdish and Afghan television services.   According to three colleagues who spoke on condition of anonymity, however, Javanmardi works for the U.S Agency for Global Media, not Voice of America. His email address has a USAGM domain. (The colleagues spoke on condition of anonymity, citing fears of retribution.)   \n   As an employee of the parent agency, his involvement in news decisions could run afoul of the same firewall that critics say Lake ignored by appearing on Voice of America.   Javanmardi and USAGM did not respond to NPR's requests for comment or questions about his job or title.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Kari Lake, who at the time was running for one of Arizona's U.S. Senate seats, spoke at the Road to Majority conference in Washington, D.C. on June 21, 2024.  The conference host, Faith and Freedom Coalition, advocates for incorporation of Christianity in American government.\n                \n                    ALLISON BAILEY/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty/AFP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        ALLISON BAILEY/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty/AFP\n    \n\n   \n   Largely ignored by Lake, Congress moves to sustain international networks   In a rebuke of the Trump administration, House and Senate lawmakers have drafted spending bills that include $643 million for the U.S. Agency for Global Media for fiscal year 2026.  The House passed its version of the legislation earlier this month.   While that amount is far less than what Congress allocated in the past, it is four times what the Trump administration had requested for the agency, funds that Lake intended to use to shut it down.    The lawmakers also set aside money for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. It has operated on a shoestring since Lake sought to cut off its funds. Like Voice of America Persian, its Persian-language service, called Radio Farda, is aimed at audiences inside Iran.   When authorities severed access to the Internet, the network's executives appealed to the U.S. Agency for Global Media to use their shortwave and mediumwave radio transmitters in Kuwait and elsewhere.    Lake has repeatedly condemned Radio Free Europe for broadcasting into Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has cracked down on the independent press. In June, when the U.S. bombed Iran and the Iranian regime blocked web access, she did not allow Radio Farda access to the transmitters.   In a posting on Facebook on Jan. 13, Lake said she and Radio Free Europe CEO Steve Capus agreed \"we need to have a unified message so we are not sending mixed messages to the people of Iran.\" But she said Capus has not fulfilled his side of the bargain. (Capus and Radio Free Europe did not comment for this story.)   \n   Radio Farda still has not been allowed to use the transmitters.   Her refusal has frustrated some influential lawmakers.   \"It's been a week since the regime in Tehran blacked out the internet, and 10 months since USAGM blacked out its transmitters for Persian-language @RadioFarda_ from @RFERL,\" Republican Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky tweeted on Jan 15. \"What a waste of America's tremendous capacity to share the truth.\"   On a conservative commercial talk radio show last week, Lake called Radio Farda \"a propaganda site run by Radio Free Europe.\"   NPR's Ayda Pourasad and D. Parvaz contributed to this story.\n",

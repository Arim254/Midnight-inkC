On Tuesday, 18 Democratic governors also announced they would boycott a traditional dinner at the White House.   \"If the reports are true that not all governors are invited to these events, which have historically been productive and bipartisan opportunities for collaboration, we will not be attending the White House dinner this year,\" the Democrats wrote. \"Democratic governors remain united and will never stop fighting to protect and make life better for people in our states.\"   \n   Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican who chairs the NGA, told fellow governors in a letter on Monday that the White House intended to limit invitations to the association's annual business meeting, scheduled for Feb. 20, to Republican governors only.   \"Because NGA's mission is to represent all 55 governors, the Association is no longer serving as the facilitator for that event, and it is no longer included in our official program,\" Stitt wrote in the letter, which was obtained by The Associated Press.   The governors' group, which is scheduled to meet from Feb. 19-21, is one of the few remaining venues where political leaders from both major parties gather to discuss the top issues facing their communities. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday that Trump has \"discretion to invite anyone he wants to the White House.\"   \"It's the people's house,\" she said. \"It's also the president's home, so he can invite whomever he wants to dinners and events here at the White House.\"   Representatives for Sitt and the NGA didn't comment on the letter. Brandon Tatum, the NGA's CEO, said in a statement last week that the White House meeting is an \"important tradition\" and said the organization was \"disappointed in the administration's decision to make it a partisan occasion this year.\"   \n   In his letter to other governors, Stitt encouraged the group to unite around common goals.   \"We cannot allow one divisive action to achieve its goal of dividing us,\" he wrote. \"The solution is not to respond in kind, but to rise above and to remain focused on our shared duty to the people we serve. America's governors have always been models of pragmatic leadership, and that example is most important when Washington grows distracted by politics.\"   Signs of partisan tensions emerged at the White House meeting last year, when Trump and Maine's Gov. Janet Mills traded barbs.   \n   Trump singled out the Democratic governor over his push to bar transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women's sports, threatening to withhold federal funding from the state if she did not comply. Mills responded, \"We'll see you in court.\"   Trump then predicted that Mills' political career would be over for opposing the order. She is now running for U.S. Senate.   The back-and-forth had a lasting impact on last year's conference and some Democratic governors did not renew their dues last year to the bipartisan group.\n",

Johnson was charged in Florida after receiving a full pardon from President Donald Trump for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n                \n                    Hernando County Sheriff's Office\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Hernando County Sheriff's Office\n    \n\n   \n   A Florida handyman who received a pardon from President Trump for storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, has been convicted of multiple state charges of child molestation and exposing himself to children, prosecutors told NPR. Andrew Paul Johnson, the pardoned rioter, attempted to bribe one victim with money he claimed he would receive as part of restitution for Jan. 6 defendants, police reported. The conviction is the latest case of a pardoned Capitol rioter committing new crimes after receiving a pardon.   On Tuesday, a jury in Hernando County, Fla., found Andrew Paul Johnson guilty of five charges, including molesting a child under 12 and another under 16, as well as lewd and lascivious exhibition. Johnson was acquitted of one charge of sending sexual material to a child.   \n   William Forgie, the chief assistant state attorney for the fifth judicial circuit in Florida, told NPR in an email that Johnson \"faces up to life in prison\" when he is sentenced in March. An attorney for Johnson did not respond to a phone message seeking comment.   \n   A police report from the Hernando County Sheriff's Office filed as part of Johnson's Florida case describes a pattern of abuse — including both physical sexual abuse and exposing his genitalia to children — that took place \"over a many-month span.\" One of Johnson's victims was 11 years old at the time of the abuse.   Johnson also attempted to keep one victim quiet by claiming he would receive $10 million from the Trump administration as restitution for former Jan. 6 defendants and would share the money with the victim in his will, according to the police report. Convicted rioters and their supporters have advocated for financial reparations since Trump returned to office, though it's unclear if the administration will take that step.   In 2024, Andrew Paul Johnson pleaded guilty to nonviolent charges for entering the U.S. Capitol through a broken window during the Jan. 6 riot and then cursing at police officers trying to clear the area. Prosecutors said Johnson described himself on social media as an \"American Terrorist\" and \"Proud J6er,\" and that he violated court orders by posing with a gun while his case was ongoing.   \n   Chief Judge James Boasberg sentenced Johnson to one year in prison, in part due to Johnson's lengthy criminal history, including drug possession, driving under the influence and resisting arrest.   \n   Trump has described the more than 1,500 people charged for their roles in the Jan. 6 attack as \"patriots,\" and argued that they were treated unfairly by the justice system. \"These were peaceful people, these were great people,\" Trump said in 2021.   Just months after Johnson received his prison sentence, Trump pardoned him along with virtually every other Jan. 6 defendant.   The White House has not answered NPR's questions about whether the administration intends to provide compensation to people charged for their roles in the attack on the U.S. Capitol, though some Trump administration officials have promoted the idea in the past.   Johnson is one of several former Jan. 6 defendants who have faced additional legal trouble after receiving pardons from Trump. New charges filed against former defendants have included possession of child sexual abuse material and breaking and entering.   \n   Last week, Christopher Moynihan pleaded guilty in New York state court to a misdemeanor charge of harassment after he was accused of threatening to kill Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the top Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives. \"I cannot allow this terrorist to live,\" Moynihan allegedly wrote in a text message. \"I will kill him for the future.\"   The White House did not respond to NPR's request for comment.\n",

The National Governors Association meets in Washington, D.C., every year with this year's meeting scheduled for next week. The traditionally bipartisan event is an opportunity for governors to meet with the president and discuss issues affecting their constituents. It's usually followed by a formal dinner. This year, the Trump Administration only invited Republicans to the meeting and disinvited some Democratic governors from the formal dinner scheduled to follow.   \n   Maryland Governor Wes Moore is one of the two disinvited governors. Moore said the decision sent the same message as the president's recent refusal to apologize for posting a racist meme of the Obamas.   \"This message of disrespect — of his own personal feelings of supremacy — I think, are things that are just deeply unneeded reminders of just how unstable his leadership continues to be,\" Moore said.   White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt addressed the exclusions at a press briefing on Tuesday.   \"It's the people's house,\" Leavitt said. \"It's also the president's home. And so he can invite whomever he wants to dinners and events here at the White House.\"   \n   Democratic leaders who were invited to the dinner have said they will skip the dinner. The National Governors Association said it won't \"facilitate\" events that don't include all governors, including next week's dinner.   Moore discussed the dinner and his state's redistricting with NPR's Michel Martin. This interview occurred before other Democratic leaders said they would skip the dinner and before Leavitt's press briefing.

Mike Quigley of Illinois about DHS funding and ICE reforms ahead of Friday's deadline to avert a partial government shutdown.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Democratic Congressman Mike Quigley of Illinois is part of this discussion. After the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, Quigley changed his mind about ICE, saying it could not be reformed and must be dismantled. Congressman, good morning.MIKE QUIGLEY: Good morning. Thanks for having me back.INSKEEP: What do you mean by dismantled? Are you in favor of abolishing ICE, as some people say?QUIGLEY: Look, I voted no on DHS funding for this, and I'll vote no again. Reforms are no longer enough to course-correct here. We have to dismantle ICE and start over, rebuilding an immigration enforcement agency from the ground up. We need people keeping the border secure, making sure drugs and people aren't tracked into the country and removing the worst of the worst criminals. But they're not doing that. We've seen the horrors and the terror of what they're doing. So I don't trust this agency. I think you dismantle them and you start anew with the original mission of the agency in place.INSKEEP: It seems likely that's not going to happen in this negotiation, so let's talk about the situation now. We just heard that Republicans seem to be on board with body cameras. There is some support for limiting these roving patrols. What else do you think is realistic to get out of this negotiation?QUIGLEY: You know, I think they shouldn't wear masks because what we've seen here is that there's no accountability when they're not mearing wasks (ph). But we've also seen police across the country wear ID, whether it's some sort of QR code. If they're worried about them being doxed, a QR code - you know, the agency and people will know who those are and not the general public. I mean, maybe that's a compromise. But look, there's just too much at stake here - protecting sensitive locations, stopping racial profiling. And then, again, we're not asking ICE to do anything that we don't ask of every police force in the country. They have to uphold the use-of-force standards. There should be some coordination with state and local officials. So that's not a lot to ask. That's all we've asked Chicago Police Department and every police department in the country.INSKEEP: I had not heard this idea previously that you're discussing about QR codes. I want to make sure I understand this. The idea is, instead of their name on the uniform, the agent has a QR code, and people who are standing around monitoring this with their phones can scan the QR code with the phone. And maybe they don't learn the agent's name, but they're able to report this specific person did this specific thing, and someone can investigate later. Is that what you mean to say?QUIGLEY: Look, you asked what the fallback might be. I don't think they should wear a mask. But I'm just saying this is how unreasonable they are. If there's some sort of QR code where the agency knows who they are and if something bad happens, as it's had happen all too often here, there is at least some way that we can find out who's responsible and someone can be held accountable. That's, at least, some way. I'm not suggesting that's the ideal. I'm suggesting - to answer the question, is there a way to compromise on this? Frankly, we're way past that. At this point in time, we've got to take this agency down and start anew with an agency who gets its mission and doesn't exceed it on a daily basis.INSKEEP: Sounds like you're going to be a no vote regardless on this DHS funding, but you're surrounded by other Democrats and Republicans. And in conversations, is it your sense that the deadline is going to be missed, that it is likely that DHS, the other parts of DHS, will shut down for a while?QUIGLEY: Yeah. I don't see any middle ground popping up right now. You know, when the president of the United States talks about, well, we've got to fund FEMA, and you have to be voting for this or you vote against FEMA, just a few months ago, he was talking about dismantling FEMA. Seems to forget that much of the reason that we need FEMA is his total disregard for climate change and the extreme weather events that we're experiencing. So the president's hypocrisy is showing here. I don't want to shut down any level of government. The irony is ICE has been so dramatically funded, you know, they won't be hurting in a shutdown. Their budget was tripled. And when they talk, again, about a lack of body...INSKEEP: Yeah.QUIGLEY: ...Cameras, they've got all the money in the world to buy what they need.INSKEEP: OK. Congressman Mike Quigley of Illinois. Thanks very much for your insights. Really appreciate it.QUIGLEY: Thank you. Take care.INSKEEP: Have a good morning.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

The American people can feel that our economy is leaving us behind. The American people also feel like our traditional politicians' response feels anemic — feels like we're not actually being heard.\"   Mejia concluded that the conversations she had with voters felt \"live\" for people, who want to hold elected officials accountable.

    "body": "\n      A contentious House hearing with senior immigration leaders did little to bring lawmakers closer on a deal to fund the Department of Homeland Security.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  The Department of Homeland Security faces a possible shutdown this weekend. Bipartisan talks have stalled over limiting President Trump's immigration enforcement agenda.STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  And in a few minutes, we will hear from one of the Democrats involved in the negotiations, Representative Mike Quigley. First, we have some sounds from Capitol Hill. Lawmakers in the House called up to the people leading the president's immigration agenda yesterday, and here are the facts.MARTIN: NPR's immigration policy correspondent Ximena Bustillo has been tracking all this, and she's with us now. Good morning, Ximena.XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Good morning.MARTIN: So tell us - who did we hear from, and what did they say?BUSTILLO: Officials from the three immigration agencies were on tap, all wanted to talk about how they were implementing President Trump's agenda, so that's reducing the number of people crossing at the southern border, increasing arrests and deportations and bringing more scrutiny to legal immigration. Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting director Todd Lyons faced most of the questions, even though his agency is not the only one conducting immigration law enforcement. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow faced the fewest questions, even though his agency has leaned into policing tactics and reviewing the status of more immigrants.MARTIN: That's interesting. OK, so Democrats have been demanding that agents be equipped with body cameras, for agents to identify themselves and to use judicial warrants when they go into people's homes. Those are some of the demands, but those seem to be the main ones. Did those come up yesterday?BUSTILLO: Yeah. Republicans asked about body camera availability, and Lyons said that ICE only has 3,000 cameras for 13,000 officers, and Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Rodney Scott noted that only half of 20,000 CBP officers have body cameras and not enough people to fully implement them. Here is Scott's plea to Congress.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RODNEY SCOTT: So fund the entire program so that we can be transparent and that we can make sure America knows what we're doing because that trust is critically important.BUSTILLO: Lyons promised to release body cam footage of enforcement in Minneapolis as well. But Lyons also said that he would not ask his officers to remove their face coverings. Both Scott and Lyons said that that could result in doxing for their officers. Republicans generally are still opposed to mandating that officers remove their face masks.MARTIN: OK, so the two sides, the Republicans and Democrats, do seem to agree about body cameras, at least the importance of body cameras. So were there any other areas where the two parties seem to be on the same page about what has been happening and what should happen next?BUSTILLO: Both Democrats and Republicans suggested ICE may have gone too far in recent actions. For example, one Republican, Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, said he believed, quote, \"roving patrols\" should be done at the border rather than in major cities of the United States. Ending these, quote, \"roving patrols\" is something Democrats also want. McCaul also applauded the leadership changes in Minneapolis, which removed border patrol commander Greg Bovino and sent in White House Border Czar Tom Homan to lead on-the-ground operations there. McCaul said this was, quote, \"returning to the original mission of ICE.\"MARTIN: OK. So at least one Republican seems to have some sort of alignment with the Democrats on these issues. So there is this funding deadline on Friday for the Department of Homeland Security. What could happen in the next few days?BUSTILLO: Well, all three are scheduled to be back on Capitol Hill on Thursday to do it all over again but this time before the Senate. I'm going to continue to keep an eye on what Republicans are asking for and how far apart the two parties are in their concerns. But if they can't come to an agreement, parts of DHS may see their funding slow down. Now, this would be particularly things like the Transportation Security Administration or disaster response. Now, border patrol and ICE got that infusion of cash last summer from Congress, so they can continue to dip into that and work and get paid, even if there is a shutdown to the agency.MARTIN: That is NPR's immigration policy correspondent Ximena Bustillo. Ximena, thank you.BUSTILLO: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

In a blistering opening statement, ranking member Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., criticized the DOJ's handling of the Epstein files and the agency's treatment of survivors, highlighting that several were present in the hearing room. Raskin and Democrats on the panel have called for increased transparency, highlighting examples where they say redacted information in the documents benefits powerful individuals who may be implicated in Epstein's crimes, instead of omitting information that protects survivors.    \n   \"You're not showing a lot of interest in the victims, Madam Attorney General, whether it's Epstein's human trafficking ring or the homicidal governmental violence against citizens in Minneapolis,\" Raskin said, in reference to the two fatal shootings of U.S. citizens by immigration officers in the city last month. \"You're siding with the perpetrators, and you're ignoring the victims,\" he added. \"That will be your legacy unless you act quickly to change course.\"   Throughout the hearing, Bondi, a former Florida attorney general, defended the DOJ's handling of the files, touting the release of millions of documents. In her opening statement, she vowed to continue fighting for survivors, saying she was \"deeply sorry for what any victim, any victim, has been through, especially as a result of that monster.\"    But in response to Democrats' questions about the DOJ's handling of the Epstein investigation, Bondi repeatedly pushed back — sometimes with personal attacks directed at lawmakers.   When asked by Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., to apologize to survivors for the agency's \"absolutely unacceptable release of the Epstein files and their information,\" Bondi retorted: \"I'm not going to get in the gutter for her theatrics.\"   \n   Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., was one of the few Republicans to press Bondi on Epstein.    Massie has largely broken with his party for months in criticizing the administration on the issue. During the hearing, he demanded accountability from the DOJ for sharing survivor information and accused officials of \"over-redacting\" potentially incriminating information.    Bondi responded by calling Massie a \"failed politician\" with \"Trump derangement syndrome,\" and asked whether the congressman demanded the same level of transparency from former Attorney General Merrick Garland during the Biden administration. Massie went on to reject that argument.   \n   \"This cover-up spans decades, and you are responsible for this portion of it,\" he said.   Political divides on weaponization   The attorney general's appearance before the committee comes one year into her tenure atop the Justice Department, a tumultuous period marked by a striking departure from the traditions and norms that have guided the department for decades.   Since taking the helm, Bondi has overseen the firing of career prosecutors and FBI officials who worked on Capitol riot cases or Trump investigations, investigated and prosecuted prominent opponents of the president, and dropped prosecutions of his allies.   \n   Across the aisle, most GOP lawmakers used their time during the hearing to praise the attorney general's work, emphasizing DOJ efforts to combat violent crime and illegal immigration — issues Bondi has highlighted as major accomplishments during her first year.    \"What a difference a year makes,\" the committee's chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said in his opening remarks. \"The DOJ has returned to its core missions — upholding the rule of law, going after the bad guys and keeping Americans safe.\"   Bondi says she's made \"tremendous progress\" toward ending what she says was the department's weaponization in recent years against Trump and conservatives. Biden-era DOJ officials deny they politicized the department, and they point to the prosecutions of prominent Democratic lawmakers and even President Joe Biden's son Hunter as evidence.   For decades, the Justice Department has enjoyed a degree of independence from the White House, particularly in investigations and prosecutions, to insulate them from partisan politics.   Critics say that under Bondi, independence has disappeared and the DOJ has helped enact Trump's promised campaign of retribution against his perceived enemies, including bringing charges against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.   \n   Both cases have since been tossed by a federal judge. The Justice Department is appealing that decision.   Democrats tried to turn Bondi's claims of weaponization around, accusing the DOJ of carrying out Trump's political agenda.   \"You've turned the people's Department of Justice into Trump's instrument of revenge,\" Raskin said. \"Trump orders up prosecutions like pizza, and you deliver every time.\"   Other perceived opponents of the president or individuals standing in the way of his agenda have also found themselves under DOJ investigation, including Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff and former Obama-era intelligence officials James Clapper and John Brennan.   \n   Most recently, a handful of Democratic lawmakers faced scrutiny from the administration for appearing in a video last fall where they directed members of the military to refuse illegal orders — a decision that Trump called \"treasonous.\"   The administration has since suffered another legal setback in that fight. A grand jury in Washington, D.C., this week rejected an attempt by federal prosecutors to indict the lawmakers on federal charges.\n",

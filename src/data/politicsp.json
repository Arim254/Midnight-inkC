Dan Caine.   In an interview with Morning Edition, Smith said Congressional leaders learned more about how the operation was carried out, but that the bulk of the briefing focused on the long-term strategy for Venezuela.   \"There was a lot of talk about avoiding chaos now that Maduro is gone, vague talk about how the administration is working with the now-president of Venezuela [Delcy] Rodriguez, but not any specifics,\" Smith said.   \n   He added that the economic chaos facing Venezuela \"runs the risk of it turning into armed gangs fighting with each other in a chaotic situation. It certainly doesn't improve the very problems that supposedly taking Maduro was supposed to fix.\"   Speaking to NPR's Leila Fadel, Smith discussed the legality of the operation to remove Maduro from Venezuela and concerns about ongoing U.S. involvement in the South American country.

    "body": "\n      President Trump is set to meet with House Republicans Tuesday. The meeting comes a day after administration officials briefed top lawmakers on the weekend operation in Venezuela.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  The seizure of Venezuela's president raises a question for the American president - whether he should have consulted Congress.LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Yeah. President Trump did not inform Congress before an operation that the White House calls a law enforcement operation. Democrats saw it as an act of war, and Republicans largely have obeyed the president.INSKEEP: Lawmakers from both parties received a briefing after the operation, and NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt was waiting outside. Barbara, good morning.BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve.INSKEEP: OK. So the secretary of state goes in - Marco Rubio - secretary of defense, attorney general, CIA director. They brief top lawmakers. And then what did you hear on the way out?SPRUNT: You know, it really depends on who it was. The partisan divide was on full display. On the one hand, you had Republicans calling it a good meeting, a thorough briefing. They said that the military operation was appropriate from the administration. And then Democrats left the briefing saying that they had more questions than answers. Here's Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. He called the administration's plan for running Venezuela vague and unsatisfying.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHUCK SCHUMER: I did not receive any assurances that we would not try to do the same thing in other countries. When the United States engages in this kind of regime change and so-called nation-building, it always ends up hurting the United States. I left the briefing feeling that it would again.SPRUNT: You know, there are some meetings where members leave and talk to reporters and you learn a ton of new information. This was not that. A lot of people left saying that they're just not sharing these details from the briefing at this point, but that doesn't mean that they're shying away from talking about their concerns. And a really big point of contention is that Congress wasn't notified in advance of the operation.INSKEEP: Well, let's talk that through. And we should be clear - president after president after president has taken more and more power from Congress, and Congress has largely rolled over. This Congress has very notably rolled over and said that it has no role to play again and again and again. But how are lawmakers talking about it in this situation?SPRUNT: Exactly that. I mean, Democrats are concerned about the White House circumventing Congress. They say this is just the latest example of that in a long list of examples. Here's Gregory Meeks, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GREGORY MEEKS: It seems, at every turn, Donald Trump is trying to figure out how he avoids Congress. And unfortunately, Congress allows him to do it.SPRUNT: House Speaker Mike Johnson actually addressed this directly. He said that this operation was not an act of war, it was a legal operation, and that the president has the authority to deploy military forces to address threats to the United States. And as for this claim that Congress is weak? He says, no, not the case.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE JOHNSON: Look, I can tell you - as speaker of the House, as a person who's in charge of defending Article I powers, I'm just going to insist to you that those have not been traversed in any way by what happened here. The president used his authority under the law.INSKEEP: Lawmakers today are going to meet with the president. And it's Republicans meeting him, right?SPRUNT: That's right. And in the past, when the president has joined these types of conference meetings with House Republicans, it becomes almost like a rally. And it's not hard to envision that happening today, given that they're gearing up as a party for the midterm elections. So I expect that Venezuela will be part of the conversation, but not the only topic. There will be a separate all-member briefing on Venezuela tomorrow, and that's where I expect we'll learn more about next steps in the region.INSKEEP: NPR's Barbara Sprunt, thanks so much.SPRUNT: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Steve Inskeep asks Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly about the Trump administration's moves to reduce Kelly's rank over a video urging military members not to follow illegal orders.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Senator Mark Kelly has been listening with us. Senator, welcome back.SEN MARK KELLY: Well, thank you for having me on, Steve.INSKEEP: We were just listening to the words of the secretary of defense - seditious statements, a pattern of reckless misconduct from June to December. Have you been seditious or recklessly guilty of misconduct?KELLY: I have been doing my job, which is oversight of the Department of Defense. I'm a member of the Armed Services Committee, and they should know that. They seem to have a problem with the separation of powers. We are the Article 1 branch of government, the United States Congress, and I have oversight responsibility. And it goes beyond that video, Steve. Even in the letter of censure they sent me yesterday, they talked in detail about other things that I said. They don't like what I'm saying. Because of that, Donald Trump wanted me hanged and now prosecuted, and now we're at the point where they want to reduce me in rank.INSKEEP: You have, of course, more than one identity. You're referring to your identity and role, responsibility as a senator. Do you have some special responsibility as a retired military officer to keep your mouth shut?KELLY: Hey, we have First Amendment constitutional rights in this country to speak out against this government. That also applies to retired members of the U.S. military. I left the military 15 years ago. I served 25 years in the United States Navy. I flew 39 combat missions. I flew into space four times - all wearing the U.S. flag on my uniform. And, you know, I've given so much for this country, and so has my family. I'm fourth generation, you know, service member. You know, can Donald Trump say that? I don't think Pete Hegseth can say that either, you know, by the way. And this is the way they're going to deal with me. And it sends a chilling effect to service members - retired service members especially across the country, but anybody who served in the military and any U.S. citizen - that if you speak out against this president, they're going to come after you.INSKEEP: We heard Hegseth say that he's beginning a formal 45-day process, according to our report there from Quil Lawrence. Does that mean you have some opportunity to defend yourself, to bring in a defense lawyer to introduce evidence? What is the process, so far as you know?KELLY: Well, they haven't told us what the process is, and, you know, this is typical of them. I first heard about this yesterday again via social media. But it's serious, and I'm going to take it seriously, and I'm going to, you know, fight this with everything I have.INSKEEP: I will note that Secretary Hegseth, apparently, in a video that has surfaced from 2016 said similar things. I'll just read Hegseth's quote. His words should stand on their own. Quote, \"If you're doing something that is just completely unlawful and ruthless, then there is a consequence for that. That's why the military said it won't follow unlawful orders from their commander in chief.\" Was Pete Hegseth correct back in 2016?KELLY: He was correct. And isn't this the height of hypocrisy? Pete Hegseth says something in 2016, specifically about Donald Trump. I said something generically about, you must follow the law, the uniform code of military justice. His case, it seems to be fine. My case, the president wanted me hanged, executed, prosecuted, and now they want to demote me.INSKEEP: Let's work back through some of the incidents that you have spoken out about. The most recent being, of course, the seizure of Nicolas Maduro, the president of Venezuela. Quil Lawrence mentioned the drug boats. Of course, your initial statement was in the context of U.S. troops in American cities. Do you believe that U.S. troops, in fact, have been given illegal orders in recent months?KELLY: I had many questions about the attacks on the drug boats and continue to, especially the second, you know, strike on the shipwrecked...INSKEEP: Right.KELLY: ...You know, individuals. And I continue to ask these questions and ask for, you know, more information. Every time we go into a brief with this Department of Defense, we come out with more questions than we had, you know, going in. And I've been very concerned about orders that this president could give. He's talked about executing, killing the family members of terrorists. That means women and children. He's talked about shooting protesters - U.S. citizens - in the legs and sending troops into U.S. cities to train on U.S. citizens.INSKEEP: We've just got a few seconds, but I want to ask specifically about Nicolas Maduro. Should the Delta Force troops just said, nope, not doing it?KELLY: Well, hey, so we - you know, we should not be in the business of regime change. Didn't Donald Trump make that perfectly clear when he was running for president?INSKEEP: But was this illegal, in your view?KELLY: Well, I think we've got to look at the constitutionality of these actions. In the case of Maduro, he's a bad guy, and he should be prosecuted. And now the president's supporting his handpicked successor already and says we run the country. We're not. We're not running the country.INSKEEP: OK. Democratic Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona. It's always a pleasure. Thank you, sir.KELLY: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Tim Walz says he's dropping his bid for a third term. His decision comes amid criticism of his management of fraud investigations highlighted by President Trump,   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Minnesota's Democratic Governor Tim Walz has ended his reelection campaign. The announcement on Monday came as President Trump, members of his administration and his supporters have been playing up and distorting cases of fraud in Minnesota's benefits programs. Walz, of course, was Kamala Harris' vice-presidential running mate, and Trump has mocked him repeatedly. And the controversy over fraud cases is still affecting the national social services network. We're joined now by Minnesota Public Radio's Clay Masters in St. Paul. Good morning, Clay. Thanks for being here.CLAY MASTERS, BYLINE: Yeah, good morning. Good to be here.FADEL: So Walz was going for a third term. Why did he say he was dropping out?MASTERS: He says he wants to spend his final year in office focused on fighting fraud in state programs instead of campaigning.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TIM WALZ: I have every confidence that if I gave it my all, we would win the race. But as I reflect on this moment with my family and my team over the holidays, I came to the conclusion that I can't give a political campaign my all.MASTERS: During his remarks yesterday, Walz defended his administration's response to mounting fraud scandals in state social service programs. He also attacked Republicans for what he called political gamesmanship. In a statement posted later to Truth Social, President Trump said, without any evidence, that Walz was caught red-handed for stealing tens of billions of taxpayer dollars. And I'll note, Leila, there are no fraud allegations against Walz, and this is about money that contractors and providers got from benefit programs.FADEL: So you and your colleagues have been covering legal cases and investigations of benefits fraud in Minnesota for years. What has come out in court, and why is this in the national spotlight now?MASTERS: Right. Federal prosecutors say billions of dollars have been stolen during Walz's time in office. He was first elected in 2018, and more than 90 people here have been charged with felonies and federal fraud cases, and at least 60 have been convicted. In the highest profile case, prosecutors said contractors in a child nutrition program stole some $250 million in taxpayer money. This was in the COVID era. The ringleader is a white woman, and many other defendants are of Somali origin.Recently, President Trump has been just verbally attacking people of Somali backgrounds in Minnesota, accusing them of fraud, calling U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar and her friends garbage and saying he doesn't want them in the U.S. Now, this all comes after the holidays when a viral video of a MAGA-connected influencer is accusing day care centers run by Somali Americans of fraud without evidence. In the video, they can be seen knocking on day care center doors in Minneapolis and demanding to see the children.FADEL: Yeah. So really scapegoating the entire Somali community in Minnesota over accusations or crimes of a few.MASTERS: Right.FADEL: And now there are national implications in this state and beyond, right?MASTERS: Yeah. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said last week it's freezing some federal funding meant to help many low-income families across the country pay for child care. And Republicans in Ohio, also with a sizable Somali American population, called for an audit into programs there. And yesterday, the governor there, Mike DeWine, a Republican, defended his state's programs. Republican Governor Greg Abbott ordered a probe of programs in Texas yesterday. Here in Minnesota, the administration has been sending more federal officials and initiating investigations.FADEL: So where do things stand now with Minnesota's governor's race, given that Walz is dropping out?MASTERS: Right. A long list of Republicans have already announced their running. Name a couple - Minnesota Speaker of the House Lisa Demuth, also MyPillow CEO and Trump ally Mike Lindell. For Democrats, we're hearing that Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar might be getting into the race. That could excite some Democrats because she's won four times here. Last reelected in just 2024.FADEL: That's Clay Masters of Minnesota Public Radio. Thank you.MASTERS: You're welcome.(SOUNDBITE OF SURPRISE CHEF'S \"ALL NEWS IS GOOD NEWS\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

It's not on display at the Capitol, as is required by law. Its whereabouts aren't publicly known, though it's believed to be in storage.   \n   House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has yet to formally unveil the plaque. And the Trump administration's Department of Justice is seeking to dismiss a police officers' lawsuit asking that it be displayed as intended. The Architect of the Capitol, which was responsible for obtaining and displaying the plaque, said in light of the federal litigation, it cannot comment.   Determined to preserve the nation's history, some 100 members of Congress, mostly Democrats, have taken it upon themselves to memorialize the moment. For months, they've mounted poster board-style replicas of the Jan. 6 plaque outside their office doors, resulting in a Capitol complex awash with makeshift remembrances.   \n   \"On behalf of a grateful Congress, this plaque honors the extraordinary individuals who bravely protected and defended this symbol of democracy on Jan. 6, 2021,\" reads the faux bronze stand-in for the real thing. \"Their heroism will never be forgotten.\"   Jan. 6 void in the Capitol   In Washington, a capital city lined with monuments to the nation's history, the plaque was intended to become a simple but permanent marker, situated near the Capitol's west front, where some of the most violent fighting took place as rioters breached the building.   But in its absence, the missing plaque makes way for something else entirely — a culture of forgetting.   Visitors can pass through the Capitol without any formal reminder of what happened that day, when a mob of President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the building trying to overturn the Republican's 2020 reelection defeat to Democrat Joe Biden. With memory left unchecked, it allows new narratives to swirl and revised histories to take hold.   Five years ago, the jarring scene watched the world over was declared an \"insurrection\" by the then-GOP leader of the Senate, while the House GOP leader at the time called it his \"saddest day\" in Congress. But those condemnations have faded.   Trump calls it a \"day of love.\" And Johnson, who was among those lawmakers challenging the 2020 election results, is now the House speaker.   \n   \"The question of January 6 remains – democracy was on the guillotine — how important is that event in the overall sweep of 21st century U.S. history,\" said Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University and noted scholar.   \"Will January 6 be seen as the seminal moment when democracy was in peril?\" he asked. Or will it be remembered as \"kind of a weird one-off?\"   \"There's not as much consensus on that as one would have thought on the fifth anniversary,\" he said.   Memories shift, but violent legacy lingers   At least five people died in the riot and its aftermath, including Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot by police while trying to climb through a window toward the House chamber. More than 140 law enforcement officers were wounded, some gravely, and several died later, some by suicide.   All told, some 1,500 people were charged in the Capitol attack, among the largest federal prosecutions in the nation's history. When Trump returned to power in January 2025, he pardoned all of them within hours of taking office.   Unlike the twin light beams that commemorated the Sept. 11, 2001, attack or the stand-alone chairs at the Oklahoma City bombing site memorial, the failure to recognize Jan. 6 has left a gap not only in memory but in helping to stitch the country back together.   \"That's why you put up a plaque,\" said Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Pa. \"You respect the memory and the service of the people involved.\"   Police sue over Jan. 6 plaque, DOJ seeks to dismiss   The speaker's office said in a statement late Monday the statute authorizing the plaque is \"not implementable\" and proposed alternatives also \"do not comply.\" Johnson's spokesman said if Democrats are serious about commemorating the police, they're free to work with the appropriate committees to develop a framework for proper vetting and consideration.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A replica plaque commemorating the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot hangs outside the office of Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Tuesday, Dec. 30, 2025, at the Longworth House Office Building on Capitol Hill in Washington.\n                \n                    Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Lawmakers approved the plaque in March 2022 as part of a broader government funding package. The resolution said the U.S. \"owes its deepest gratitude to those officers,\" and it set out instructions for an honorific plaque listing the names of officers \"who responded to the violence that occurred.\" It gave a one-year deadline for installation at the Capitol.   \n   This summer, two officers who fought the mob that day sued over the delay.   \"By refusing to follow the law and honor officers as it is required to do, Congress encourages this rewriting of history,\" said the claim by officers Harry Dunn and Daniel Hodges. \"It suggests that the officers are not worthy of being recognized, because Congress refuses to recognize them.\"   The Justice Department is seeking to have the case dismissed. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro and others argued Congress \"already has publicly recognized the service of law enforcement personnel\" by approving the plaque and displaying it wouldn't alleviate the problems they claim to face from their work.   \"It is implausible,\" the Justice Department attorneys wrote, to suggest installation of the plaque \"would stop the alleged death threats they claim to have been receiving.\"   The department also said the plaque is required to include the names of \"all law enforcement officers\" involved in the response that day — some 3,600 people.   Makeshift memorials emerge   Lawmakers who've installed replicas of the plaque outside their offices said it's important for the public to know what happened.   \"There are new generations of people who are just growing up now who don't understand how close we came to losing our democracy on Jan 6, 2021,\" said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a member of the Jan. 6 committee, which was opposed by GOP leadership but nevertheless issued a nearly 1,000-page report investigating the run-up to the attack and the attempt to overturn the 2020 election.   Raskin envisions the Capitol one day holding tours around what happened. \"People need to study that as an essential part of American history,\" he said.   \"Think about the dates in American history that we know only by the dates: There's the 4th of July. There's December 7th. There's 9/11. And there's January 6th,\" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-calif., who also served on the committee and has a plaque outside her office.   \n   \"They really saved my life, and they saved the democracy and they deserve to be thanked for it,\" she said.   But as time passes, there are no longer bipartisan memorial services for Jan. 6. On Tuesday, the Democrats will reconvene members from the Jan. 6 committee for a hearing to \"examine ongoing threats to free and fair elections,\" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York announced. It's unlikely Republicans will participate.   The Republicans under Johnson have tapped Rep. Barry Loudermilk of Georgia to stand up their own special committee to uncover what the speaker calls the \"full truth\" of what happened. They're planning a hearing this month.   \"We should stop this silliness of trying to whitewash history -- it's not going to happen,\" said Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., who helped lead the effort to display the replica plaques.   \"I was here that day so I'll never forget,\" he said. \"I think that Americans will not forget what happened.\"   The number of makeshift plaques that fill the halls is a testimony to that remembrance, he said.   Instead of one plaque, he said, they've \"now got 100.\"\n",

Trump returned to Washington from his winter break at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., one day after U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife in a raid on his compound in Caracas.\n                \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   President Trump is set to meet with House Republicans at the Kennedy Center on Tuesday as lawmakers in both chambers are calling for more details on the weekend operation in Venezuela and the U.S. role there moving forward.   \n   The gathering in Washington, D.C., comes a day after top administration officials briefed Capitol Hill leaders for several hours behind closed doors, leaving a largely partisan divide on the military operation that led to the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.   The Monday briefing was the first opportunity for top party leaders, along with members from key committees in Congress, to question administration officials about a mission for which they were given no advance warning.   \n   Following the briefing, Republicans said the president was well within his powers to order the mission without congressional input.   \"We are not at war. We do not have U.S. armed forces in Venezuela, and we are not occupying that country,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said after the briefing. \"The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war — that is true — but it also vests the president of the United States with vast authorities as commander in chief.\"   \n   The Monday briefing was led by key members of the president's foreign policy team, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine.   It was attended by the Gang of Eight, made up of the House and Senate leaders from both parties and the top Republican and top Democrat serving on each chamber's intelligence committees. Joining them were bipartisan leaders from the foreign affairs, foreign relations and armed services committees.   The Tuesday gathering at the Kennedy Center will be an opportunity for Trump to address members of his party as they are gearing up for a fight to maintain control over the House in the midterm elections. In the past, his addresses to these gatherings have focused on broader topics and rallying together as a party.   \n   Speaker Johnson said the administration scheduled a separate briefing on Venezuela for all members of Congress on Wednesday, where it is expected that more details will be shared about next steps in the region.   A partisan divide persists over Trump's handling of Venezuela   Following the meeting, Johnson told reporters that the operation in Venezuela was not \"a regime change,\" but rather \"a demand for change in behavior by a regime.\" And while  Trump said over the weekend that the U.S. will run Venezuela until a \"proper transition can take place,\" Johnson told reporters, \"we don't expect troops on the ground\" or direct involvement in Venezuela \"in any other way\" beyond coercing reforms from the interim government now in place.   Other lawmakers leaving the briefing said they did not yet have clarity on whether there would be more U.S. involvement in Venezuela.   \n   Republicans' solidarity with the president and his top officials signaled that Trump continues to draw fierce loyalty from the vast majority of his party in Congress. However, Democrats said the operation illustrated a dangerous expansion of Trump's executive powers and risked plunging the U.S. into the very same kind of ongoing conflict that Trump campaigned on avoiding.   \"It seems at every turn, Donald Trump is trying to figure out how he avoids Congress,\" said Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y. \"And unfortunately, Congress allows him to do it.\"   Meeks, the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, voiced a concern that Democrats have raised throughout the last year — that Congress is abdicating its constitutional authority in deference to the White House.   Johnson addressed that criticism.   \"Look, I can tell you, as speaker of the House, as the person who's in charge of defending Article I powers, I'm just going to insist to you that those have not been traversed in any way by what happened here,\" he told reporters.   \n   Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., warned of troubles that could lie ahead, arguing the briefing left more questions than answers.   \"Their plan for the U.S. running Venezuela is vague, based on wishful thinking and unsatisfying,\" Schumer said. \"I did not receive any assurances that we would not try to do the same thing in other countries.\"   This marked the first of what will likely be several more briefings for lawmakers about the events that unfolded in Venezuela and next steps.\n",

Her comments came in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's renewed call for the strategic, mineral-rich Arctic island to come under U.S. control in the aftermath of the weekend military operation in Venezuela.   \n   The dead-of-night operation by U.S. forces in Caracas to capture leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife early Saturday left the world stunned, and heightened concerns in Denmark and Greenland, which is a semiautonomous territory of the Danish kingdom and thus part of NATO.   Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart, Jens Frederik Nielsen, blasted the president's comments and warned of catastrophic consequences. Numerous European leaders expressed solidarity with them.   \n   \"If the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops,\" Frederiksen told Danish broadcaster TV2 on Monday. \"That is, including our NATO and thus the security that has been provided since the end of the Second World War.\"   20-day timeline deepens fears   Trump called repeatedly during his presidential transition and the early months of his second term for U.S. jurisdiction over Greenland, and has not ruled out military force to take control of the island. His comments Sunday, including telling reporters \"let's talk about Greenland in 20 days,\" further deepened fears that the U.S. was planning an intervention in Greenland in the near future.   Frederiksen also said Trump \"should be taken seriously\" when he says he wants Greenland. \"We will not accept a situation where we and Greenland are threatened in this way,\" she added.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                FILE - In this Aug. 16, 2019, photo, large Icebergs float away as the sun rises near Kulusuk, Greenland.\n                \n                    Felipe Dana/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Felipe Dana/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Nielsen, in a news conference Monday, said Greenland cannot be compared to Venezuela. He urged his constituents to stay calm and united.   \"We are not in a situation where we think that there might be a takeover of the country overnight and that is why we are insisting that we want good cooperation,\" he said.   Nielsen added: \"The situation is not such that the United States can simply conquer Greenland.\"   \n   Ask Rostrup, a TV2 political journalist, wrote on the station's live blog Monday that Mette previously would have flatly rejected the idea of an American takeover of Greenland. But now, Rostrup wrote, the rhetoric has escalated so much that she has to acknowledge the possibility.   Trump slams Denmark's security efforts in Greenland   Trump on Sunday also mocked Denmark's efforts at boosting Greenland's national security posture, saying the Danes have added \"one more dog sled\" to the Arctic territory's arsenal.   \"It's so strategic right now,\" Trump had told reporters Sunday as he flew back to Washington from his home in Florida. \"Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place.\"   \n   He added: \"We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.\"   But Ulrik Pram Gad, a global security expert from the Danish Institute for International Studies, wrote in a report last year that \"there are indeed Russian and Chinese ships in the Arctic, but these vessels are too far away to see from Greenland with or without binoculars.\"   U.S. space base in northwestern Greenland   Greenlanders and Danes were further rankled this weekend by a social media post following the raid by a former Trump administration official turned podcaster, Katie Miller. The post shows an illustrated map of Greenland in the colors of the Stars and Stripes accompanied by the caption: \"SOON.\"   \"And yes, we expect full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,\" Ambassador Jesper Møller Sørensen, Denmark's chief envoy to Washington, said in a post responding to Miller, who is married to Trump's influential deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller.   The U.S. Department of Defense operates the remote Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland. It was built following a 1951 defense agreement between Denmark and the United States. It supports missile warning, missile defense and space surveillance operations for the U.S. and NATO.   On Denmark's mainland, the partnership between the U.S. and Denmark has been long-lasting. The Danes buy American F-35 fighter jets and just last year, Denmark's parliament approved a bill to allow U.S. military bases on Danish soil.   Critics say the vote ceded Danish sovereignty to the U.S. The legislation widens a previous military agreement, made in 2023 with the Biden administration, where U.S. troops had broad access to Danish air bases in the Scandinavian country.\n",

Fallon/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The Pentagon is mounting a six-month review of women in ground combat jobs, to ensure what it calls the military \"effectiveness\" of having several thousand female soldiers and Marines in infantry, armor and artillery, according to a memo obtained by NPR.   Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel Anthony Tata wrote in a memo last month that the effort is to determine the \"operational effectiveness of ground combat units 10 years after the Department lifted all remaining restrictions on women serving in combat roles.\"   Tata requested Army and Marine leaders to provide data on the readiness, training, performance, casualties and command climate of ground combat units and personnel. The services are to provide points of contact no later than Jan. 15 to the Institute for Defense Analyses, a nonprofit corporation that assists the government on national security issues. The memo says the data should include \"all available metrics describing that individual's readiness and ability to deploy (including physical, medical, and other measures of ability to deploy.)\"   \n   Moreover, the seven-page memo calls for any internal research and studies — not publicly available — on \"the integration of women in combat.\"   \"We should not have women in combat roles\"   Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson wrote in an email to NPR that the study is to \"ensure standards are met and the United States maintains the most lethal military. Our standards for combat arms positions will be elite uniform, and sex neutral because the weight of a rucksack or a human being doesn't care if you're a man or a woman. Under (Defense) Secretary (Pete) Hegseth, the Department of War's [sic] will not compromise standards to satisfy quotas or an ideological agenda—this is common sense.\"   Hegseth, an Army National Guard veteran with tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, opposed women in ground combat units while he was a Fox News host and author. \"I'm straight up saying we should not have women in combat roles. It hasn't made us more effective. Hasn't made us more lethal. Has made fighting more complicated,\" he said in a November 2024 podcast hosted by Shawn Ryan. But during his confirmation hearing last year he softened his stance, saying women can serve in combat roles as long as they meet the same standards as men.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Pete Hegseth speaks to senior military leaders at Marine Corps Base Quantico on Sept. 30, 2025 in Quantico, Va. In his remarks, Hegseth told admirals and generals that women must meet the \"highest male standard.\"\n                \n                    Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   During a September address to admirals and generals at Marine Base Quantico in Virginia, Hegseth announced that women must meet the \"highest male standard.\"   \n   \"Any place where tried and true physical standards were altered, especially since 2015, when combat standards were changed to ensure females could qualify, must be returned to their original standard.\" But he did not say he was barring women from ground combat roles.   \"When it comes to any job that requires physical power to perform in combat, those physical standards must be high and gender neutral,\" Hegseth said. \"If women can make it, excellent. If not, it is what it is. If that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, so be it. That is not the intent, but it could be the result.\"   Women currently in ground combat units   Of all soldiers serving in combat units in the Army, women make up a small fraction: a total of some 3,800 women serve in infantry, armor and artillery. Among them are more than 150 women who completed the arduous Ranger training. A small number of women — around 10 or so — passed Green Beret training. The Marines have about 700 females in these ground combat jobs. And in all these jobs, women must meet the same standards as their male counterparts.   Ellen Haring, a senior research fellow at Women in International Security, is a West Point graduate and retired Army colonel with 30 years in uniform, dismissed the Pentagon review as a way to exclude women from ground combat.   \"It's exactly what [Hegseth] said all along,\" she said. \"He's against women in combat and he's going to get them out. It's going to be an effort to prove women don't belong.\"   Meanwhile, Khris Fuhr, also a West Point graduate who worked on gender integration for the Army Forces Command at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, said an Army study between 2018 to 2023 found that women performed well in ground combat units, and in some cases had higher scores than male soldiers. She called the upcoming Pentagon study, \"a solution for a problem that doesn't exist.\"   \n   Then Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced at a Pentagon press conference in 2015 that women would be admitted to all ground combat positions, saying it made no sense to exclude half the population from serving in those jobs.   \"As long as they qualify and meet the standards,\" Carter said, \"Women will now be able to contribute to our mission in ways they could not before.\"   But the decision was a controversial one, especially among the Marine Corps. Then Joint Chiefs Chairman, General Joe Dunford, didn't attend the press conference and instead put out a statement saying \"my responsibility is to ensure his decision is properly implemented.\"   Marines privately bristled at the announcement. They conducted a training exercise in the Mojave desert in 2015 that found gender-integrated units were slower, less lethal and more prone to injury than all-male units. Marine officers also said accepting women would lead to greater risk, meaning more Marine combat casualties. Carter said he saw it differently.   While the Marine exercise found that teams that included women were overall less effective, Defense Secretary Carter pointed out that the study failed to focus on individual achievement. Advocates of women in combat say the exercise failed to consider high-achieving women in those combat roles.\n",

Mark Kelly over a video Kelly did telling troops not to follow illegal orders.   \n\n    QUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE: Kelly and five other Democrats with military or intelligence backgrounds made a video last November as President Trump talked about increasing the use of active-duty troops and National Guard in U.S. cities, even over the objections of state governors. The message was for those troops.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARK KELLY: Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders.CHRIS DELUZIO: You must refuse illegal orders.ELISSA SLOTKIN: No one has to carry out orders that violate the law.CHRISSY HOULAHAN: Or our Constitution.LAWRENCE: At the time, President Trump described the lawmakers as traitors, posting on social media that their behavior could be punishable by death.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KAROLINE LEAVITT: You can't have a functioning military if there is disorder and chaos within the ranks. And that's what these Democrat members were encouraging.LAWRENCE: That was White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt at a briefing in November.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LEAVITT: I think what Senator Mark Kelly was actually trying to do was intimidate the 1.3 million active-duty service members who are currently serving in our United States Armed Forces with that video that he and his Democrat colleagues put out.LAWRENCE: Of the six, Senator Kelly may be in the most jeopardy. Because he reached full military retirement, he's subject to the military justice system and could even be recalled to face court-martial. The Navy began to investigate that option last year, but Kelly was defiant.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KELLY: President Trump is trying to silence me, threatening to kill me. And he sent his secretary of defense after me.LAWRENCE: Kelly continued to speak out about the administration's deadly strikes against suspected drug boats, including the killing of shipwrecked survivors, and now the Trump administration's removal of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Yesterday, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced on social media that he's initiated a formal 45-day process to reduce Kelly's rank and retirement pay in response to what he called Kelly's seditious statements and his, quote, \"pattern of reckless misconduct\" from June to December last year. Senator Kelly replied in a statement that the Trump administration is trying to stifle free speech and dissent among retired military officers. He called that un-American, and he said he'd fight it with everything he's got.Quil Lawrence, NPR News.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

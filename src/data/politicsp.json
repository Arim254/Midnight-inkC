Brown/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   ATLANTA — Democrats flipped two seats on Georgia's statewide Public Service Commission by wide margins, one of many surprise victories for the party Tuesday up and down the ballot in the handful of races across the country.   Polling shows the Democratic Party is historically unpopular, but at polling places this year voters have helped the party overperform in elections against the backdrop of President Trump's even less popular policies.   Beyond the blowout victories in the New Jersey and Virginia governors' races, Zohran Mamdani winning a majority of votes in New York City's mayoral election and California voters approving a plan to temporarily redraw the state's congressional districts to add Democrat-leaning districts, the party continued its trend of electoral success in the 2025 general election.   \n   Here are some other notable election results around the country:   In Georgia, Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson will be the newest members of the state's five-person public utility regulator after earning roughly 60% of the vote. It's the first time Democrats have won a nonfederal statewide office there since 2006 and one where soaring energy costs and displeasure with incumbents dominated the race.   Pennsylvania voters chose to retain three state Supreme Court judges that were first elected as Democrats after millions of dollars in outside spending driven by conservative billionaire Jeff Yass' efforts to reshape the state court's politics. Democrats also won special elections for a seat on Pennsylvania's Superior Court and a seat on its Commonwealth Court.   Also in Pennsylvania, Democrats swept the top \"row offices\" in the purple-hued Bucks County, electing the county's first-ever Democratic district attorney and defeating an incumbent Republican sheriff a year after Trump narrowly won there. Democrats similarly notched commanding victories in county executive races in Erie, Lehigh and Northampton counties, all bellwether counties in recent presidential elections.   At the state legislative level, Mississippi Democrats have broken a GOP supermajority in the state Senate after flipping two seats in that chamber plus another pickup in the state House. A federal court ordered lawmakers to redraw 14 total House and Senate districts after finding the maps drawn in 2022 discriminated against Black voters.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A lying Statue of Liberty is on display outside a polling station Tuesday in Arlington, Va. Virginians hit the poll on Election Day to pick their next governor but also expanded the majority for Democrats in the state's House of Delegates.\n                \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Democrats have also vastly expanded their control of the Virginia House of Delegates and New Jersey's state Assembly, giving the party supermajorities in those chambers.   \n   In many local races across the country, Democrats touted victories that will reshape their communities, like the flipping of all three city council seats in Georgetown, S.C., the unseating of the last remaining Republican city council member in Orlando, Fla., and winning back mayoral races in Connecticut.   For the first time in a half-century, Democrats control the Onondaga County legislature that includes Syracuse, N.Y. Democrats saw a city council seat in Charlotte, N.C., switch parties for the first time since 1999.    Democrats across the ideological spectrum won, too. Beyond Mamdani's victory in New York City, the Democratic Socialists of America touted municipal wins for members in Detroit, Atlanta and Cambridge, Mass., among others.   \n   Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin previously predicted in an interview with NPR that the party's success in special elections in 2025 — where the party has overperformed prior margins by an average of about 14% — would continue into the midterm cycle.   \"The important thing to remember is midterm elections are not a referendum on a party that's not in power,\" Martin said. \"So our numbers really don't matter here. Donald Trump is at an all-time low in terms of his favorability and his approval numbers… the Republican Party is as well.\"   Tuesday's results also show that the economy and affordability continue to be top of mind for voters, and voters have registered their displeasure with Trump and congressional Republicans' agenda on that front.\n",

Spanberger declared victory over Republican incumbent Dave Brat.\n        \n            Win McNamee/Getty Images\n        \n    \n   \n   Democrat Abigail Spanberger will be the next governor of Virginia, according to a race call by the Associated Press. This historic win will position her as Virginia's first woman governor.   \n   Backed by national Democrats looking to strengthen their chances in the 2026 midterm elections, Spanberger defeated her Republican opponent, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. Spanberger served in the CIA before running for Congress in 2018, where she served three terms in the U.S. House.   Throughout her career, Spanberger has cultivated a reputation as a pragmatic centrist. During her run for governor, she earned Virginian's support by speaking to their concerns about the rising cost of living and economic uncertainty. Spanberger promised to advocate for federal workers and federal contractors in the state, who have been negatively impacted by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cutbacks, federal layoffs, tariffs and the extended shutdown.   \n   \"I will look to work with a president that I may disagree with substantially,\" Spanberger told Morning Edition. \"And right at this moment, coming in now as governor elect, and governor in the new year, my approach will be to make sure that I'm pushing for what we need here on the ground. And right now, that will be pushing back against a variety of the bad policies that are coming out of this White House.\"   In a conversation with NPR's Leila Fadel, Spanberger spoke about her historic win and plans to deliver on the platform she laid out during her campaign.   The following exchange has been edited for length and clarity.      Interview Highlights   Leila Fadel: How are you feeling this morning as you reflect on your historic election, the first woman governor in Virginia?   Abigail Spanberger: I am feeling great this morning. It is a good day in Virginia and the transition starts today. So I'm excited to get to work.   Fadel: So winning an election is one thing, but fulfilling the promises to make things affordable for federal workers who have lost their jobs, as you did on the campaign trail, is another. What's on your agenda, day one?   \n   Spanberger: Day one is to start working with our partners in the General Assembly to make sure they're ready to go with the bills to file. Making sure that I am ready, day one, in January, with executive actions related to ensuring that we're supporting all Virginians, particularly given the challenges that so many of our community members are facing in the past because of DOGE and now because of the shutdown. And maintaining the economic focus that I have had throughout this campaign, so that as soon as I am sworn in, in January, we are moving quickly to take decisive and clear actions to deliver on the promises and the plans that I set forth throughout the campaign.   Fadel: As you point out, Virginia, home to hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors deeply affected by DOGE cuts and the government shutdown. Before we get further into that, I do want to ask if you see your win as an endorsement of your agenda or a repudiation of Donald Trump?   Spanberger: I think it's absolutely an endorsement of an agenda that's putting Virginians first. It's an endorsement of an agenda that we laid out with plans throughout the summer in strengthening our public schools, lowering costs, particularly housing, health care and energy, and growing our economy. And certainly that happens all on a landscape where Virginia has been so impacted by the choices coming out of this White House, whether it's DOGE, whether it's tariffs and then retaliatory trade policies that we have then experienced and have impacted Virginia, from small businesses to farmers to shipments into our port. But certainly it's an endorsement of our affirmative agenda. But, certainly, on the landscape where so much of what is happening here in Virginia and so many of the concerns that people have are really heightened because of the ways that we have been impacted by the bad choices and aggressive chaos coming out of Washington.   \n   Fadel: What about on immigration? I mean, Virginia's outgoing Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, shares the president's hardline approach to immigration. He signed an executive order that requires local law enforcement to work with federal immigration authorities. Will that also be your approach?   Spanberger: Absolutely not. I'm a former law enforcement officer. I was a federal agent before I became a CIA officer. So my entire background is one of law and order, understanding the threats that our country faces coming from the outside, and a clear recognition, frankly, of the responsibilities of what it is to uphold the law. The efforts that we have seen undertaken by this administration with ICE is beyond anything that I ever knew as a law enforcement officer. Any time we went anywhere, we were showing our warrants. When we were with local police, they were clearly marked. We were clearly marked. The idea that there are families getting pulled over on the side of the road, and parents getting taken out of the cars, and children left is just an absolute nightmare situation and it doesn't make our communities safer. And so my approach will be: when there is a warrant signed by a judge, certainly law enforcement can and must work with federal agencies. That's how I always worked task force or joint issues. But I do not want local Virginia law enforcement doing the administrative actions of ICE, particularly at a time when it drives so much fear and confusion within our communities.

It takes the title from the most recent shutdown, which stretched from December 2018 to January 2019 during the first Trump administration.   \n   That impasse started with Democrats' refusal to fund President Trump's southern border wall. It ended — 35 days and an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP later — after a series of escalating disruptions, including to air travel, put pressure on Trump and Republicans in Congress to reach a compromise.   This time around, the government shuttered on Oct. 1 after Congress failed to break a stalemate over funding negotiations. More than a month later, an end to the stalemate appears nowhere in sight.   \n   There have been 20 \"funding gaps\" since Congress introduced the modern budget process in 1976, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, but many of those were only a few days long. Before now, only three funding lapses shut down the government for more than two weeks — and they were all within the last 30 years. (There was another shutdown in 1978, but that was before funding gaps halted government operations the way they do today.)   While Republicans control both chambers, they need 60 votes to pass a spending bill in the Senate. Democrats are using that as leverage to push for an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that are due to expire at the end of this year, potentially leaving millions of Americans without health insurance. Republicans have said they are open to talks on the subsidies — but only after the government reopens.   In the meantime, both parties are pointing the finger at each other and doing little, at least publicly, to reopen the government. The Senate has now tried — and failed — 14 times to pass a House-approved stopgap funding bill. The House, meanwhile, has been out of session since the shutdown began.   Americans are feeling the worsening impacts every day.   \n   Over 1 million federal workers are working without paychecks. Another roughly 600,000 have been furloughed, and although a 2019 law ensures they are entitled to backpay after the shutdown is over, recent comments by President Trump have left many worried about whether that will still happen.   Air traffic control shortages have caused delays and disruptions at airports across the country. National park sites are reducing operations and Smithsonian museums are closed. The IRS furloughed nearly half its staff, creating delays in taxpayer services. Tens of thousands of children from low-income families are now at risk of losing access to the Head Start program.   \n   And, federal food and nutrition benefits such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) stopped over the weekend, prompting widespread outcry and pushback from two federal judges. In response, the Trump administration says it will restart those payments — but they will be delayed and may only be for half the amount people typically get.   In a weekend interview with CBS News, Trump continued to place blame on Democrats, and called on Senate Republicans to end the filibuster to bypass Democrats altogether. Senate Republicans have rejected that plea.   Trump acknowledged that his involvement helped bring an end to the previous shutdown, but didn't appear as willing to compromise this time: \"I'm not gonna do it by being extorted by the Democrats who have lost their way.\"\n",

Mikie Sherrill secured a decisive victory in Tuesday's election to become the next governor of the Garden State in a race some polls predicted would be tighter.   Sherrill beat the President Trump-endorsed Republican candidate, Jack Ciattarelli, by about 13% of the vote — marking the first time since the 1960s that New Jersey voters elected a governor from the same party three terms in a row.   In an interview with Morning Edition, Sherill said her win was about New Jersey residents wanting leadership at a time when many feel some of President Trump's moves — including tariffs, federal reductions in health spending and threats to the multi-billion dollar Gateway Tunnel Project — will make life harder for them.   \n   \"They look to my background in the military. They also want somebody who gets it and gets them,\" Sherrill said. \"They look to the fact that I'm a mom of four kids and I know what's been going on in our communities and our schools, and they wanted somebody to address those key issues.\"   Speaking to NPR's A Martínez, Sherrill discussed her win and what Democrats' successful 2025 election means going forward.   This interview has been edited for length and clarity.      Interview highlights   A Martínez: It's been six decades since New Jersey elected a governor from the same party three times in a row. How does that make you feel?   Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill: It makes me feel pretty great. And I'll tell you, after speaking to thousands and thousands of New Jerseyans about just what it was going to take for for them, for their families to succeed, and then really executing the campaign focused on declaring a state of emergency on utility costs on day one, expanding first-time homebuyers credit to get people a foot in the door to homes or really handling the crisis that's going on in our health care system. Just relentlessly focusing on the people that I was stepping up to serve I think had huge gains. I think that's what people here in New Jersey expect from government. I often say that the key to my success is ruthless competence. And so we got it done in the campaign. We put together just the biggest, I think most professional campaign, the state has seen, and we saw great results last night.   \n   Martínez: My colleague Leila Fadel asked Virginia's governor-elect, Abigail Spanberger, if her win was more of an endorsement of her policies or more of a push back to President Trump. So that same question now to you.   Sherrill: I think what this shows is that people in this state really want leadership. They look to my background in the military. They also want somebody who gets it and gets them. And I think in that case, they look to the fact that I'm a mom of four kids and I know what's been going on in our communities and our schools, and they wanted somebody to address those key issues. While at the same time, the fact that a lot of the affordability issues and the problems there stem from Trump's administration. So I heard as I went and spoke to thousands of people about the tariffs, how they were putting people out of business or larger businesses were laying people off. I heard about fears from the One Big Beautiful Bill and how people were going to afford to have health care. And then most recently, when Trump said he was going to terminate the Gateway Tunnel Project — thousands of New Jerseyans spoke to me about how important that was to not just their quality of life, but their hopes for opportunity and jobs. So again and again, the focus on affordability, on people's lives, on their kids' future really intersects with the attacks on the economy coming from Trump's administration.   \n   Martínez: Are there any places at all where you might find common ground with President Trump?   Sherrill: We have a lot of big events coming up here in New Jersey where we will really be showcasing kind of the center of what we're showcasing about America. That's both the nation's 250th birthday anniversary. And most people know that the majority of the Revolutionary War took place in New Jersey. George Washington spent more time in Jersey than anywhere else. And some major turning point battles are here. So that's a huge event coming up. We have the FIFA World Cup, the biggest sporting event in the world. The final will be here in New Jersey. So all of that's coming into the state. It's a great opportunity to both showcase our country as well as, I think, some really good economic opportunities. And hopefully the administration will be a good partner in that endeavor.   \n   Martínez: Now, you've made the rising cost of living a top issue. And New York City is right across the Hudson River from New Jersey. When it comes to housing affordability, how do you see yourself possibly working with its new mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani?   Sherrill: You know, we're not going to solve New York's housing shortage, but what we can do here in New Jersey is really work to expand housing opportunities.   Martínez: People go from New Jersey to New York all the time. That's why I'm asking.   Sherrill: Right. But what we're seeing is a real influx of New Yorkers into places like Jersey City, Hoboken — and we'll continue to provide great opportunities for people. We'll continue to build our businesses here. But really what we have to do is across the state, look to some of our opportunities and transit-oriented development business opportunities in the southern part of our state, transit across the state. Although again with the Gateway Tunnel Project, that's going to be a key investment that we need from the federal government. And then when it comes to working with Mayor-elect Mamdani or [New York Gov. Kathy] Hochul, I will be working to get, you know, get in to ensure that we have resources here in New Jersey, that we're working together to make sure, for example, the FIFA World Cup goes off really well. I think we'll have a lot going on in Liberty around the Statue of Liberty in our harbor. So we'll work closely with New York to make sure we run this safely, securely, and we have the economic benefits of it here.   \n   Martínez: What are your thoughts on these two significant wins [in Virginia and New Jersey] across the mid-Atlantic region?   Sherrill: I think it's building back that juggernaut of a Democratic coalition — working people, the Black and Latino communities — these are communities that want to see great government. They want to see great schools, great job opportunities. And that's what Democrats have traditionally focused on when we build out a juggernaut of a campaign and a good, effective government. And that's what I intend to do.   \n   This digital article was edited by Treye Green.\n",

Up and down the ballot, Democrats did well. That was true whether it was the marquee governors' races in Virginia and New Jersey, where Democrats significantly outperformed 2024 presidential election margins, or even less-closely watched races like the Virginia House of Delegates, the state supreme court in Pennsylvania and even Georgia Public Service Commission.   And the outcomes very well may have consequences in the near term, for things like the federal government shutdown, in the medium term for the 2026 midterm elections and in the longer term for 2028.   \n   Here are five takeaways from the 2025 off-year elections:   1. It's still the cost of living, stupid   The old political axiom, coined by former Bill Clinton adviser James Carville is, \"It's the economy, stupid.\" Well, over the last couple of years, more specifically that should be, \"It's the cost of living, stupid.\" Whether it was Democratic President Joe Biden or now Republican President Trump, prices and affordability have proven to be voting motivators.   But Trump has largely ignored it, saying he always felt immigration was more motivating. That came back to bite his party Tuesday night.   \n   The exit polls found that in all four major contests — the governors' races in Virginia and New Jersey, the New York mayor's race and the Proposition 50 battle in California — voters said the economy was the most important issue (or close to it in New Jersey), and they sided with Democrats overwhelmingly.   And that's despite Republicans being seen Tuesday night as best on the issue of crime or immigration in these elections (counting Trump-endorsed Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent in New York).   That's a very bad sign for Republicans and Trump, who clearly now own the economy, despite how much the president continues to try to blame his predecessor.   \n   2. Republicans still have a Trump problem — in two different ways   The president is unpopular and a drag on his party when he's not on the ballot, but also, when he's not on the ballot, the GOP can't seem to turn out conservatives.   Trump's numbers with independents haven't been good since early on in his second term as president, as lots of them disapprove of the job he's doing on the economy and think he's gone too far with how he's approached a policy of mass deportations.   \n   In these elections, according to the exit polls, as of 1 a.m. ET — independents made up a third of the electorate in Virginia, and Democrat Abigail Spanberger won those voters by 19 points in the governor's race. It was a similar story in New Jersey, where they made up 31% and went for Democrat Mikie Sherrill by 13 points.   It's a real quandary for Republicans. It was true during his first term as president, too, that in these non-presidential election years, Trump brings people out to the polls in the wrong way for the GOP. If you're a Republican, that has to be figured out. But so few want to cross Trump, and show a public break with him, that that's unlikely to happen anytime soon for the party en masse.   It's something to watch heading into next year's midterms and into 2028 when Trump is constitutionally ineligible to run again.   3. The Trump slump with Latinos appears to be real   Trump made significant inroads with Latinos during the 2024 presidential election. In fact, no Republican presidential candidate won a higher percentage with Latinos — ever.   But there have been signs that Latinos were moving away from Trump. Poll after poll has shown that, and Tuesday night was the first time it showed up at the ballot box in a significant way. Spanberger and Sherrill, the governors-elect from Virginia and New Jersey respectively, both won Latinos by 2-to-1 margins, according to the exit polls.   \n   Going deeper into New Jersey specifically, Trump won Passaic County in North Jersey, a county that is nearly half Latino, according to the census. He was the first Republican presidential candidate to win it since 1992. Trump won it by 3 points, but Sherrill won it by 15.   There are 10 counties in New Jersey where Latinos make up at least 1-in-5 people, per the U.S. census. Sherrill not only won them all, she expanded Democratic margins and flipped three Trump had won.   \n   For a couple of decades — since Latinos have become a significant political force given their population boom in the country — they had been reliable Democratic voters. But they have increasingly become a bloc that is not necessarily loyal to either party.      Get more updates in the NPR Politics newsletter.      They're particularly worried — like lots of other voters — about the cost of living. And many Latino leaders, including in the Republican Party, have voiced concerns about Trump's approach to immigration — casting a far-wider net than just hardened criminals.   Tuesday's result is likely going to have a lot of smart conservatives privately questioning Trump's policies and biting their nails about winning the group back for their races next year, as they try to hold onto the House.   4. The redistricting arms race is on, and Democrats got a boost Tuesday on that front   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                California Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks during an election night gathering at the California Democratic Party headquarters on Tuesday in Sacramento, Calif.\n                \n                    Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Practically, maybe the most consequential election Tuesday was the Proposition 50 ballot initiative in California. A yes vote on Prop 50 would temporarily overturn the requirement that California draw its congressional districts via independent commission.   That's exactly what happened — and it wasn't even close.   That wasn't guaranteed at the beginning of this effort a few months ago. It was spearheaded by California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, and with the help of a lot of money and high-profile Democrats like former President Barack Obama, they successfully made it a proxy fight with Trump. They convinced California Democrats that this was necessary to counterbalance Trump's demands on red states, like Texas, to squeeze out more Republican congressional districts to try to ensure GOP control of the House next year.   Now, California is set to redraw its congressional maps, which likely will result in more Democratic seats.   If that wasn't politically significant enough, there was also how Newsom positioned himself. While taking a victory lap, he tried to show he's a Democrat looking to counterbalance Trump not just with congressional districts but as a leader.    \n   Newsom called it a \"good night\" for the Democratic Party, one on the \"ascendancy,\" and \"on its toes rather than on its heels.\" Newsom also chided Trump, calling him \"historically unpopular,\" that he \"promised to make us healthier and wealthier,\" but \"we're sicker and poorer\" and that Trump knows his unpopular position. \"Why else,\" Newsom asked, would Trump try to get more seats out of Texas except to try to \"rig\" next year's elections? Newsom boasted of his state standing \"firm in response\" to Trump.   Democrats have made clear they want a fighter, someone willing to stand up to Trump in any way possible, someone with the guts to, say, bend the rules a little the way Trump might. One wonders who Newsom thinks should lead this \"ascendant\" party?   5. The Democratic Party will have to wrestle with its identity over the next year   There are plenty of people in the party with different ideas on how to lead the party, push a message of affordability and stand up to Trump in the process.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani speaks during an election night event on Tuesday.\n                \n                    Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   That brings us to Zohran Mamdani.   No one has captured more attention during this election cycle than Mamdani. The 34-year-old, who is set to become the youngest New York City mayor in more than a century, and the first Muslim to serve in that office, has become a star with progressives — and a villain among conservatives.   Conservatives are very good at creating Democratic bogeymen, and they will try their hardest to make Mamdani, a self-avowed democratic socialist, the face of the party. Mamdani has plenty of political gifts. The campaign he ran was unique in its ability to reach out to younger voters in authentic ways and on social media. And, unlike a lot of Democrats, who have a hard time squeezing their policy proposals onto a bumper sticker, he was able to communicate his message of affordability clearly.   \n   But he also did nothing to calm his critics Tuesday night. His victory speech was bold and defiant, even beginning by quoting Eugene Debs, a committed socialist who created the Socialist Party of America. The cover of the conservative New York Post Wednesday depicts Mamdani holding up a hammer and sickle, a communist symbol, with the headline: \"THE RED APPLE.\"   He reached out to Jewish New Yorkers in his speech, saying he would aim to fight the \"scourge of antisemitism.\" And he also poked the White House hive. Speaking directly to Trump, he urged him to \"turn the volume up\" before lambasting him over income inequality, union rights and his view of immigrants.   \n   All night, Fox News opted to talk about \"Commie\" Mamdani instead of taking victory speeches from Spanberger and Sherrill. Both women cut a different political profile: both have military or law enforcement backgrounds and tried to reach out to their opponents' voters. So, a large swath of the country on the right didn't hear a Democrat wishing her opponent well, praising her military service and saying she wants to be governor for everyone in the state.   Instead, they were served a heavy dose of red scare.   But is Mamdani now the face, or the \"soul\" of the Democratic Party? New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who also describes herself as a democratic socialist and was an early Mamdani backer, was asked about that on MSNBC Tuesday night.   \"I don't think that our party needs to have one face,\" she said. \"Our country does not have one face. It's about all of us as a team together. And we all understand the assignment. Our assignment everywhere is to send the strongest fighters for the working class wherever possible. In some places, like Virginia, for the gubernatorial seat, that's going to look like Abigail Spanberger. In New York City, unequivocally, it's Zohran Mamdani.\"   \n   Again, it's the cost of living and affordability that's key. Can Republicans effectively make the next year a debate between capitalism and socialism — or will Democrats be able to band together and sell something on the economy that's better than what's currently in control of Washington?   That's going to be a key question for the 2026 midterms, which kick off now.\n",

You're reading the Up First newsletter. Subscribe here to get it delivered to your inbox, and listen to the Up First podcast for all the news you need to start your day.   Today's top stories   NPR's senior political editor/correspondent Domenico Montanaro joins the newsletter today to break down the 2025 off-year elections.   Up and down the ballot, Democrats did well, from the marquee gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey to a key redistricting ballot initiative in California and even state Supreme Court races in Pennsylvania. Here are five takeaways from the 2025 off-year elections:   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Voters cast their ballots at a polling station on Nov. 4, 2025, in Arlington, Virginia. Virginians hit the polls on Election Day to pick their next governor.\n                \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n    It's still the cost of living, stupid. Prices, prices, prices. Affordability was a through line in most of the races Tuesday. President Trump's lack of focus on it likely hurt his party, as voters overwhelmingly sided with Democrats on the economy. Republicans still have a Trump problem — in two different ways. Republican candidates are in a quandary — Trump is unpopular and a drag with independents, but without him on the ballot, they continue to have problems turning out base voters. The Trump slump with Latinos appears to be real. Trump made inroads with Latinos in 2024, but that has slid backward. Latinos chose Democrats in the governors' races by 2-to-1 margins. The redistricting arms race is on, and Democrats got a boost Tuesday on that front. Yes on Prop 50 won big, giving Democrats a chance to counterbalance GOP efforts to squeeze out more Republican House seats. It was a big win for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, too. The Democratic Party will have to wrestle with its identity over the next year. From Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York to Abigail Spanberger for Virginia governor, there's going to be a real debate on how best for Democrats to present themselves to win in next year's midterm elections.   \n   Stay informed with more news and analysis by subscribing to the NPR Politics newsletter and listening to the NPR Politics podcast.   Today marks day 36 of the ongoing government shutdown, making it the longest in U.S. history. It takes the title from the most recent shutdown, which stretched from December 2018 to January 2019 during President Trump's first term in office. With no end in sight, Americans are feeling the worsening impacts every day, from disruptions at airports across the U.S. to federal workers going without a paycheck. Here's how this shutdown compares to previous ones.   The Supreme Court hears arguments today on whether Trump can unilaterally set tariff rates under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Lower courts say he has exceeded his authority, while Trump argues that the measure allows him to impose tariffs to address trade imbalances and fentanyl imports. Tariffs are generating billions of dollars for the federal government, but they are also raising the costs of goods for consumers and frustrating businesses. Listen to the oral arguments in the case here.   Israeli authorities have arrested and detained the military's top lawyer after she admitted leaking footage of Israeli soldiers sexually abusing a Palestinian detainee at a facility where Israel has held Palestinian prisoners throughout the war in Gaza. The military advocate general, Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, stated in her resignation letter that she authorized the video's release to defuse attacks on investigators handling the case. Tomer-Yerushalmi has now been arrested for leaking the footage.

The National Association of the Deaf (NAD) and two deaf men filed the lawsuit against Trump and Leavitt in May. The suit also names White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, along with the offices for president and vice president. It alleges the White House's failure to provide ASL violates Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The law prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in programs conducted by the federal government. The suit also claims the White House is in violation of the First and Fifth Amendments, which protect free speech and provide for due process, respectively.   NAD Interim CEO Bobbie Beth Scoggins said in a statement to NPR Wednesday that the organization is pleased that deaf and hard of hearing Americans will soon regain access to important information from the government.   \"American Sign Language and accurate captioning are both essential to ensuring full and equal access to information,\" Scoggins said. \"ASL and English are distinct languages, and captions alone cannot meet the needs of everyone in our community. The court's ruling affirms what we have long known: equal access to information from the White House is not optional. We deserve the same timely, direct access to White House briefings as everyone else.\"   \n   The White House did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment on the judge's decision.   Ali's order specifies that the ASL interpretation must be visible and signed by a qualified interpreter. He was not persuaded by White House arguments that it does provide closed captioning.   \n   \"The defendants correctly note that the plaintiffs are entitled only to reasonable accommodation. But it is not reasonable — indeed it can hardly be called an accommodation at all — to transcribe press briefings into a language that Ford and many NAD members do not know,\" Ali said in the opinion.   Ali is referring to plaintiff Derrick Ford, of Anderson, Ind. Matthew Bonn, of Germantown, Md., is also a plaintiff in the case.   According to the NAD, hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. communicate mainly in ASL, and many deaf and hard of hearing people do not know English. ASL has its own vocabulary and grammar that is different from English.   The judge stopped short of granting the group's request to require ASL interpretation at briefings and events conducted by the vice president, first lady, and second lady. Ali also declined at this time to require that interpretation be provided to news networks and uploaded to the White House website and social media pages. Scoggins says the NAD will continue to vigorously pursue all relief sought in its lawsuit.   The preliminary injunction is intended to give temporary relief to the group and the plaintiffs, as the case plays out in the legal system. Ali is ordering the White House to update the court on its compliance by Friday.\n",

    "body": "\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  In California, New York, Virginia and New Jersey, Democrats are declaring yesterday's election results a repudiation of President Trump.LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Republicans suffered losses in major races that include two of the first statewide contests since Trump returned to the White House. Former U.S. Navy helicopter pilot and Democratic Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill won the governorship in New Jersey.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKIE SHERRILL: We take oaths to a Constitution, not a king.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: That's right.SHERRILL: We've chosen liberty, the very foundation of democracy, and we've chosen prosperity necessary to create opportunity for all.FADEL: She beat the Trump-backed candidate, Republican Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli. In her victory speech, Sherrill said she would keep fighting the president's policies.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SHERRILL: So, New Jersey, to quote The Boss, the future is now. Roll up your sleeves. Let your passion flow. The country we carry in our hearts is waiting.(CHEERING)MARTÍNEZ: Virginia's Abigail Spanberger, who in fact once shared an apartment with Mikie Sherrill on Capitol Hill, will become the first woman to lead the Commonwealth.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: We sent a message to the whole world that in 2025, Virginia chose pragmatism over partisanship.(CHEERING)SPANBERGER: We chose our Commonwealth over chaos.(CHEERING)MARTÍNEZ: Spanberger is a former CIA analyst who served three terms in the U.S. House. She defeated the state's Republican lieutenant governor, Winsome Earle-Sears.FADEL: In New York, Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani also secured a commanding win in the mayoral race in America's biggest city to be its first Muslim mayor, first South Asian and its youngest mayor in generations. His victory speech had a message of hope and belonging.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ZOHRAN MAMDANI: New York will remain a city of immigrants, a city built by immigrants...(CHEERING)MAMDANI: ...Powered by immigrants...(CHEERING)MAMDANI: ...And, as of tonight, led by an immigrant.(CHEERING)MAMDANI: So hear me, President Trump, when I say this. To get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.FADEL: He galvanized voters by running a deft internet campaign and having a clear message of affordability. More than 2 million New Yorkers turned out to vote for the first time since 1969. More than a million chose Mamdani. He beat former Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent and was backed by President Trump, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Mamdani dealt with bigoted attacks throughout his campaign for his faith. He was also labeled a communist by his opponents and criticized for his stand on Israel.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MAMDANI: The conventional wisdom would tell you that I am far from the perfect candidate. I am young, despite my best efforts to grow older.(LAUGHTER)MAMDANI: I am Muslim.(CHEERING)MAMDANI: I am a Democratic socialist.(CHEERING)MAMDANI: And most damning of all, I refuse to apologize for any of this.(CHEERING)MARTÍNEZ: Here in California, a ballot initiative to redraw congressional districts in Democrats' favor also succeeded, with the help of a $120 million war chest amassed by Governor Gavin Newsom.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GAVIN NEWSOM: We stood tall and we stood firm in response to Donald Trump's recklessness. And tonight, after poking the bear, this bear roared, with unprecedented turnout in a special election with an extraordinary result.FADEL: Those were some of the sounds and reactions from last night's elections. And to put it all into context, Larry Sabato is on the line. He's a political analyst and the Robert Kent Gooch professor of politics at the University of Virginia. Sabato is also the founder of and director of the Center for Politics, which promotes civic engagement and participation. Welcome to the program. Good morning.LARRY SABATO: Thank you. Good morning.FADEL: So these are the first major elections to take place since President Trump won reelection a year ago. Now, Trump wasn't on the ballot, but he was very present in all of these elections. What do the results say about how voters feel about the president and his administration?SABATO: Well, first, it was a Democratic landslide. There's simply no question about it. The New Jersey governor's race, according to several polls, was supposed to be very close and on the edge of an upset by the Republican candidate, and in fact, it turned into a landslide and an even larger landslide in Virginia for Abigail Spanberger, the first woman governor of Virginia - or governor-elect, at least, and the entire Democratic ticket was swept in and a massive 64 Democrats elected to the House of Delegates. They only had 51 before the election. And California, as you mentioned, with Proposition 50. The point is simply this - these are blue-leaning localities, no question about it.FADEL: Right.SABATO: So you can't take too much away from the Republicans or from Trump's coalition. But it's pretty obvious that Democrats got a tremendous boost of enthusiasm and energy with these victories. Nothing cures illness like success.FADEL: Now, what was behind what ignited voters across the country? Like you said, they're blue-leaning, not a total surprise, but a lot of these wins were much bigger than expected.SABATO: Yes, and that's an important element of this. You look to see what the margins are, and the margins were far beyond what had been projected in advance or what even Democratic officials thought they would get. The reason is Donald Trump. It's affordability, yes, as everyone's stressed, but it's mainly Donald Trump. You look at the exit poll, you can see how incredibly unpopular he's become in the states and localities that had elections yesterday.FADEL: Now, will this impact Republican strategy and President Trump's strategy going forward looking at what voters did last night?SABATO: Well, it'll be interesting to see if it has an impact on the shutdown, maybe encouraging a compromise at last. For President Trump, I think we all know that while he may make some small changes, he's not one for turning, and he's unlikely to change the basic drift of his administration. Of course, that may be good for Democrats.FADEL: What is the signal, though, ahead of next year's midterms? I mean, does this mean something bigger when it comes to 2026?SABATO: Well, we're all going to pretend it does because that's what we do.FADEL: (Laughter).SABATO: We analyze elections, and we pretend to know what's going to happen a year from now. But the truth is the headlines will change so many times between now and the midterm elections in November of 2026. However, it does suggest that Trump's very dramatic actions to expand presidential power and, at least from critics, a belief that we're moving down the authoritarian highway is having an effect, at least on Democrats. It's motivating them to turn out in large numbers and to vote in anti-Trump line.FADEL: There were very different candidates on the ballots - right? - that won. When you look at Spanberger and Sherrill, who won for governorships in Virginia and New Jersey, they're seen as moderate candidates. In New York, the breakout star of this election was a Democratic socialist - a progressive who was unapologetic about that fact. They all had a message of affordability, but they messaged very differently. Which of these political types is the future of the party?SABATO: Well, the future for the near term is certainly Sherrill and Spanberger, the two moderate Democrats who were elected governors of two important states, because they showed how it can be done on a broad scale. This is not to diminish Mamdani's victory in New York City, but New York is a bit different. Those of us who have been around for a while know that you don't look to New York City to set the national standard, but you can look to states like New Jersey and Virginia to do so.FADEL: Interesting. You know, as we think about last night's elections, the approval ratings for Democrats in Congress, generally, is quite low. I mean, what do Democrats have to do to win back some of the voters that they have lost in recent years, and what can they learn from what happened last night?SABATO: All three of the big winners - Mamdani, Sherrill and Spanberger - have an important thing in common. They are youthful and energetic. And Mamdani, certainly, is charismatic, and I think to some degree, Spanberger is, too. That's a combination you don't see very often in the Democratic Party - not as often as they need. And that's because the leadership, as we all know, has gotten older.FADEL: So are you saying some of the older leadership - establishment leadership - should be stepping aside to make way?SABATO: Yes. In a word, yes. I think most Democrats would agree with that.FADEL: Now that California, the country's most populous state, has voted for redistricting, where does this leave the fight to change congressional maps across the country?SABATO: The big picture is the Republicans are going to win that battle. They may not win the war, but they're going to win that battle because they have many more states with Republican governors and legislatures that will follow the instructions they're given by Trump and the White House, and they've done so. But Democrats are now fighting back. And the California victory, which was enormous - 62, 63%...FADEL: Yeah. With 7 million voters.SABATO: ...It approached 2-1. Yeah. I mean, it's pretty incredible. That has given Democrats new momentum, new energy and a resolve to at least counteract the Republican effort to the extent they can. So instead of Republicans gaining 12 or 13 additional seats through gerrymandering, maybe they will net only six or seven or eight. That still isn't good news for Democrats, but it's better than alternative.FADEL: Well, what's the news for democracy if each party just gerrymanders its way to power?SABATO: Oh, I think that this is a disaster all the way around. It was initiated by Trump and the White House using Texas. They knew they could get Texas to fall in line, and they pressured a bunch of other states to do the same thing.FADEL: Larry Sabato is a political analyst and the Robert Kent Gooch professor of politics at the University of Virginia. Thank you so much for your time and your insights.SABATO: Thank you very much.(SOUNDBITE OF ONRA'S \"WHERE I'M FROM\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Democrats have gone all-in on their fight to preserve the subsidies, withholding votes 14 times for a Republican-backed short-term spending measure even as shutdown pain ratchets up with flight cancellations, delayed SNAP benefits and missed paychecks for federal workers.   \n   Though Republicans have insisted they will not negotiate on the subsidies until the government reopens, some members are calling for them to be preserved.   The stalemate has underscored the Affordable Care Act debate's lasting imprint on Washington, more than 15 years after it was signed into law. Clashes over health care have continued to animate pivotal moments in American politics, from consequential elections to paper-thin votes in Congress and even a past government shutdown in 2013.   Now the debate has stoked a record-long shutdown, just ahead of midterm elections in 2026, when health care could once again shape the results.   Why some Obamacare critics want to extend its subsidies   For more than a month, Democrats have refused to back a government funding measure without an agreement to extend subsidies for ACA marketplace plans, which expire at the end of the year.   That has left Republicans in a tricky position. While the party broadly dislikes the law, some in Congress have begun to acknowledge they may be stuck with it.   \"This is a big deal in my district,\" said Rep. Jeff Hurd, R-Colo. \"I've heard from a number of people who are facing dramatic increases.\"   Hurd says without the subsidies, constituents in his heavily rural district could lose health coverage.   \n   Like most in his party, Hurd says reopening the government has to come first. He is also one of more than a dozen House Republicans who signed onto a letter calling for them to be preserved. And along with a pair of Democrats, Hurd and Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., outlined a bipartisan framework this week to temporarily extend the subsidies.   Even the conservative firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., has called for keeping them, despite her sharp criticism of Obamacare, saying the cost of health care is a top issue in her deep red district.   \n   \"The toothpaste is out of the tube,\" Greene wrote on X this month.   When the Affordable Care Act passed with zero Republican votes, this kind of acceptance would have been hard to imagine.   Fights over the ACA helped fuel a 2013 shutdown. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) held the Senate floor for more than 21 hours, railing against Obamacare and memorably reading from Dr. Seuss' Green Eggs and Ham.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen.

Fred Upton, R-Mich., who chaired a key committee that tried to work on a substitute. \"Here we are today, and there's still no alternative. It's been 15 years. It's not gonna go away.\"   Today, Upton says letting the subsidies expire could be disastrous for many Michiganders.   Even House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has acknowledged that Obamacare is unlikely to be repealed.   Johnson and other Republicans, including President Trump, who talked about \"concepts of a plan\" to replace the ACA during a presidential debate last fall, have struggled to articulate concrete reforms.   \"These ideas have been on paper for a long time,\" Johnson said recently. \"There's volumes of this stuff. We've been working on it since day one of this Congress.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., speaks during a press conference on Capitol Hill on Monday.

More than half of marketplace enrollees live in Republican congressional districts.   \n   \"They're more likely to live in rural areas, to own a small business or be farmers,\" she said.   An October survey of competitive congressional districts by Republican pollster John McLaughlin, who has worked with Trump during each of his campaigns, also found overwhelming support for extending the subsidies. He says the results have been put in front of top advisers at the White House.   \"Voters are definitely more likely to vote for somebody who's gonna support a healthcare tax credit that they can use versus those who might oppose it,\" McLaughlin said in an interview.   \n   Some Democrats hoped Trump would get involved and cut a deal on subsidies to end the shutdown. But Trump has continued to bash Obamacare and has yet to embrace an extension of the subsidies.   And many rank-and-file Republicans remain skeptical of the Affordable Care Act, including Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a gastroenterologist.   \"Obamacare has become the 'Unaffordable Care Act,\" Cassidy said. \"And the reforms that were supposed to lower costs are now being papered over with more and more subsidies.\"   Hurd, the Colorado congressman, agrees the subsidies only address a symptom of the ballooning cost of health care. Still, he says extending them is an imperative for him and many colleagues — and hopes this can also be an opportunity for a bipartisan conversation about health care.   \"Whether it's something they're public about or not, if you're genuinely serious about serving your constituents, this ought to be something on your radar screen,\" Hurd said.   Why Democrats are all-in on their healthcare push   Meanwhile, Democrats are betting enormous political capital as they hold out for a subsidies deal, emboldened by what happened in 2018, when candidates running on health care swept the party back into the House majority.   That year, Andy Kim ran for a Republican-held congressional district in New Jersey. The incumbent, Rep. Tom MacArthur, was a key player in efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, authoring an amendment that would have allowed states to waive the ACA ban on denying coverage over pre-existing conditions.   \n   \"Everyone was furious,\" Kim recalled. \"He really touched a third rail.\"   That year in Michigan, Democrat Elissa Slotkin also challenged a Republican incumbent on health care.   \"I think it was the dominant issue,\" Slotkin said. \"My experience with my mom not having insurance when she was diagnosed with Stage 4 ovarian cancer just meant that a lot of people wanted to talk about it and I had a lot to say.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., says she does not know if healthcare will play the same driving role for Democrats as it did in 2018. But she says there is reason to believe it will. Above, Slotkin speaks at the Center for American Progress on June 26, 2025, in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Kevin Wolf/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kevin Wolf/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Kim and Slotkin won their races — part of a blue wave that gave Democrats control of the House. Eight years later, they are in the Senate, where Democrats have refused to back a stopgap spending bill without a deal to extend expiring ACA subsidies. Open enrollment began Nov. 1, when many Americans discovered that their premiums without the subsidies next year will skyrocket.   \"That's 500,000 people in my state alone,\" Slotkin said. \"You're talking about people who are going to be doubling their costs and then therefore deciding not to keep health care coverage.\"   \"I think what's really telling is that we see not just majorities, but large majorities, of Republicans, independents and Democrats saying that they want Congress to extend the enhanced premium tax credits,\" KFF's Kirzinger said.   \n   KFF has been polling on the ACA for years. The 2010 law is more popular than ever, a sea change from 15 years ago, when Americans were more evenly divided on the law.   \"The best thing that happened to the Affordable Care Act politically was when Republicans started trying to take it away,\" said Meredith Kelly, a top Democratic congressional committee staffer during the 2018 midterms.   Leading up to that cycle, Kelly worried that Obamacare was a political liability for Democratic candidates. But then, with Trump in office, Republicans moved to destroy it.   \"I think that the 2018 cycle was a massive turning point for the popularity of the ACA,\" Kelly said. \"And I think that's in great part because Democrats worked really hard that cycle to help Americans understand what Republicans were ripping away.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., accompanied by Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., points to a poster depicting rising medical costs if Congress allows the Affordable Care Act tax credits to expire as he speaks to reporters at the U.S. Capitol on Oct. 15, 2025.\n                \n                    Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Democrats think health care will resonate again in the 2026 midterms, despite the onslaught of news that has characterized Trump's second term. Riding the Senate subway, Kim says 2018 was chaotic, too, and still the health care message cut through.   \n   \"I think sometimes we don't remember how turbulent and crazy the first term was as well,\" Kim said.   Hustling to another vote on the Republican funding bill, Slotkin said she does not know whether health care will play the same driving role it did in 2018. But she says there is reason to believe it will.   \"Among all of the major ways people are paying more and the cost of living is going up, I can't think of something that is more personal than health care,\" she said.   Will the shutdown reshape the health care debate?   Throughout the shutdown, Republicans have slammed the high cost of the subsidies, calling them a relic of the pandemic-era and no longer needed. They also have accused Democrats of holding the government hostage to extract policy concessions, putting federal workers and others in the crosshairs.   \"I'm still at a loss as to what exactly they're trying to get out of this,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Tuesday. \"While they may believe politically that it's in their best interests, it's certainly not in the best interests of the American people ... Nobody wins. Shutdowns are stupid.\"   Kelly, the Democratic strategist, thinks Democrats will win that argument in the long run.   \"What I do hope the American people understand before next November is that Democrats are on the side of lowering their costs and protecting their health care, and Republicans are not,\" she said. \"That will be the lasting impact of this shutdown.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in the East Room of the White House on March 23, 2010 in Washington, D.C. Fifteen years later, the political debate over the law continues to dominate in Congress.\n                \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Not all Democrats agree that the shutdown consequences will be worth it. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., has been one of three in her caucus voting with Republicans to reopen the government.   \"I don't think we should swap the pain of some Americans for others,\" she told reporters. \"I think we can keep the government open and address the looming crisis of the health care cliff that we are seeing.\"   \n   Republicans hoped more Democrats would see it that way as the shutdown dragged on. This week, some have signaled they may now accept just the promise of a vote on the subsidies.   For now, the shutdown may soon stretch into a sixth week, with the subsidies still set to expire.\n",

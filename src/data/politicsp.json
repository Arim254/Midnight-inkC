Standing in the Rose Garden last April, President Trump proclaimed what he called \"liberation day,\" a day that \"will be remembered as the day American industry was reborn.\"        Oral arguments in the case are set for 10 a.m. ET. Listen here:    Loading... \n      Carrying out his campaign pledge to impose massive tariffs on foreign imports, Trump issued an executive order that initially imposed a tariff of at least 10% on goods from most countries doing business with the United States. Goods from countries like China have been hit with much higher tariffs — up to 145%, though they have since come down. Imports from allies like Canada and Mexico have been taxed at 25%; Canada's rate was later increased to 35%. In an interview with CBS' 60 Minutes this week, Trump credited the tariffs with the deal he just negotiated with China, boasting that without tariffs, China would not have \"come to the table.\"   The case before the court   But the up and down, fluctuating tariffs around the world spooked American businesses, prompting a court challenge, contending that the president had exceeded his authority in imposing the tariffs.   In some two dozen previous cases, the Supreme Court has been largely receptive to Trump's claims of presidential authority, but those victories came on the Supreme Court's emergency docket, allowing Trump policies to take effect on a temporary basis while the litigation played out in the lower courts.   \n   In contrast, the tariff cases are the real deal, with the court having ordered full briefing and expedited arguments in the case, and offering the justices the first real opportunity to say \"no\" to the president.     One of the lead challengers to the tariffs is Victor Owen Schwartz, a wine and spirits importer from upstate New York who has been in business for 40 years.    \"The thing is there's such a misconception out there that foreign entities are paying the tariffs,\" he says, adding: \"I can't say this enough times: Americans are paying the taxes. American business is paying the taxes and it will be passed on to consumers.\"   According to Schwartz, small businesses not only have to worry about fluctuating tariff rates, but the tariffs have also plunged the value of the dollar compared to the euro. When you add up all of these costs, he says, they amount to about 35% more he has to pay for his wines. So, he charges more, eats part of the tariff, and is down to a barebones profit that in the long run, he says, is \"unsustainable.\"    Loading... \n   Or as Schwartz wryly puts it: \"Do you think I can increase the price of Sancerre by 35%?\"   Trump's view    Countering that argument is Trump who sees tariffs as potentially bringing in trillions of dollars to the federal government. They've brought in $195 billion this fiscal year, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group.   \"I always say 'tariffs' is the most beautiful word to me in the dictionary,\" Trump has said, \"because tariffs are going to make us rich as hell. It's going to bring our country's businesses back that left us.\"   Indeed, the tariffs are so important to the president that he flirted with the idea of attending Wednesday's argument. In the end, he decided against being the first president to do that, instead sending his treasury secretary.   Regardless of who is in the court chamber on Wednesday though, the justices certainly know that a ruling against Trump would be a dramatic, even embarrassing, setback for the president, and none of the six conservatives, including three Trump appointees, is likely looking for a confrontation with the nation's chief executive.      \n   The issue the justices must resolve is whether Trump has the power to unilaterally set tariff rates under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, known as IEEPA. Lower courts have ruled that Trump exceeded his authority under both the statute and the Constitution.   But the president argues that both allow him to impose tariffs in order to deal with persistent trade imbalances and to stem the flood of fentanyl coming into the United States. Both, he asserts, present national emergencies and pose a threat to national security.     As Solicitor General D. John Sauer put it in the administration's briefs, were the Supreme Court to invalidate the tariffs, it \"would have catastrophic consequences for our national security, foreign policy, and economy.\"  And he said, that were the court to rule against the president, it would \"lead to dangerous diplomatic embarrassment.\"   While the administration conceded in the lower courts that this is the first time in the 50-year history of IEEPA that any president has tried to use the statute to impose tariffs on his own, it continues to maintain that the Trump tariffs are beyond the jurisdiction of the courts altogether, and that the only check on presidentially imposed tariffs would be if Congress were to specifically reject them.   Arguments against tariffs     Countering that argument at the Supreme Court on Wednesday, lawyer Neal Katyal will tell the justices that the word \"tariff\" isn't even in the IEEPA statute and that there is \"zero\" authority under the statute to justify such sweeping presidential authority when the constitution itself gives the legislature, not the president, the power to tax.     \"The idea that every president had this power all along—Presidents Reagan to Obama— and none of them knew it and all of them have been spending all this time negotiating with Congress to try and get tariff authority when they had it from the start, is just too fanciful to believe,\" Katyal asserts.   \n   He notes that Congress has created \"an extensive trade architecture\" governing everything from how a president may deal with trade deficits to national security questions. For instance, a different statute does allow the president to increase tariffs by 15% when there is a serious trade deficit, but only for 150 days.   \"The president has said, 'I can blow past all of those things and do whatever I want,'\" says Katyal.  And that, he maintains, is contrary to the nation's history dating from its founding.   \"That is why we had the Boston Tea Party. It is why our Revolutionary War was fought. The idea that you can tax Americans through the monarch's decision alone is as foreign to our Constitution and our traditions as anything I have ever seen.\"   IEEPA wasn't aimed at tariffs or taxes at at all, says Katyal's co-counsel Michael McConnell, a conservative former federal judge appointed by George W. Bush, who now is director of the Stanford Constitutional Law Center. \"It's a statute about imposing various forms of sanctions, economic sanctions on countries with whom we are in conflict,\" he says, adding, \"It has nothing to do with imposing taxes on Americans for engaging in perfectly lawful trade with friendly nations.\"   One of the issues raised by the challengers is that the administration's argument also fails under the so-called \"major questions doctrine,\" first enunciated by the court's conservatives in 2022. It says that for Congress to delegate a major policy decision to another branch of government, it must be explicit in its text about doing so. But at least one member of the court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh has indicated that in his view at least the major questions doctrine does not apply to foreign affairs and national security.   The briefs filed by interested groups in Wednesday's case are remarkably lopsided, with 38 briefs supporting the challengers, representing over a thousand organizations and individuals on the right, left, and center of the political spectrum.  Also among those supporting the challengers are a large group of national security experts from previous Republican and Democratic administrations and a similarly diverse set of 44 economists on both the left and right, including four Nobel prize winners.   \n   On the other side are six briefs, mainly representing individuals, who did not want to be interviewed for this story.   That said, the case is not a slam dunk at all, says conservative scholar Jonathan Adler, of William and Mary Law School.   \"In general, the court is very reluctant to second guess presidential determinations that something implicates national security or that there is an exigency,\" he says.   Of course, just what are exigent circumstances is often in the eye of the beholder, and the current court often rejected the Biden administration's assertion of exigent circumstances.\n",

It takes the title from the most recent shutdown, which stretched from December 2018 to January 2019 during the first Trump administration.   \n   That impasse started with Democrats' refusal to fund President Trump's southern border wall. It ended — 35 days and an estimated $3 billion in lost GDP later — after a series of escalating disruptions, including to air travel, put pressure on Trump and Republicans in Congress to reach a compromise.   This time around, the government shuttered on Oct. 1 after Congress failed to break a stalemate over funding negotiations. More than a month later, an end to the stalemate appears nowhere in sight.   \n   There have been 20 \"funding gaps\" since Congress introduced the modern budget process in 1976, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, but many of those were only a few days long. Before now, only three funding lapses shut down the government for more than two weeks — and they were all within the last 30 years. (There was another shutdown in 1978, but that was before funding gaps halted government operations the way they do today.)   While Republicans control both chambers, they need 60 votes to pass a spending bill in the Senate. Democrats are using that as leverage to push for an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that are due to expire at the end of this year, potentially leaving millions of Americans without health insurance. Republicans have said they are open to talks on the subsidies — but only after the government reopens.   In the meantime, both parties are pointing the finger at each other and doing little, at least publicly, to reopen the government. The Senate has now tried — and failed — 14 times to pass a House-approved stopgap funding bill. The House, meanwhile, has been out of session since the shutdown began.   Americans are feeling the worsening impacts every day.   \n   Over 1 million federal workers are working without paychecks. Another roughly 600,000 have been furloughed, and although a 2019 law ensures they are entitled to backpay after the shutdown is over, recent comments by President Trump have left many worried about whether that will still happen.   Air traffic control shortages have caused delays and disruptions at airports across the country. National park sites are reducing operations and Smithsonian museums are closed. The IRS furloughed nearly half its staff, creating delays in taxpayer services. Tens of thousands of children from low-income families are now at risk of losing access to the Head Start program.   \n   And, federal food and nutrition benefits such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) stopped over the weekend, prompting widespread outcry and pushback from two federal judges. In response, the Trump administration says it will restart those payments — but they will be delayed and may only be for half the amount people typically get.   In a weekend interview with CBS News, Trump continued to place blame on Democrats, and called on Senate Republicans to end the filibuster to bypass Democrats altogether. Senate Republicans have rejected that plea.   Trump acknowledged that his involvement helped bring an end to the previous shutdown, but didn't appear as willing to compromise this time: \"I'm not gonna do it by being extorted by the Democrats who have lost their way.\"\n",

Today's top stories   NPR's senior political editor/correspondent Domenico Montanaro joins the newsletter today to break down the 2025 off-year elections.   Up and down the ballot, Democrats did well, from the marquee gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey to a key redistricting ballot initiative in California and even state Supreme Court races in Pennsylvania. Here are five takeaways from the 2025 off-year elections:   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Voters cast their ballots at a polling station on Nov. 4, 2025, in Arlington, Virginia. Virginians hit the polls on Election Day to pick their next governor.\n                \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n    It's still the cost of living, stupid. Prices, prices, prices. Affordability was a through line in most of the races Tuesday. President Trump's lack of focus on it likely hurt his party, as voters overwhelmingly sided with Democrats on the economy. Republicans still have a Trump problem — in two different ways. Republican candidates are in a quandary — Trump is unpopular and a drag with independents, but without him on the ballot, they continue to have problems turning out base voters. The Trump slump with Latinos appears to be real. Trump made inroads with Latinos in 2024, but that has slid backward. Latinos chose Democrats in the governors' races by 2-to-1 margins. The redistricting arms race is on, and Democrats got a boost Tuesday on that front. Yes on Prop 50 won big, giving Democrats a chance to counterbalance GOP efforts to squeeze out more Republican House seats. It was a big win for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, too. The Democratic Party will have to wrestle with its identity over the next year. From Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York to Abigail Spanberger for Virginia governor, there's going to be a real debate on how best for Democrats to present themselves to win in next year's midterm elections.   \n   Stay informed with more news and analysis by subscribing to the NPR Politics newsletter and listening to the NPR Politics podcast.   Today marks day 36 of the ongoing government shutdown, making it the longest in U.S. history. It takes the title from the most recent shutdown, which stretched from December 2018 to January 2019 during President Trump's first term in office. With no end in sight, Americans are feeling the worsening impacts every day, from disruptions at airports across the U.S. to federal workers going without a paycheck. Here's how this shutdown compares to previous ones.   The Supreme Court hears arguments today on whether Trump can unilaterally set tariff rates under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Lower courts say he has exceeded his authority, while Trump argues that the measure allows him to impose tariffs to address trade imbalances and fentanyl imports. Tariffs are generating billions of dollars for the federal government, but they are also raising the costs of goods for consumers and frustrating businesses. Listen to the oral arguments in the case here.   Israeli authorities have arrested and detained the military's top lawyer after she admitted leaking footage of Israeli soldiers sexually abusing a Palestinian detainee at a facility where Israel has held Palestinian prisoners throughout the war in Gaza. The military advocate general, Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, stated in her resignation letter that she authorized the video's release to defuse attacks on investigators handling the case. Tomer-Yerushalmi has now been arrested for leaking the footage.

Up and down the ballot, Democrats did well. That was true whether it was the marquee governors' races in Virginia and New Jersey, where Democrats significantly outperformed 2024 presidential election margins, or even less-closely-watched races like the Virginia House of Delegates, the state supreme court in Pennsylvania and even Georgia Public Service Commission.   And the outcomes very well may have consequences in the near term, for things like the federal government shutdown, in the medium term for the 2026 midterm elections and in the longer term for 2028.   \n   Here are five takeaways from the 2025 off-year elections:   1. It's still the cost of living, stupid.   The old political axiom, coined by former Bill Clinton adviser James Carville is, \"It's the economy, stupid.\" Well, over the last couple of years, more specifically that should be, \"It's the cost of living, stupid.\" Whether it was Democratic President Joe Biden or now Republican President Trump, prices and affordability have proven to be voting motivators.   But Trump has largely ignored it, saying he always felt immigration was more motivating. That came back to bite his party Tuesday night.   \n   The exit polls found that in all four major contests — the governors' races in Virginia and New Jersey, the New York mayor's race and the Proposition 50 battle in California — voters said the economy was the most important issue (or close to it in New Jersey), and they sided with Democrats overwhelmingly.   And that's despite Republicans being seen Tuesday night as best on the issue of crime or immigration in these elections (counting Trump-endorsed Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent in New York).   That's a very bad sign for Republicans and Trump, who clearly now own the economy, despite how much the president continues to try to blame his predecessor.   \n   2. Republicans still have a Trump problem — in two different ways   The president is unpopular and a drag on his party when he's not on the ballot, but also, when he's not on the ballot, the GOP can't seem to turn out conservatives.   Trump's numbers with independents haven't been good since early on in his second term as president, as lots of them disapprove of the job he's doing on the economy and think he's gone too far with how he's approached a policy of mass deportations.   \n   In these elections, according to the exit polls, as of 1 a.m. ET — independents made up a third of the electorate in Virginia, and Democrat Abigail Spanberger won those voters by 19 points in the governor's race. It was a similar story in New Jersey, where they made up 31% and went for Democrat Mikie Sherrill by 13 points.   It's a real quandary for Republicans. It was true during his first term as president, too, that in these non-presidential election years, Trump brings people out to the polls in the wrong way for the GOP. If you're a Republican, that has to be figured out. But so few want to cross Trump, and show a public break with him, that that's unlikely to happen anytime soon for the party en masse.   It's something to watch heading into next year's midterms and into 2028 when Trump is constitutionally ineligible to run again.   3. The Trump slump with Latinos appears to be real   Trump made significant inroads with Latinos during the 2024 presidential election. In fact, no Republican presidential candidate won a higher percentage with Latinos — ever.   But there have been signs that Latinos were moving away from Trump. Poll after poll has shown that, and Tuesday night was the first time it showed up at the ballot box in a significant way. Spanberger and Sherrill, the governors-elect from Virginia and New Jersey respectively, both won Latinos by 2-to-1 margins, according to the exit polls.   \n   Going deeper into New Jersey specifically, Trump won Passaic County in North Jersey, a county that is nearly half Latino, according to the census. He was the first Republican presidential candidate to win it since 1992. Trump won it by 3 points, but Sherrill won it by 15.   There are 10 counties in New Jersey where Latinos make up at least 1-in-5 people, per the U.S. census. Sherrill not only won them all, she expanded Democratic margins and flipped three Trump had won.   \n   For a couple of decades — since Latinos have become a significant political force given their population boom in the country — they had been reliable Democratic voters. But they have increasingly become a bloc that is not necessarily loyal to either party.      Get more updates in the NPR Politics newsletter.      They're particularly worried — like lots of other voters — about the cost of living. And many Latino leaders, including in the Republican Party, have voiced concerns about Trump's approach to immigration — casting a far-wider net than just hardened criminals.   Tuesday's result is likely going to have a lot of smart conservatives privately questioning Trump's policies and biting their nails about winning the group back for their races next year, as they try to hold onto the House.   4. The redistricting arms race is on, and Democrats got a boost Tuesday on that front   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                California Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks during an election night gathering at the California Democratic Party headquarters on Nov. 4, 2025 in Sacramento, California.\n                \n                    Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Practically, maybe the most consequential election Tuesday was the Proposition 50 ballot initiative in California. A yes vote on Prop 50 would temporarily overturn the requirement that California draw its congressional districts via independent commission.   That's exactly what happened — and it wasn't even close.   That wasn't guaranteed at the beginning of this effort a few months ago. It was spearheaded by California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, and with the help of a lot of money and high-profile Democrats like former President Barack Obama, they successfully made it a proxy fight with Trump. They convinced California Democrats that this was necessary to counterbalance Trump's demands on red states, like Texas, to squeeze out more Republican congressional districts to try to ensure GOP control of the House next year.   Now, California is set to redraw its congressional maps, which likely will result in more Democratic seats.   If that wasn't politically significant enough, there was also how Newsom positioned himself. While taking a victory lap, he tried to show he's a Democrat looking to counterbalance Trump not just with congressional districts but as a leader.    \n   Newsom called it a \"good night\" for the Democratic Party, one on the \"ascendancy,\" and \"on its toes rather than on its heels.\" Newsom also chided Trump, calling him \"historically unpopular,\" that he \"promised to make us healthier and wealthier,\" but \"we're sicker and poorer\" and that Trump knows his unpopular position. \"Why else,\" Newsom asked, would Trump try to get more seats out of Texas except to try to \"rig\" next year's elections? Newsom boasted of his state standing \"firm in response\" to Trump.   Democrats have made clear they want a fighter, someone willing to stand up to Trump in any way possible, someone with the guts to, say, bend the rules a little the way Trump might. One wonders who Newsom thinks should lead this \"ascendant\" party?   5. The Democratic Party will have to wrestle with its identity over the next year   There are plenty of people in the party with different ideas on how to lead the party, push a message of affordability and stand up to Trump in the process.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani speaks during an election night event on Nov. 4, 2025.\n                \n                    Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   That brings us to Zohran Mamdani.   No one has captured more attention during this election cycle than Mamdani. The 34-year-old, who is set to become the youngest New York City mayor in more than a century, and the first Muslim to serve in that office, has become a star with progressives — and a villain among conservatives.   Conservatives are very good at creating Democratic bogeymen, and they will try their hardest to make Mamdani, a self-avowed Democratic socialist, the face of the party. Mamdani has plenty of political gifts. The campaign he ran was unique in its ability to reach out to younger voters in authentic ways and on social media. And, unlike a lot of Democrats, who have a hard time squeezing their policy proposals onto a bumper sticker, he was able to communicate his message of affordability clearly.   \n   But he also did nothing to calm his critics Tuesday night. His victory speech was bold and defiant, even beginning by quoting Eugene Debs, a committed socialist who created the Socialist Party of America. The cover of the conservative New York Post Wednesday depicts Mamdani holding up a hammer and sickle, a communist symbol, with the headline: \"THE RED APPLE.\"   He reached out to Jewish New Yorkers in his speech, saying he would aim to fight the \"scourge of antisemitism.\" And he also poked the White House hive. Speaking directly to Trump, he urged him to \"turn the volume up\" before lambasting him over income inequality, union rights and his view of immigrants.   \n   All night, Fox News opted to talk about \"Commie\" Mamdani instead of taking victory speeches from Spanberger and Sherrill. Both women cut a different political profile: both have military or law enforcement backgrounds and tried to reach out to their opponents' voters. So, a large swath of the country on the right didn't hear a Democrat wishing her opponent well, praising her military service and saying she wants to be governor for everyone in the state.   Instead, they were served a heavy dose of red scare.   But is Mamdani now the face, or the \"soul\" of the Democratic Party? New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who also describes herself as a Democratic socialist and was an early Mamdani backer, was asked about that on MSNBC Tuesday night.   \"I don't think that our party needs to have one face,\" she said. \"Our country does not have one face. It's about all of us as a team together. And we all understand the assignment. Our assignment everywhere is to send the strongest fighters for the working class wherever possible. In some places, like Virginia, for the gubernatorial seat, that's going to look like Abigail Spanberger. In New York City, unequivocally, it's Zohran Mamdani.\"   \n   Again, it's the cost of living and affordability that's key. Can Republicans effectively make the next year a debate between capitalism and socialism — or will Democrats be able to band together and sell something on the economy that's better than what's currently in control of Washington?   That's going to be a key question for the 2026 midterms, which kick off now.\n",

The ongoing 36-day closure has sparked disputes over a range of topics — from the separation of powers and the federal workforce, to food assistance and air traffic control.   But at the heart of the impasse is a debate about health care, specifically expiring subsidies for health insurance premiums purchased on the Affordable Care Act marketplace.   Democrats have gone all-in on their fight to preserve the subsidies, withholding votes 14 times for a Republican-backed short-term spending measure even as shutdown pain ratchets up with flight cancellations, delayed SNAP benefits and missed paychecks for federal workers.   \n   Though Republicans have insisted they will not negotiate on the subsidies until the government reopens, some members are calling for them to be preserved.   The stalemate has underscored the Affordable Care Act debate's lasting imprint on Washington, more than 15 years after it was signed into law. Clashes over health care have continued to animate pivotal moments in American politics, from consequential elections to paper-thin votes in Congress and even a past government shutdown in 2013.   Now the debate has stoked a record-long shutdown, just ahead of midterm elections in 2026, when health care could once again shape the results.   Why some Obamacare critics want to extend its subsidies   For more than a month, Democrats have refused to back a government funding measure without an agreement to extend subsidies for ACA marketplace plans, which expire at the end of the year.   That has left Republicans in a tricky position. While the party broadly dislikes the law, some in Congress have begun to acknowledge they may be stuck with it.   \"This is a big deal in my district,\" said Rep. Jeff Hurd, R-Colo. \"I've heard from a number of people who are facing dramatic increases.\"   Hurd says without the subsidies, constituents in his heavily rural district could lose health coverage.   \n   Like most in his party, Hurd says reopening the government has to come first. He is also one of more than a dozen House Republicans who signed onto a letter calling for them to be preserved. And along with a pair of Democrats, Hurd and Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., outlined a bipartisan framework this week to temporarily extend the subsidies.   Even the conservative firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., has called for keeping them, despite her sharp criticism of Obamacare, saying the cost of health care is a top issue in her deep red district.   \n   \"The toothpaste is out of the tube,\" Greene wrote on X this month.   When the Affordable Care Act passed with zero Republican votes, this kind of acceptance would have been hard to imagine.   Fights over the ACA helped fuel a 2013 shutdown. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) held the Senate floor for more than 21 hours, railing against Obamacare and memorably reading from Dr. Seuss' Green Eggs and Ham.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is seen on a television in the Senate Press Gallery as he speaks during a filibuster on the Senate floor on Sept. 24, 2013. Cruz held the Senate floor for more than 21 hours, railing against Obamacare and memorably reading from Dr. Seuss' \"Green Eggs and Ham.\"\n                \n                    Charles Dharapak/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Charles Dharapak/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Former Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor says backlash against the law helped give birth to the Tea Party and later the Make America Great Again movement.   \"There was a lot of trepidation as to what Obamacare was going to mean,\" Cantor said in an interview with NPR. \"Whether you were going to be able to keep your doctor, whether there were going to be 'death panels,' and honestly a concern about the unknown.\"   Over the years, Republicans repeatedly tried to repeal and replace Obamacare.   \"We still faced opposition from within our own ranks,\" said former Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., who chaired a key committee that tried to work on a substitute. \"Here we are today, and there's still no alternative. It's been 15 years. It's not gonna go away.\"   Today, Upton says letting the subsidies expire could be disastrous for many Michiganders.   Even House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has acknowledged that Obamacare is unlikely to be repealed.   Johnson and other Republicans, including President Trump, who talked about \"concepts of a plan\" to replace the ACA during a presidential debate last fall, have struggled to articulate concrete reforms.   \"These ideas have been on paper for a long time,\" Johnson said recently. \"There's volumes of this stuff. We've been working on it since day one of this Congress.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., speaks during a press conference on Capitol Hill on Monday. Johnson is a longtime critic of the Affordable Care Act, but has acknowledged the law is unlikely to be repealed.\n                \n                    Roberto Schmidt/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Roberto Schmidt/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Polls show a majority of Republicans still oppose Obamacare, but the law's popularity has grown, says Ashley Kirzinger, director of survey methodology at the health policy organization KFF. More than half of marketplace enrollees live in Republican congressional districts.   \n   \"They're more likely to live in rural areas, to own a small business or be farmers,\" she said.   An October survey of competitive congressional districts by Republican pollster John McLaughlin, who has worked with Trump during each of his campaigns, also found overwhelming support for extending the subsidies. He says the results have been put in front of top advisers at the White House.   \"Voters are definitely more likely to vote for somebody who's gonna support a healthcare tax credit that they can use versus those who might oppose it,\" McLaughlin said in an interview.   \n   Some Democrats hoped Trump would get involved and cut a deal on subsidies to end the shutdown. But Trump has continued to bash Obamacare and has yet to embrace an extension of the subsidies.   And many rank-and-file Republicans remain skeptical of the Affordable Care Act, including Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a gastroenterologist.   \"Obamacare has become the 'Unaffordable Care Act,\" Cassidy said. \"And the reforms that were supposed to lower costs are now being papered over with more and more subsidies.\"   Hurd, the Colorado congressman, agrees the subsidies only address a symptom of the ballooning cost of health care. Still, he says extending them is an imperative for him and many colleagues — and hopes this can also be an opportunity for a bipartisan conversation about health care.   \"Whether it's something they're public about or not, if you're genuinely serious about serving your constituents, this ought to be something on your radar screen,\" Hurd said.   Why Democrats are all-in on their healthcare push   Meanwhile, Democrats are betting enormous political capital as they hold out for a subsidies deal, emboldened by what happened in 2018, when candidates running on health care swept the party back into the House majority.   That year, Andy Kim ran for a Republican-held congressional district in New Jersey. The incumbent, Rep. Tom MacArthur, was a key player in efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, authoring an amendment that would have allowed states to waive the ACA ban on denying coverage over pre-existing conditions.   \n   \"Everyone was furious,\" Kim recalled. \"He really touched a third rail.\"   That year in Michigan, Democrat Elissa Slotkin also challenged a Republican incumbent on health care.   \"I think it was the dominant issue,\" Slotkin said. \"My experience with my mom not having insurance when she was diagnosed with Stage 4 ovarian cancer just meant that a lot of people wanted to talk about it and I had a lot to say.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., says she does not know if healthcare will play the same driving role for Democrats as it did in 2018. But she says there is reason to believe it will. Above, Slotkin speaks at the Center for American Progress on June 26, 2025, in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Kevin Wolf/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kevin Wolf/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Kim and Slotkin won their races — part of a blue wave that gave Democrats control of the House. Eight years later, they are in the Senate, where Democrats have refused to back a stopgap spending bill without a deal to extend expiring ACA subsidies. Open enrollment began Nov. 1, when many Americans discovered that their premiums without the subsidies next year will skyrocket.   \"That's 500,000 people in my state alone,\" Slotkin said. \"You're talking about people who are going to be doubling their costs and then therefore deciding not to keep health care coverage.\"   \"I think what's really telling is that we see not just majorities, but large majorities, of Republicans, independents and Democrats saying that they want Congress to extend the enhanced premium tax credits,\" KFF's Kirzinger said.   \n   KFF has been polling on the ACA for years. The 2010 law is more popular than ever, a sea change from 15 years ago, when Americans were more evenly divided on the law.   \"The best thing that happened to the Affordable Care Act politically was when Republicans started trying to take it away,\" said Meredith Kelly, a top Democratic congressional committee staffer during the 2018 midterms.   Leading up to that cycle, Kelly worried that Obamacare was a political liability for Democratic candidates. But then, with Trump in office, Republicans moved to destroy it.   \"I think that the 2018 cycle was a massive turning point for the popularity of the ACA,\" Kelly said. \"And I think that's in great part because Democrats worked really hard that cycle to help Americans understand what Republicans were ripping away.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., accompanied by Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., points to a poster depicting rising medical costs if Congress allows the Affordable Care Act tax credits to expire as he speaks to reporters at the U.S. Capitol on Oct. 15, 2025.\n                \n                    Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Democrats think health care will resonate again in the 2026 midterms, despite the onslaught of news that has characterized Trump's second term. Riding the Senate subway, Kim says 2018 was chaotic, too, and still the health care message cut through.   \n   \"I think sometimes we don't remember how turbulent and crazy the first term was as well,\" Kim said.   Hustling to another vote on the Republican funding bill, Slotkin said she does not know whether health care will play the same driving role it did in 2018. But she says there is reason to believe it will.   \"Among all of the major ways people are paying more and the cost of living is going up, I can't think of something that is more personal than health care,\" she said.   Will the shutdown reshape the health care debate?   Throughout the shutdown, Republicans have slammed the high cost of the subsidies, calling them a relic of the pandemic-era and no longer needed. They also have accused Democrats of holding the government hostage to extract policy concessions, putting federal workers and others in the crosshairs.   \"I'm still at a loss as to what exactly they're trying to get out of this,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Tuesday. \"While they may believe politically that it's in their best interests, it's certainly not in the best interests of the American people ... Nobody wins. Shutdowns are stupid.\"   Kelly, the Democratic strategist, thinks Democrats will win that argument in the long run.   \"What I do hope the American people understand before next November is that Democrats are on the side of lowering their costs and protecting their health care, and Republicans are not,\" she said. \"That will be the lasting impact of this shutdown.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in the East Room of the White House on March 23, 2010 in Washington, D.C. Fifteen years later, the political debate over the law continues to dominate in Congress.\n                \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Not all Democrats agree that the shutdown consequences will be worth it. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., has been one of three in her caucus voting with Republicans to reopen the government.   \"I don't think we should swap the pain of some Americans for others,\" she told reporters. \"I think we can keep the government open and address the looming crisis of the health care cliff that we are seeing.\"   \n   Republicans hoped more Democrats would see it that way as the shutdown dragged on. This week, some have signaled they may now accept just the promise of a vote on the subsidies.   For now, the shutdown may soon stretch into a sixth week, with the subsidies still set to expire.\n",

Yesterday, federal workers stayed home from work, national parks prepared to close down and people seeking services from the federal government met a patchwork of availability and access.</p>   <p>In Washington, White House officials and Congressional leaders spent the day pointing blame in public while a small group of lawmakers in the Senate began talks about a potential offramp.</p>   <p>Congressional Republicans were quick to dub the funding lapse \"The Schumer Shutdown\" ‚Äî in a dig at Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., ‚Äî and maintain that the government should be reopened before any bipartisan negotiations begin. Senate Democrats remained largely united in opposition to the short-term spending bill passed by the House earlier this month, as they continue to push for an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies set to expire at the end of the year.</p>   \n   <p>At the White House, Vice President JD Vance warned that federal workforce layoffs would be coming if the shutdown continues, in a break with past precedent of temporary furloughs. Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, also announced that the government would cancel or delay infrastructure and green energy projects that the administration says do not align with their policy goals ‚Äì all in states that voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>   <div>\n            <blockquote><div><p>Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left's climate agenda is being cancelled.

Administration officials at all levels say the push to undo Medicaid cuts Republicans passed this summer amounts to providing health care to undocumented immigrants. </p>   <p>That description does not fully or accurately describe the demands Democrats are making. They want to reverse the Medicaid cuts that were in the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill that Republicans passed the summer. That bill also included a provision that would punish states that provide health coverage to undocumented immigrants. But to be clear, people who are in the country without legal status are not qualified for Medicaid or able to buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act.</p>   \n   <p>The White House is also calling the proposed layoffs one of the \"unfortunate consequences to a government shutdown,\" as press secretary Karoline Leavitt put it on Wednesday. Leavitt and Vance told reporters that a prolonged shutdown would require permanent cuts, even while lapses in spending generally only lead to temporary furloughs.</p>   <p>At the center of those cuts is White House budget director Russ Vought, who was also a key architect of the controversial Project 2025 blueprint, where he advocated for a more activist approach to cutting spending and overhauling the federal workforce.</p>   <p>Now as part of the administration, Vought has expressly stated that the \"appropriations process has to be less bipartisan.\"</p>   <p>Federal employees' unions are <a href=\"https://democracyforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AFGE-AFSCME-Complaint-093025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><u>suing over the Office of Management and Budget memo</u></a> preparing agencies for layoffs during a shutdown. The complaint argues that the Trump administration is \"deviating from historic practice and violating applicable laws.\"</p>   <h3>Top congressional leaders aren't talking, but informal bipartisan talks have started</h3>   <p>A pair of partisan stopgap bills <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/01/nx-s1-5558456/government-shutdown-trump-house\" target=\"_blank\"><u>failed once again in the Senate</u></a> on Wednesday. One bill was the House-passed stopgap bill written by Republicans to fund the government until Nov. 21. The other was an alternative written by Democrats that includes several health care policy changes. Throughout the day top party leaders pointed fingers about who was to blame for the shutdown.</p>   <p>Still, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., aren't engaged in negotiations. Thune has said he's willing to talk about health care once the government reopened.</p>   <p>But a small group of lawmakers from both parties has been huddling in more informal talks.</p>   <p>Groups of lawmakers have been huddling on the Senate floor and in hallways around the chamber working to craft a compromise to reopen government and extend the expiring health care tax credits and subsidies.   </p>   \n   <p>Republicans are floating ways to put income caps on the subsidies or limit the number of people who are eligible to receive them. They also maintain a new plan must eliminate waste from the program. Democrats want to preserve the credits for as many working and middle class people as they can in a bipartisan bill.</p>   <p>Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who has been part of those efforts working on a deal on the health care subsidies, told reporters, \"I am encouraged there are so many people on both sides who think we can work this out.\"</p>   <p>Schumer told reporters Wednesday that he has been pushing for talks for some time, even if he is not directly involved.</p>   <p>\"It's a good thing that Republicans and Democrats are now talking,\" he said.</p>   <p>Thune said he is receiving briefings on the talks and has told people involved to come and talk to him when they have \"critical mass,\" meaning enough votes from Democrats to end a shutdown.</p>   <p>No votes are planned for Thursday to allow lawmakers to observe the Jewish holiday. Senate GOP leaders are expected to call for another vote on Friday on the House-passed stopgap bill that funds federal agencies through November 21. Leaders are still discussing plans for possible weekend votes. But the three times they've attempted to pass the measure did not result in<strong> </strong>the 60 votes needed to advance. Two Democrats ‚Äî Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and John Fetterman of Pennsylvania ‚Äî and one Independent, Angus King of Maine, did vote with most Republicans on that bill on Wednesday, but Thune needs another 5 Democrats to clear it through the chamber.</p>   <p>The House is out of session until October 7.</p>   <p>Loading...</p>\n   <p><em>NPR's Elena Moore and Tamara Keith contributed to this report. </em></p>\n</div>"

But it was enough to throw some major East Coast <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/01/25/688660390/flights-delayed-at-laguardia-newark-airports-as-workers-call-in-sick-amid-shutdo\" target=\"_blank\">airports into chaos</a>.</p>   <p>With <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/series/g-s1-91413/government-shutdown-2025\" target=\"_blank\">another shutdown underway</a>, U.S. airlines are once again bracing for the possibility of delays and disruptions to commercial aviation.</p>   <p>\"You have the reality of human beings, many of [whom] are living paycheck to paycheck,\" said Dennis Tajer, a longtime pilot for American Airlines, and a spokesman for the union that represents its 16,000 pilots. \"It doesn't take long before the system slows down. The safety margin is always protected. But what happens is we meter the amount of aircraft that the system can hold.\"</p>   \n   <p>That's what happened on January 25th, 2019, when a shortage of air traffic controllers forced the FAA to limit traffic at LaGuardia Airport in New York, along with other major airports from Newark, N.J. to Orlando, Fla.</p>   <p>That same day, President Trump agreed to a temporary government funding measure, effectively ending the longest shutdown in U.S. history after 35 days. Exactly how much those disruptions to commercial aviation had to do with the funding deal remains open to interpretation, though some observers think it was an important factor.</p>   \n   <p>Lawmakers in Washington appear far from an agreement to end the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/01/nx-s1-5558456/government-shutdown-trump-house\" target=\"_blank\">current government shutdown</a> that began early Wednesday morning.</p>   <p>Unlike the prior shutdown, the Department of Transportation says it will keep the FAA's air traffic controller training academy open, part of a push to meet its ambitious hiring goals.</p>   <p>Still, the shutdown will hurt the nearly 14,000 current controllers who have to work through it, even though they won't get paid until it ends.</p>   <p>\"It's an unnecessary distraction\" on top of what is already \"one of the most stressful jobs in the entire world,\"  Nick Daniels, the president of National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said in a video message to members posted on Sunday.</p>   \n   <p>\"We have people that will have to decide, do I take a second job? Do I have to do Uber? Do I have to find some source of income during this time?,\" he said.</p>   <p>But Daniels urged controllers to be professional ‚Äî and pleaded with them not to engage in any kind of coordinated job action, because that could prompt the Trump administration to try to decertify the union.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5327x3549+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb1%2F44%2F65fcdf8348bf8f41b76e4f056d5a%2Fgettyimages-2238160970.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5327x3549+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb1%2F44%2F65fcdf8348bf8f41b76e4f056d5a%2Fgettyimages-2238160970.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5327x3549+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb1%2F44%2F65fcdf8348bf8f41b76e4f056d5a%2Fgettyimages-2238160970.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5327x3549+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb1%2F44%2F65fcdf8348bf8f41b76e4f056d5a%2Fgettyimages-2238160970.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5327x3549+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb1%2F44%2F65fcdf8348bf8f41b76e4f056d5a%2Fgettyimages-2238160970.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5327x3549+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb1%2F44%2F65fcdf8348bf8f41b76e4f056d5a%2Fgettyimages-2238160970.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5327x3549+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb1%2F44%2F65fcdf8348bf8f41b76e4f056d5a%2Fgettyimages-2238160970.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5327x3549+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb1%2F44%2F65fcdf8348bf8f41b76e4f056d5a%2Fgettyimages-2238160970.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5327x3549+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb1%2F44%2F65fcdf8348bf8f41b76e4f056d5a%2Fgettyimages-2238160970.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5327x3549+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb1%2F44%2F65fcdf8348bf8f41b76e4f056d5a%2Fgettyimages-2238160970.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5327x3549+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb1%2F44%2F65fcdf8348bf8f41b76e4f056d5a%2Fgettyimages-2238160970.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5327x3549+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb1%2F44%2F65fcdf8348bf8f41b76e4f056d5a%2Fgettyimages-2238160970.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5327x3549+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb1%2F44%2F65fcdf8348bf8f41b76e4f056d5a%2Fgettyimages-2238160970.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5327x3549+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb1%2F44%2F65fcdf8348bf8f41b76e4f056d5a%2Fgettyimages-2238160970.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5327x3549+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb1%2F44%2F65fcdf8348bf8f41b76e4f056d5a%2Fgettyimages-2238160970.jpg\" alt=\"Passengers walk through security lines at Reagan National Airport on the first day of the U.S. government shut down in Arlington, Va.

The government typically decides which employees are considered essential for a temporary shutdown. In this instance, the White House might be attempting to apply this concept to enforce permanent cuts. Multiple federal employee unions say the White House doesn't have the authority to do so.</li><li>üéß <strong>Many vital government services, like Social Security payments and Medicaid, are expected to be unaffected by the shutdown.</strong> However, staffing shortages <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5560670:x\" target=\"_blank\">may lead to delays for some services</a> if the shutdown continues, says NPR's Greg Allen. Among the things most at risk are <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/02/nx-s1-5557289/federal-shutdown-nutrition-aid-wic-snap-benefits-government-funding\" target=\"_blank\">federal food assistance programs</a> such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Carlos Hernandez, a 75-year-old, visited a SNAP office in Maryland yesterday to renew his benefits, only to find the office closed. Hernandez said he worries about what the shutdown could mean for his benefits.</li><li>‚û°Ô∏è <strong>Multiweek shutdowns are relatively rare</strong>, but have become more common in recent decades. Here's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/01/nx-s1-5559267/government-shutdown-length-history\" target=\"_blank\">how long past shutdowns have lasted</a>.</li><li>‚û°Ô∏è <strong>A shortage of air traffic controllers may have helped end</strong> the last government shutdown in 2019. Now, U.S. airlines are once again <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/02/nx-s1-5560219/air-traffic-controllers-ending-government-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\">bracing for possible delays</a> in commercial flights.</li></ul>   \n   <p><strong>Israel has instructed all residents of Gaza City to evacuate to allow for an expanded ground operation.</strong> Israel's defense minister stated that anyone remaining in Gaza City will be considered \"militants and supporters of terror.\" According to the United Nations director for Gaza operations, on average, about 100 Palestinians are being killed daily as a result of Israel's attacks. <br /></p>   <ul><li>üéß <strong>This is all happening as President Trump's 20-point peace proposal remains on the table</strong>, awaiting a response from Hamas, says NPR's Emily Feng. The proposal has <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5560670:x\" target=\"_blank\">run into challenges</a>, including far-right ministers in Israel being infuriated that the plan would let Palestinians stay in Gaza and not forcibly displaced. Qatar is helping mediate the ceasefire negotiations, but trust is thin, especially after Israel tried to kill Hamas negotiators in Qatar in September. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized for that action this week.</li></ul>   <p><strong>Democratic Gov. of Kentucky Andy Beshear is considering running for president.</strong> He has won the election for governor twice, excelling in a state that voted for Trump three times. The feat is something Kentucky Republicans have dismissed as a quirk. Beshear discusses changes he believes Democrats need to make in an NPR interview with <em>Morning Edition</em> host Steve Inskeep.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>Three Senate Democrats broke with their party and voted with Republicans to fund the government and avert a shut down. One of them, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, explains her reasoning.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>SCOTT DETROW, HOST: </p><p> The federal government is in the first day of a shutdown. The shutdown began at midnight last night. That's when the most recent funding bill expired. Senate Democrats blocked a bill funding government operations in an effort to try and get Republicans to agree to extend soon-to-expire health care subsidies and other health care-related funding. It is a move that carries political risks, but one that most Democratic members of Congress are on board with. One of the few exceptions is Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, who voted along with Republicans for the funding bill. Cortez Masto joins us now. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.</p><p>CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: Hello, Scott. Great to join you.</p><p>DETROW: Let's start with that. Why did you break ranks with so many other Democrats on this vote?</p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Well, you know, coming from Nevada, I know it was important to avoid a costly shutdown that would harm Nevadans. And I honestly didn't think it would be appropriate to hand more power to this reckless administration. I think it's important for us to really work in a bipartisan way to solve problems, including addressing this looming health care crisis that we have. I see it in Nevada when I'm home. And we should be working together to solve those problems. We don't need to shut down the government to do that.</p><p>DETROW: We saw you in a lot of animated conversations on the Senate floor last night around this vote. Do other Democrats share your concerns, Democrats who might've voted for the shutdown?</p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Well, absolutely. I think we are all seeing because of the unfortunate policies of this administration, the Republicans in control. In our own home states, we're seeing it. I'm seeing it in Nevada, high costs, right? An economy in slowdown, this looming health care crisis. The last legislation that the Republicans passed, they took away Medicaid for millions of Americans. And now we're on the cusp of taking away the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>DETROW: Well...</p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Many people in my state are harmed by this. And so it does require us to really focus on how we solve these problems and talk and work and get together as members of Congress, do our job, pass appropriations bills but solve problems for Americans. And this is part of why we need to continue to work. And I will be focused on talking to my colleagues across the aisle and with my colleagues in my own caucus to figure out how we come out of this and solve these problems.</p><p>DETROW: Well, then I want to get your take on one of the arguments that many of your Democratic colleagues are saying, that this is truly the only point that the minority party has to exert leverage at the moment in Congress, especially given how little the Trump administration is negotiating with Democrats on most things. So why not? If you have those concerns, if you see this as a crisis, what is your argument against using the leverage of a shutdown to try and address it?</p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Well, I've just said, I was just home in Nevada. I was talking to so many people. The challenge we have right now is high costs. I see it in Nevada, grocery costs, clothing, energy costs. I also know that we are seeing a downturn in our tourism economy nationally because of the policies of this administration. And as you well know, Scott, it impacts Nevada. Las Vegas is the gold standard for tourism and travel around the world, and we are seeing an impact to our tourism and travel industry as well. Those are hundreds of thousands of jobs...</p><p>DETROW: I want to...</p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: ...In Nevada. But let me just add...</p><p>DETROW: Yeah. Yeah.</p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: I also know that a shutdown would also harm many of my independent contractors that are my skilled labor. And they work out at the test site. There's a couple hundred of them that would lose their jobs. And so my challenge here is, I don't believe in really this idea that we have to harm some Americans to solve problems for others. I think the goal here is for all of us to work together to help everyone and solve Americans' problems. And that includes around this health care crisis.</p><p>DETROW: The shutdown is underway, as you know. Happens, when this begins, both sides are blaming the other in different ways. I want to play you something that Vice President Vance said at a White House briefing today.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>JD VANCE: The Democrats did nothing to help us. In fact, we would've loved to have the Democrats helping us, but they didn't. They talk about doing something. They don't actually do the hard work of making it happen.</p><p>DETROW: How concerned are you that as this goes on, as those economic effects that you're worried about start to take place, that it's Democrats who will get the blame for this impasse?</p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Yeah, let me jump back here and first just say that's a lie. And what's coming out of the vice president's mouth...</p><p>DETROW: What specifically?</p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: That the Democrats weren't willing to talk. It's a lie. And I can point to a number of things where there's mischaracterizations. But more importantly, we have the White House and the president of the United States and the vice president, instead of trying to bring the sides together to work to solve this problem, they are throwing mischaracterizations out there. They're lying. And they're not trying to help, and they're not being constructive to help us solve this problem.</p><p>So with that said, this is the role of Congress, to appropriate and to keep this government open. And that's why, for me, in the Senate, I will continue to reach across the aisle to my colleagues, figure out where we can come together to open up this government and solve the problems around the health care crisis that we have right now. And I'm telling you, the looming one is this cliff for the Affordable Care Act. That is going to impact people in my state, working families in my state and their children...</p><p>DETROW: Senator...</p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: ...Who rely on the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>DETROW: We're just about out of time for this segment, though. But I really appreciate you joining us. That is Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto. Thank you so much.</p><p>CORTEZ MASTO: Thank you, Scott.</p>\n    <p>Copyright ¬© 2025 NPR.

But one of the first things that could get hit is the nutrition assistance that many pregnant women and new parents depend on.</p>   <p>It's been crucial for Lucia Graves, who found out she was pregnant back in March 2020, just days before the world shut down for the Covid-19 pandemic. She was a waitress at the time and on her own financially.</p>   <p>\"So here I am like, 'Oh my goodness. I have this baby on the way, and now I have no job,' \" she says.</p>   \n   <p>Graves lives in Lebanon, N.H. She had pregnancy complications, her daughter was born a month early, and after breastfeeding just a short while, her milk ran dry. It was a big relief when a social worker said Graves was eligible for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, which is known as WIC.</p>   <p>\"They were able to cover baby formula, which is huge,\" she says. \"They gave us like 10 or 12 cans each [month]. That still didn't cover everything that my child needed, but it covered a lot.\"</p>   <p>WIC also provides breastfeeding support, nutrition counseling and serves children up to age 5. That's <a href=\"https://www.nwica.org/press-releases/national-wic-association-statement-on-reversal-of-federal-funding-freeze\" target=\"_blank\"><u>nearly 7 million people in all</u></a>, including nearly half of all infants born in the U.S.</p>   <p>Graves is now engaged, and her fianc√© also has a young daughter. Both girls are eligible for $26 a month for fruit and vegetables, plus a list of WIC-approved groceries. If that ends, she says it would be harder to eat healthier and to make ends meet.</p>   <p>\"The prices of milk, the prices of eggs, prices of bread. All of these things are, like, astronomical,\" she says. \"So it would be a huge hit to us.\"</p>   <p>That hit could come a lot sooner than in the last government shutdown, in 2018. That's because this one falls right at the start of the federal fiscal year. Since Congress has not yet passed a new budget, there's no new money for agencies to spend.</p>   \n   <p>\"We have a really short runway here before we would reach a real crisis in program operations,\" says Nell Menefee-Libey with the National WIC Association. She calculates that runway at about two weeks.</p>   <p>The money to keep things going for that long will come from a contingency fund, whatever's left over from last year's budget and rebates from infant formula companies, she says. Then states would need to fill the gap. \"And there will also be some variation between states, because they may have different amounts of resources on hand,\" she says.</p>   <p>The day before the shutdown, <a href=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/2025/09/30/colorado-food-assistance-shutdown/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Colorado lawmakers approved</u></a> $7.5 million to fund WIC in their state. The last time the government shut down, states got reimbursed for that spending.</p>   <p><a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/wic-works-addressing-the-nutrition-and-health-needs-of-low-income-families\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Research shows</u></a> WIC improves pregnancy and birth outcomes, <a href=\"https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/population-family-and-reproductive-health/research-and-practice/life-course-framework/child-and-adolescent-health/women-infants-and-children-program-wic/hpril/about-the-project/background\" target=\"_blank\"><u>children's development</u></a> and their lifelong diet, all of which reduces healthcare costs. But if the shutdown drags out, Menefee-Libey says some WIC offices will have to triage. That will mean prioritizing women who are pregnant and breastfeeding, and turning away pre-school-age kids.</p>   <p>\"If people are turned away, you don't get them back,\" she says. \"That is the opportunity to reach your family during these really critical and vulnerable life stages. And turning someone away means losing an opportunity for a healthy future for a child.\"</p>   <p>Beyond WIC, the country's much larger food aid program ‚Äî the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP ‚Äî is in better shape moneywise. That's because the debit-like cards people use to buy food are loaded a month in advance.</p>   <p>\"Their benefits are going to be there for October. And anyone who is eligible should feel free to apply,\" says Gina Plata-Nino with the Food Research & Action Center.</p>   <p>Food banks are also still open and prepping for more demand from federal contractors and employees who are now furloughed or forced to work without pay.</p>   \n   <p>During the last shutdown, \"we did have people in suits waiting at food banks,\" Plata-Nino says. \"Because there was no money coming in, and people had to pay their rent.\"</p>   <p>She hopes it won't come to that this time.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n         <p>Democrat Andy Beshear has twice won election as governor of Kentucky ‚Äî thriving in a state that has voted for Donald Trump three times.</p>   <p>Now Beshear is considering a run for president. He discussed what he believes Democrats need to change in an NPR all-platform interview, which included a video and special podcast episode, as well as reports on the <em>Up First </em>podcast and <em>Morning Edition.</em></p>   <p>He has a lower national profile than another contender, California's Gavin Newsom. He's also less well known than some previous guests in the NPR interview series ‚Äî <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/17/g-s1-89190/jb-pritzker-tenessee-memphis-national-guard\" target=\"_blank\">JB Pritzker</a>,<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/28/nx-s1-5475197/buttigieg-trump-democrats-election-2028\" target=\"_blank\"> Pete Buttigieg </a>and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5306406/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-politics-interview\" target=\"_blank\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>. But he has a credential others lack: winning statewide in a very red state. (A red <em>commonwealth, </em>to be exact; it's the Commonwealth of Kentucky.) In a party eager for new leadership, he is 47.</p>   \n   <p>Kentucky Republicans dismiss his success as a quirk: The son of a popular former governor, Beshear won races in 2019 and 2023, which were not presidential election years. Many of Trump's backers stayed home. Still he received credit for his handling of the pandemic and a string of natural disasters. A major theme of our interview was how Democrats can improve their dismal showing among rural and red-state voters.</p>   <p>You can view the interview above. Here are some highlights:</p>   <h3>He says Trump owns any damage from the government shutdown</h3>   <p>Beshear took note of the president's threat to permanently <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/26/nx-s1-5553544/trump-administration-threatens-large-scale-layoffs-if-government-shuts-down\" target=\"_blank\">fire federal employees</a> as a way to pressure Democrats.</p>   <p>\"If he fires a bunch of people, it's not because Democrats wouldn't reach a deal. It's because the president decides and actually fires people,\" he said. <strong>\"</strong>People aren't a negotiating tool. They are not a prop. And that's how he's treating these families.\"</p>   <p>Some political analysts have suggested that Democrats needed a shutdown, having failed in almost every other way to slow down Trump from enacting his agenda. Beshear said he supported the shutdown only because Democrats settled on an issue affecting millions of people: Obamacare subsidies that expire later this year.</p>   <h3>He makes the case for nominating a Democrat from a red state</h3>   <p>Beshear has sharply criticized Trump ‚Äî calling his address this week to military leaders \"un-American.\" Yet, he told us that within his state \"the temperature is turned down,\" and in some cases people are \"willing to vote for people of both parties.\"</p>   \n   <h3>He says Democrats can win more votes if they show \"respect\"</h3>   <p>Beshear won two elections in a state where many voters are socially conservative, and Republicans do not let him forget it. Months before the 2023 vote, the legislature passed a bill restricting care for transgender youth.</p>   <p>\"And I knew they did it in part so that they could run tens of millions of dollars of negative ads if I vetoed it. But I did veto it because it was the right thing to do,\" he said. \"My faith teaches me that all children are children of God, and I didn't want these kids being picked on.\" He added that explaining the reason shows voters respect.</p>   <h3>He argues that Democrats can bring more states back into play¬†</h3>   <p>As recently as 2008, Democrats had senators from rural and red states ranging from Montana to Arkansas to North Carolina, achieving a 60-vote supermajority. In that year's presidential election, Barack Obama won Iowa and Indiana. Today it's hard for Democrats to conceive of winning a 51-seat Senate majority, and the electoral map for the next presidential election will again be a challenge.</p>   <p>\"The Democratic Party needs to invest,\" Beshear said, offering himself as proof that the party can win in unexpected places. \"Democrats can win back voters in those rural areas, especially with what we're seeing right now. But Democrats need to be the common sense, common ground, get results, type of party, one that spends 80% of its time on concerns that impact 100% of the American population.\"</p>   <p><em>The radio version was produced and edited by Adam Bearne and Reena Advani, with digital editing by Majd Al-Waheidi.</em></p>\n</div>"

Schumer and Jeffries are key Democrats in the budget dispute with the White House.</p>   <p>\"Roughly $18 billion in New York City infrastructure projects have been put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles,\" said Russell Vought, head of the federal Office of Management and Budget, <a href=\"https://x.com/russvought/status/1973386129320665329\" target=\"_blank\">in a post on X</a>.</p>   \n   <p><a href=\"https://x.com/USDOT/status/1973404678302957684\" target=\"_blank\">In a separate post</a>, the U.S. Department of Transportation explicitly linked the federal review to the shutdown, saying, \"USDOT's review of New York's unconstitutional practices will take more time\" because of the budget impasse.  Officials said a disbursement of $300 million in funding for New York's  Second Avenue subway project would be affected immediately.</p>   <p>The $18 billion cut targets money for two major transportation projects. One is construction of a rail tunnel under the Hudson River between New York and New Jersey, due for completion in the next decade. It is a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-new-york-city-business-94a9e170a3348c74a3545ece08f15687\" target=\"_blank\"><u>priority for Schumer</u></a> and was backed by former President Joe Biden. The second is the Second Avenue project in the New York City subway system.</p>   <p>Schumer, Jeffries and other Democratic leaders in New York have rejected the Trump administration's claim that the federal shutdown is being caused by Democratic lawmakers.  </p>   <p>\"Republicans JUST VOTED DOWN our bill to avoid a government shutdown at midnight and address the healthcare needs of the American people,\" <a href=\"https://x.com/SenSchumer/status/1973172052443222341\" target=\"_blank\">Schumer wrote on X</a> in the hours before the shutdown began.  \"Republicans are plunging us into a government shutdown rather than fixing their healthcare crisis.\"</p>   <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxD2A66V2Jw\" target=\"_blank\">During a press conference on Wednesday,</a> Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, also blamed the shutdown on Trump and Republican leaders.  \"They hold all the levers of power,\" Hochul said, while predicting the shutdown would inflict \"pain on millions of Americans.\" Hochul also rejected the administration's claim that the cuts to the New York projects are related to DEI, saying it was trying to use \"culture wars\" as the reason.</p>   \n   <p><a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/trump-halts-money-for-nyc-infrastructure-projects-says-minority-contract-rules-are-unconstitutional\" target=\"_blank\">In a statement, Hochul also condemned </a>the freezing of infrastructure dollars:  \"We've done our part, we're ready to build, it's underway,\" Hochul said</p>   <p>This isn't the first time Trump has opposed funding for massive infrastructure projects in New York City.  During his first term, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/03/20/595344923/wh-threatening-to-veto-spending-bill-if-it-includes-money-for-northeast-rail-tun\" target=\"_blank\">Trump threatened to veto funding</a> for a long-delayed, costly rail tunnel under the Hudson River.  </p>   <p>Trump has also previously threatened funding for New York City in order to apply political pressure on Democratic leaders and influence New York politics.  Just this week, he said he would cut off all federal dollars for the city if voters elect state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani as mayor.</p>   <p>\"Remember, he needs the money from me, as President, in order to fulfill all of his FAKE Communist promises,\" <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115287641147640374\" target=\"_blank\">Trump posted on his social media platform</a>.  \"He won't be getting any of it, so what's the point of voting for him?\" </p>   <p>Mamdani is not a communist.  The state Assemblyman, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, has led the mayoral race for months.  He currently faces independent Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.  The current mayor, Eric Adams, dropped out of the contest on Sunday. Polls show Mamdani as the frontrunner.</p>   <p><a href=\"https://x.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1973387082396467256\" target=\"_blank\">In a post on X, Mamdani also blasted Trump</a> over the federal government shutdown.  \"They shut it down because they're determined to strip healthcare from millions of Americans, to enrich the billionaires they serve, to continue the assault on our rights,\" he wrote.</p>\n</div>"

Since 2021, those have kept ACA plans affordable for people who get their insurance this way. </p>   <p>Earlier this week, Democrats in the Senate <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/30/nx-s1-5555966/government-shutdown-democrats-elizabeth-warren-healthcare\" target=\"_blank\">refused to vote</a> for the Republican short-term funding bill that did not include an extension of the enhanced premium tax credits.</p>   <p>So why do they matter?</p>   \n   <p>The enhanced tax credits are important for people who don't get health insurance through their job or a public program like Medicare or Medicaid. This year enrollment hit a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/08/nx-s1-5252585/affordable-care-act-trump-biden-health-insurance-deadline\" target=\"_blank\">record 24 million</a>.</p>   <p>That is only about 7% of the U.S. population, but the people who rely on these plans are an influential group that includes small business owners, farmers and ranchers, says <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/person/cynthia-cox/\" target=\"_blank\">Cynthia Cox</a>, vice president and director of the Program on the ACA at the nonpartisan health research organization KFF.</p>   <p>Cox and her team just did <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/\" target=\"_blank\">an analysis</a> on what will happen to people's premiums next year if Congress doesn't extend the enhanced subsidies.</p>   <p>\"On average, we're expecting premium payments by enrollees to increase by 114%,\" she says.</p>   <p>That means a lot of people are going to have to pay double the monthly premium they're paying now.</p>   \n   <p>Or, says Cox, they might have to switch to a higher-deductible plan, change jobs to one that offers insurance, or they might lose their coverage.</p>   <p>The Congressional Budget Office <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-09/61734-Health.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">estimates</a> that 4 million people will become uninsured if the enhanced tax credits expire. </p>   <p>It also estimates that extending the policy will cost the government a lot ‚Äî $350 billion over 10 years.</p>   <p>Premium tax credits have been critical to increasing enrollment in ACA plans.</p>   <p>When the ACA was passed in 2010, Congress created a sliding scale to give people a break on their premiums based on income. But premiums were still too high for a lot of people and those with incomes above 400% of the federal poverty level had to pay full price, says <a href=\"https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014RXPVAA4/sabrina-corlette\" target=\"_blank\">Sabrina Corlette</a>, project director at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.</p>   \n   <p>\"So there was a chunk of folks who just were really struggling to afford\" their premiums, she says. And enrollment was sluggish.</p>   <p>So in 2021, Congress stepped in with a lot more federal funding, which made premiums more affordable <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/explaining-health-care-reform-questions-about-health-insurance-subsidies/\" target=\"_blank\">for people of all income levels.</a></p>   <p>It was an \"incredibly successful effort to get more people into coverage and reduce the uninsured rate,\" says Corlette.</p>   <p>Some Republican lawmakers say the current enhanced tax credits are just too expensive. Other Republicans say they're open to extending the policy but not as part of the shutdown fight.</p>   <p>\"That premium support program doesn't even expire until next year. So why are you shutting down the government on Oct. 1 because of a program that doesn't even expire for another few months?\" Vice President Vance said<strong> </strong>on Fox News on Wednesday.</p>   <p>Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., says that actually, it is an urgent issue. As she explained in a press conference Wednesday, open enrollment for ACA plans starts Nov. 1.</p>   <p>\"Later is too late,\" she said. \"The new higher health care rates, those are being set right now. Notifications to families ‚Äî they're in the mail now. Open enrollment is weeks away and families are panicking.\"</p>   <p>For Cox, having this relatively small slice of the health insurance pie dominating the political universe takes her back to the repeal and replace fight of 2017 and countless standoffs over the Affordable Care Act since then.</p>   <p>\"Obamacare has always been the center of a political firestorm, at least in health policy,\" she said. \"Here we are again.\"<br /></p>\n</div>"

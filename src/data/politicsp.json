    "body": "\n      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Scott Adams, creator of Dilbert, the office humor comic strip, is pictured at work in 2006. Adams has metastatic prostate cancer and he appealed to President Trump to help save his life by solving a bureaucratic problem with his health insurance. It worked: His appointment is Tuesday.\n                \n                    Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Like many, many Americans, Scott Adams had health insurance problems.   But Adams — made famous first by his long-running Dilbert cartoon, and later for a racist rant on YouTube — counts some powerful people in his social media circle: President Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr. and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.   So Adams posted his complaint on X, saying Kaiser of Northern California, his health insurer and care provider, had \"dropped the ball\" in scheduling a procedure needed to treat his metastatic prostate cancer. Adams wrote he was going to ask Trump to help save his life, and he added: \"I am declining fast. I will ask President Trump if he can get Kaiser of Northern California to respond and schedule it for Monday.\"   \n   Donald Trump Jr. responded to the post on X first, saying: \"Going to make sure that my dad sees this.\"   Just after 11 am on Sunday morning, Kennedy responded, saying, \"Scott. How do I reach you? The President wants to help.\"   Later that day, President Trump posted a screen shot of Adams' original post and responded  \"On it!\" on his favored social media platform, Truth Social.   And on Monday, Adams posted that he had an appointment to receive the infusion he needed of the cancer drug, Pluvicto, on Tuesday.   \"For context, I waited months for the drug, like everyone else,\" Adams wrote. \"But I think my files got misplaced or something and that glitch just got corrected. Not sure.\"   \n   The U.S. health care system is notoriously complex, confusing and expensive, and many Americans have had similarly frustrating experiences as Adams did. Few, though, have the social media reach to enlist such powerful helping hands.   \"Our health system shouldn't be one where we need the intervention of the president or the HHS secretary to weigh in on behalf of a high-profile political backer,\" said Anthony Wright, the executive director of Families USA, a health care advocacy organization.   Wright added that he is gratified Adams got the help he needed and said it should be available to all. \"Glad the President is offering to do casework,\" Wright said, noting that federal workers who do similar problem solving have been fired and navigators who help people sign up for Affordable Care Act health insurance have been cut by 90%. Wright also called out the\" \"current shutdown over the issue of tax credits that help millions access and afford health care.\"   \n   NPR reached out to Kaiser for comment and they e-mailed this statement: \"Mr. Adams' oncology team is working closely with him on the next steps in his cancer care, which are already underway. Since it was approved by the FDA three years ago, Kaiser Permanente's nuclear medicine and medical oncology experts have treated more than 150 patients with Lu-177 PSMA (Pluvicto) in Northern California alone. We know this drug and this disease.\"   Adams' experience drummed up a chorus of well-wishes online, as well as those who called out the preferential treatment he apparently got.   \n   \"There are Americans all over America who are currently going through similar circumstances,\" wrote one X poster, responding to Kennedy's offer to help Adams.   Another responded: \"How about promoting UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE, like the rest of the Industrialized 1st World Nations, so EVERYONE can be treated, not just Celebrity & the Wealthy?\"   In the shutdown health care fight that started Oct. 1, about 24 million Americans who buy their insurance on the ACA marketplaces will see their premiums skyrocket — the average plan will double in price — if Congress doesn't act. Democrats say they will not reopen the government unless the tax subsidies that bring down the cost are renewed. Republicans say they will not discuss renewing the subsidies until the government is reopened.\n",

The deal, worth almost $49 billion, comes at a particularly difficult time for Tylenol-maker Kenvue, after the Trump administration linked acetaminophen — the active ingredient in this common painkiller — to autism. The assertions came despite a lack of clear scientific evidence, and Kenvue has called them simply false.   For Kimberly-Clark, the deal adds a new swath of consumer brands. Besides Tylenol, Kenvue also owns other pharmacy mainstays such as Band-Aid, Listerine, Neutrogena and Aveeno.    \n   Kimberly-Clark CEO Mike Hsu said in Monday's announcement, that the two \"iconic companies\" would create \"a global health and wellness leader.\"    Executives from both companies said the combined entity would serve people \"at every stage of life\" and benefit from Kenvue's relationships with dermatologists, dentists, pediatricians and other healthcare professionals.    Kimberly-Clark has been attempting to challenge the dominance of consumer goliath Procter & Gamble, whose business spans all drugstore aisles, including cold and digestion medicines.    And Kenvue has been on the selling block for a while now, ever since it was spun off from Johnson & Johnson in 2023. Its share price collapsed a few months after going public, losing a third of its value since the start of the year before Monday's news.   On Monday morning, Kenvue's stock price jumped around 17%, while Kimberly-Clark's fell about 12%.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., about how the start of health insurance open enrollment and other issues might change his party's shutdown strategy going forward.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  As we've been reporting on this increasingly lengthy government shutdown, we've been talking with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress about the politics around the shutdown and also about the substantive issues that Selena just told us about. This morning, Senator Chris Van Hollen is with us. He is a Democrat. He is the senior senator from Maryland, and he sits on the Senate appropriations and budget committees.Good morning, Senator. Thanks for joining us.CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Michel, good morning.MARTIN: So as we just heard from Selena's reporting, the Affordable Care Act marketplace open enrollment period is underway, and millions of people are about to see what their health insurance is going to cost them. The prediction is there's going to be sticker shock. Do you think that this might unlock the stalemate in Congress?VAN HOLLEN: Well, I certainly hope so. This is the ticking time bomb on health care costs that we've been warning about, and now people are seeing that sticker shock. And you would hope that that would get President Trump to finally focus and come to the table to talk to Democrats to resolve these matters, instead of spending all this time either at Mar-a-Lago or traipsing around the world or providing a $20 billion taxpayer bailout to his buddy in Argentina or trying to build a new ballroom. We've been trying, Michel, to get the president to the table to talk about these things.MARTIN: So I see that you're bypassing your Republican colleagues. You're saying you want to go straight to President Trump, that he's the key to this. Is that what I'm hearing you say?VAN HOLLEN: President Trump is really the only Republican in Washington, D.C., who matters because, at the end of the day, all the other Republicans do what he says to do - with one exception, which is his call to change the supermajority on the filibuster. But with that one exception, Trump is the only Republican in town who I think we can - we hope to make a deal with. And that's why it's important that he finally come to the table.MARTIN: So President Trump told \"60 Minutes\" he is willing to work with Democrats on health care. Let's listen.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Obamacare is terrible. It's bad health care at far too high a price. We should fix that.UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: And...TRUMP: We should fix it, and we can fix it with the Democrats. All they have to do is let the country open, and we'll fix it.MARTIN: So, Senator, I recognize that Democrats are frustrated that Republicans complain about the Affordable Care Act but, to this point, haven't really presented an alternative, certainly not in the current Congress. But having said that, first of all, let me just ask you - do you believe that? Do you believe that the president will negotiate if you do vote - if the Democrats do - if enough Democrats join Republicans in voting to end the shutdown?VAN HOLLEN: No, I don't believe the president. And I have now voted, Michel, seven times to open the government, but do it without giving Donald Trump a blank check for lawless activities and to deal with this health care crisis. And so this really is the moment that the president needs to come to the table, like all other presidents have done before.MARTIN: So - and to that other issue that Selena talked about in her reporting, the expiring ACA tax subsidies are just part of the issue that increased health insurance costs. Do Democrats also have a plan for issue like the repayment cap that was eliminated by the Republican tax and spending bill in the summer?VAN HOLLEN: Well, we'd like to deal with that issue. But the immediate issue is simply extending the existing tax cuts - right? - that allow middle-class and working-class families to afford health care. It's the one tax cut that the - that Republicans refused to extend when they passed their so-called Big Beautiful Bill, right? They extended tax cuts for billionaires permanently, but they are allowing this one to lapse. So the priority is to fix this. We're happy to also discuss the cap and other issues if the president wants to sit down at the table and get it done.MARTIN: So, you know, this shutdown is causing some real pain, which you certainly know. I mean, you have a lot of constituents who are affected by it. Beyond rising health care costs, federal workers are going unpaid. People are losing federal food aid. Access to the free early childhood development program, Head Start, for low-income families might be, you know, shut down. The head of AFGE, the American Federation of Government Employees, is now calling for Democrats to vote for a bill to reopen the government. At what point does the juice not become worth the squeeze from prolonging this fight?VAN HOLLEN: Well, I'd like to end the fight. And the way to do it is to get Donald Trump to talk about it, as we've been discussing. Again, there are big issues here, and we need to resolve them. I have, as I said, voted to reopen the government. The president is deciding to try to make this even more painful than it has to be. I mean, they've been withholding food assistance intentionally. They claim they had to do that. Turns out, as we said, they did not have to do it. In fact, a judge has said that they're required by law to use the contingency funds. So, Donald Trump, quit trying to increase the pain more than necessary and let's get this done.MARTIN: That is Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland. He's a Democrat. Senator Van Hollen, thank you so much.VAN HOLLEN: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF THE AMERICAN ANALOG SET SONG, \"DIANA SLOWBURNER II\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Today's top stories   President Trump has shown little interest in negotiating with Democrats to end the government shutdown. He spent the weekend in Florida, one of five trips he's taken since the shutdown began. On Air Force One last night, he told reporters it is up to the Democrats to end it. Check the latest news on the shutdown from our coverage here.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump salutes a Marine as he arrives at the White House on Nov. 2 in Washington, D.C.

Unlike past presidents who stayed in Washington to negotiate a deal, Trump hasn't changed his schedule. The GOP-led House of Representatives passed a short-term funding bill in September. The GOP's goal is to apply pressure on Senate Democrats to vote for the House bill.   Two federal judges on Friday ordered the Trump administration to use emergency money to keep the national food aid program SNAP going. The program ran out of money on Saturday, and it is unclear how quickly the administration could restart the program. The administration has argued that using contingency funds for regular SNAP benefits is illegal because they are intended for situations such as natural disasters.    \n   🎧 NPR's Joe Hernandez reports the lapse – affecting 42 million people – is unprecedented for the program. Democratic state officials behind one of the lawsuits argue that stopping benefits will lead to worse food insecurity.📷 Food banks and pantries in the U.S. are scrambling to feed families amid the government shutdown. Here's how they are stepping up to help.   Tomorrow is Election Day, with voters in Virginia and New Jersey choosing new governors. Several cities across the country will also choose new leaders, including New York City, America's largest city. In the final stretch of the race, the face off between Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani and former governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an Independent, could heavily influence the Democratic Party. Early voting has surged compared to previous elections.    🎧 The excitement that Mamdani has garnered in this race has been exciting for a lot of Democrats, not just in the city he is campaigning in, but across the country, says NPR's Brian Mann. However, Mamdani embracing the \"socialist\" label has made many Democratic leaders nervous. Some top Democrats have withheld endorsements, and his support skews heavily toward younger voters.

The courts are weighing in on their legality. But — if successful — they could also fulfill a long-running administration goal of employing America's military to aid in the mass deportation of immigrants without legal status, according to an NPR review of past comments from Trump and his allies. It's a move that would stray significantly from past federal use of the Guard, challenging laws that dictate how the U.S. military can be used domestically. And with the 2026 midterms looming, some experts worry Guard troops could even be used as a tool of systemic voter suppression and intimidation.   \n   Trump has sent troops into four Democratic-led cities and threatened to send them to several more, claiming they are needed to crack down on crime and protect federal immigration facilities and officers. Those deployments, and the White House's rhetoric around them, have regularly conflated violent crime and illegal immigration into a single crisis, blurring the lines around the role of the Guard and federal agents.   \n   Taken one at a time, the deployments can seem random or fickle — Trump will often muse about sending troops into a city, only to back track his comments and focus on a different city days later.   But the president and several others in his inner circle — most notably Stephen Miller, a senior aide to Trump in his first term, and now Trump's right hand man on immigration — have long talked about using the National Guard to help with mass deportations and immigration raids, despite U.S. laws broadly preventing the military from being used for domestic policing. To get around those laws, both Trump and Miller have talked about invoking the Insurrection Act, which allows the president to deploy the military within the U.S. in certain situations.   Legal experts, activists and watchdog groups worry the Trump administration could fundamentally change the way the military is used on U.S. soil, specifically raising concerns about the upcoming 2026 midterm elections and what armed troops on the streets could mean as voters cast ballots.   \n   Laying the groundwork   Much of Trump's campaign ahead of the 2024 election was focused on drumming up anti-immigrant sentiment and pushing his plan for mass deportations. He vowed several times on the campaign trail that he would launch the largest deportation operation in American history.   In his first term, Trump and his administration had similar ambitions, but struggled to scale up infrastructure and manpower needed to carry out the goal.   In a TIME Magazine interview in April of 2024, then-candidate Trump was asked specifically if his plan included the use of the U.S. military.   \"I can see myself using the National Guard and, if necessary, I'd have to go a step further. We have to do whatever we have to do to stop the problem we have,\" Trump responded.   Using the National Guard for immigration enforcement is an idea that Miller had talked about publicly in the years before.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                White House Deputy Chief of Staff for policy and U.S. Homeland Security Adviser Stephen Miller speaks after President Trump signed an order sending National Guard to Memphis, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on September 15, 2025.\n                \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   In 2023, Miller appeared on the late right-wing activist Charlie Kirk's podcast to talk about how mass deportations under Trump's hopeful second term could work.   \n   \"In terms of personnel, you go to the red state governors, and you say, give us your National Guard. We will deputize them as immigration enforcement officers,\" Miller explained. \"The Alabama National Guard is going to arrest illegal aliens in Alabama, and the Virginia National Guard in Virginia.\"   Miller doesn't specify how that would be legal — under U.S. law, the military can't be used for domestic policing unless authorized by the Constitution or Congress. For Democratic-run states that don't comply, Miller said, the federal government would simply send the National Guard from a nearby Republican-run state.   The deployments   In recent months, the Trump administration has deployed Guard troops to states against the wishes of their Democratic governors — including sending troops from Texas into Illinois. The administration said their purpose was to protect federal immigration facilities and officers. Those deployments are tied up in court challenges.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Members of the Texas National Guard stand guard at an army reserve training facility on October 07, 2025 in Elwood, Illinois.\n                \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Scott Olson/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   Miles Taylor, former chief of staff in the Department of Homeland Security during Trump's first term, worked closely with Miller. He's since become a vocal critic of the president and his policies.   \n   Taylor says he's not surprised to see Miller's plan coming to fruition.   \"Trump was deeply deferential to Stephen and I think you've seen that with a vastly more empowered Stephen Miller in a second term,\" says Taylor, an author and commentator.   Taylor says that during Trump's first term, the president wasn't talking publicly about using the U.S. military for immigration enforcement, but it was something that was discussed behind closed doors.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Miles Taylor, former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security during President Trump's first term, holds up his phone outside of the U.S. courthouse in Alexandria, Va., ahead of the arraignment hearing for former FBI director James Comey on Oct. 8\n                \n                    Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"I can remember in meetings with him in the Oval Office, or on Air Force One, or at the border, him starting to bring up this idea of using the United States military to solve the problem,\" he says.   It wasn't something that Trump just talked about. In 2017, The Associated Press reported on a memo it obtained from DHS, outlining a draft proposal to use the National Guard to round up unauthorized immigrants throughout the U.S. At the time, the White House denied it, saying there was no such plan.   Taylor says there very much was — but it was also more than that.   \"It was the invocation of the Insurrection Act to deputize the military to enforce domestic law to basically become a domestic police force,\" he says, noting that this particular idea was something that troubled him and several other staffers.   \n   \"It rocked us to our core,\" he says.   Trump invoking the Insurrection Act would legally allow for the military to act as police on U.S. soil — to carry out immigration enforcement, but possibly other enforcement too, according to legal experts.   NPR asked the White House about potential plans to deputize the Guard for law enforcement and to use the Insurrection Act, but it did not directly respond to those questions, instead criticizing Taylor and NPR. Spokeswoman Abigail Jackson also referenced Trump's \"highly successful operations to drive down violent crime in American cities.\"   \n   Project 2025   The broader themes of these National Guard deployments are also embedded in Project 2025, a conservative action plan written by the Heritage Foundation after Trump's first term that's more than 900 pages long.   Trump has incorporated many of its policies, and authors into his second administration. So much so that the report's architect, Russell Vought, is the head of the White House's Office of Management and Budget.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, in September.\n                \n                    Dominic Gwinn/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Dominic Gwinn/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty\n    \n\n   \n   Matt Dallek, a professor at The George Washington University who studies the American conservative movement, says that Project 2025 essentially opens the door for Trump's National Guard deployments — particularly to Democratic-led cities — without explicitly calling for them.   \"The subtext of Project 2025 is to take any and all steps at the executive level to go into cities and states to enact the priority — which is to root out illegal immigration,\" Dallek says.   The idea of bullying states and cities into following orders from the president is a key part of the text, says David Graham, a journalist for The Atlantic who also wrote a book on the project. So is the use of the military.   \"There is this idea in Project 2025, and among the authors, that the military is just an underused resource for policing immigration,\" Graham says, noting that often illegal immigration is presented as a national security problem. He says the report's authors believe that the U.S. has \"this huge, huge resource of armed people, and we're not doing anything with it, and we need to use it to secure the border.\"   Beyond mass deportation   In recent weeks, Trump has talked about invoking the Insurrection Act often, especially in regard to deploying the National Guard. Earlier this month, he said that he was \"allowed\" to invoke it if the courts deny his deployments in places like Portland, Ore., or Chicago, where prosecutors and federal judges have questioned the need for troops on the ground.   \n   Trump invoking the Insurrection Act to allow troops to help with immigration enforcement is also something that Stephen Miller has talked about.   He told the New York Times back in 2023: \"President Trump will do whatever it takes.\"   That possibility has both legal experts and immigration advocates worried, especially about the implications it could have for Americans at large.   Kica Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center, an immigration rights advocacy group, says it has her worried about the upcoming 2026 midterm elections and what the presence of troops might mean for voters as they cast ballots.   \n   \"What I have said repeatedly is that the path to authoritarianism in this country is being built on the backs of immigrants. They will begin with immigrants. They will not end with immigrants,\" she says.\n",

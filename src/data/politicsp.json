On Tuesday night, he delivered.   Tuesday's address lasted approximately one hour and 48 minutes making it the longest speech before a joint session of Congress in at least 60 years, according to the American Presidency Project, which tracks the lengths of each speech since 1964.   \n   It beats the record Trump himself set last year, speaking for an hour and 39 minutes in what was not technically a State of the Union (Because it was the first year of Trump's second nonconsecutive term, the speech was not classified as a State of the Union). Before that, the record was held by former President Bill Clinton for his 2000 State of the Union, which came in at an hour and 28 minutes.   The shortest speech of the past 60 years was former President Richard Nixon's 1972 State of the Union, which lasted only 28 minutes, per the American Presidency Project.   The runtime included lengthy pauses for applause, disruptions, recognition of guests, and cheers for the Olympic gold-winning U.S. men's hockey team.   The State of the Union gives the president an opportunity to set or reset the national agenda, and Trump's comes at a moment when most Americans say the country is worse off than it was a year ago, according to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll.   \n\n\n",

    "body": "\n      Facing rough poll numbers, President Trump has a lot at stake for the State of the Union address. Here's how other presidents have handled the moment.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  President Trump delivers tonight's State of the Union at a moment when he's facing considerable political challenges. NPR's Domenico Montanaro takes a look back to see what we might expect.DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Here's something you probably won't hear President Trump say tonight.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GERALD FORD: And I must say to you that the state of the union is not good.MONTANARO: That was Gerald Ford in 1975. He's the only U.S. president to explicitly say in a State of the Union address that the state of the union was, in fact, not good. And he had reason to. He had assumed office only months earlier after President Nixon resigned in the wake of the Watergate scandal. The country was facing a lot of challenges.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)FORD: Millions of Americans are out of work. Recession and inflation are eroding the money of millions more. Prices are too high, and sales are too slow.MONTANARO: Sound familiar? Prices, the cost of living are top concerns for voters now, and Trump has struggled when talking about it, often dismissing concerns. Here he was at a rally in Georgia last week.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They would say affordability. Everybody would say, oh, Trump's caused - no, no. They caused the affordability problem, and we've solved it.MONTANARO: Presidents often get more blame and credit than they deserve on the economy, but polling shows people say Trump's policies, particularly his tariffs, are making things worse. An NPR/PBS News/Marist poll this month finds 59% disapprove of the job that he's doing on the economy. Majorities disapprove of the job he's doing on foreign policy. Two-thirds say his immigration enforcement has gone too far. And perhaps no surprise, then, 57% say the state of the union is not strong. When presidents in the past have faced significant political headwinds, they've often dialed it back in State of the Union addresses, even trying to joke about their fortunes, like Bill Clinton did in 1995.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BILL CLINTON: If we agree on nothing else tonight, we must agree that the American people certainly voted for change in 1992 and in 1994.(APPLAUSE)MONTANARO: Wait for it.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CLINTON: And as I look out at you, I know how some of you must have felt in 1992.(LAUGHTER)MONTANARO: Just months earlier, Republicans rode a conservative wave to win control of Congress two years after Clinton himself won the presidency. As he then tried to position himself for reelection, Clinton sought common ground with a nod to the political right.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CLINTON: The era of big government is over.(APPLAUSE)MONTANARO: Presidents have also tried to find higher ground even after defeat.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GEORGE W BUSH: Tonight, I have the high privilege and distinct honor of my own as the first president to begin the State of the Union message with these words - Madam Speaker...(CHEERING)MONTANARO: George W. Bush in 2007, after his party lost control of Congress, congratulating the then-new speaker of the House, Democrat Nancy Pelosi. Presidents have also tried to address the issues that put them in a difficult position in the first place.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARACK OBAMA: Now, I have heard rumors that a few of you still have concerns about our new health care law.MONTANARO: Barack Obama in 2011, just after his party lost a whopping 63 seats and control of the House.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)OBAMA: So let me be the first to say that anything can be improved.MONTANARO: Even Trump in 2018, also suffering from low approval ratings, called for compromise on a comprehensive immigration overhaul.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: One where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs and must have.MONTANARO: He proposed a path to citizenship for people brought to the United States as children, known as DREAMers, and funding a wall along the southern U.S. border, as well as other restrictions. It went nowhere. Republicans wound up losing control of the House that November. Trump has shown no signs of compromise in this second term, and he has a lot of work to do, starting with this speech, to try to mitigate potential big losses for Republicans this November.

    "body": "\n      An NPR investigation has found that the public database of Epstein files is missing dozens of pages related to sexual abuse accusations against President Trump.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  We know that President Trump's name is in the Epstein files thousands of times, but there are new details about notable examples where his name does not appear. An NPR investigation finds dozens of pages of documents that mention Trump have been withheld or removed from the public Epstein files database, and they include accusations of sexual abuse against the president. NPR's Stephen Fowler uncovered the story, and he joins me now. Hi there.STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Hey there.SUMMERS: Stephen, what do we know about these allegations against President Trump?FOWLER: We found two internal documents from the FBI and the Justice Department. Those documents were published last year and released in the files a few weeks ago. They discuss claims made about Trump in relation to Epstein. Most of them are highly salacious. The records show many of them are unverifiable or not credible reports, and they show investigators took little action on them.But there is one in particular that accused Trump of sexually abusing a minor around 1983, when she was also being abused by Epstein. It was sent to a field office to investigate further, and it shows up in this PowerPoint from the Justice Department summarizing their investigations into Epstein and his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, under a section called Prominent Names.SUMMERS: I mean, this is a pretty serious accusation. Do we know why the Justice Department included that claim against President Trump or how it was resolved?FOWLER: We do not. Unlike other claims and interviews and people mentioned in this web of investigation, we only have a partial look at the beginning and end of this story with vast unknowns in the middle. Aside from those two documents I mentioned, there's no other reference we found in the millions of pages that have been published to identify where that claim came from or where it went as far as an investigation's concerned. That's highly unusual, especially because there's a myriad of untrue and sensationalist claims about Trump the Justice Department warned that were in the files. And you can see documentation of why those didn't go anywhere. It's also unusual because there's evidence that the FBI talked to this Trump accuser multiple times.SUMMERS: OK. A couple of questions here, Stephen. What sort of evidence? And how do we know that these documents have been withheld instead of just found elsewhere in the files?FOWLER: There's basically this table of contents of the FBI's case file for the investigation and for witness materials turned over to Ghislaine Maxwell's attorneys in her criminal case. Cross-referencing those lists, we discovered there are four interviews with this Trump accuser. Only one of them is made public and that also doesn't get into these claims against Trump at all.There are also three sets of serial numbers stamped onto these files, called Bates stamps, where each page or set of documents goes up by one as it moves to the next one. So at the end of this interview document, the bottom tracking number increased by one to go to the next file. The top number, tracking the documents related to this accuser, skipped up by six, and there's a third serial number that jumped by 53, showing that there is likely something out there beyond what the Justice Department is sharing.SUMMERS: And what have we heard from the Trump administration in response to this reporting?FOWLER: Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, sent a statement to NPR that says in part, President Trump, quote, \"has done more for Epstein's victims than anyone before him by signing the law to release the files, among other things.\" The Justice Department initially declined to answer on record questions about these specific documents. After publication, they reached out to NPR and took issue with how we characterize their initial response. A Justice Department spokeswoman reiterated the Justice Department's stance that any documents not published are because they are privileged, duplicates or relate to an ongoing federal investigation, but they didn't elaborate what the case was for these documents.SUMMERS: As you know, President Trump is preparing to deliver his State of the Union address this evening, and some of the victims of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse are expected to be there as guests of Democratic lawmakers. Tell us what's next with Congress and their role with the Epstein files.FOWLER: Well, Juana, lawmakers from both parties have argued the Justice Department and the Trump administration have not been transparent. Some of them are inviting these abuse victims to make that point. Also, the House Oversight Democrats issued a statement today that they also found evidence of what NPR reported - that the Justice Department is withholding these interviews related to allegations against Trump. They plan to investigate and seek out those documents.SUMMERS: NPR's Stephen Fowler in Atlanta, thanks so much.FOWLER: Thank you.SUMMERS: And you can read NPR's full reporting on the Epstein files, including this investigation, on our website.

    "body": "\n      President Trump is set to deliver his first State of the Union address of his second term, as he faces a host of key issues from tariffs to Iran.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  President Trump speaks to Congress and the country tonight.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's going to be a long speech because I have - we have so much to talk about.LEILA FADEL, HOST:  The State of the Union address is any president's annual opportunity to set the national agenda or reset the agenda when it's not going well. Many Americans don't feel good about the state of the union. An NPR survey out this week finds that 60% of those responding - 6 out of 10 - say the country is worse off than a year ago. In a few moments, we'll discuss all this with a Republican analyst and speechwriter. First, let's preview the speech.INSKEEP: NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez has an assessment. Franco, good morning.FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve.INSKEEP: What do you know about the president's approach?ORDOÑEZ: Well, I expect his team is finishing a speech that tries to do that - push the reset button - a speech that not only touts his accomplishments but sets the stage for the upcoming midterms, you know, focusing on how the administration plans to really tackle costs for everyday Americans. But I spoke with Ashley Koning, a pollster from Rutgers University, who told me that the administration faces an uphill battle.ASHLEY KONING: There is so much on the table right now with the president going into this speech between whether we're talking about the partial shutdown, the economy, immigration or Iran, and then clearly him seeing his worst poll numbers right now during his second term.ORDOÑEZ: You know, and the thing is, Steve, you really don't know what Trump is going to say. And the reality here is the president says a lot of things in public, but he hasn't really explained some of the policies in a way at least that many Americans would approve. So he has this opportunity to clarify those plans tonight.INSKEEP: Well, as you're saying that, I'm thinking he's talking to the nation right after the Supreme Court found his tariffs were illegal.ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, a huge blow to his agenda and a great example to what we're talking about. Trump's promising new tariffs under a different law, which really has some Republicans concerned because of the associated higher costs. Jon McHenry, a veteran Republican strategist, told me that Trump could take this moment to give his reasons for a policy many Americans don't agree with.JON MCHENRY: He has an opportunity to say, this is why I think these tariffs are important, and we are going to handle it in this manner because I'm trying to preserve manufacturing jobs, because I'm trying to preserve farming jobs, rather than just saying, I can't believe these people are against me. What losers and RINOs they are.INSKEEP: Got to note, when the court first ruled, the president took the latter course, Franco. He called the justices, quote, \"unpatriotic and disloyal,\" even though he appointed some of them.ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. And just think about this, Steve. Those justices are going to be in the room with Trump. And as always the case with this president, the optics are going to be a big part of the evening. So when Trump sees those justices, you know, walking in in their black robes, you know, is he going to be able to resist attacking them personally, as he did so aggressively last week?INSKEEP: So we'll watch for that and also watching this - what approach can the president take to the possible war against Iran?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I think a similar one. I mean, right now, there's a real concern, especially from his own party, that the U.S. can be dragged into a long-term conflict, you know, the kind of conflict Trump himself pledged to avoid. Again, Trump has not made the public case for why strikes may be necessary, as presidents have in the past. And this could be an opportunity for Trump to do that, to explain his reasoning. And if he does, at least people will have understood why he made that decision. But that's obviously not Trump's MO.INSKEEP: NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez. Thanks for your insights, as always.ORDOÑEZ: Thanks, Steve.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      President Trump is expected to deliver a lengthy defense of the first year of his second term and make the case for his party ahead of the midterms in his speech Tuesday.   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  OK. Let's hear more about the State of the Union address tonight. It comes at a tense time, both at home and abroad. In the last few days, the Supreme Court ruled against a major part of President Trump's economic agenda. And overseas, he is debating his next move amid the U.S. military buildup around Iran. There is a lot the president could talk about, in other words. And NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben is here to talk with us and give us a little bit of a preview. Hey there.DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hello.KELLY: What do we expect tonight?KURTZLEBEN: Well, first off, we expect it to be a long speech. Trump said so himself yesterday. He just said, there's a lot to talk about. So, you know, put on some coffee.KELLY: Right (laughter).KURTZLEBEN: But beyond that, press secretary Karoline Leavitt - she said today that a large portion of the speech will focus on the economy, and she told Fox News that the cost of living is going to be a big part of that.(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FOX & FRIENDS \")KAROLINE LEAVITT: He'll be sharing these stories, again, of everyday Americans who are directly benefiting from his policies and making a few new policy announcements as well to continue tackling the affordability crisis that Joe Biden created one year ago.KURTZLEBEN: Now, the White House has told reporters, including NPR, that one new proposal will be a plan to make sure tech firms building new data centers, which use massive amounts of energy, pay increased electricity costs. So we'll see what other new policies he outlines and - this is key - if those require the help of Congress at a time when Republicans have slim majorities in both the House and the Senate.But to put a pin in another thing she said there - this White House is still making the case that any economic problems are Joe Biden's fault. Now, that gets harder with every passing day. But no matter what, any new policies aimed at the cost of living are going to come while the president says he's going to push new tariffs. Now, those raise prices. So that could end up giving mixed messages.KELLY: Yeah. On the tariffs, the Supreme Court, as we noted, just ruled against those last week - said they were unconstitutional. We expect he will bring that up.KURTZLEBEN: I would be stunned if he didn't talk about tariffs tonight. After that Friday ruling, he was furious, and he vowed to impose new ones. So maybe he'll say a bit more about what new tariffs he wants to impose. And with Supreme Court justices sitting right there in front of him, he may not be able to resist bringing up that ruling.KELLY: OK. On the world stage, over the past year, he has done a lot. Quite a bit of it has not been popular - things like regime change in Venezuela. What are we expecting there? Will he be defending his foreign policy agenda?KURTZLEBEN: Yeah. Well, I mean, first off, you're right, he's been active. There's Venezuela. There's the huge tariffs on China, tariffs on other countries, the attempts to broker peace in Gaza and Ukraine, threats to take over Greenland, picking fights with Canada, the attack on Iran and now, yeah, that military buildup around Iran. So first...KELLY: Long list. Yeah.KURTZLEBEN: ...Yes. It's wild to think about. I mean, so first off, we're going to be listening for any indications of what he's going to do with Iran. But beyond that, Trump initially ran on an America First policy. His foreign policy actions in this last year, though, haven't looked all that America First to some in his party. And now with this military buildup in the Middle East, the question is whether he makes an effective case for whatever it is he's trying to do there.KELLY: And just - Danielle, the moment that he's speaking in - he's delivering a State of the Union in a moment when many Americans say the state of the union is not strong. How does that affect tonight?KURTZLEBEN: Yeah. According to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll, 55% of Americans see the direction Trump is moving the country in as a, quote, \"change for the worse.\" Now, again, polls show Americans are also worried about their finances and those tariffs, and Trump's immigration policy has gone, over the past year, from a strength to a weakness. After all, it's only been weeks since federal agents killed those two people in Minneapolis. So tonight's speech - he has to assure Americans that he has the right vision for the country. And the question is, does that spur them to get out and vote for Republicans this year?KELLY: NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben, happy coffee brewing.

While the White House kept Trump's full guest list under wraps for now, presidents traditionally extend invites to people who align with issues they support. First lady Melania Trump has picked her own attendees to highlight her platforms on AI education and foster care.   Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has invited the daughter of a Uyghur doctor who went missing in 2018. Several Democratic lawmakers are bringing survivors of alleged sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein.   \n   Traditionally, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle attend the address. However, this year at least five Democratic senators and 14 members of the House are choosing to skip over their opposition to Trump's agenda, and planning to attend an alternate event staged by MoveOn.org called \"The People's State of the Union.\"   Here's who will, and won't, be there.   Who's coming   Among Trump's guests is Saige Blair. Blair is at the center of a lawsuit involving allegations that Virginia school officials made decisions about Blair's well-being and gender identity without informing the then-14-year-old's parents. Erika Kirk will be there. She's the widow of Charlie Kirk and the new CEO and board chair of Turning Point USA, her late husband's right-wing youth organization. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that, with Kirk in the chamber, Trump \"will call on Congress to 'firmly reject political violence against our fellow citizens.'\" Kirk was named to succeed her husband as CEO after he was assassinated in September.First lady Melania Trump is bringing Sierra Burns, a participant in the Melania Trump Foster Youth to Independence Program, and Everest Nevraumont, a 10-year-old public speaker and advocate of artificial intelligence education. \"Sierra and Everest embody my ongoing mission to uplift America's foster youth and expand opportunity for our next generation through education and technology,\" the first lady said. House Speaker Mike Johnson is bringing Ziba Murat. Murat is the daughter of Gulshan Abbas, a retired medical doctor who went missing in China in 2018, after her sister criticized the Chinese government's treatment of Uyghur people, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom says.The U.S. men's hockey team, which brought home the gold medal after defeating Canada at this year's Winter Olympics, is expected to attend, House Speaker Johnson told CBS News.Democratic California Rep. Mark Takano will be attending with George Retes. Retes is a U.S. citizen who was on his way to work in Ventura, Calif., in July, when he said federal immigration agents pepper sprayed him, pulled him out of his car and detained him for three days with no explanation and no judicial hearing.Republican Rep. Pete Stauber of Minnesota is bringing conservative Youtuber Nick Shirley, according to The Minnesota Star Tribune. \"Nick played a significant role in showing the nation the crisis level of fraud and corruption happening in our own state government that's cost taxpayers $9 billion,\" Stauber said on X. Democratic Rep. Suhas Subramanyam of Virginia has invited the brother and sister-in-law of Virginia Roberts Giuffre, one of the most visible victims of abuse by late financier Jeffrey Epstein. Other Epstein survivors were also invited: Jess Michaels was invited by Rep. James Walkinshaw, D-Va., and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., invited Haley Robson.    \n   Who's not coming   The U.S. women's Olympic hockey team, also fresh off its Olympic gold-medal win, has reportedly declined President Trump's invitation due to scheduling conflicts. \"We are sincerely grateful for the invitation … and deeply appreciate the recognition of their extraordinary achievement,\" a USA Hockey spokesperson said, according to NBC News.    Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen, of Maryland, said he won't be at the State of the Union. His name appears on the flier for The People's State of the Union. \"Trump is marching America towards fascism, and I refuse to normalize his shredding of our Constitution & democracy,\" he said last week.Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts said in a statement he's also going to the alternative event. Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California said in a video that, for the first time, he's not attending the State of the Union. He said he'll be outside the Capitol at The People's State of the Union. \"I will not give him the audience he craves for the lies that he tells,\" he said. Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts said she's missing the traditional address to attend the alternative event because she refuses \"to sit and listen to that man spew lies and hate.\"Other politicians expected to attend The People's State of the Union include Sens. Ruben Gallego, Tina Smith and Jeff Merkley; as well as House Reps. Yassamin Ansari, Becca Balint, Greg Casar, Teresa Leger Fernandez, Maxwell Frost, Robert Garcia, Jim Himes, Sara Jacobs, Pramila Jayapal, John Larson, Sydney Kamlager-Dove, Summer Lee, Chellie Pingree, Emily Randall, Mary Gay Scanlon, Delia Ramirez and Bonnie Watson Coleman, according to the event's organizers.   \n\n\n",

    "body": "\n   President Trump opened his State of the Union by putting his presidency in grand historic terms – acknowledging the nation's 250th anniversary while also declaring the \"golden age of America.\"   \"Tonight, after just one year, I can say with dignity and pride that we have achieved a transformation like no one has ever seen before, and a turnaround for the ages,\" he said. \"We will never go back to where we were just a short time ago.\"   \n   Americans may see that as a celebration or a threat, depending on their party. Trump's speech is delivered before an intensely divided public. The president's policies and actions in the first year of his second term have reinforced those divisions – from foreign policy to immigration to the economy.   The president faces negative approval ratings, including on immigration, the topic that twice helped propel him to the White House. The speech also comes just days after the Supreme Court delivered a blow to his tariff policy, and weeks after federal agents the administration sent into Minneapolis shot and killed two U.S. citizens.   Amid those challenges, Trump celebrated what he counts as his achievements, especially on the economy.   \n   Trump defended the many tariffs he imposed over the last year, despite the Supreme Court ruling last week that found a swath of those import taxes to be unconstitutional. He repeated his vow to impose replacement tariffs, authorized under different laws from those the Supreme Court struck down.   \"As time goes by, I believe the tariffs paid for by foreign countries will, like in the past, substantially replace the modern day system of income tax, taking a great financial burden off the people that I love,\" he said.   \n   This isn't the first time Trump has said tariffs could replace income taxes. Experts have repeatedly disputed that this is either possible or advisable.   Trump also touted the tax cuts Republicans passed last year in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, but not without attacking Democrats for opposing them.   \"All Democrats, every single one of them voted against these really important and very necessary massive tax cuts,\" he said.   \n   While Trump spent much of his speech celebrating his first year in office, he also announced policies he wants to put into place, including \"ratepayer protection pledges.\" These would require tech companies building new data centers, which use massive amounts of energy, to pay more for electricity to mitigate price spikes for the communities where those centers are built.   He also said he wants to create retirement accounts for people without access to retirement plans with matching employer contributions. The government, he added, would match up to $1,000 per year in these accounts.   More than half the country — 55% — think President Trump is changing the nation \"for the worse,\" according to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll. That's a marked increase from around this point in his first presidency, when 42% of Americans believed the same.   Recent polls also show the president has a deeply negative approval rating, including negative numbers on immigration and the economy. Those numbers are highly partisan – Republicans still overwhelmingly approve of the president, while Democrats overwhelmingly disapprove. Multiple polls show that a majority of independents disapprove of the job Trump is doing.   \n   On economic issues, Trump has been making the case to Americans for months – especially since Democratic wins in November's elections – that he is working to ease the cost of living.   Trump also leaned into the administration's ongoing message that former president Joe Biden is to blame for any current cost-of-living problems. However, more than one year into Trump's second term, this raises the question of how long the administration can blame economic problems on Biden.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Mary Louise Kelly talks with conservative podcaster Michael Knowles, host of The Michael Knowles Show, about what he hopes to hear from President Trump tonight in the State of the Union.   \n\n    (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's going to be a long speech because I have - we have so much to talk about.MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  A long speech because there's so much to talk about. President Trump giving us a preview there of his State of the Union address tonight. The constitutionally mandated address to Congress is expected to kick off at 9:00 p.m. Eastern. Among those who will be listening live in the room, conservative podcaster Michael Knowles. He is there as a guest of House Speaker Mike Johnson, and he joins us now to share what he will be listening for. Welcome. Good to speak to you again.MICHAEL KNOWLES: Wonderful to be with you. Thanks for having me.KELLY: What do you see as the point of a speech like tonight's? In an era when most Americans have made up their minds what they think about President Trump, what they think of his agenda, what do you think a State of the Union address can achieve?KNOWLES: Well, the first point is he has to do it. It's constitutionally required. But obviously, the president is thinking beyond that, and we're obviously looking ahead at the midterms here. So I think that the point of the speech is not even so much to convey all of the accomplishments of the administration. And I agree with President Trump - I think there have been a lot of accomplishments in the administration on a whole variety of issues. But the poll numbers for the president are mixed, and they're sometimes even mixed on particular issues, the clearest one being, in the wake of the enforcement of immigration law in Minnesota, that the majority of Americans still support mass deportations, and also the majority of Americans want ICE to stop deporting these people. And so there's a little bit of a contradiction.KELLY: And I will just insert - you're talking about polling numbers - the latest Washington Post/ABC News/Ipsos poll has got 58% of Americans disapprove of the way that President Trump is handling immigration.KNOWLES: On ICE, yes. So this is what's so strange, though, is when you dial in on the issue, they still support immigration enforcement. That was one of the reasons President Trump won the popular vote. But then some of the particulars have made people uneasy. And so I...KELLY: But to circle us in on tonight, relate that to...KNOWLES: Yes.KELLY: ...Tonight and what you're hoping the president will hear. You want to hear him explain why he's doing what he's doing on immigration and a whole raft of other issues?KNOWLES: No. I think Ronald Reagan said it best when he said, when you're explaining, you're losing. The reason I mention the contradictions in some of the polling numbers is because I think what Americans want is a sense of safety. I think Americans feel uneasy. They feel uneasy on an issue like immigration. They feel uneasy on the economy. You know, there are a whole host of great economic numbers that have come out - rents falling six months in a row. The jobs numbers are pretty good. Inflation's quite good. The fundamental issues on the economy are looking quite good under Trump in basically every category. And so I think what President Trump has to do is relay the accomplishments across all of those disciplines in the administration. But what he has to convey to the American people is that he is the one who is bringing back security.KELLY: How confident are you that he will stay on message, on that message that you're laying out?KNOWLES: Well, I'm certain he will not stay on script. That is a guarantee. He will weave and go off script. However, I think he's gotten better at it, and he's gotten better at staying on message. I think he's honed in exactly what his message is. So I'm not placing any bets on him following the teleprompter, but I do think he will stay on message.KELLY: Should he use tonight to articulate to A, Congress and B, the American people what his aim would be for a war with Iran?KNOWLES: It will. Knowing President Trump's ability to surprise, you know, some of us might expect the bombs to be flying while he's speaking. Though maybe that's, you know, expecting too much.KELLY: But this is a man who campaigned for the White House on a promise to pull America out of endless wars in the Middle East, not to drag us into another one.KNOWLES: Certainly. But I think President Trump's record on war has been quite good. The action in Venezuela took about 88 minutes, start to finish. His action in Iran was over on the Fordo nuclear base before people even knew it began. And so the case that he has to make, regardless of what he does with regard to Iran, is that what he is doing is prudent. It is expedient. It is chiefly in the American interest, not in some kind of abstract interest, and that it will not be protracted.KELLY: Last thing, Michael Knowles, you know, at the outset of our conversation, I said he's going to be speaking to a lot of Americans who have made up their minds. Do they like him? Do they not? Do they like his policy and his agenda? Do - or not? We're speaking in a midterm year. For Americans, you know, going into tonight's speech who are skeptical, who didn't vote for Trump, who don't like him, is there anything you would wish to hear him say to reach across the aisle to build a bigger tent?KNOWLES: Well, he's built a large tent. I mean, I think we're underselling the fact that the man not only won reelection, but he won the popular vote. So, you know, he won the majority of American voters, which is good. He needs to maintain that coalition, perhaps even rebuild (ph)...KELLY: But again, back to those poll numbers saying 60% say the country is worse off than a year ago.KNOWLES: No, I certainly agree. He has to beef up that coalition. He has to reearn the support of some of that coalition. There's no question about that. But the way that he's going to do it is going to be to remind them why they voted for him in 2024 in the first place, and that is going to be recentering immigration. That's going to be recentering crime. And that's going to be recentering a normal American way of life. Many of the excesses from the Democrats that were rejected in November '24 pertain to the mass migration, to the radical social issues, notably the trans ideology and some other pieces. And so Trump, I think, needs to remind people that he represents normal. It's kind of funny because he's a billionaire reality TV star, but he needs to show them that he is the candidate of the ordinary American way of life and the ordinary American. He has done that before, and so what remains to be seen is whether or not he can do that again.KELLY: And I guess my question would just be what's normal? We're a big country with a huge diversity of people, which is one of our greatest strengths. Is there room in the tent for people who may have a very different view from President Trump's?KNOWLES: Certainly, there is room for people of a wide variety of backgrounds. However, there is still a norm. You know, basic stuff. Most people want to be able to afford a house, get married, have kids, have a brighter future, give their kids a brighter future than they themselves had. They don't want some of the radical ideologies, notably, once again, the gender ideology. They don't want totally open borders. They don't want foreign interventions that are disconnected from American interests. They want pretty basic stuff. And so we can say we're a wide, diverse country, but when it all comes down to it, the majority of people want roughly the same sorts of things. The Democrats had ceased to speak to those desires. Trump was able to really capture that, build a broad new coalition, and that's where he needs to get back to basics tonight.KELLY: Michael Knowles, I hope you packed your PowerBar to get through it, but promises to be a long and interesting night.KNOWLES: (Laughter) Wonderful to speak to you. And maybe I'll speak to you in a few days when the speech is over.KELLY: We will look forward to it. Thanks so much.

President Trump delivered the first official State of the Union address of his second term on Tuesday night. The speech gave Trump the opportunity to tout accomplishments and outline his agenda for his administration's second year.    \n   It comes at at time when Americans are divided on whether Trump's first year has been a success. A new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll shows that six in 10 believe the country is worse off than last year and that a majority think the state of the union is not strong.   Reporters from across NPR's newsroom are fact checking his speech and offer context — on topics like immigration, the economy, tariffs and trade and foreign policy.  (Newest fact checks show up first below.)      \n   Warrior dividend    TRUMP: \"Every service member recently received a warrior dividend of $1,776. You know, they put it on my desk. We got the money from tariffs and other things.\"   Trump announced military service members would receive a $1,776 \"warrior dividend\" during his prime time address in December.   The money was allocated to service members in the massive omnibus budget bill known as \"One Big Beautiful Bill.\" Congress — which has the power of the purse and is solely responsible for taxation and appropriation — approved $2.9 billion to subsidize housing for military members. Trump rebranded those funds as the \"warrior dividend.\"   — Saige Miller, Washington Desk Producer      Did members of the Somali community pillage $19 billion?   TRUMP: \"When it comes to the corruption that is plundering — really, it's plundering America — there's been no more stunning example than Minnesota, where members of the Somali community have pillaged an estimated $19 billion from the American taxpayer.\"   Almost 100 defendants – many of Somali descent – have been charged by the Department of Justice in connection with alleged fraud connected to federal social safety net and child welfare programs in Minnesota, according to the White House.   In one high-profile case, federal prosecutors charged dozens of people in 2022 connected to a Minnesota nonprofit called Feeding Our Future with stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from taxpayer-funded child nutrition programs during the COVID-19 pandemic.   \n   The president has used that controversy to attack the Somali American community at large in Minneapolis, including calling Somali immigrants \"garbage\" who \"contribute nothing.\"   — Jasmine Garsd, Immigration Correspondent      Transgender youth   TRUMP: \"No state can be allowed to rip children from their parents' arms and transition them to a new gender against the parents’ will. Who would believe that we’re even talking about this? We must ban it, and we must ban it immediately.\"   For the second year in a row, President Trump has brought as a guest a parent with a story about a child who began a gender transition in secret. The children mentioned in both speeches seem to have done some version of \"social transition,\" which involves changing a name, pronouns, clothes, haircuts and the like. All of those things are reversible.   This is a topic he brought up frequently during his presidential campaign, in which he and Republicans spent millions on anti-trans ads.   So far, the Trump administration's efforts to ban trangender care has focused on medical interventions for youth. Using threats of withheld federal funding, investigations, proposed regulations, and subpoenas, the White House has succeeded in shutting down many gender clinics for youth at hospitals across the country. There are also many lawsuits challenging these actions.   — Selena Simmons-Duffin, Health Policy Correspondent      Drug cartels as FTOs   TRUMP: \"For years, large swaths of territory in our region, including large parts of Mexico, really large parts of Mexico, have been controlled by murderous drug cartels. That is why I designated these Cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations, and I declared illicit Fentanyl as a Weapon of Mass Destruction.\"   Under Trump, the State Department has designated a number of drug cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations, or FTOs. This is a novel use of the designation, which has traditionally been used to go after overseas entities that have threatened the security interests of the U.S., such as al-Qaida or ISIS. This pivot in definition of FTO has raised some concern among those who were previously involved in the designation process and other counterterrorism experts. They say that responding to criminal narcotics enterprises that operate from a profit motive is fundamentally different from disrupting networks that sow ideological and violent opposition to the U.S. government.   \n   — Odette Yousef, Domestic Extremism Correspondent      Iranian protesters killed    TRUMP: “And just over the last couple of months, with the protests, they've killed at least — it looks like 32,000 protesters — 32,000 protesters in their own country. They shot them and hung them.\"   Iran's security forces unleashed a brutal crackdown against protesters in January. The Human Rights Activist News Agency has put the death toll at more than 7,000, though various human rights groups say the number could be even higher. Iran's government has acknowledged more than 3,000 deaths in clashes, a figure that includes protesters and security force members.   — Greg Myre, national security correspondent      Was Iryna Zarutska killed by an immigrant?   TRUMP: \"She had escaped a brutal war only to be slain by a hardened criminal set free to kill in America — came in through open borders. Mrs. Zarutska, tonight, I promise you we will ensure justice for your magnificent daughter, Iryna.\"   Iryna Zarutska was fatally stabbed on August 22, 2025 while riding the light rail line in Charlotte, N.C. Zarutska, who was 23, was stabbed by 34-year-old DeCarlos Brown Jr., who has a reported history of mental health issues.   In tonight's address, Trump claimed Brown was an immigrant released into America thanks to an open border policy. There is no evidence of this. Local media has reported that Brown was born and raised in Charlotte and had spent time in and out of North Carolina jails.   — Jasmine Garsd Immigration Correspondent       \"I ended eight wars\"   TRUMP: “In my first 10 months, I ended eight wars.”    President Trump has had diplomatic successes, but his repeated claim that he's ended eight wars is an exaggeration.   Perhaps his biggest success to date was brokering a ceasefire in the Israel and Hamas war in Gaza last October. However, Israel has continued to carry out airstrikes, killing hundreds of Palestinians since the truce was announced. Israel alleges many ceasefire violations by Palestinian militias.   \n   Trump's list also includes Israel and Iran. Israel and the U.S. exchanged airstrikes with Iran for 12 days last June before Trump declared a truce. However, none of the longstanding issues were resolved, and Trump is again threatening to attack Iran.   — Greg Myre, national security correspondent      Iran's nuclear program \"obliterated\"   TRUMP: “That's why, in a breakthrough operation last June, the United States military obliterated Iran's nuclear weapons program with an attack on Iranian soil known as Operation Midnight Hammer. For decades, it had been the policy of the United States never to allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon.”   Trump again repeated his oft-stated claim that the U.S. \"obliterated\" Iran's nuclear program during one day of bombing in Iran last June. There's a broad consensus that combined U.S. and Israeli strikes inflicted major damage on Iran's nuclear program. However, Iran has not allowed international inspectors to examine their nuclear facilities, making a precise assessment impossible.   In addition, Trump has not explained why he's considering a new round of attacks on Iran's nuclear program if it was 'obliterated' just months ago.   — Greg Myre, national security correspondent      Foreign investment    TRUMP: \"In 12 months, I secured commitments for more than $18 trillion pouring in from all over the globe.\"   Trump referenced this figure, but a White House website of total investment at both home and abroad sits at under $10 trillion. And other analyses have found that number inflated as well.   — Saige Miller, Washington Desk Producer      Oil and natural gas production   TRUMP: \"American oil production is up by more than 600,000 barrels a day ... American natural gas production is at an all time high because I kept my promise to drill, baby, drill.\"   The U.S. set an annual crude oil production record last year, rising about 400,000 barrels a day from 2024, according to the Energy Information Administration. That was not a new trend initiated by Trump — crude output rose for four years in a row. However, it's expected to drop by about 100,000 barrels a day in 2026, thanks in large part to low oil prices. Globally, the world is currently oversupplied with oil.   \n   It is true that natural gas production is up; the EIA forecasts record natural gas production in 2026 and 2027. Natural gas prices were low in 2024 but jumped sharply last year, due in part to massive exports of liquefied natural gas from the U.S. to other countries, mostly in Europe and Asia.   Oil companies have not been on a drilling spree, as Trump's \"drill, baby, drill\" phrasing would suggest. According to Baker Hughes, a firm that monitors the energy industry, the number of active drilling rigs in the U.S. this week is down about 7% from this time a year ago. Low oil prices and skeptical investors have kept companies cautious. However, technological improvements have helped make U.S. oil production more efficient, squeezing more oil and natural gas out of existing wells, which has helped keep production high anyway.   — Camila Domonoske, Cars and Energy Correspondent      Voter fraud is already incredibly rare   TRUMP: \"I am asking you to approve the SAVE AMERICA Act to stop illegal aliens and others who are unpermitted persons from voting in our sacred American elections. The cheating is rampant in our elections. It’s rampant.\"   Trump has been claiming that noncitizens are voting en masse in American elections for more than a decade.   But it's illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal races, and they have never been found to vote in anything but microscopic numbers. In the rare cases they do vote, research has found it's often due to misunderstandings about the rules, as opposed to an attempt to influence election results, as Trump often claims.   Still, since Trump took office for his second term, his government has put more resources than ever before toward trying to find these voters. They've found very little.   \"Even states that are looking everywhere to try to amplify the numbers of noncitizens … when they actually look, they find a surprisingly, shockingly small number,\" said David Becker, an election expert who runs a nonprofit that has been tracking noncitizen voting audits across the country.   \n   In Michigan, an audit after the 2024 election found 16 alleged noncitizen votes out of the state's roughly 5.7 million cast. In Iowa, it was 35 votes out of 1.67 million cast.   Experts often note that for immigrants without legal status, it doesn't make sense to risk prison, deportation and family separation to cast one ballot — especially because the inherent paper trail of voting makes it very easy to get caught.   Trump correctly noted that not every state requires voters to show photo ID at the time they cast a ballot. But he oversimplified the dozen or so states that don't have such a requirement in implying that anyone can easily vote without being verified by officials first.   Federal law already requires identity verification for all voters at registration, by mandating they provide a valid driver's license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number. People who don't register in person are also required to provide ID the first time they vote, regardless of the state they live in.   The SAVE America Act that Trump referenced tonight isn't expected to garner the requisite 60 votes in the Senate needed to overcome a legislative filibuster, but you can still read a breakdown of what's in the proposed Republican election overhaul here.   — Miles Parks, Voting Correspondent      Congressional stock trading ban faces tough odds for passage   TRUMP: “As we ensure that all Americans can profit from a rising stock market, let's also ensure that members of Congress cannot corruptly profit from using insider information. They stood up for that? I can't believe it. I can't believe it. Did Nancy Pelosi stand up if she's here? Doubt it. Pass the 'Stop Insider Trading Act' without delay. I wasn't sure if anybody even on this side was going to applaud for that. I was – I’m very impressed.\"   \n   Congress has unsuccessfully pursued a stock trading ban for their members for years. Members of both sides of the aisle have put forth proposals that have drawn broad, bipartisan support. However, those efforts have fallen short of becoming law.   Those failures have spanned several House speakers, including former Speakers Nancy Pelosi and Kevin McCarthy. Pelosi's husband, Paul, has drawn attention as a venture capitalist who has been active in trading.   This time around, the GOP-led Stop Insider Trading Act has little chance of passage, currently without much bipartisan support.   — Claudia Grisales, Congressional Correspondent       DHS and terrorism prevention   TRUMP: “As we speak, Democrats in this Chamber have cut off all funding for the Department of Homeland Security — it's all cut off. All cut off. They have instituted another Democrat shutdown, the first one costing us two points on GDP. Two points we lost on GDP, which probably made them quite happy, actually. Now they have closed the agency responsible for protecting Americans from terrorists and murderers.\"   Since Trump took office for his second term in January 2025, there have been mounting concerns among former federal employees and field experts about a diminished capacity to counter violent extremism. Many seasoned counterterrorism officials left government service, and budget cuts have fundamentally shifted the core infrastructure that had been devoted to community-based prevention programs, data-gathering and analysis. In the case of one of these programs, the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships, the administration replaced an outgoing head with a 22-year-old without experience in law enforcement or counterterrorism. Outside of DHS, other agencies that have traditionally played a role in countering violent extremism, such as the FBI, have seen manpower diverted to immigration enforcement.   — Odette Yousef, Domestic Extremism Correspondent       Payments to insurance companies   TRUMP: \"That's why I introduced the “Great Health Care Plan.” I want to stop all payments to big insurance companies and instead, give that money directly to the people so they can buy their own health care, which will be better health care at a much lower cost.\"   \n   At this point, Trump's \"Great Health Care Plan\" isn't a comprehensive health policy, but an articulation of policy priorities that Trump has asked Congress to develop into legislation. He supports loosening rules around mandatory benefits required by the Affordable Care Act and promoting health savings accounts, which allow people to set aside pre-tax funds to pay for certain health-related expenses. Under current law, HSA funds can't be used for health insurance costs like premiums.   Even the \"catastrophic\" or skinny plans preferred by Trump are private insurance plans, and the money paid for them goes to big insurance companies. The only way to stop payments to health insurance companies would be to bolster public health insurance options like Medicaid and Medicare.   A recent poll from KFF found Americans are more worried about health costs than any other household expenses. It also found that people plan to vote based on whether they think a candidate will help with health costs.   This year, ACA premiums have doubled on average, and in some cases, have increased much more, because Republicans did not vote with Democrats to extend extra ACA tax credits. Since then, more than a million people have dropped their coverage.   — Selena Simmons-Duffin, Health Policy Correspondent      Did murderers, ex-convicts and mental institution patients emigrate to the U.S. under Biden?   TRUMP: \"They poured in by the millions and millions from prisons, from mental institutions. There were murderers, 11,888 murders. They came into our country.\"   There is no evidence of this.   A historic number of people came across the U.S. border during the Biden administration, however many were vetted. Programs like parole and the CBP One app required entry screenings and interviews.   There has also been extensive research showing that immigrants, both documented and undocumented, are less likely to commit crimes than citizens. What's more, although the number of people in immigration detention is at a historic high (near 70,000 as of earlier this month), around 74% have no criminal conviction.   \n   — Jasmine Garsd, Immigration Correspondent      Tariffs and manufacturing   TRUMP: \"Moving forward, factories, jobs, investment and trillions and trillions of dollars will continue pouring into the United States of America because we finally have a president who puts America first.\"   President Trump argues that high tariffs will spark a renaissance in U.S. manufacturing. But it hasn't happened yet. Factories have been in a slump for most of the last year, shedding 108,000 jobs in 2025, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.   No doubt Trump's taxes on foreign imports have allowed some U.S. factories to raise their prices. But the vast majority of factory managers, many of whom rely on foreign components, say tariffs have been a drag on their business. \"Morale is very low across manufacturing in general,\" one unnamed factory manager told the Institute for Supply Management in December.   — Scott Horsley, Chief Economics Correspondent      Venezuelan oil \"received\" in the U.S.   TRUMP: “We just received from our new friend and partner, Venezuela, more than 80 million barrels of oil.”   Since the U.S. captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro last month, the U.S. government has been helping sell some of Venezuela's oil. The U.S. has worked with two Swiss oil trading companies, Vitol and Trafigura. (Both Vitol and Trafigura have pleaded guilty to bribery and settled cases with the Department of Justice during the Biden administration.)   Secretary of Energy Chris Wright says that U.S.-facilitated oil sales total more than $1 billion. However the Venezuelan government has said it has only received $300 million. In a Senate hearing last month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said $200 million is in a bank account in Qatar. It's unclear where the rest of the money is and if and when it will get to the Venezuelan people.   The U.S. is the biggest producer of oil in the world and the world is currently oversupplied with oil.   \n   – Julia Simon, Climate Solutions Correspondent      Prescription drug prices   TRUMP: “I’m also ending the wildly inflated cost of prescription drugs like it’s never happened before. Other presidents tried to do it, but they never could. They tried. Most didn’t try, actually. But they tried. They said they’d try. They couldn't do it. They didn't even come close. They were all talk and no action, but I got it done under my just-enacted most-favored nation agreements, Americans who have for decades paid by far the highest prices of any nation anywhere in the world for prescription drugs, will now pay the lowest price anywhere in the world for drugs anywhere – the lowest price. ”   This claim is not true. Americans still pay several times more money for prescription drugs than people in peer countries. The Trump administration has taken aim at drug prices in various ways, but how helpful those efforts will ultimately be — and for how many people — is not yet clear.   His biggest move so far has been to use tariffs as leverage to negotiate deals with more than a dozen drugmakers, and then launch a direct-to-consumer website called TrumpRx where people can buy brand-named drugs at a discount. There are only about 40 drugs currently available on the site, and those same companies Trump struck deals with raised prices on hundreds of other drugs they sell. For most people, using insurance and paying a copay for their medications will be cheaper than TrumpRx, according to an analysis by KFF.   What many peer countries do to keep the prices of prescription drugs down is to regulate those prices. President Trump and congressional Republicans have generally rejected that approach, branding it as \"government price setting.\"   — Selena Simmons-Duffin & Sydney Lupkin, health correspondents      Data centers and electricity rates   TRUMP: \"Many Americans are also concerned that energy demand from AI data centers could unfairly drive up their electric utility bills. Tonight, I'm pleased to announce that I have negotiated the new ratepayer protection pledge. You know what that is. We're telling the major tech companies that they have the obligation to provide for their own power needs; they can build their own power plants as part of their factory.\"   Electricity prices rose 6.3% in the last 12 months – more than double the overall rate of inflation. That's partly due to the high cost of natural gas, which is a major fuel for power plants. It's also due to increased demand, some of which comes from power-hungry data centers. Rising electricity prices were a big theme in last year's gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia.   — Scott Horsley, Chief Economics Correspondent      Declining murder rates    TRUMP: “Last year, the murder rate saw its single largest decline in recorded history. This is the biggest decline, think of it, in recorded history, the lowest number in over 125 years.”   Murders have been on a steep decline following a pandemic-era surge.   The homicide rate in 35 studied cities dropped 21% in 2025, compared with 2024, according to data from the Council on Criminal Justice.   The FBI hasn't released 2025 homicide data for all jurisdictions nationwide yet. However, the Council on Criminal Justice states \"there is a strong possibility\" that the murder rate will be roughly 4 per 100,000 residents. That, according to the council, would be the lowest rate ever recorded, going back to 1900. It would also mark the largest single-year percentage drop in homicides on record.   Murders and violent crime were already declining under the Biden administration. In 2024, President Joe Biden's final year in office, violent crime dropped to a 20-year low.   — Saige Miller, Washington Desk Producer      Standing by tariffs after rebuke by SCOTUS   TRUMP: \"As time goes by, I believe the tariffs, paid for by foreign countries, will, like in the past, substantially replace the modern day system of income tax, taking a great financial burden off the people that I love.\"   The federal government has been collecting about $30 billion every month in tariffs, which is far more than it made from import taxes before Trump returned to the White House last year.   The Supreme Court struck down about half of Trump's tariffs last week, ruling that the president had exceeded his authority. Some of those levies are being replaced with alternative import taxes.   The Constitution gives Congress the power to levy tariffs — though lawmakers have delegated limited tariff powers to the executive branch.   Economists say the vast majority of tariff bills are being paid by businesses in the U.S. that import products. In some cases, those costs are being passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices.   Tariff revenue, while substantial, has fallen short of what the administration projected. This is partly because some imports have been granted tariff exemptions, and partly because importers have shifted production to countries facing lower tariff rates. Imports from China, for example, made up 12% of total imports in 2024. By last fall that had dropped to about 8%.   — Scott Horsley, Chief Economics Correspondent      Tax cuts   TRUMP: \"Last year I urged this Congress to begin the mission by passing the largest tax cuts in American history, and our Republican majorities delivered so beautifully.\"   Congressional Republicans voted last summer to extend portions of the 2017 tax cut which otherwise would have expired last year. An analysis by the Tax Foundation found the package — the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — is the sixth largest tax cut in U.S. history, not the largest. The bill also adds new tax breaks on tips, overtime pay and Social Security benefits. The result will be somewhat higher take-home pay for many workers in 2026. The bill also cut government spending on safety-net programs such as Medicaid and food stamps.   The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office says the bulk of the tax savings will go to the wealthy. Middle-income households will see a smaller benefit, between $500 and $1000 a year. For families making less than $55,000 the loss of government benefits will likely outweigh any tax savings, leaving them worse off. The tax cut is also expected to encourage more business investment, which could boost future economic growth.   — Scott Horsley, Chief Economics Correspondent      Gasoline prices   TRUMP: \"Gasoline, which reached a peak of over $6 a gallon in some states under my predecessor — it was, quite honestly, a disaster — is now below $2.30 a gallon in most states, and in some places, $1.99 a gallon. And when I visited the great state of Iowa just a few weeks ago, I even saw $1.85 a gallon for gasoline.\"   According to GasBuddy, only the cheapest 10% of stations in the country are seeing prices of $2.31 per gallon or cheaper. And while gasoline was $1.85 a gallon in Iowa in early January, prices have since risen. As for $1.99 gasoline, \"only 8 out of roughly 150,000 gas stations nationwide are selling gasoline below $2 per gallon,\" GasBuddy's Patrick de Haan wrote on Tuesday.   While the specific prices named by President Trump are exceptional rather than representative, gasoline is certainly cheaper now than it was before his inauguration. The national average gasoline price is currently at $2.92 a gallon, according to AAA, or about 22 cents cheaper than this time a year ago.   Those prices are driven by global markets, and a worldwide oversupply of oil is the dominant force keeping prices in check. Presidents do not set gasoline prices. However, politics can be a factor in global markets, and Trump has put pressure on the oil cartel OPEC to keep oil prices down.   — Camila Domonoske, Cars and Energy Correspondent      Job growth   TRUMP: \"More Americans are working today than at any time in the history of our country. Think about that — any time in the history of our country, more working today, and 100% of all jobs created under my administration have been in the private sector. \"   Job growth slowed sharply in the last year. U.S. employers added just 181,000 jobs in all of 2025, compared to more than 1.4 million in 2024. Hiring picked up in January of this year, but the job gains last month were concentrated in health care — an industry that is typically insulated from the ups and downs of the broader economy. Unemployment has remained low — just 4.3% in January — but that's up from 4% a year ago when Trump returned to the White House.   — Scott Horsley, Chief Economics Correspondent      Do we have the strongest and most secure border so far?   TRUMP: \"After four years in which millions and millions of illegal aliens poured across our borders totally unvetted and unchecked, we now have the strongest and most secure border in American history, by far.\"   This is partly true.   It is not true that there have been zero crossings; for example, there were 237,538 in 2025, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. But Border Patrol encounters with migrants crossing into the United States from Mexico have fallen to their lowest level in more than 50 years, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of statistics from the federal government.   While it is true that there were a historic number of crossings during the Biden administration, it is untrue that the border was wide open for people to cross unvetted: in the final year of his administration, President Biden significantly tightened controls.   — Jasmine Garsd, Immigration Correspondent      Stock market    TRUMP: \"The stock market has set 53 all-time record highs since the election. Think of that – one year – boosting pensions, 401(k)s and retirement accounts for the millions and millions of Americans, they're all gaining. Everybody's up, way up.\"   The stock market has enjoyed big gains over the last year, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average topping 50,000 for the first time earlier this month. In 2025, the S&P 500 index jumped 18%, after a 24% gain in 2024. The stock market rally has given a boost to many people's retirement savings. It's important to remember, however, that stock ownership is very concentrated. The richest 10% of families own 87% of all stock market wealth, while half of all Americans own little or no stock.   — Scott Horsley, Chief Economics Correspondent       Inflated claims about inflation   TRUMP: \"The Biden administration and its allies in Congress gave us the worst inflation in the history of our country, but in 12 months, my administration has driven core inflation down to the lowest level in more than five years, and in the last three months of 2025 it was down to 1.7%.\"   Inflation has cooled in recent months. But the cost of living is still climbing faster than most people would like. A few items have gotten cheaper in the last year, such as gasoline and eggs. But housing, groceries, electricity and natural gas have all gotten more expensive.   Inflation reached a four-decade high of 9.1% in 2022, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent prices soaring around the world. By the time President Joe Biden left office, inflation had fallen to 3%. It dropped as low as 2.3% last April, before rebounding to 3% in September.   Trump's tariffs have raised the price of some imported goods, but the effects on the overall cost of living have been limited. Annual inflation dipped to 2.4% in January. (A separate measure of inflation, which is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, shows that prices are still climbing at roughly the same rate that they were a year ago.)   — Scott Horsley, Chief Economics Correspondent      A \"turnaround for the ages\"   TRUMP: \"When I last spoke at this chamber 12 months ago, I had just inherited a nation in crisis with a stagnant economy, inflation at record levels…\"   The U.S. economy was in solid shape before President Trump returned to the White House for his second term. In fact, in October 2024, The Economist had labeled the U.S. economy \"the envy of the world,\" because it had bounced back from the pandemic recession in stronger shape than most of its peers. To be sure, many Americans were frustrated with the high cost of living, and that dissatisfaction contributed to Trump's victory the following month. However, costs have continued to climb over the last year, and that dissatisfaction is now weighing on Trump's own approval rating. Nearly six-in-ten Americans say the country is worse off now than it was a year ago, according to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll.   — Scott Horsley, Chief Economics Correspondent   \n",

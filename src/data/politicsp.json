This, in effect, will leave an <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/08/nx-s1-5529364/new-snap-rules-could-result-in-2-4-million-people-losing-benefits-each-month\" target=\"_blank\">estimated 2.4 million Americans</a> without food aid.</p>   \n   <p>\"The national food insecurity survey is a critical, reliable data source that shows how many families in America struggle to put food on the table,\" Crystal FitzSimons, president of the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) told NPR. FRAC is an anti-hunger organization that advocates for food security in the U.S.</p>   <p>FitzSimons said that without the annual report, advocates and policymakers won't have a clear lens on the scale of hunger in America, and how to prevent it.</p>   <p>\"Without that data, we are flying blind, and we don't know the impact,\" FitzSimons said.</p>   <p>According <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/key-statistics-graphics\" target=\"_blank\">to the USDA</a>, 47.4 million people lived in food insecure households in 2023. This means that at certain times, \"these households were uncertain of having or unable to acquire enough food to meet the needs of all their members.\" Among those, nearly 14 million were children.</p>   <p>In the announcement, the Agriculture Department stated, \"trends in the prevalence of food insecurity have remained virtually unchanged.\"</p>   <p>Experts are saying that's not true.</p>   <p>\"Last year's report for 2023 showed an increase in food insecurity,\" Kyle Ross, a policy analyst with the progressive research group the Center for American Progress, told NPR. \"At that point, it has been the largest rate of food insecurity that the country has seen since 2014 and substantially larger than just two years prior.\"</p>   \n   <p>The 2023 report revealed that the number of food-insecure children in the United States increased by 3.2% compared to 2022's annual report, <a href=\"https://frac.org/hunger-poverty-america\" target=\"_blank\">according to the FRAC</a>.</p>   <p>Ross also said the Agriculture Department's claim that the annual report on food and nutrition insecurity in America might be politicized is not accurate.</p>   <p>\"That has no bearing in reality whatsoever,\" Ross said.</p>   <p>Created during the Clinton administration, the Household Food Security Report has been a yearly fixture in understanding food insecurity and policy for vulnerable Americans. The survey has been published annually for 30 years, throughout both Republican and Democratic administrations.</p>   \n   <p>Ross thinks that the higher job requirements people have to meet to access SNAP benefits, and the resulting rise in food insecurity, is the likely motive behind the Trump administration scrapping the report.</p>   <p>\"This will substantially increase food insecurity, and unfortunately, that will make itself clear in the data of food insecurity reports in the next couple of years,\" Ross said.</p>   <p>The USDA did not respond to questions from NPR about the reasons behind the report's cancellation.</p>   <p>The last report will be released on Oct. 22, according to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-ending-america-hunger-report-snap-cuts-750f90757f50ab2d8bc97dfca5a917dd\" target=\"_blank\">The Associated Press</a>.

I forgive him because it's what Christ did. And it's what Charlie would do.\"</p>   \n   <p>Kirk went on to say that \"the answer to hate is not hate. The answer — we know from the Gospel — is love.\" </p>   <p>For most of the memorial, Kirk's friends, allies and supporters spoke about the growth of his conservative operation from an idea in 2012 into one of the most influential organizations in modern politics, emphasizing his personal character and a vision rooted in their shared faith for carrying on his work.</p>   <p>While President Trump described Kirk as a \"missionary with a noble spirit,\" he said he disagreed with his views on those with different opinions.</p>   <p>\"He did not hate his opponents, he wanted the best for them,\" Trump said. \"That's where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponent. I don't want the best for them.\"</p>   <p>In the days since Kirk was shot and killed on the campus of Utah Valley University, Kirk's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/10/nx-s1-5537045/charlie-kirk-shot-utah\" target=\"_blank\">legacy as a youth organizer</a> and evangelizer of conservative politics and conservative Christianity has taken on a new life, with tens of thousands of new requests to create chapters of his Turning Point group on high school and college campuses, the organization says.</p>   <p>Erika Kirk is taking over as the leader of Turning Point, and prominent Republican figures like Vice President Vance and broadcaster Tucker Carlson have stepped in to host <em>The Charlie Kirk Show</em>, remembering their friend and vowing to advance his causes.</p>   \n   <h3>Some see Kirk's death as Democrats' fault</h3>   <p>Kirk's killing has also led to an escalation of rhetoric and action from the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers who have painted their ideological opponents as radical forces of evil who have harmed the country.</p>   <p>On Kirk's podcast last week, Vance said political violence is \"not a both-sides problem\" and blamed the \"incredibly destructive movement of left-wing extremism\" for the attack allegedly carried out by a lone shooter.</p>   <p>Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller suggested that the federal government would \"identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy\" left-wing networks that he blamed without evidence for fomenting violence, and Trump vowed to label the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5545764/trump-says-he-plans-to-designate-antifa-as-a-terrorist-organization\" target=\"_blank\">nebulous left-wing \"antifa\" ideological movement</a> a \"major terrorist organization.\"</p>   \n   <p>On Sunday night, President Trump hailed Kirk as a \"martyr,\" which others like onetime Trump adviser Steve Bannon have echoed. Pro-Trump influencer Chaya Raichik, who runs the \"Libs of TikTok\" social media account, wrote \"THIS IS WAR.\" And lawmakers like Wisconsin GOP Rep. Derrick Van Orden compared Kirk's killing as a catalyst similar to Sept. 11 and that he would \"not allow these leftist scumbags to take my country.\" </p>   <p>Prominent <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/13/nx-s1-5538476/charlie-kirk-jobs-target-social-media-critics-resign\" target=\"_blank\">online voices</a> on the right have called for people who have made social media posts criticizing Kirk or mocking his death to lose their jobs or face investigation, including the vice president telling people to \"call them out and, hell, call their employer.\"</p>   <p>The president and Federal Communications Chairman Brendan Carr are facing questions about freedom of speech protections after Carr threatened ABC over remarks made by late night host Jimmy Kimmel in a monologue last week about Kirk's killing.

And they added that state Medicaid programs, in partnership with the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, would cover this use.</p>   \n   <p>The suite of changes were announced despite a notable lack of clear scientific evidence to support these moves. They were presented as part of what the administration said was its commitment to identify the root causes of autism, diagnoses of which have increased in recent years.</p>   <p>Flanked by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid head Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Trump pinned substantial blame for rising autism rates on the common painkiller, which is also known by its<strong> </strong>brand name<strong>, </strong>Tylenol.</p>   \n   <p>\"Taking Tylenol is not good — I'll say it: It's not good,\" he said, suggesting without evidence that communities without access to the medicine have \"no autism,\" while in others, autism now affects one in 12 boys. (An estimated <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/17/nx-s1-5366693/researcher-discusses-cdc-findings-that-autism-rates-have-increased-in-kids\" target=\"_blank\">1 in 31 children in the U.S. </a>are diagnosed with autism.)  Trump also discouraged giving acetaminophen to babies, as well. (He also suggested that vaccines and their frequency may be a culprit in causing autism, an oft-repeated claim that has been debunked by decades of research.)</p>   <p>Trump and his deputies repeatedly advised pregnant women to refrain from using acetaminophen, and said they would caution physicians against using it — contrary to what physicians' groups say.</p>   \n   <p>In a statement sent to NPR, Tylenol maker Kenvue disputed<strong> </strong>the administration's claims.</p>   <p>\"We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism,\" the statement said. \"We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned about the health risks and confusion this poses for expecting mothers and parents.\"</p>   <p>During the press conference, officials pointed to <a href=\"https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-025-01208-0\" target=\"_blank\">a study</a> done by Harvard University and other researchers that found that women who reported taking acetaminophen while they were pregnant seemed to be slightly more likely to have a child who was later diagnosed with autism.</p>   \n   <p>One of the researchers on that study was Ann Bauer, an epidemiologist at the University of Massachusetts. Bauer said she thinks pregnant women should be told about a possible risk from acetaminophen. But the researcher also was worried that it might be too soon to have the federal government offering guidance on its use.</p>   <p>\"I'm a little concerned about how this message is going to come because I think they may be jumping the gun,\" Bauer said before the announcement was made. \"I think those of us in the research community would like to see stronger evidence.\"</p>   \n   <p>Diagnoses of autism have risen over the past two decades, though use of acetaminophen has not — remaining largely steady over that time. The increase in diagnoses is often attributed to a broadened definition of autism, with changes in the diagnostic criteria, as well as increased awareness and screening, but Kennedy dismissed those explanations as a \"canard.\"</p>   <p>Many physicians and autism advocacy groups said they opposed the administration's stance.</p>   <p>\"It is highly unsettling that our federal health agencies are willing to make an announcement that will affect the health and well-being of millions of people without the backing of reliable data,\" Steven J. Fleischman, MD, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a written statement.</p>   <p>Even the notice about acetaminophen issued to physicians by the Food and Drug Administration <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/188843/download?attachment=&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery\" target=\"_blank\"><u>pointed out</u></a> that a possible link to autism was an area of ongoing scientific debate, and said that \"while an association between acetaminophen and autism has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established and there are contrary studies in the scientific literature.\"</p>   <p>Specifically, the Food and Drug Administration, as well as the agency that sets policy for Medicare and Medicaid, pledged to change the indication on a medication called leucovorin as a treatment for autism, despite scant evidence that this form of vitamin B has any effect.</p>   <p>In response to that change, the American Psychiatric Association issued a statement opposing the administration's suggestion that vaccines cause autism, adding that leucovorin (folinic acid) is not recommended to treat autism, adding \"it will require many more years of research before we know if leucovorin is an appropriate treatment for individuals with autism.\"</p>   <p>But, by his own admission, President Trump said he was not precise with his language on the subject. But he repeated the same message multiple times during his remarks.</p>   \n   <p>\"If you can't tough it out,\" President Trump said, limited use of acetaminophen might be necessary. But \"ideally you don't take it at all,\" he said, in a rambling press conference that at times conflated vaccine and painkiller use, citing both unconfirmed rumors and personal suppositions that both might be harmful to women and babies.</p>   <p>\"It looks like you're pumping it into a horse,\" Trump said of multiple vaccinations given to children. \"The Amish, for example, have no autism,\" he said, despite research showing that autism does affect Amish communities, later adding that there are no cases of autism in Cuba, when in fact there are cases of autism there. He called on pregnant women to refrain from using the common painkiller, repeatedly saying \"Don't take Tylenol.\"</p>   <p>\"There's no downside,\" he maintained, although pregnant women are told to avoid other anti-fever drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen, and fever can be dangerous in a pregnancy. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, which recommends using acetaminophen to treat fever and pain in pregnant women, says that untreated fever can cause grave harms such as miscarriage, birth defects or premature birth, especially early in a pregnancy.</p>   <p>Merck, maker of various vaccines including for measles, pneumonia and HPV, also responded, saying, \"the recent statement that vaccines could be linked to autism is inconsistent with the extensive scientific studies that have been conducted over the past 25 years, which have consistently shown no link between vaccination and autism.\"</p>   <p>\"Today's announcement risks taking us backwards,\" said Jackie Dilworth, a spokesperson for The Arc of the United States, a group representing people with developmental disabilities and their families. \"Today's claims risk fueling stigma, misleading the public, and distracting from what families truly need,\" because they present unproven suppositions as fact, she said.</p>\n</div>"

Bunch III a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/12/nx-s1-5500550/smithsonian-trump-review\" target=\"_blank\">letter</a> requiring a \"comprehensive internal review\" of eight Smithsonian museums including American History, American Art Museum, Natural History and Air & Space.</p>   <p>Now, historians and citizens concerned about the Trump administration's approach to, and involvement in, the Smithsonian have come together to document how the museums look today. Their goal is to produce a record before any changes that might be made.</p>   \n   <p>Two historians in particular put out the call for help. One, Georgetown University professor Jim Millward, said the Trump administration's pressure on the Smithsonian has him alarmed. \"I'm a historian of China, and so I'm really used to when governments are stepping in trying to whitewash history and censor history like that,\" he said. \"And it really upset me to see this being threatened in the United States as well.\"</p>   <p>Millward's colleague, historian Chandra Manning, was equally concerned, so the two of them got together to hatch a plan. \"As citizens, we wanted to find a way to step forward and steward this national treasure for now and for the future,\" said Manning.</p>   <p>Manning said they took inspiration from \"<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/save-our-signs/home\" target=\"_blank\">Save Our Signs</a>,\" which was created in response to the Trump administration's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/17/nx-s1-5540117/government-moves-to-national-scrub-park-sites-of-negative-history\" target=\"_blank\">call</a> for visitors to report signs in National Parks that are \"negative about either past or living Americans.\" Hundreds of visitors photographed signs to help create an archive of what the signs said before any changes were made.</p>   <p>\"<a href=\"https://www.citizenhistorians.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Citizen Historians</a>\" aims to do the same for the Smithsonian, said Millward.</p>   <p>\"So<strong> </strong>we came up with this idea to call for volunteers to go out and, in a systematic way, go exhibit by exhibit, room by room, hall by hall, museum by museum, and take pictures simply of what's up there now and what's being said now,\" he said.</p>   \n   <h3>A vast \"repository of human wisdom\"</h3>   <p>This is a massive undertaking. There are millions of artifacts, objects, specimens and artworks on view at the Smithsonian's 21 museums.</p>   \n   <p>\"The range is really quite breathtaking,\" said Manning, \"from Jackie Robinson's jersey to prehistoric skeletons to Ming vases. It really is a repository of human wisdom right here in Washington, D.C.\"</p>   <p>The historians sent their request for volunteers to friends, neighbors and colleagues. The only requirement was a smartphone and a desire \"to join us to help save our history,\" according to the letter, which was shared with NPR.</p>   <p>Millward said hundreds of people responded.</p>   <p>\"The volunteers run the gamut. Young and old people from all over D.C., Maryland and Virginia,\" he said. \"Some had worked at the Smithsonian before, maybe as docents or even as employees, but many had not. They'd simply visited the Smithsonian themselves over the years and had a real feeling of how important it was.\"</p>   <h3>\"Citizen historians\" with smartphones</h3>   <p>Volunteer Shelley Smith, a retired public health professional, was assigned the gallery \"Forces for Change: Mary McLeod Bethune and Black Women's Activism\" at National Museum of African American History and Culture</p>   \n   <p>In 1904, Bethune started a school for Black girls in Daytona Beach, Fla. She went on to become a prominent civil rights activist and the first African American to have a state-commissioned statue in the U.S. Capitol, of which a replica is in the gallery. Among the other influential Black women honored are Mamie Till-Mobley, Shirley Chisholm, Lena Horne, Oprah Winfrey and poet Amanda Gorman.</p>   <p>Smith photographed everything: a small diary Bethune kept when she visited Europe in 1927, the historic images, the wall text.</p>   <p>\"You see history in a different light,\" she said, \"They tell the story from a lot of different angles. And so it was just so important to document what the people that initiated this museum and project wanted to be out there and wanted to be said.\"</p>   \n   <p>Millward said he believes museums should change with the times based on scholarly research and historic oversights, not with political pressure.</p>   <p>\"We don't want a museum that doesn't deal with sensitive issues. We want one that's honest and can talk about the whole range of our history and culture,\" he said.</p>   <p>According to Millward, volunteers have so far uploaded more than 25,000 photographs and videos from Smithsonian museums to a temporary storage site. He and his colleagues are looking for a permanent home for the images.

The signers also include Selena Gomez and Olivia Rodrigo, who both had early success as Disney actors.</p>   \n   <p>Other signers include Tom Hanks, Jennifer Aniston, Robert DeNiro, Jason Bateman, Natalie Portman and Maya Rudolph.</p>   \n   <p>In part, the letter reads: \"Last week, Jimmy Kimmel was taken off the air after the government threatened a private company with retaliation, marking a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation. In an attempt to silence its critics, our government has resorted to threatening the livelihoods of journalists, talk show hosts, artists, creatives, and entertainers across the board. This runs counter to the values our nation was built upon, and our Constitution guarantees … Regardless of our political affiliation, or whether we engage in politics or not, we all love our country. We also share the belief that our voices should never be silenced by those in power – because if it happens to one of us, it happens to all of us.\"</p>   <p>In his opening monologue last Monday, Kimmel had criticized the conservative response to the assassination of conservative activist and close Trump ally Charlie Kirk. \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,\" Kimmel said.</p>   \n   <p>Last Wednesday, Brendan Carr, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5546764/fcc-brendan-carr-kimmel-trump-free-speech\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> conservative podcaster Benny Johnson: \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct to take action on Kimmel or, you know, there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.\"</p>   <p>Within <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/18/nx-s1-5545671/kimmel-suspension-charlie-kirk-death-free-speech-censorship\" target=\"_blank\">hours</a>, ABC announced it would suspend Kimmel's show indefinitely. On the Fox News program <em>Saturday in America</em>, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/karoline-leavitt-says-obama-has-no-idea-what-hes-talking-about-after-kimmel-comments.amp\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>, \"The decision to fire Jimmy Kimmel and to cancel his show came from executives at ABC.\" Kimmel has not been fired, nor has his show been canceled.</p>   \n   <p>The executive director of the ACLU, Anthony D. Romero, told NPR in a written statement on Monday: \"We now find ourselves in a modern McCarthy era, facing exactly the type of heavy-handed government censorship our Constitution rightfully forbids. The silencing of Jimmy Kimmel and jawboning of media outlets through lawsuits and threats to their licenses evoke dark memories of the 1950s. We must remember, however, that Senator McCarthy was ultimately disgraced and neutralized once Americans mobilized and stood up to him. We must do the same today because, together, our voices are louder and, together, we will fight to be heard.\"</p>   \n   <p>Other entertainers have taken separate actions to make their feelings known – including some who also have ties to Disney properties.</p>   <p>On Monday morning, hosts of the popular ABC morning show <em>The View</em> also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxcGIHLUcRM\" target=\"_blank\">criticized</a> the Trump administration and their own corporate bosses. Host Whoopi Goldberg said that her show had waited several days to see if Kimmel would make any sort of public statement. \"The government cannot — cannot — apply pressure to force someone to be silenced,\" she said. Her co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin added, \"The First Amendment is the first for a reason, because you need to be able to hold those in power accountable.\"</p>   <p>On Sunday evening, musician Sarah McLachlan, one of the founders of the Lilith Fair music festival, and fellow artist Jewel declined to perform at the premiere of the Hulu documentary <em>Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery</em>. (Hulu is also owned by Disney.)</p>   <p>In comments made from the stage before the documentary's screening in Los Angeles, McLachlan — who appears in the film — announced the decision to cancel the live performances. She <a href=\"https://x.com/chrissgardner/status/1969995307355431388\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>: \"I've grappled with being here tonight and around what to say about the present situation that we are all faced with, the stark contraction to the many advances we've made watching the insidious erosion of women's rights, of trans and queer rights, the muzzling of free speech. I think we're all fearful for what comes next, and none of us know.\"</p>   \n   <p>Another, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jimmy-kimmel-suspension-reactions-marvel-disney-stars-1236376120/\" target=\"_blank\">currently circulating</a> open letter signed by some <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-vhY9XHKjmqUJ50imhEn4UPXTTYgxY9XlZ83hhA2k_o/edit?tab=t.0\" target=\"_blank\">600 comedians</a> including Jimmy Fallon, Chelsea Handler, Margaret Cho, David Cross and W. Kamau Bell reads in part: \"Every culture needs humor. It's how we heal and how we connect with each other. Take it away, and what's left is fear, silence, and a bleak existence. When the government targets one of us, they target all of us. They strike at the heart of our shared humanity. They strip away the basic right every person deserves: to speak freely, question boldly, and laugh loudly… We will not be silenced.\"</p>   \n   <p>Some prominent conservative lawmakers and commentators have also weighed in on the issue of free speech.</p>   <p>Last week, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, during an episode of his podcast dedicated to Kirk's murder and its aftermath, addressed Attorney General Pam Bondi and her declaration that the Department of Justice would \"target\" those who used \"<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5544346/where-does-free-speech-go-from-here\" target=\"_blank\">hate speech</a>.\" Carlson <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5iCxIu7Syw\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>: \"Consider what it means if you don't respect free speech, which is another way of saying free conscience. The right of other people to make up their own minds about the basic questions of what is right and wrong, and to express their views on those issues. If you don't acknowledge the right of other people to do that, and if you take steps to prevent them from doing that, what are you really saying? You're saying, 'I don't think you have a soul. I think you're a meat puppet I can control.'\"</p>   <p>On Friday, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas criticized Carr and the FCC on his own podcast, calling the situation \"dangerous as hell.\"</p>   <p>\"I gotta say, that's right out of <em>GoodFellas</em>,\" Cruz <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6KYixCBTJc&list=PL5V1QY3MemiGElRzUH3Zea8yGBkMwYMHb&index=3\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. \"That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar going, 'Nice bar you got here. It'd be a shame if something happened to it.'\"</p>\n</div>"

The president said he wanted to see justice served. </p>   <p>\"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/08/nx-s1-5496468/justice-department-escalates-its-campaign-against-trumps-perceived-political-enemies\" target=\"_blank\">he wrote</a>.</p>   <p>What Trump said couldn't wait are criminal investigations of his most prominent critics: former FBI Director Jim Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff. </p>   \n   <p>His post emerged only hours after the top federal prosecutor in northern Virginia left his job under pressure. Erik Siebert had worked closely with Trump's top DOJ leaders this year, but he concluded he could not seek criminal charges the president wanted against James.</p>   <p>Now Lindsey Halligan, who had been serving as a special assistant to the president, was sworn in Monday as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, though she has no prosecutorial experience. Most recently, she's been helping Trump remove what he calls \"improper ideology\" from the Smithsonian museums.</p>   <p>\"This attorney general sent a memo on Day 1 that made it clear that Justice Department lawyers were the president's lawyers, and we are now seeing how that's playing out and how dangerous it is — how it disintegrates the rule of law,\" Stacey Young, a former DOJ attorney who now leads a group called Justice Connection that helps Justice Department workers, said of Attorney General Pam Bondi.</p>   <p>Already this year <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/31/nx-s1-5484932/layoffs-at-the-department-of-justice-are-transforming-its-workforce\" target=\"_blank\">thousands of employees have left the Justice Department</a> through dismissals and forced resignations. Nearly all of the public integrity unit is gone, as are three in four lawyers in the civil rights division. </p>   <p>Many people inside the department are afraid, Young said. After all, she said, if the president is willing to fire a prosecutor for not pursuing his enemies, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/30/nx-s1-5476311/trump-fired-workers-justice-department\" target=\"_blank\">anybody at the department could get fired</a>. </p>   \n   <p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump was understandably frustrated with lawmakers and state officials who investigated him.</p>   <p>\"The president is fulfilling his promise to restore a Department of Justice that demands accountability, and it is not weaponizing the Department of Justice to demand accountability for those who weaponize the Department of Justice,\" Leavitt said.</p>   <p>The Justice Department has traditionally operated with some measure of distance from the White House on criminal investigations. But that distance seems to have closed this year in a way that feels different to longtime observers.</p>   \n   <p>During the presidency of Richard Nixon, public servants at the DOJ felt squeezed between what the president wanted and what the law required. But even Nixon was not as clear and open as Trump is now about what he wanted to happen.</p>   <p>\"In this situation you have a president who is openly, brazenly bragging about his ability to seek retribution against his political enemies,\" said George Washington University law professor Stephen Saltzburg.</p>   <p>Saltzburg said it looks as if the Trump White House is insisting career prosecutors use their power to make life hell for people who challenge Trump — and on the other side of the coin, to drop investigations or pardon people who support the president, including <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/18/nx-s1-5299906/justice-department-trumps-allies-cases\" target=\"_blank\">the people who rioted at the U.S. Capitol</a> four years ago.</p>   <p>Trump's political appointees took an oath to support and defend the Constitution when they arrived on the job. That oath may soon be put to the test, if it hasn't already, Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith <a href=\"https://executivefunctions.substack.com/p/how-should-a-doj-political-appointee\" target=\"_blank\">wrote recently in his newsletter Executive Functions</a>. </p>   <p>\"The Article II truism about presidential power cannot justify continued service to a president and administration openly indifferent to law,\" Goldsmith wrote. \"That is an issue of personal and professional ethics and integrity.\"</p>   \n   <p>Federal prosecutors decide which defendants to charge, and when and where. But there are still some outside checks on that power. In recent weeks, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/05/nx-s1-5526925/as-trump-cracks-down-on-d-c-crime-grand-juries-emerge-as-a-check-on-overreach\" target=\"_blank\">grand juries in Washington, D.C.,</a> have refused to indict people, and magistrate judges have turned away requests for search warrants. </p>   <p>That skepticism, which followed the federal occupation of D.C., may carry over into other cases. Take the claims by Trump's critics of <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB11326\" target=\"_blank\">selective or vindictive prosecution</a>, for example.</p>   <p>In the past, there's been a very high bar to succeed in court on that allegation. But now that Trump is so open about his demands, judges may think differently.</p>   \n   <p>\"I think the president's announcement of what he wants the Justice Department to do is so out of line with our history of promoting equal justice under law and fairness that I don't think that any federal judge is going to look at this and be happy about what the president is doing,\" Saltzburg said.</p>\n</div>"

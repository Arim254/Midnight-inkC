Since the first attack was announced on Sept. 2, these strikes have occurred nearly every week, killing dozens of people.   NPR compiled a list of these boat attacks using posts on Truth Social and X by President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. These posts show grainy video footage of vessels being blown up. The administration has not publicly released further evidence that the boats were actually carrying drugs and who was on board. Select lawmakers have been briefed about  the U.S. attacks, though some of them, including the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee, have requested additional information.   \n   The strikes are part of a larger Trump administration  strategy to target what officials call \"narco-terrorists.\" In a post on X on Nov. 4, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth vowed to \"find and and terminate EVERY vessel with the intention of trafficking drugs to America to poison our citizens,\" adding that \"NO cartel terrorist stands a chance against the American military.\"   Of specific interest to Trump is targeting Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang that his administration designated a foreign terrorist organization in January 2025. In dozens of speeches since taking office, Trump has accused Tren de Aragua of violent criminal activity within the United States' borders.   \"Such organizations torture, maim, mutilate and murder with impunity,\" Trump said in an address to the United Nations on Sept. 23. \"And for this reason, we've recently begun using the supreme power of the United States military to destroy Venezuelan terrorists and trafficking networks led by [Venezuelan President] Nicolás Maduro.\" The Venezuelan government denies the charges that it plays a role in drug trafficking.    \n   Legal scholars question whether the executive branch has the unilateral authority to launch these attacks in international waters without an authorization of force from Congress. The administration claims it does have the authority, and the president has said he doesn't need a congressional declaration of war.   There are also reports that these strikes have endangered and killed civilians. Colombian President Gustavo Petro accused the U.S. of murdering a Colombian fisherman with no ties to drug smuggling in a September strike. Relations between the United States and some Latin American countries had already begun to strain since Trump took office. This latest high-profile military operation in the region marks a significant further erosion.\n",

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is expected to administer the oath of office for the Arizona Democrat after the chamber returns to session this afternoon to take up a plan to reopen the government after a record shutdown.   Speaking with All Things Considered on Tuesday, Grijalva argued her support to release the Jeffrey Epstein files played a role in her wait to get seated.    \"I do believe that there is absolutely a connection,\" Grijalva said. \"That has resulted in denying representation to more than 800,000 Arizonans for the last seven weeks.\"    \n   On the campaign trail, Grijalva promised to sign onto a bipartisan petition to force a vote to release the Epstein files. Hers would be the decisive 218th signature on the petition to trigger that vote — an effort that's been led by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif.   The fight over the delay in swearing her in has galvanized Democrats, who have accused Johnson of stalling in order to put off the vote.   Johnson has rejected those accusations, recently saying he would allow a vote on the Epstein files.   He had previously said he would swear in the winner of the Arizona race as soon as they wanted, but later said he would not do so until after the government reopened. Johnson kept members away during the government shutdown. The chamber's last legislative session before Wednesday was Sept. 19.   \n   Grijalva won her seat on Sept. 23 in a special election to represent the state's 7th Congressional District — a border district that includes parts of Tucson.   During that time, Grijalva and other Democrats worked to meet with Johnson, marching to his office and in some cases, confronting him.    \"I have no staff ... The phones don't work. There's no computer,\" Grijalva told NPR last month. \"We don't have a government email.\"   Grijalva told All Things Considered she \"absolutely\" still planned to sign the Epstein discharge petition once she is sworn in, explaining she wants \"justice for the survivors and consequences for those who committed crimes against children and women.\"   \n   Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said the delays were \"unbelievable,\" but \"those days are over.\" The top Democrat on the House Rules Commitee, Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, said the petition could trigger the vote by early December \"if all goes the way we want it to go.\"    Before that, one of Grijalva's first votes is expected to be on whether to reopen the government. Grijalva said she would not support the bipartisan plan passed by the Senate on Monday, saying the concessions secured by Democrats \"weren't significant in making a difference for anybody who's fighting to keep their health care.\"\n",

The order keeps in place at least for a few more days a chaotic situation. People who depend on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to feed their families in some states have received their full monthly allocations, while others have received nothing.   \n   The order will expire just before midnight Thursday.   The Senate has approved a bill to end the shutdown and the House of Representatives could vote on it as early as Wednesday. Reopening the government would restart the program that helps 42 million Americans buy groceries, but it's not clear how quickly full payments would resume.   The justices chose what is effectively the path of least resistance, anticipating the federal government shutdown will end soon while avoiding any substantive legal ruling about whether lower court orders to keep full payments flowing during the shutdown are correct.   \n   Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was the only one of the nine justices to say she would have revived the lower court orders immediately, but didn't otherwise explain her vote. Jackson signed the initial order temporarily freezing the payments.   \n   Beneficiaries in some states have received their full monthly allocations while in others they have received nothing. Some states have issued partial payments.   How quickly SNAP benefits could reach recipients if the government reopens would vary by state. But states and advocates say that it's easier to make full payments quickly than partial ones.   Carolyn Vega, a policy analyst at the advocacy group Share Our Strength, also said there could be some technical challenges for states that have issued partial benefits to send out the remaining amount.   An urgent need for beneficiaries   In Pennsylvania, full November benefits went out to some people on Friday. But Jim Malliard, 41, of Franklin, said he had not received anything by Monday.   Malliard is a full-time caretaker for his wife, who is blind and has had several strokes this year, and his teenage daughter, who suffered severe medical complications from surgery last year.   That stress has only been compounded by the pause in the $350 monthly SNAP payment he previously received for himself, his wife and daughter. He said he is down to $10 in his account and is relying on what's left in the pantry — mostly rice and ramen.   \n   \"It's kind of been a lot of late nights, making sure I had everything down to the penny to make sure I was right,\" Malliard said. \"To say anxiety has been my issue for the past two weeks is putting it mildly.\"   The political wrangling in Washington has shocked many Americans, and some have been moved to help.   \"I figure that I've spent money on dumber stuff than trying to feed other people during a manufactured famine,\" said Ashley Oxenford, a teacher who set out a \"little food pantry\" in her front yard this week for vulnerable neighbors in Carthage, New York.   \n   SNAP has been the center of an intense fight in court   The Trump administration chose to cut off SNAP funding after October due to the shutdown. That decision sparked lawsuits and a string of swift and contradictory judicial rulings that deal with government power — and impact food access for about 1 in 8 Americans.   The administration went along with two rulings on Oct. 31 by judges who said the government must provide at least partial funding for SNAP. It eventually said recipients would get up to 65% of their regular benefits. But it balked last week when one of the judges said it must fund the program fully for November, even if that means digging into funds the government said need to be maintained in case of emergencies elsewhere.   The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to pause that order.   \n   An appeals court said Monday that full funding should resume, and that requirement was set to kick in Tuesday night before the top court extended the order blocking full SNAP payments.   Congressional talks about reopening government   The U.S. Senate on Monday passed legislation to reopen the federal government with a plan that would include replenishing SNAP funds. Speaker Mike Johnson told members of the House to return to Washington to consider the deal a small group of Senate Democrats made with Republicans.   President Trump has not said whether he would sign it if it reaches his desk, but told reporters at the White House on Sunday that it \"looks like we're getting close to the shutdown ending.\"   Still, the Trump administration said in a Supreme Court filing Monday that it shouldn't be up to the courts.   \"The answer to this crisis is not for federal courts to reallocate resources without lawful authority,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer said in the papers. \"The only way to end this crisis — which the Executive is adamant to end — is for Congress to reopen the government.\"   \n   After Tuesday's ruling, Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on social media: \"Thank you to the Court for allowing Congress to continue its swift progress.\"   The coalition of cities and nonprofit groups who challenged the SNAP pause said in a court filing Tuesday that the Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, is to blame for the confusion.   \"The chaos was sown by USDA's delays and intransigence,\" they said, \"not by the district court's efforts to mitigate that chaos and the harm it has inflicted on families who need food.\"\n",

The measure, which extends funding levels for much of the government through Jan. 30, also includes a trio of appropriation bills that would fully fund some federal programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) through Sept. 30, 2026. Payments for SNAP, which provides food assistance to nearly 42 million people, have been locked in a court fight as a result of the shutdown.   The Senate approved the legislation late Monday, with seven Democrats and one Independent joining most Republicans. The bill includes a provision to reverse the layoffs the Trump administration imposed during the shutdown.   \n   Most Democrats on Capitol Hill angrily denounced the deal because it failed to address the central issue prompting the standoff — how to address health care subsidies that are expiring at the end of the year.   As part of the compromise, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., agreed to hold a vote by mid-December on legislation Democrats will craft to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. Some Republicans agree Congress needs to do something to head off steep premium increases for those relying on the subsidies, but it's unclear there are enough GOP votes to pass a bill through the chamber. Even if a deal comes together in the next few weeks, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has declined to guarantee a vote.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., attends a Veterans Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery on Tuesday.\n                \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a moderate who helped broker the deal with Thune, told reporters on Monday that the shutdown increased political pressure on the GOP to negotiate some solution on health care.   \"If the Republicans don't come to the table, if Donald Trump, who claims he can make a deal, is not willing to say to Speaker Johnson, 'you need to have a vote, you need to get something done,' then come next election, in the midterms, the American people are going to hold them accountable and we are going to continue to make this an issue.\"   \n   House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., panned the deal shortly before the Senate passed it, and urged House Democrats to vote no.    \"We're not going to support a partisan Republican spending bill that continues to gut the health care of the American people,\" Jeffries said.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries,D-N.Y., speaks during a news conference Monday on Capitol Hill.\n                \n                    Tom Brenner/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Tom Brenner/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Jeffries and other opponents of the deal argue the results of last week's elections, which featured big Democratic wins in gubernatorial contests and other local elections, sent a signal that voters backed the shutdown strategy, and wanted action on health care.   \n   Hill Republicans maintain that flight delays due to staffing shortages and disruption in government services over several weeks will harm Democrats who blocked bills to reopen the government. But President Trump suggested after GOP candidates were defeated last week that the shutdown harmed the party.   With the midterm elections a year away it's unclear just how far the longest shutdown on record will factor into voters' decisions, especially if concerns about the economy persist.\n",

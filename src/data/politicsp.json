    "body": "\n      NPR's Steve Inskeep speaks with Miles Bruner, a Republican operative who walked away from his job. Bruner says the GOP is increasingly corrupt and has devolved into a cult of personality.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  An employee of a Republican fundraising firm says he quit. Miles Bruner says he wants to make amends for his politics.MILES BRUNER: For so long, I was working on a project that I feel severely damaged our democracy.INSKEEP: Bruner first wrote his story on the website The Bulwark. He was not a household name, but a guy in the trenches who said he worked for years sending out fundraising appeals he considers deceptive. We invited Bruner to talk about it, and three weeks later, he came by. There is a story behind that delay.I saw your article. We reached out. Initially, we heard you...BRUNER: Yeah.INSKEEP: ...Stopped doing interviews.BRUNER: (Laughter) Yeah. That's correct.INSKEEP: And then we heard, well, that was because it was kind of overwhelming.BRUNER: Yes, it was.INSKEEP: Criticizing your political tribe in such a divisive time stirs a lot of reactions.BRUNER: Explosive rants, and then people, like, targeting your family, and stuff you really just never think you would ever see.INSKEEP: He went dark for a while but also heard from supporters who persuaded him the criticism was just words. Bruner is a Californian who says he became political in high school, arguing against the liberals on the debate team. He went on to work for a Republican state senator and recalls a moment he grew uncomfortable - his boss publicly criticized a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.BRUNER: But we got pushback almost immediately because we had said that the girl killed was a hero, and we kind of had to, like, walk some of it back or, I mean, delete the post. It was so defeating because if we weren't able to call out these attacks, what could we call out? I literally went home, and I cried.INSKEEP: You hung on, though, in the party for quite some time. Moved to Washington, in fact...BRUNER: Yes.INSKEEP: ...And worked not for a campaign directly, but for a company. What was that like?BRUNER: Personally, the work I was doing aside, I'd tell everyone I worked for a great company. I made a decent wage. I was able to start a family because of them.INSKEEP: Campaign Solutions is the name of the company, and they would work for...BRUNER: Yeah, they did digital fundraising for candidates, PACs, committees, that kind of stuff.INSKEEP: So great company. But...BRUNER: But we were writing pretty inflammatory fundraising emails on a daily basis. And it was stuff that I found personally abhorrent. But again, you kind of compartmentalize and you rationalize away a lot of those internal disagreements.INSKEEP: You write in the article, quote, \"it was routine to publish content that pushed election fraud conspiracies, stoked anti-immigrant sentiment and sowed distrust in our institutions.\"BRUNER: Yeah.INSKEEP: Do you remember a particular fundraising email or whatever it was that did that?BRUNER: I had a couple of candidates right after the 2020 election. We pushed out. And then they had no evidence in their specific elections that there was any fraud or any untoward behavior by election officials or the Democratic Party. But we took the initiative to say, we don't know what Democrats are up to. Like, this election can go either way because of potential fraud. We need your help. Send money. So that was pretty routine, especially right after the 2020 election.INSKEEP: I think now about why you went along with it and did it. Did you just think, I'm basically their representative. It's like I'm their lawyer. This is their point of view. I'm helping them get across their point of view?BRUNER: Yeah. You kind of do whatever it takes to win at that point. You figure this is the direction the party's already going, and so the copy is, for lack of a better term, it's working. You know what's getting engagement, and you know that talking about fraud, despite you having no specific knowledge or evidence, is going to work. And so you're going to push whatever you can that maximizes the engagement or dollars in the door for your candidate.INSKEEP: True in social media. True in fundraising.BRUNER: Yes, very true. And they kind of worked hand in glove together. Whatever is working on social media, they inform what will work on email, and then vice versa. So you're always in conversation with each other.INSKEEP: You describe a personal experience that finally pushed you over the edge. In 2023, I think. What happened?BRUNER: What happened in 2023 had to do with the Supreme Court and the Dobbs decision. I had been pro-life as a kid - younger - and then as I got older, I became more pro-choice, but it still wasn't something I've - like, I voted on. It was just kind of something in the background. But yeah, then the Dobbs decision happened. I didn't think much of it, but then my wife and I, we were expecting our first child, and then, unfortunately, we had a miscarriage. The impact of Dobbs all of a sudden became very real to us.INSKEEP: Meaning, you were thinking about what if we had needed?BRUNER: Yeah, what if we had needed it? What if something had been slightly different? What if we had been in a different part of the country? Then it just became unfathomable to me 'cause this was already a tragedy we were dealing with. Like, we struggled with it for several months. And then to have that other layer of not having the support of the medical community or your own government to help, I just couldn't fathom that, and that's one of the things that really began pushing me over the edge.INSKEEP: You say pushing you over the edge. I'm now picturing you clinging to the edge because you stayed on a couple more years.BRUNER: Yeah, I stayed on a couple more years. And the reasons that is because, again, you find excuses. If something's comfortable, you cling on as much as you can because it's something you know.INSKEEP: Do you remember the day that you decided, I'm really, really doing this. I'm really quitting. I'm writing about it?BRUNER: For me, it was seeing the masked federal agents in our streets. That's what kind of pushed me over the edge because all up until that point, I was kind of able to rationalize, compartmentalize. And to say, like, I'm just a cog in the machine. I don't matter. And I woke up and I realized, like, there's no way I would be able to justify this to my daughter, like, when she's an adult. I couldn't explain this away.INSKEEP: I could envision someone listening to this interview who's more conservative saying, sure, you were inside the machine, you didn't like the sausage being made. You didn't like how...BRUNER: Yeah.INSKEEP: ...It was being made. But if you were a Democrat, you'd see something just as bad. Do you believe that's true?BRUNER: All I can say is that I saw what I saw on the Republican side, and I never really heard anything similar that reached the level of what we were putting out. So that's really all I...INSKEEP: In terms of election denialism or whatever.BRUNER: Election denialism, anti-immigrant tirades, anti-democratic policies. Like, those were something that Democrats just weren't putting out.INSKEEP: Miles Bruner, thanks so much.BRUNER: Thank you for having me. I really appreciate it.INSKEEP: We reached out to Campaign Solutions, Bruner's former employer, and have yet to hear back.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

But suspending funding to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP, may have long-lasting impacts, say some experts and those who depend on the program to feed their families.      \n   Jacqueline Giammona, a single working mom of two boys, relies on SNAP for most of her groceries. By last week, her pantry and freezer were near empty.    The Sacramento, Calif., resident was among those in some states who saw November benefits hit the EBT card they use to buy food, amid back-and-forth legal wranglings that reached the Supreme Court.   \"I was really relieved,\" she said, but there was a nagging feeling in her gut. \"Okay, what if they take it away?'\"   \n   Giammona can't fathom why the government would deprive low-income people of a necessity like food. She considers it an \"abuse of power\" with lasting consequences.   \"People are going to distrust the government, and I think that people are going to be really angry about it for a long time,\" she said.   SNAP is the country's largest anti-hunger program, serving the 1 in 8 U.S. residents who live at or just above the poverty line. For more than 60 years it has stood as a key safety-net for those in need.   Funded each year by Congress, its budget is designed to grow and shrink to meet the demand. To see it compromised was startling, said Craig Gundersen, an economics professor at Baylor University.   \"This is a big surprise,\" Gundersen said. \"It really has broken this entitlement status of SNAP, and that's of concern.\"   \n   President Donald Trump has been a critic of SNAP. During the shutdown, he called it out as one of the \"Democrat programs\" he pledged to cut. On his social media platform Truth Social he falsely claimed former President Joe Biden expanded it by \"Billions and Billions of dollars\" and that benefits were given randomly \"to anyone for the asking, as opposed to just those in need.\"   In late October, as the government shutdown wore on, the U.S. Department of Agriculture posted on its website that it would not pay the full $8 billion in SNAP benefits due for November. The message blamed Democrats for the shutdown and the consequent suspension of payments.   \n   Crystal FitzSimons, president of the Food Research & Action Center, said she felt \"shock, outrage, disbelief.\"   \"It was a policy choice that was made by this administration,\" she said.   The administration challenged the ruling of three lower courts that it had reserve funds to pay full SNAP benefits, arguing it needed the money for other children nutrition programs. The Agriculture Department said it had about $4.5 billion in a contingency fund that would cover roughly half of November's benefits. Two judges said the administration should tap other reserves to make up the difference.     The deal cut by Congress to reopen the government funds SNAP through September 2026. But FitzSimons is nervous that the program could be used again as a negotiation tactic.   \"Once you break a taboo,\" she said, \"it's that much easier to break a taboo.\"   Ideally, she'd like to see lawmakers pass a bill to ensure there is no future delay in SNAP benefits, even in a government shutdown.   \"Could Congress compel USDA to actually act? They could,\" she says. \"I'm not sure that we'll be able to get that done before Oct. 1, 2026.\"   \n   Some advocates also worry the SNAP disruption will dissuade people who face hunger from getting help.    \"By making SNAP payments uncertain the shutdown will likely further decrease the number of eligible people who will apply,\" said Joel Berg, CEO of the nonprofit Hunger Free America.   The Agriculture Department did not respond to an NPR request for comment about concerns over mistrust in the program and plans to address that.   The weeks of hardship, anxiety and chaos caused by the funding pause have, however, shined a light on the importance of the program, many noted. SNAP recipients have seen an outpouring of support from people around the country and lawmakers from both major parties.    \"If anything, I think that this shutdown and this disruption of SNAP benefits will make Americans more aware this is really an important program and should retain its entitlement status,\" said Gundersen.   \n   Brittany Jansen, of Phoenix, hopes more people will realize hunger affects those close to them.   Jansen applied for SNAP benefits 10 months ago, after she and her partner racked up thousands of dollars in credit card debt for groceries and gasoline. He changed career paths and has yet to find a full-time job. She bartends part-time, and they split shifts because they can't afford child care for their two toddlers.   Her own mother didn't fully grasp the struggle.   \"When I first told her that we were getting benefits she was confused,\" Jansen said, \"because she was like, 'Well, you both have jobs!'\"   Since the shutdown and SNAP funding pause, Jansen has been more open about the fact that her family needs help.   \"And I think people are just kind of surprised,\" she said.\n",

The bill that President Trump signed to end the shutdown also changes the rules for Americans who grow and sell hemp. A lot of hemp comes from Kentucky, where one of the U.S. senators celebrated this change, while the other says it will destroy the industry. Joe Sonka with Kentucky Public Radio has the facts.JOE SONKA, BYLINE: A 2018 farm bill allowed hemp to be grown to make CBD products that include the nonpsychoactive component of cannabis often used to help with pain, anxiety and sleep. Some in the industry used that hemp to also create a synthetic product like delta-8 with a higher concentration of THC, mimicking marijuana. That's a loophole, says Senator Mitch McConnell, who used the new spending bill to fix it.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MITCH MCCONNELL: It will keep these dangerous products out of the hands of children, while preserving the hemp industry for farmers.SONKA: But his fellow Kentucky Senator Rand Paul blasted the provision, saying McConnell's loophole fix went too far and would actually eradicate the booming market of hemp products. Think gummies, candies, oils and drinks.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RAND PAUL: This is the most thoughtless, ignorant proposal to an industry that I've seen in a long, long time.SONKA: In the end, McConnell won out, and the bill now bans the sale of hemp-derived products with more than 0.4 milligrams of THC per container. That's way too low, says Jim Higdon. He owns Cornbread Hemp, a growing Kentucky company with 100 employees.JIM HIGDON: That will make illegal all hemp products in America, including nonintoxicating CBD products will become illegal, will become Schedule 1 controlled narcotics.SONKA: That's because, he says, even nonintoxicating CBD products contain a small amount of THC. The U.S. Hemp Roundtable advocacy group says the new law will wipe out 95% of America's $28 billion hemp industry, costing more than 300,000 jobs. Hemp is different from marijuana, and the ban does not affect that industry. Some conservatives have praised the loophole fix, including Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick. He posted on social media, quote, \"I believe this ban will save a generation from getting hooked on dangerous drugs.\" For his part, Higdon says the ban is an existential threat to his business. But it also won't go into effect until a year from now.HIGDON: We can pass legislation in this year to get the guardrails that we need to keep hemp products legal in America with an appropriate THC cap per serving.SONKA: He remains hopeful that Congress will help him stay in business beyond next year.For NPR News, I'm Joe Sonka in Louisville, Kentucky.(SOUNDBITE OF DECEPTIKON'S \"INACCESSIBILITY\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

The bill passed Wednesday night despite Republicans' narrow margin in the House. Six Democrats joined their Republican colleagues to get the bill over the finish line 43 days after the shutdown began: Reps. Henry Cuellar of Texas, Don Davis of North Carolina, Adam Gray of California, Jared Golden of Maine, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, and Tom Suozzi of New York.   Two Republicans -- Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Greg Steube of Florida -- voted no. The final vote was 222 to 209.   \n   President Trump signed the bill shortly after the House vote. Trump blamed Democrats for the shutdown at the signing event in the Oval Office.    \"This was an easy extension but they didn't want to do it the easy way,\" Trump said. \"They wanted to do it the hard way.\"   In addition to extending last year's spending levels through the end of January for most of the government, the bill provides funding for some agencies through the end of next September, including payments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The program, which provides food aid to nearly 1 in 8 Americans, has been mired in a court battle because of the shutdown.   The bill includes a measure to reverse layoffs the Trump administration imposed during the shutdown, provides backpay for federal employees, and institutes protections against further layoffs.   But the central issue underlying the entire shutdown — extensions on enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire at the end of the year — is not addressed in the bill.   Instead, as part of the deal reached with a bipartisan contingent of senators, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., agreed to hold a vote in mid-December on Democrat-drafted legislation aimed at extending those subsidies.   \n   That doesn't sit well with many Senate Democrats, who remain wary of the pledge.   \"A handshake deal with my Republican colleagues to reopen the government and no guarantee to actually lower costs is simply not good enough,\" said Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., who voted against the measure.   Even if a December bill addressing the expiring subsidies passes the Senate, it would need to go to the House. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has not made a guarantee to bring such a bill to the floor for a vote.   A lot of pain, not a lot of gain   Government shutdowns historically have not been effective tools for advancing a party's policy goals. The last six weeks proved that to be the rule, not an exception.   The decision by Senate Democrats not to fund the government before Oct. 1 was fueled, at least in part, by demands from the Democrats' political base to be a strong opposition party. The party homed in on a promise that they would not fund the government unless Republicans agreed to extend subsidies for people who buy health care through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.   The decision came after key Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, voted alongside Republicans to avoid a shutdown in March. The result was a furious Democratic base, who demanded the minority party exert what little leverage it has to force a negotiation with Republicans in exchange for their votes to fund the government.   With an eye toward the expiring subsidies and resulting skyrocketing premiums, Senate Democrats stood firm during the October shutdown, hoping their resolve, paired with the devastating impacts of the shutdown on millions of Americans, would bring Republicans to the negotiating table.   But the strategy ultimately didn't work. Republicans didn't budge and continued to hold regular votes to fund the government.   \n   In the meantime, 42 million Americans who participate with SNAP didn't receive the food aid they rely on. Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees had to remain on the job without pay, leading to the Federal Aviation Administration's order to scale back flights. Millions of federal workers went without pay.   The group of seven Democrats and one independent senator who voted to end the shutdown acknowledged that waiting longer wouldn't bring about a different result.   \"There was no guarantee that waiting would get us a better result, but there was a guarantee that waiting would impose suffering on more everyday people,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told NPR.   The result is an end to a shutdown that does not address the core demand from Democrats on the subsidies. Instead they are left to defend the kind of handshake agreement that they once said was insufficient.   Thune's ultimate deal with Democrats aligns with his repeated statements throughout the shutdown that Republicans would be open to negotiating on the expiring subsidies only after the government was funded, not before.   Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, one of the six Democrats who voted for the bill in the House, said there is still an opportunity to address health care.   \"Congress still has a window to pass bipartisan legislation to extend the ACA premium tax credits,\" Golden said in a statement. \"In September, I joined a bipartisan coalition in the House to put forth legislation to extend the credits for one year and now, with the shutdown now over, I urge members of both parties who care about affordable health care to come back to the table so we can get the job done.\"   Another factor that didn't go Democrats' way is the president himself. President Trump has been known at times to upend Congressional Republicans' game plan. But he took a step back during the shutdown and let Thune drive the GOP strategy. He didn't take the bait from Democrats who repeatedly asked where Trump \"the great negotiator\" was in the discussions.   \n   What happens now?    Both parties have significant choices ahead that could lay the groundwork for their political successes and headaches through next year.   Senate Democrats have about a month to craft a bill that addresses the expiring ACA subsidies in a way that brings enough Republicans on board for passage.   If they're successful at getting an extension, Democrats will be able to start 2026 with a policy victory in hand that will shape their messaging going into the midterm elections. If Republicans don't support it, Democrats still have what they see as a winning issue — health care — to run on next year.   Some Republicans have shown interest in addressing the subsidies, but want to institute reforms like fraud prevention and income caps.   And both parties have to contend with the fact that the government is only funded for a few months. Congress will still have to pass nine other appropriations bills before the continuing resolution ends.\n",

Today's top stories   The House Oversight Committee yesterday released over 20,000 documents turned over to Congress from Jeffrey Epstein's estate. Among the documents were new emails from the convicted sex offender that mention President Trump, often expressing displeasure with him and his presidency. Democrats and Republicans have differing views on what the documents say about Epstein.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A protester holds a sign related to the release of the Jeffrey Epstein case files outside the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 12, 2025. Democrats released emails Wednesday in which Jeffrey Epstein suggested Donald Trump was aware of the disgraced financier's sexual abuse and had \"spent hours\" with one of his victims at his house.\n                \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 The majority of the emails were obsessively tracking Trump's ascent to the presidency from 2015 to 2018. Epstein mocked Trump and even wrote a note saying there isn't one decent cell in Trump's body to former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, NPR's Stephen Fowler tells Up First. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the release of the emails proves nothing. House Speaker Mike Johnson has been opposed to the effort from some Republicans and Democrats to release all unclassified files held by the Justice Department around the life and death of Epstein, who died by suicide while awaiting trial in 2019. Arizona Rep. Adelita Grijalva was sworn into Congress yesterday, meaning the bipartisan push now has enough support to force a House floor vote on the Epstein files bill.   \n   The longest government shutdown in U.S. history is now over after Trump signed a bill to fund it last night. The bill includes measures that reverse the layoffs imposed by the Trump administration during the shutdown, provide back pay for federal employees, and fund some agencies through the end of next September. The bill does not extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, which expire at the end of the year.    🎧 NPR's Barbara Sprunt says she is watching how Democrats will craft a bill that could appeal to Republicans, addressing the expiring subsidies during the promised December vote in the Senate on the issue. If they are successful, Democrats will be able to begin the new year with a policy victory. If Republicans oppose the bill, Democrats will have what they see as a winning issue to campaign on: the high cost of health care.🎧 There are signals that a one-year extension of the federal subsidies could be possible, but there is no concrete deal at this point, says NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin. Republicans say that the subsidies don't address the rising health costs and that they were supposed to be a temporary pandemic policy. Meanwhile, Democrats want to maintain the generous subsidies that have kept the monthly premium costs down.   \n   Israel deported 154 Palestinian prisoners last month as part of the exchange for Hamas freeing its final group of Israeli hostages. The prisoners were sent into exile in Cairo, never to return to their homes in the Palestinian territories. Israeli security experts say the deportation policy aims to prevent released prisoners from re-engaging in militant activities, but past incidents indicate that this practice can have unintended long-term consequences for Israeli security.

The FDA plans to remove warning labels from estrogen-based hormone therapy used to treat menopause symptoms. These warnings originated from the early 2000s when a Women's Health Initiative study found this type of therapy increased the risk of heart attacks, strokes, blood clots and breast cancer. However, experts now believe that more is known about safe and effective combinations of therapy when it is started earlier than the age of the women in the study, which was 63. Here are some things to consider when talking to your healthcare provider about the therapy:    👩‍⚕️ Experts recommend starting the therapy before the age of 60 or within the first 10 years of menopause onset.👩‍⚕️ Have a discussion about how long you should be on the therapy. In general, women stay on it for three to five years, but that isn't a hard rule.👩‍⚕️ For those who prefer not to undergo hormone therapy, there are alternatives available. The FDA has approved two non-hormonal medications for treating severe hot flashes during menopause.

The aurora borealis was spotted in a large swath of states, including Tennessee, New York, New Mexico and Idaho. The northern lights could be seen as far south as parts of Florida and Alabama, a relatively rare occurrence highlighting the severity of this week's storms. Auroras are becoming more frequent in the U.S. as the sun approaches the peak of its 11-year solar cycle. This trend is expected to continue for several months.

The announcement follows harsh criticism from the Trump administration about California and other states granting licenses to people in the country illegally. The issue was thrust into the public's consciousness in August, when a tractor-trailer driver not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people.   Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that California's action to revoke these licenses is an admission that the state acted improperly even though it previously defended its licensing standards. California launched its review of commercial driver's licenses it issued after Duffy raised concerns.   \n   \"After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we've exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,\" Duffy said, referring to the state's governor. \"This is just the tip of iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.\"   Newsom's office said that every one of the drivers whose license is being revoked had valid work authorizations from the federal government. At first, his office declined to disclose the exact reason for revoking the licenses, saying only they violated state law. Later, his office revealed the state law it was referring to was one that requires the licenses expire on or before a person's legal status to be in the United State ends, as reported to the DMV.   Still, Newsom's spokesperson Brandon Richards shot back at Duffy in a statement.   \"Once again, the Sean 'Road Rules' Duffy fails to share the truth — spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,\" Richards said.   Fatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year also highlight questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash that killed three people last month involved a truck driver in the country illegally, only adding to the concerns.   \n   Duffy previously imposed new restrictions on which immigrants can qualify for commercial driver's licenses. He said earlier this fall that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver's licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed. The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards.   Duffy revoked $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn't enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he reiterated Wednesday that he will take another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses if they don't invalidate every illegal license and address all the concerns. But revoking these licenses is part of the state's effort to comply.   The new rules for commercial driver's licenses that Duffy announced in September make getting them extremely hard for immigrants because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible. States will also have to verify an applicant's immigration status in a federal database. The licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner.   Under the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2b is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business. But the rules won't be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers will be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.   Those new requirements were not in place at the time the 17,000 California licenses were issued. But those drivers were given notices that their licenses will expire in 60 days.   \n   Duffy said in September that investigators found that one quarter of the 145 licenses they reviewed in California shouldn't have been issued. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver's work permit expired — sometimes years after.   Newsom's office said the state followed guidance it received from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about issuing these licenses to noncitizens.\n",

The federal government is reopening. But after 43 days on pause, things may not return to business as usual right away. For instance, federal workers are still awaiting backpay and air travel disruptions are expected to linger.   \n   And some impacts could continue much longer than six weeks, whether that's national parks trying to make up for lost visitor revenue or taxpayers waiting longer for refunds from a backlogged Internal Revenue Service (IRS).   There's also the looming threat of another potential shutdown in the not-too-distant future, since this bill only funds the government through Jan. 30.   Here's a look at where things stand for now.   Keep scrolling for updates, and jump by category here:   Federal workers | SNAP| Smithsonian | Air travel | National parks | Taxes | Economic data   \n   Federal employees return to work, awaiting back pay    Roughly 1.4 million federal workers have gone without pay for six weeks. Roughly half of them were required to keep working without paychecks, while hundreds of thousands of others were furloughed.   Russ Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, told agency heads to direct furloughed employees to return to work Thursday.   \"Agencies should take all necessary steps to ensure that offices reopen in a prompt and orderly manner\" on Thursday, Vought wrote in a Wednesday memo.   \n   The timing of backpay is a different question.   After the government shutdown ending in January 2019 — then the longest in history — Congress passed a law ensuring back pay for federal workers \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"   But Trump appeared to suggest otherwise in public comments last month, leaving many feds worried.   \n   The bill that Congress passed to end the shutdown guarantees back pay. It also reverses several agencies' attempted staffing reductions during the shutdown, which were paused by a federal judge, and prevents additional layoffs of federal employees through January.   Shaun Southworth, a federal employment attorney, said in an Instagram video that the timing of backpay will vary by agency based on their payroll providers, but most employees should start seeing deposits within days.   \"Many employees historically saw deposits within the first business days after reopening,\" he says of the last shutdown. \"A minority may roll to the next cycle if the system needs extra processing.\"   \n   SNAP is back    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Daytona Beach residents wait in their cars during a free food distribution for SNAP recipients organized by the Volusia County Sheriff's Office and The Jewish Federation at the Daytona International Speedway last week.\n                \n                    Miguel J.

Rodriguez Carrillo/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The bill Congress passed to reopen the government funds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) through September 2026.   The program, which some 42 million Americans rely on for food assistance, has been the subject of much uncertainty — and an escalating legal battle — in recent weeks. The Trump administration said last month that it would suspend SNAP funding in November due to the shutdown, prompting a wide outcry and a series of legal challenges.   \n   While the administration initially said it would comply with two rulings requiring it to provide at least partial funding for SNAP in November, it balked — and ultimately appealed to the Supreme Court — after one of those judges said it must fund the program fully for the month. The Supreme Court paused that order (and extended that pause again on Tuesday, with the end of the shutdown in sight).   At this point, beneficiaries in some states have gotten their full monthly allocations, while others have gotten partial payments or nothing at all. Reopening the government means restarting SNAP, but it's not clear how quickly full payments will resume, since that varies by state. And, as NPR has reported, many who rely on the program are worried that benefits could be cut again.   Smithsonian institutions will reopen on a rolling basis   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Smithsonian National Museum of African American History, closed during the government shutdown, is expected to reopen Friday.\n                \n                    Stefani Reynolds/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Stefani Reynolds/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\n   \n   The Smithsonian, which encompasses 21 museums and the National Zoo, says its reopening will be gradual.   Its website says the National Museum of American History, as well as the National Air and Space Museum and its Virginia annex, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, will open their doors on Friday.   All other museums and the zoo — including its beloved live animal cams — will reopen to the public \"on a rolling basis\" by Monday.   Air travel won't bounce back overnight   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A passenger waits for his flight at Los Angeles International Airport on Friday, as flight reductions began at major U.S. airports.\n                \n                    Sarah Reingewirtz/Los Angeles Daily News/SCNG\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Sarah Reingewirtz/Los Angeles Daily News/SCNG\n    \n\n   \n   The shutdown snarled air travel in a tangle that experts say is beyond a quick fix.   \n   Escalating shortages of air traffic controllers — who have been required to work without pay — caused delays and disruptions at airports nationwide since early October. Then, last week, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to reduce air traffic at 40 of the country's busiest airports, starting by 4% and ramping up to 10% by this Friday.   \n   The FAA announced Wednesday that it would freeze flight reductions at the current 6% level, citing a rapid improvement in controller staffing. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said air traffic controllers will get a lump sum payment equal to 70% of their back pay within 48 hours of the shutdown ending.   The agency says it will continue to assess \"whether the system can gradually return to normal operations.\"   Airlines and aviation regulators have warned that flight disruptions are likely to continue once the government reopens. Airlines had to adjust their schedules to reduce flights, and those changes can take time to reverse.   \"It's going to take a bit to unwind, and the responsibility is not going to fall completely on the air traffic control operation,\" former FAA administrator Randy Babbitt told NPR's All Things Considered on Tuesday. \"A good deal of responsibility will be the carriers getting their schedules and the aircraft and personnel back in the right positions to resume normal flying.\"   Air travel experts have told NPR that even after the shutdown, lingering impacts could potentially complicate Thanksgiving travel — which is always a hectic time to fly.   National Parks start to \"pick up the pieces\"       \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A sign posted by the National Park Service warns of closures at the Benjamin Rush Gardens in Philadelphia during the government shutdown earlier this month.\n                \n                    Matthew Hatcher/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Matthew Hatcher/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Most national parks stayed at least partially open during the shutdown, but with significantly reduced staffing (since thousands of National Park Service employees were furloughed) and limited services like visitor centers and trash pickup.   The National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA), a nonprofit that advocates for national parks, said in a statement that it could take months for returning staff to address the damage.   \n   \"For 43 days, many national parks were left open, vulnerable and unprotected,\" said Kristen Brengel, senior vice president of government affairs at NPCA. \"The National Park Service, already pushed to its breaking point after losing 25% of permanent staff, is left to pick up the pieces.\"   \n   National parks were already feeling the strain before the shutdown, forced by federal funding cuts to cancel ranger programs, close visitors centers and pause maintenance and research.   During the shutdown, parks were unable to collect millions of dollars in entrance and recreational fees, which Brengel says could delay construction projects and other visitor services. And nonprofits which diverted resources to help parks stay operational have depleted their budgets in the process, Brengel says, leaving them \"unsure if they will ever fully recover those funds.\"   Congress' bill funds the National Park Service through January. But Brengel calls it \"only a short-term reprieve,\" warning that another government shutdown could dampen the busy season by affecting the hiring of seasonal rangers for next spring and summer.   The IRS is looking ahead to tax filing season   The IRS furloughed nearly half of its approximately 74,000 workers and tried to lay off roughly 1,400 others — though those cuts were reversed as a result of the bill reopening the government.   The agency's operations were limited during the shutdown. It generally did not pay tax refunds during this period, scaled back its live telephone customer service supports, closed walk-in Taxpayer Assistance Centers and cancelled appointments related to cases with the Independent Office of Appeals and Taxpayer Advocate Service — which it says will be rescheduled once the government reopens.   Tax deadlines and laws remain in effect, and the IRS says it has continued critical operations related to next year's tax-filing season.   \n   But some experts worry that the effects of the shutdown — on top of thousands of IRS job cuts enacted earlier this year — could make for a messy 2026 tax season.   In an October letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) urged the IRS to take steps like pausing notice and collection activities during the shutdown. It wrote that since taxpayers can only respond to those by mail, the understaffed agency may not see their letters in time to fix errors or address issues — and will have to deal with an unwieldy backlog when the government reopens.   \n   \"This burden has the real potential to delay the 2026 filing season due to the increased stresses to our entire tax system,\" the accountants wrote.   Such disruptions have happened before.   The 2018-2019 shutdown left the IRS with over 5 million pieces of unprocessed mail, 80,000 unaddressed responses to Fiscal Year 2018 Earned Income Tax Credit audits and 87,000 amended returns waiting to be processed, according to a report by the National Taxpayer Advocate (an independent agency within the IRS).   And years earlier, the 16-day government shutdown in October 2013 delayed billions of dollars of tax refunds and created a backlog of 1.2 million income and Social Security number verification requests, according to the Committee for a Responsible Budget.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A 'We're Hiring' sign is taped to the window of a business in Miami, Florida.  Federal jobs reports were delayed by the government shutdown.\n                \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Delayed economic reports may never be released   The shutdown could leave permanent gaps in economic data.   The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics typically releases employment reports on the first Friday of each month, a practice that was paused in October and November. Even with the government reopening, their future is uncertain.   White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Wednesday that October's inflation and jobs reports will \"likely never [be] released and all of that economic data released will be permanently impaired.\" She blamed Democrats for the shutdown, which she said \"may have permanently damaged the federal statistical system.\"   The Bureau of Labor Statistics has not commented publicly on the status of the reports or updated its calendar of upcoming release dates. Economists expect the bureau to release its September jobs report (which was nearly ready when the government shut down on Oct. 1) first, and say it's an open question when — or whether — any October reports will be published.\n",

The Wednesday vote was the first time House members voted since House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., sent members home after the chamber passed its initial version of a continuing resolution in mid-September.   \n   \"The House did its job,\" Johnson said on the third day of the shutdown when asked why he wasn't having members stay in town. \"The House will come back into session and do its work as soon as [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer allows us to reopen the government.\"   He kept his word but tensions were high when members returned this week.   \"Long time, no see. I hardly recognize you guys,\" said House Rules Committee ranking member Jim McGovern, D-Mass., at a meeting. \"Where the hell have you been?\"   \n   After repeated comments from Democrats about Republicans being on vacation during the shutdown, Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., stepped in.   \"I am sick and tired of hearing you all say we had an eight-week vacation. I worked every day,\" she said. \"I don't want to hear another soul say that.\"   Although House leadership in both parties held press conferences every day during the shutdown, there was no legislative business of the House for over seven weeks.   \"The halls have been pretty, pretty lonely,\" said California Republican Kevin Kiley on Wednesday. Unlike Republicans, rank and file House Democrats were instructed by their leaders to come to D.C. regularly for caucus meetings.    But Kiley kept showing up to his Capitol office throughout the shutdown.   \n   \"This has not been the finest hour for the United States Congress, having the House of Representatives cancel its sessions while so many people across the country were suffering,\" he told NPR. \"I don't think that either party comes out of this thing in the best light.\"   Kiley said he used the time to work with a colleague on the other side of the aisle to address an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year – the crux of the shutdown itself.   \n   \"That was, I guess, one advantage of being here – that I have had some constructive conversations like that,\" he said. \"But of course, if the entire House was here, then we could have been having the sort of consensus building process that you need to pass legislation like this.\"   Other GOP members, like Missouri Rep. Mark Alford, said the time back home was useful.   \"In a way, this time away working in the district has been very, very helpful,\" he told NPR. \"I got more done in my district than I think in the three years that I've been [in Congress]. We went to farms, we went to businesses, we visited 14 of our 18 rural hospitals in our district, and it gave us a real clear picture of where America stands right now and what we can do to help.\"   Meanwhile, Democrats are still fuming that the chamber was sent home in the first place.   \"I think that the speaker really has exhibited some poor judgment. I think it was disrespectful to the body,\" said Rep. Julie Johnson, D-Texas.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Rep. Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., speak to the press after Grijalva was sworn in at the Capitol on Nov. 12. 2025.\n                \n                    SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images/AFP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images/AFP\n    \n\n   \n   She called it \"poor form\" for the speaker not to swear in fellow Democrat Adelita Grijalva, who won an Arizona special election in mid-September and was waiting to be sworn in during the shutdown.   Grijalva told NPR's All Things Considered she thinks her support of the effort to release the Jeffrey Epstein files played a role in her wait to get seated.   \n   \"I really like this lady. She's going to be an excellent member of Congress,\" Speaker Johnson said after he swore Grijalva in. \"We followed the custom of the House on the timetable and we've had a little, as we say in the deep South, some intense fellowship about that. But she's here now and I promised that we would have the oath administered before we began legislative business so she hasn't missed a vote.\"   Rep. Melanie Stansbury, D-N.M., said swearing in Grijalva during the shutdown is just one of the business items of the chamber that should have been done last month.   \n   \"For the last 54 days, the House has been completely closed and locked out, and there is all manner of legislative business that could have been going on,\" she told NPR. \"People are angry about the lack of accountability.\"   Stansbury added: \"We should have been here for the entire time.\"   Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., agreed with that.   \"We were gone far too long,\" he told NPR. \"I didn't want to go home in August [for recess]. So to be gone for those five or six weeks and then turn around and do it again in October was just – that's just more than Americans should have to put up with.\"   Womack, a longtime appropriator, said he has his eye on the end of January — when Congress has to finish the rest of its spending bills.   \"We're going to be putting Congress on the clock again in another 78, 79 days,\" he said. \"We're going to be right back where we were. I just hope we don't put America back through the same nut roll.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's A Martinez speaks with Rep. Ro Khanna [[roh KAH-nah]], D-Calif., about the next steps in the push to release thousands of pages of documents from Jeffrey Epstein's estate.   \n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  California Congressman Ro Khanna joins us now. He's a Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, which released thousands of documents from the Epstein estate. Congressman, so we just heard about that vote that House Speaker Mike Johnson is going to hold next week on that measure forcing the DOJ to release the Epstein files. Now, that's actually very early, earlier than he's required. Why do you think he's choosing to accelerate that timeline?RO KHANNA: Well, this is Thomas Massie and my bill. We've been fighting for it for five months. He realizes now when we got to 218 signatures yesterday that 40 to 50 Republicans in his caucus will vote for the release. This will be the largest vote of MAGA base against Donald Trump since Donald Trump walked down the escalator. And I think Johnson is just bowing to reality. He knows that he's going to have to have this vote, so why not get it over with soon?MARTÍNEZ: Yeah, 'cause he could've waited until December. But that also means that everyone has until December to discuss and kind of go over it.KHANNA: Exactly. And every day that's passing, there are more Republicans who are joining our effort. Look, this is a case of rich and powerful men who abused young girls. There are over 1,000 victims. This is not really a partisan issue. And the entire Epstein class needs to go in our politics. We need to restore our politics for working people and ordinary people. And I don't care whether there were Republicans or Democrats implicated, that class needs to leave. And the left and right actually is coming together on this.MARTÍNEZ: I want to talk about, though, the substance of the newly released documents. So Democrats released a few specific emails where Epstein mentioned Trump. And that's out of the 20,000 emails that the committee had in its possession. What do you think those particular emails that your party decided to highlight, what do they say about Trump's relationship with Epstein?KHANNA: Well, those emails clearly show that he had a significant relationship. The emails suggest that he at the very least knew that Epstein was engaged in illegal conduct. And the question is raised, well, why didn't he say anything? And how much did he know? And the question is also raised, who else knew? I mean, from talking to the victims' lawyers who've seen these files, they believe that there are hundreds of men who either knew about Epstein's abuse and kept quiet or who actually participated in a farm system where Epstein gave them women to abuse.MARTÍNEZ: So, Congressman, are you saying that there could be criminal guilt by association here?KHANNA: No, I would not go that far. And this effort has never been actually just about Donald Trump. What I will say is that there have been a lot of people who have acted with moral guilt. There are some people who may have criminal guilt. But the point is these rich and powerful men should not have university buildings named after them. They should not have scholarships named after them. They should not be lionized in society. And so far, they've been shielded. And what Thomas Massie and I are trying to do is expose all of this, have a lead accountability and make it clear that there was a lot of abuse and corruption in our government. And the focus needs to be on these women and survivors.MARTÍNEZ: Do you think that we will ever kind of get past this? I mean, everyone, I'm talking from Congress to all of us who cover this, is this going to be just something we'll always have in the back of our minds?KHANNA: I do believe we can get past this. This vote next week is going to be historic. It's the first time that Congress is going to go on record to say the Epstein files should be released. I hope it'll push the Senate to vote, especially if we get big numbers. And then I hope that within the next six months, the files are released.But the reason this has resonated with the American public is there's a feeling that the American dream is dead. There's a feeling that rich and powerful people have too much money controlling our government, that they get away with things ordinary Americans can't and that they need to be held accountable, if not criminally, at least morally, at least politically. And that we need to restore a sense of standing up for survivors, protecting America's kids and having a politics where billionaires can't just buy off politicians and avoid the rules.MARTÍNEZ: Quickly, even though if it would pass the Senate, the president would need to sign it into law, which is unlikely. Then what's the point of holding this vote at all? Just a few seconds, Congressman.KHANNA: First of all, we may get a veto-proof vote in the House. You could get that in the Senate, and it will put such incredible pressure for the MAGA base to be voting against the president. That has never happened in his first term or second term.MARTÍNEZ: That's Democratic Representative Ro Khanna of California.

    "body": "\n      NPR's A Martinez speaks with author and journalist Jonathan Cohn of The Bulwark about the politics surrounding the future of the Affordable Care Act.   \n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  So can Democrats and Republicans come to an agreement on extending those expiring COVID-era Affordable Care Act subsidies? For more on that political fight, we've called Jonathan Cohn. He's a senior national correspondent for conservative news site The Bulwark. He's also the author of \"The Ten-Year War: Obamacare And The Unfinished Crusade For Universal Coverage.\"Jonathan, so we just heard the next big question is whether Democrats in the Senate can come up with a bill that'll pass with at least a handful of Republican senators. Do you see any option out there that could get enough support?JONATHAN COHN: Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't bet a lot of money on it, for the reasons your correspondent just was laying out. If there were an easy agreement here, we'd have it by now. But I do think the underlying reality - we were just listening to it. All these people who don't have health insurance are going to have trouble paying for their health insurance because these expiring subsidies go away. And, you know, they are disproportionately in Republican districts in Republican states. That has not changed. That is going to put pressure on Republican legislators to come to the table and try to find a way to do something about this.MARTÍNEZ: So based on what you just said, then, are Republicans viewing that as a priority at all that - one that maybe they could be or should be solving?COHN: It depends on which Republicans you're talking about. Obviously, Speaker Mike Johnson - no, it's very clear he does not want to do this. But, you know, there are Republican members of the House who are interested. Don Bacon from Nebraska has actually a proposal out there. There are a number of Republican senators who have talked about it, and they are talking about it because they're reacting to their constituents, and they can read the polls as well as anybody. They know this does not look good for their party to have this giant premium increase going. So there's some appetite there. Whether that - whether you can get from that appetite to an agreement, obviously, is a whole other question.MARTÍNEZ: But the big Republican option - at least some Senate Democrats are open to extending those expiring subsidies in exchange for stricter restrictions on abortion. And that's something for Democrats that seems to be a nonstarter. So are we right where we started from already?COHN: They would have to resolve the abortion issue, and that's one of several that I think could get in the way. That, I think, is a nonstarter for the Democrats. You know, I think the easy way to think about this is I think Democrats are open. My - this is my guess, is, you know, I could - you can imagine a deal where the Republican - where the Democrats have to settle for half a loaf. They can't get all the extension they want. They can't - you know, not quite as much money, maybe not as many years. Where I don't think they're going to be open for business is on anything that undermines or holds back on the Affordable Care Act. They're happy to - I can see negotiations over what this extension looks like. I do not see any negotiations where part of the deal is we're going to start to dismantle, you know, this law that the Republicans call Obamacare.MARTÍNEZ: Now, does President Trump need to get directly involved somehow in this issue to get something done?COHN: I would assume so. I mean, for a negotiation like this to come through in normal times, the president has to be deeply engaged, has to be the convener, has to bring the people together. I think that's even more so in this case because we know House Republicans. And again, I think it - that's where the sticking point's going to be 'cause the - yeah. You know, you - the Senate seems maybe like an easier deal. They're not going to vote, you know, yes unless, you know, Speaker Johnson allows a vote. And in general, they're going to take their cues from Trump, so, I mean, he's got to get engaged. He's got to be pushing this. And, you know, that - one could say maybe that's the biggest obstacle, 'cause so far, he has not.MARTÍNEZ: Why do you think President Trump hasn't ever really been able to articulate a plan? Because he's always talked about repealing and replacing Obamacare. But then, when he's asked about a plan, he never seems to have much to say.COHN: Yeah. So there's a basic contradiction here between what he says he wants to - what - the values of what he says he wants to deliver and the whole Republican Party says they want to deliver and what their actual plans would do. I mean, there's a fundamental divide in this country. Democrats want to get to universal coverage. They think the government should be heavily involved in making - guaranteeing health care for everyone. Republicans do not believe that. It's a principled fight, right? I mean, this is what we - liberal and conservative fight we've had over the generations.The problem is, people like health care. So, you know, Donald Trump says, we're going to give you great health care, cheap health care for everybody, and it's going to be better than, you know, the Affordable Care Act. Well, they don't actually have plans that do that. They have plans that cut government health care plans. They cut Medicare. They cut subsidies. And, you know, from their standpoint, it's great. It's less government spending. You can put that money into tax cuts. But it does always mean there's - you know, millions of people are going to lose insurance if you do one of those plans. And there's not going to be protections for people with pre-existing conditions. So that's a contradiction, and he can't solve that any more than anyone else can.MARTÍNEZ: Just a few seconds, Jonathan. Do you think centrist Democrats gave up their leverage by ending this shutdown now?COHN: I - you know, my personal opinion is they had a little more of a hand to play out on this, I think, you know? But, you know, there's still a - there's still more of this game to be played.MARTÍNEZ: Jonathan Cohn is a senior national correspondent for conservative news site The Bulwark. Jonathan, thanks.COHN: Thanks for having me.(SOUNDBITE OF GOGO PENGUIN'S \"EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OK\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

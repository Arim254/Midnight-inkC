European royals, government officials, politicians and others are losing jobs and titles over their connection to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. European law enforcement agencies are opening investigations based on recent troves of documents released by the U.S. government.   Prominent Americans with apparent ties to Jeffrey Epstein — including President Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick— have so far largely kept their positions of power.   Epstein also associated with Democratic politicians and academics, including former President Bill Clinton.   \n   While appearing in the Epstein files is not necessarily proof of wrongdoing, for Europeans, it's been \"very humiliating\" to see their \"rich and famous hobnobbing\" with Epstein, \"a fake American billionaire\" and convicted sex trafficker of minors, said Richard Painter, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School who served as the chief ethics lawyer to President George W. Bush.   But in the U.S., Painter says, the connection between money and politics can shield some of those named in the files. \"You've got all this massive amount of money in politics. So the billionaire class is definitely going to want to be protected,\" he said.   Neither the White House nor the Department of Commerce have responded to a request for comment.   In the United Kingdom, former Prince Andrew was stripped of his royal titles and forced to move out of the royal estate. That was over claims that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, as he is now known, had sex with teenage girls — which he has denied — during his visits with Epstein.   Now, with the latest release of files, the former prince faces an investigation by British police over claims he shared confidential trade information with Epstein in 2010. King Charles III, Mountbatten-Windsor's brother, is \"ready to support\" investigators, Buckingham Palace said in a statement sent to news outlets this week.   \n   Others in the U.K. have faced consequences, not for allegations of sexual misconduct, but for being too friendly with Epstein. Peter Mandelson, a prominent Labour Party figure and Britain's ambassador to the U.S., was stripped of his position in September and resigned from the House of Lords earlier this month. He now faces a criminal investigation after new files suggest he received payments from Epstein and shared government documents.   For a while, Prime Minister Keir Starmer faced calls to step down over his continued support for Mandelson. Starmer, earlier this month, apologized to Epstein's victims. \"None of us knew the depth and darkness of that relationship,\" he said of Mandelson's ties to Epstein.   In countries such as Britain with a parliamentary system, leaders are more vulnerable to calls to resign from political opponents or even members of their own party, Painter noted, than leaders in the United States.   \"Ultimately the Parliament, the legislature, calls the shots and then the members of the legislature are vulnerable to be voted down in the next election,\" he said. \"There's more accountability to the public.\"   Trump is somewhat insulated from political pressure   President Trump was a longtime friend of Epstein's and appears frequently in the released documents from the late financier's estate. Trump and the White House have both consistently denied any wrongdoing.   Still, because he is in his second term and is constitutionally prohibited from running for reelection, he is shielded from some accountability, according to Painter.   Lutnick, Trump's billionaire commerce secretary, previously had said he had \"very limited interactions\" with Epstein, a New York City neighbor after visiting his townhouse in 2005. But this week, at a Senate hearing, he acknowledged that he and his family traveled to Epstein's private island in 2012.   Painter also criticized Attorney General Pam Bondi for \"selectively\" releasing parts of the Epstein files, despite bipartisan legislation passed by Congress which orders a full release of the documents.   \n   In her opening remarks at a contentious House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday, Bondi said she was \"deeply sorry for what any victim\" had gone through, but she avoided apologizing directly to several of Epstein's victims in the committee room.   Painter questioned whether the administration is releasing files that only implicate Democrats while shielding Republicans. Epstein knew Trump, a neighbor in Palm Beach, but Trump says they had a falling out before Epstein's conviction for sex trafficking.   A few Americans have lost positions of power. Larry Summers, a former Treasury Secretary during the Clinton administration and chief economic adviser to President Obama, stepped away from his teaching position at Harvard.   Brad Karp resigned as chair of the prestigious law firm Paul Weiss. And Kathryn Ruemmler, top lawyer at Goldman Sachs, announced that she'll resign from her job at the end of June.   Consequences spread across Europe   France's former culture minister, Jack Lang, resigned as head of a Paris cultural center after the French Foreign Ministry sought to question him about his ties to Epstein.   Former Norwegian Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland, this week was charged with \"gross corruption\" by police there and could face up to 10 years in prison after emails showed he stayed in Epstein's homes in New York and Florida and visited Epstein's private island in the Caribbean. Also this month, Mona Juul resigned as Norway's ambassador to Jordan, after revelations that Epstein left $10 million in his will to her children.   The Epstein scandal has also hit the country's royal family. Norwegian Crown Princess Mette-Marit, the wife of Crown Prince Haakon, apologized after documents showed she vacationed in an Epstein property in Palm Beach.\n",

The agents have been placed on administrative leave after \"a joint review by ICE and the Department of Justice of video evidence has revealed that sworn testimony provided by two separate officers appears to have made untruthful statements,\" the spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, said.   The rare acknowledgment of potential missteps by ICE agents comes after the agency's acting director, Todd Lyons, told Congress on Thursday that ICE has conducted 37 investigations into officers' use of force over the past year. He didn't say whether anyone has been fired.   \n   McLaughlin said the agency is investigating the January 14 shooting of the Venezuelan immigrant, and the officers involved could be fired or criminally prosecuted for any violations.   \"The men and women of ICE are entrusted with upholding the rule of law and are held to the highest standards of professionalism, integrity, and ethical conduct,\" McLaughlin said in Friday's statement. \"Violations of this sacred sworn oath will not be tolerated.\"   DHS initially said the officer fired a shot to \"save his life\" after being \"ambushed and attacked\" by three immigrants with a snow shovel and a broom handle during a \"targeted traffic stop.\"   Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, the subject of the traffic stop, was injured after getting shot in the leg. Another Venezuelan man, Alfredo Aljorna, was also accused of attacking the officers.   \n   However, Minnesota U.S. Attorney Dan Rosen on Thursday dropped the charges against them.   McLaughlin did not respond to questions about whether the agency stands by its initial statement describing the agent's behavior during the incident as self-defense.   Since the beginning, eyewitness accounts contradicted the statements made by DHS related to the shooting of Sosa-Celis.   His partner, Indriany Mendoza Camacho, told Minnesota Public Radio last week she was present the night of the shooting, and that Sosa-Celis was trying to separate the agent and the other Venezuelan man so both the immigrants could get into a house.   \n   \"I'm a witness, I saw everything, and my partner never grabbed anything to hit him or anything like that,\" she said.   \n   The shooting happened during Operation Metro Surge, an aggressive immigration crackdown that brought about 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota starting in December.   The Trump administration on Thursday announced it was ending Operation Metro Surge. The operation led to more than 4,000 arrests of undocumented immigrants, according to White House border czar Tom Homan, and the killing of two U.S. citizens, Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti.   Those shootings are also being investigated by federal authorities.   An internal preliminary review conducted by Customs and Border Protection into Pretti's death also contradicted the Trump administration's initial narrative about his shooting.\n",

In his speech at the Munich Security Conference, Rubio stressed to allies its shared history with America, calling the U.S. a \"child of Europe.\" He also reinforced the Trump administration's rhetoric suggesting that Europe faces the prospect of \"civilizational erasure\" amid its immigration policies.   \"We gather as members of a historic alliance that saved and changed the world,\" Rubio told attendees.   \n   \"America was founded 250 years ago, but the roots began here on this continent long before. The men who settled and built the nation of my birth arrived on our shores carrying the memories and the traditions and the Christian faith of their ancestors as a sacred inheritance.\"   Rubio described Europe as having grown complacent in the years since the fall of the Soviet Union, having allowed their military budgets to shrink, their jobs to be outsourced and immigration to threaten the \"cohesion\" of society, he said.   \"We made these mistakes together. And now, together, we owe it to our people to face those facts and to move forward to rebuild,\" Rubio said.   Overall, his speech was marked by a softer tone toward Europe than Trump has taken in recent months, with Trump criticizing them as \"weak\" and home to a \"decaying\" group of nations, as well as those made by his predecessor at last year's conference. Vice President JD Vance, who pilloried European leaders for their efforts to combat hate speech and disinformation and for censoring right-wing views.   \n   The secretary of state also downplayed concerns over the effects of climate change, even as many European nations have prioritized a shift to renewable energies.   Rubio also doubled down on the administration's insistence that European allies should do more to provide for their own national security needs, rather than relying so heavily on the United States.   \"We care deeply about your future and ours. And if at times we disagree, our disagreements come from our profound sense of concern about a Europe with which we are connected, not just economically, not just militarily. We are connected spiritually and we are connected culturally.\"   \n   \"Under President Trump,\" Rubio said, \"the United States of America will once again take on the task of renewal and restoration, driven by a vision of a future as proud, as sovereign, and as vital as our civilization's past. And while we are prepared, if necessary, to do this alone, it is our preference, and it is our hope to do this together with you, our friends here in Europe. For the United States and Europe, we belong together.\"   European leaders react   Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Union's executive commission, said during a panel at the conference that she was \"very much reassured\" by Rubio's speech.   \"We know that in the administration, some have a harsher tone on these topics,\" she said. \"But the secretary of state was very clear: He said, 'We want a strong Europe in the Alliance,' and this is what we are working for intensively in the European Union.\"   British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that he agreed with Rubio in the sense that \"we shouldn't get in the warm bath of complacency.\"   Starmer said that, post-Brexit, the U.K. should restrengthen ties with Europe to help the continent become more self-reliant in its defense, so that it can move \"from overdependence to interdependence.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      Secretary of State Marco Rubio delivered a speech at the Munich Security Conference in Germany amid growing tensions between the U.S. and its European allies.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  Secretary of State Marco Rubio has told European allies it's time for a period of renewal as the old world order is ending.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARCO RUBIO: And while we are prepared, if necessary, to do this alone, it is our preference and it is our hope to do this together with you, our friends here in Europe. For the United States and Europe, we belong together.SIMON: He was speaking today at the Munich Security Conference, where diplomats are still reeling from last year's speech by Vice President JD Vance, who lectured Europe about free speech and migration. Secretary Rubio touched on similar themes but in a way some Europeans seem to appreciate. NPR's Michele Kelemen is in Munich. Michele, thanks so much for being with us.MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Nice to be here, Scott.SIMON: What was Secretary Rubio's main message today?KELEMEN: Well, he said that the U.S. and Europe made a lot of mistakes in recent years, focusing on what he called the climate cult and also allowing supply chains to become too dependent on rivals like China. He also spent a lot of time talking about Christian values and fears of civilizational erasure because of mass migration. Those were, you know, a big focus of Vance's speech last year, but Rubio couched it a bit differently. Take a listen.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RUBIO: So in a time of headlines, heralding the end of the trans-Atlantic era, let it be known and clear to all that this is neither our goal nor our wish because for us Americans, our home may be in the Western Hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe.(APPLAUSE)SIMON: I here a pause there, Michele. How did the speech go over?KELEMEN: Yeah. I mean, the host of the conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, said there was a sigh of relief in the room, and he said he saw this speech as a message of reassurance. But, you know, I heard California Governor Gavin Newsom telling a group of reporters yesterday that Vice President Vance set the bar so low with last year's speech. And Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who met Rubio yesterday, also talked about the world order as we know it is in the past, but he told the U.S. that the U.S. isn't strong enough to go it alone. French President Emmanuel Macron, who's also here, told the gathering that Europe needs to become a geopolitical leader and needs to really stand up to Russia's aggression in Ukraine.SIMON: You mentioned Governor Newsom. There are other Democrats there as well, aren't there?KELEMEN: Yeah. New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made her debut here, and she's blaming the Trump administration of ripping up democratic norms and turning the world into what she calls an age of authoritarians who are carving up the world.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ: Where Donald Trump can command the Western Hemisphere and Latin America as his personal sandbox, where Putin can saber-rattle around Europe and for, essentially, authoritarians to have their own geographic domains.KELEMEN: And she says she was here with other Democrats offering a different way forward.SIMON: Russia's war in Ukraine is obviously a big concern for Europe. What did Secretary Rubio say about that?KELEMEN: Yeah. I mean, Europeans are really alarmed by Russia's continued strikes on Ukraine's energy grid during this cold spell. They say Russia is trying to play for time, trying to win territory in talks with Trump's envoys that it hasn't been able to capture on the battlefield. Rubio would only say that he's not really sure if the Russians are serious about ending the war and whether there are any terms that can be negotiated that are acceptable to Ukraine. But he said the U.S. is going to continue to try, and that's been the goal.SIMON: NPR's Michele Kelemen from Munich. Thanks so much.KELEMEN: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

During an interview with YouTuber Brian Tyler Cohen, Obama said many Americans \"find this behavior deeply troubling.\"   \"There doesn't seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office,\" Obama said in the interview, which was posted on YouTube Saturday.   \n   \"There's this sort of clown show that's happening in social media and on television,\" Obama added, describing much of the noise around Trump's presidency as a \"distraction\".   Obama's response follows outrage over the video, which depicted Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the clip, saying \"please stop the fake outrage.\" Trump refused to apologize for the social media post, telling reporters \"I didn't make a mistake\" aboard Air Force One.   The video, which was posted at the beginning of Black History Month, has since been deleted. The White House blamed a staffer for \"erroneously\" posting the video clip.   Obama also shared his thoughts on the immigration crackdown and protests in Minnesota and elsewhere around the country, telling Cohen they have left a good number of American people saying \"we're going to live up to those values that we say we believe in.\"   \"It is important for us to recognize the unprecedented nature of what ICE was doing in Minneapolis, St. Paul, the way that federal agents, ICE agents were being deployed, without any clear guidelines, training, pulling people out of their homes, using five-year-olds to try to bait their parents, all the stuff that we saw, teargassing crowds simply who were standing there, not breaking any laws,\" the 44th president said.   \n   Obama called the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis last month \"a heartbreaking tragedy\" and said it was \"a wake-up call to every American, regardless of party, that many of our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault.\"    He also said that the Trump administration has given explanations for the deaths of Pretti and Renee Good, a 37-year-old woman killed by an immigration agent, \"that aren't informed by any serious investigation.\"\n",

And after a lot of back and forth with the White House over the invite list, governors from both parties are invited to attend the traditional meeting at the White House with the president. But the chaos leading up to the meetings underscores Trump's history of unraveling Democratic norms and political relationships. NPR White House correspondent Deepa Shivaram brings us the story.DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: The annual governors' meeting at the White House used to be a run-of-the-mill event, like the winners of the World Series or the Super Bowl meeting with the president. That's according to Thad Kousser, a professor of political science at UC San Diego.THAD KOUSSER: It used to be just something that everyone would do, and it had no political content. It was part of the ceremonial head-of-state aspects of American politics. That has changed as presidents on both sides of the aisle have become so polarizing.SHIVARAM: Kousser says governors and the president have historically shared a somewhat amiable relationship. Governors have needed help from the president and the federal government in handling crises like natural disasters or the COVID-19 pandemic. And presidents have needed governors to help drum up support for their agenda.But under Trump, relationships have become increasingly tense with governors of blue states. The administration has been drafting plans to withhold federal public health funding to states like Illinois and Colorado. Trump has lashed out at Democratic governors of Minnesota Tim Walz and California's Gavin Newsom over immigration, National Guard troops and federal agents in their states and aid for natural disasters. At last year's gathering of governors at the White House, Trump went after Maine governor Janet Mills for her state's support of trans athletes.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You'd better comply because otherwise, you're not getting any federal funding.JANET MILLS: I'll see you in court.TRUMP: Every state - good. I'll see you in court. I look forward to that. That should be a real easy one.SHIVARAM: Trump's attacks have shined a spotlight onto certain Democrats, and in some ways, it's boosted their careers. Mills is now running for a Senate seat in Maine, challenging Republican Susan Collins. Newsom and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker have signaled their intention to run for president in 2028. Kousser says it's all part of the delicate dance governors from the opposing party of the president are playing.KOUSSER: Governors and presidents need each other to advance their policies, but they also can score political points by attacking each other.SHIVARAM: Trump has gone after governors in his own party, too. He was critical of Georgia Governor Brian Kemp after Kemp refused to alter the 2020 election outcome in favor of Trump. And this week, he attacked Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt, who leads the bipartisan Governors Association. Stitt stood up for the bipartisan nature of the gathering at the White House, though Stitt is term-limited, so he can't run for governor again. Still, Kousser says Stitt and the Governors Association offered an important show of unity.KOUSSER: What we're seeing here is a really impressive case of governors banding together to protect this institution - this job that they all have and love.SHIVARAM: Though the unity might only go so far. Trump has still not invited two Democrats - Maryland's Wes Moore and Colorado's Jared Polis - to the White House for a formal dinner. And both Newsom and Moore say they're not attending the meeting with Trump at all.Deepa Shivaram, NPR News, the White House.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Secretary of State Marco Rubio seeks to reassure European allies and a partial government shutdown hits the Department of Homeland Security.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  NPR's senior contributor Ron Elving joins us. Ron, thanks for being with us, as always.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.SIMON: Secretary Rubio gave a major speech at the Munich Security Conference. What do you make of it?ELVING: The expectation had been that Rubio would bring a somewhat more diplomatic version of that speech by JD Vance, this conference a year ago, expressing President Trump's longtime complaint that Europeans don't bear their share of the cost of their own defense. And Rubio was much more nuanced. He said the U.S. was strong enough to go alone but that we would prefer to renew the alliance. And as we just heard from Michele Kelemen, Rubio's statement that the U.S. would always consider itself a child of Europe, that was certainly well received.SIMON: Another Saturday, another shutdown - this one partial. Funding has lapsed for the Department of Homeland Security after lawmakers failed to reach an agreement, Democrats say they won't help approve more funding until new restrictions are placed on federal immigration operations. How do you read the significance of this latest funding lapse?ELVING: It shows the two parties are as far apart as ever on ICE and immigration enforcement. Democrats were almost entirely united on this, even though many of them oppose using shutdowns as a tactic. They could not face their voters if they let Homeland Security continue without serious reforms, even though there's plenty of money on hand for ICE to continue operations, even as other parts of the Department of Homeland Security have to shut down or cut back. That's because ICE got a huge war chest from the last big funding bill - the one Trump called the One Big Beautiful Bill. This may be one reason he liked it so much.So Democrats know this won't keep ICE from operating, but they hope it will call attention to the relationship between ICE and DHS and put more heat on the administration of the overall agency.  That includes the transportation safety folks, unfortunately, at the airports. There may be flight delays or cancellations, so there will be consequences for real people. And it once again demonstrates just how far the two parties are from finding the compromises by which this government is meant to function.SIMON: And this week, Attorney General Pam Bondi testified during a House committee hearing where she defended the Justice Department's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. It got heated. Congressman Ted Lieu,  Democrat from California, asked the attorney general whether there were any underage girls at parties that Donald Trump attended with Jeffrey Epstein. And here's how she responded.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PAM BONDI: This is so ridiculous, and that they are trying to deflect from all the great things Donald Trump has done. There is no evidence that Donald Trump has committed a crime. Everyone knows that. This has been the most transparent presidency. He's the one that asked that those files...TED LIEU: I'm reclaiming my time.BONDI: ...Be released.LIEU: I got your answer. You said there's no evidence.BONDI: President Trump asked that these...LIEU: Mr. Chairman, please stop the clock. Please stop the clock.BONDI: He signed the legislation.SIMON: It went like that. Ron, what do you make of the hearing?ELVING: Oh, it got worse. Bondi and her staff brought armloads of binders with zingers to fire back at members who questioned her on the Epstein files or who asked why Bondi's department was not complying with the bipartisan legislation passed by Congress ordering them to release all the files and use redactions only to protect victims. Instead, we've seen a lot of slow walking and outright stonewalling, with some files released that do expose victims and some files released that redact the identity of Epstein's guests and clients. That seems to turn the law on its head.You have to assume that Pam Bondi had an audience of one for this appearance - President Trump. And he may well have been pleased by her performance. But Epstein is an issue that will not go away. It cuts across a lot of the usual lines, hurts the president with his own constituencies. His numbers are eroding now not only among independents, but even among Republicans, as some have genuine distress about ICE and the whole Epstein affair.SIMON: And we're seeing more Republicans willing to depart from the president, aren't we?ELVING: Yes, that's right. And it's been significant, as you would expect. A lot of it has to do with the midterm elections later this year. Six House Republicans defied their party leaders to vote for a bill blocking tariffs Trump wants to impose on Canada. So with those crossovers, the Democrats were able to pass the measure in the House. It's a clear challenge to House Speaker Mike Johnson. He has the slimmest of majorities in the House and yet the absolute necessity of constant loyalty to Trump.SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving. Thanks so much.ELVING: Thank you, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Members of the Trump administration testified before Congress, as did Epstein's convicted co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell. Members of Congress are still seeking answers on the Justice Department's redactions in the files and the investigation overall. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom continues with its own reckoning.   The massive tranche of documents — including emails, photos and other documents — are materials collected during the Justice Department's investigation into Epstein and Maxwell. Many of the documents include unverified claims and little if any context. Congress passed a law mandating their release, and lawmakers are now combing through them seeking further accountability for the victims.    \n   Here is a round of up of the top political news related to the Epstein files this week:   Maxwell testimony    Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20-years in prison for a child sex trafficking scheme with Epstein, appeared by video for a deposition in front of the House Oversight Committee on Monday. Republicans and Democrats sought answers to a myriad of questions, including who were the other co-conspirators involved in the sex trafficking ring and which men sexually abused girls.   \n   But lawmakers weren't able to get much of anything out of Maxwell. She refused to testify and invoked her Fifth Amendment right to remain silent to avoid self-incrimination. Instead, her lawyer, David Oscar Markus, read a prepared statement to the committee. Maxwell, he said, is \"prepared to speak fully and honestly\" but only if granted clemency by President Trump.   \"Only she can provide a complete account. And some may not like what they hear, but the truth matters. For example, both President Trump and President Clinton are innocent of any wrongdoing. Ms. Maxwell alone can explain why, and the public is entitled to hear that explanation,\" Markus said.   When asked during a press briefing on Tuesday if Trump would consider pardoning Maxwell, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it's not something she has discussed with the president recently because \"frankly, it is not a priority.\"   \n   \"Last time we did speak about it, he said it's not something he's considering or thinking about,\" she told reporters.   \n   After the hearing, committee chair James Comer, R-Ky., said he was disappointed in Maxwell's lack of testimony but that the committee's investigation will continue.   \"I personally don't think she should be granted any type of immunity or clemency,\" he said of Maxwell.   Six names uncovered    The two lawmakers that spearheaded The Epstein Files Transparency Act, the law that forced the public release of the documents related to the investigation and death of Epstein, are still arguing that the Department of Justice isn't abiding by the law. Among their top concerns is how the DOJ has handled redactions in the documents, including redacting names that they say should have been made public under the law and in other instances exposing the names of victims.   Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky., reviewed an unredacted version of the files on Monday at the Justice Department, which is available to lawmakers for the first time. After searching the files, Khanna and Massie said they uncovered the names of six men in the files that were wrongly redacted. The lawmakers accused the DOJ of covering up the identities of the men and scrubbing the files ahead of the release.    \n   Khanna said on the House floor that 70% to 80% of the files are still redacted and announced the redacted names. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said on X that the move \"forced the unmasking\" of people \"who have NOTHING to do with Epstein or Maxwell.\" He added that four of the six appeared in just one document.   \"The two other men — Les Wexner and Sultan bin Sulayem — were unredacted in the one document, and are referenced in the files nearly two hundred times and over 4,700 times respectively,\" Blanche said.   \n   On Friday, Dubai Ports World announced Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem resigned from the company effective immediately.   During a tele-townhall with Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul on Tuesday, Massie said Wexner, a billionaire businessman, should be forced to answer questions about his relationship with Epstein.   In January, House Oversight ranking member Robert Garcia, D-Calif., announced a subpoena for Wexner to testify. Wexner is set to be deposed by lawmakers in Ohio, where he lives, on Feb. 18. A spokesperson for Wexner told NPR member station WOSU that Wexner fully cooperated with federal investigators by providing background information on Epstein and was not contacted again.   Lutnick and Bondi testify and lawmaker surveillance    Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, whose name also appears in the files, answered questions about his relationship with Epstein from members of a Senate committee on Tuesday during an unrelated oversight hearing. Lutinck previously said he cut ties with Epstein before the financier was charged with any sex crimes in 2006.   But the latest batch of files contained an email correspondence between Epstein and Lutnick in 2012, where Lutnick planned a trip to Epstein's island. Lutnick admitted to the committee that his family visited Epstein while on vacation.   \"We had lunch on the island — that is true — for an hour, and we left with all of my children, with my nannies and my wife all together. We were on family vacation,\" Lutnick said. He added, \"I don't recall why we did it.\"   \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n                    YouTube\n                \n        \n   When Trump was asked by reporters on Thursday about Lutnick's visit to the island, Trump said he \"wasn't aware\" of it and that he hasn't spoken with Lutnick about it.   \"I was never there. Somebody will someday say that I was never there,\" Trump added.   Despite Lutnick's connection to Epstein, press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier in the week that Lutnick \"remains a very important member of President Trump's team, and the president fully supports the secretary.\"   \n   U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi also testified before Congress on Wednesday at a heated DOJ oversight hearing, during which she repeatedly dodged questions related to the Epstein files and insulted lawmakers who questioned her about them.   In one instance, Massie pressed Bondi on why some names, including Wexner's, were redacted. Bondi defended the DOJ's work and retorted that Massie suffered from \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\" and was \"a failed politician.\"    \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n                    YouTube\n                \n        \n   Lawmakers later accused Bondi of \"spying\" on their searches of the unredacted documents in the DOJ's secure terminals. After the hearing concluded, a photo emerged of Bondi holding the search history of Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., with whom Bondi also verbally sparred.    \"Members of Congress should be able to conduct oversight without the Department of Justice spying on us. It's outrageous and has to stop,\" Jayapal said on X.   \n   U.K. fallout   Top leaders in the United Kingdom are also facing backlash as a result of the Epstein files.   U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer faced calls to resign this week over a relationship his appointed U.S. ambassador, Peter Mandelson, had with Epstein. The latest batch of files show Mandelson may have shared sensitive U.K. government information with Epstein.   \n   Mandelson resigned last year after the files showed he remained in contact with Epstein after Epstein pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution in Florida, but Starmer faces pressure and criticism for appointing Mandelson to begin with. Starmer admitted he knew Mandelson had a relationship with Epstein prior to appointing him as U.S. ambassador but said Mandelson lied to him about the extent of their relationship.   Two members of Starmer's cabinet, chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney and communications director Tim Allan, resigned this week as opposition parties urged Starmer to step down.   \n   The Epstein files continue to rope in the royal family, too. U.K. police are looking into whether former Prince Andrew, who was stripped of his title, also leaked private government information to Epstein.\n",

The department saw its baseline funding expire after lawmakers left town for a week-long recess, but without a deal to rein in the conduct of federal immigration officers. Democrats say that after two U.S. citizens were shot dead by immigration officers in Minneapolis, they need reforms cemented into law before agreeing to fund the department.   The shutdown is now the third in a matter of months, but unlike the others, this one is more limited. It only affects DHS, not other federal agencies. Still, the department is sweeping in its scope, responsible not only for immigration enforcement, but also disaster response and airport security.   \n   As lawmakers and the White House look to break the impasse, here are five things to know about the shutdown.   1. It's hard to know how long the shutdown will last    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., arrives for a press conference on February 10, 2026 on Capitol Hill. Thune has said lawmakers have been told to be ready to return from recess if a deal on DHS funding is reached.\n                \n                    Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Democrats have spelled out a list of 10 demands, but finding consensus has been tough. Some asks, like requiring immigration officers to wear body cameras, appear to enjoy bipartisan support. But GOP lawmakers have pushed back on other demands, like prohibiting agents from wearing masks to conceal their identities. Republicans say doing so would make it easier for people to doxx federal officers.    Republicans in the Senate tried to pass a short-term funding extension on Thursday to allow time for negotiations to play out, but Democrats blocked that measure before lawmakers in both chambers left the Capitol for the recess. The vote came after a White House counteroffer that Democrats rejected as \"insufficient and incomplete.\"    \"Democrats will not support a blank check for chaos,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \"This vote today asked a simple question: Will you rein in ICE's abuses or will you vote to extend the chaos. Republicans chose chaos. The Democrats, we refused.\"   Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said lawmakers have been told to be ready to return from recess if a deal is reached, though he indicated that would be unlikely.   \n   \"I just think at the moment we're not close,\" Thune told reporters.   2. Immigration enforcement is likely to continue uninterrupted    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                An ICE agent holds a taser as they stand watch on February 5, 2026 in Minneapolis.\n                \n                    Stephen Maturen/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Stephen Maturen/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   During two congressional hearings this week, the leaders of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection told lawmakers their agencies would likely not see significant impact on their enforcement operations since both agencies received more than $70 billion from Congress last summer as part of the GOP's massive tax and spending bill.   ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons said the shutdown could affect DHS's work on transnational crime, but he did not note any impact to immigration operations. CBP Commissioner Rodney Scott didn't detail how the shutdown would affect personnel, just saying: \"I agree America becomes less safe.\"   Another agency unlikely to see much interruption is U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. USCIS Director Joseph Edlow reminded House lawmakers that his agency is funded primarily by the fees people pay when they submit various forms and applications, so his employees would still get paid.   3. Air travelers could see delays ... eventually    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A TSA checkpoint is closed during last year's government shutdown at Baltimore Washington International Airport. The shutdown at DHS could lead to delays for travelers at TSA checkpoints.\n                \n                    Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Most of the Transportation Security Administration's roughly 64,000 employees are considered \"essential\" workers and have to stay on the job.   Still, travelers across the U.S. could feel the impact of the shutdown — particularly if it lasts more than a few weeks. In past shutdowns, airport security workers stayed home from work in greater numbers when they started missing paychecks, citing \"financial limitations.\"   And TSA leaders say many are still feeling the effects of the lengthy funding lapse in October and November.   \"We saw a lot of folks have to take on second jobs, making for extremely long work days,\" said Ha Nguyen McNeill, the acting administrator of the TSA, at a House hearing on Wednesday. \"Some are just recovering from the financial impact of the 43-day shutdown. Many are still reeling from it. We cannot put them through another such experience.\"   \n   The number of unscheduled absences among TSA workers doubled or even tripled at some airports during the last shutdown, according to McNeill. The threat of repeated shutdowns also makes it harder to attract and retain workers, she said.   Some may feel more motivated to show up for work this time because of the $10,000 bonuses that DHS leaders gave screeners for \"exemplary service\" after the previous finding lapse — though it remains unclear exactly how many workers received those bonuses, or how they were selected.   Fortunately for travelers, February is a relatively quiet month for the U.S. aviation industry. But traffic tends to pick up in March, when the spring break travel season begins. Air traffic controllers work for the Federal Aviation Administration, which is not part of DHS, so they should not be directly affected by a shutdown.   4. Federal disaster response will still be available, but may be slowed down    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A worker in the National Response Coordination Center looks at a map of the approaching winter storm at FEMA headquarters on January 24, 2026 in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Al Drago/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Al Drago/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The country's top disaster recovery agency will be affected by the shutdown, but the agency will still be able to respond to emergencies.   FEMA supports state and local governments when large disasters happen, including major hurricanes, earthquakes and wildfires. For example, FEMA had staff, food and generators available during the ice storm that hit the eastern half of the U.S. earlier this winter.   That type of assistance is paid for with money from the Disaster Relief Fund, which was established by Congress. On Wednesday, FEMA Associate Administrator Gregg Phillips told Congress that the fund \"has sufficient balances to continue emergency response activities for the foreseeable future.\"   FEMA also helps pay for the costs of disaster recovery, including repairs to homes, schools and roads, hauling away debris and building infrastructure such as flood walls that can help protect people during the next disaster. That work often takes years, and it will be slowed down by the shutdown because some employees may be furloughed, and some types of funding will not be available.   \n   \"A government shutdown would severely disrupt FEMA's ability to reimburse states for disaster relief costs and to support our recovery from disasters,\" Phillips told House members.   5. Some Coast Guard missions may end up suspended    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The USCGC Vigilant (WMEC-617) is docked at Coast Guard Base San Juan, on December 31, 2025 in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n                \n                    Miguel J. Rodriguez Carrillo/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Miguel J. Rodriguez Carrillo/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The U.S. Coast Guard is a branch of the military, but is housed inside DHS. Admiral Thomas Allan told the House Appropriations Committee on Wednesday that during a shutdown the Coast Guard would have to suspend all non-essential missions, and defer training and maintenance, along with commercial safety inspections and other services.    Coast Guard teams are deployed around the country and around the world and perform a wide range of missions that are considered essential, from search and rescue to interdicting drug vessels. Many of the 55,000 personnel would have to continue working, while risking not being paid during a shutdown. Though during the last shutdown, DHS used money from the Republican tax and spending bill to pay their salaries. \n",

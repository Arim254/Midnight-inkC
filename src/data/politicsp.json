    "body": "\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  In California, New York, Virginia and New Jersey, Democrats are declaring yesterday's election results a repudiation of President Trump.LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Republicans suffered losses in major races that include two of the first statewide contests since Trump returned to the White House. Former U.S. Navy helicopter pilot and Democratic Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill won the governorship in New Jersey.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKIE SHERRILL: We take oaths to a Constitution, not a king.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: That's right.SHERRILL: We've chosen liberty, the very foundation of democracy, and we've chosen prosperity necessary to create opportunity for all.FADEL: She beat the Trump-backed candidate, Republican Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli. In her victory speech, Sherrill said she would keep fighting the president's policies.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SHERRILL: So, New Jersey, to quote The Boss, the future is now. Roll up your sleeves. Let your passion flow. The country we carry in our hearts is waiting.(CHEERING)MARTÍNEZ: Virginia's Abigail Spanberger, who in fact once shared an apartment with Mikie Sherrill on Capitol Hill, will become the first woman to lead the Commonwealth.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: We sent a message to the whole world that in 2025, Virginia chose pragmatism over partisanship.(CHEERING)SPANBERGER: We chose our Commonwealth over chaos.(CHEERING)MARTÍNEZ: Spanberger is a former CIA analyst who served three terms in the U.S. House. She defeated the state's Republican lieutenant governor, Winsome Earle-Sears.FADEL: In New York, Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani also secured a commanding win in the mayoral race in America's biggest city to be its first Muslim mayor, first South Asian and its youngest mayor in generations. His victory speech had a message of hope and belonging.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ZOHRAN MAMDANI: New York will remain a city of immigrants, a city built by immigrants...(CHEERING)MAMDANI: ...Powered by immigrants...(CHEERING)MAMDANI: ...And, as of tonight, led by an immigrant.(CHEERING)MAMDANI: So hear me, President Trump, when I say this. To get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.FADEL: He galvanized voters by running a deft internet campaign and having a clear message of affordability. More than 2 million New Yorkers turned out to vote for the first time since 1969. More than a million chose Mamdani. He beat former Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent and was backed by President Trump, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Mamdani dealt with bigoted attacks throughout his campaign for his faith. He was also labeled a communist by his opponents and criticized for his stand on Israel.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MAMDANI: The conventional wisdom would tell you that I am far from the perfect candidate. I am young, despite my best efforts to grow older.(LAUGHTER)MAMDANI: I am Muslim.(CHEERING)MAMDANI: I am a Democratic socialist.(CHEERING)MAMDANI: And most damning of all, I refuse to apologize for any of this.(CHEERING)MARTÍNEZ: Here in California, a ballot initiative to redraw congressional districts in Democrats' favor also succeeded, with the help of a $120 million war chest amassed by Governor Gavin Newsom.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GAVIN NEWSOM: We stood tall and we stood firm in response to Donald Trump's recklessness. And tonight, after poking the bear, this bear roared, with unprecedented turnout in a special election with an extraordinary result.FADEL: Those were some of the sounds and reactions from last night's elections. And to put it all into context, Larry Sabato is on the line. He's a political analyst and the Robert Kent Gooch professor of politics at the University of Virginia. Sabato is also the founder of and director of the Center for Politics, which promotes civic engagement and participation. Welcome to the program. Good morning.LARRY SABATO: Thank you. Good morning.FADEL: So these are the first major elections to take place since President Trump won reelection a year ago. Now, Trump wasn't on the ballot, but he was very present in all of these elections. What do the results say about how voters feel about the president and his administration?SABATO: Well, first, it was a Democratic landslide. There's simply no question about it. The New Jersey governor's race, according to several polls, was supposed to be very close and on the edge of an upset by the Republican candidate, and in fact, it turned into a landslide and an even larger landslide in Virginia for Abigail Spanberger, the first woman governor of Virginia - or governor-elect, at least, and the entire Democratic ticket was swept in and a massive 64 Democrats elected to the House of Delegates. They only had 51 before the election. And California, as you mentioned, with Proposition 50. The point is simply this - these are blue-leaning localities, no question about it.FADEL: Right.SABATO: So you can't take too much away from the Republicans or from Trump's coalition. But it's pretty obvious that Democrats got a tremendous boost of enthusiasm and energy with these victories. Nothing cures illness like success.FADEL: Now, what was behind what ignited voters across the country? Like you said, they're blue-leaning, not a total surprise, but a lot of these wins were much bigger than expected.SABATO: Yes, and that's an important element of this. You look to see what the margins are, and the margins were far beyond what had been projected in advance or what even Democratic officials thought they would get. The reason is Donald Trump. It's affordability, yes, as everyone's stressed, but it's mainly Donald Trump. You look at the exit poll, you can see how incredibly unpopular he's become in the states and localities that had elections yesterday.FADEL: Now, will this impact Republican strategy and President Trump's strategy going forward looking at what voters did last night?SABATO: Well, it'll be interesting to see if it has an impact on the shutdown, maybe encouraging a compromise at last. For President Trump, I think we all know that while he may make some small changes, he's not one for turning, and he's unlikely to change the basic drift of his administration. Of course, that may be good for Democrats.FADEL: What is the signal, though, ahead of next year's midterms? I mean, does this mean something bigger when it comes to 2026?SABATO: Well, we're all going to pretend it does because that's what we do.FADEL: (Laughter).SABATO: We analyze elections, and we pretend to know what's going to happen a year from now. But the truth is the headlines will change so many times between now and the midterm elections in November of 2026. However, it does suggest that Trump's very dramatic actions to expand presidential power and, at least from critics, a belief that we're moving down the authoritarian highway is having an effect, at least on Democrats. It's motivating them to turn out in large numbers and to vote in anti-Trump line.FADEL: There were very different candidates on the ballots - right? - that won. When you look at Spanberger and Sherrill, who won for governorships in Virginia and New Jersey, they're seen as moderate candidates. In New York, the breakout star of this election was a Democratic socialist - a progressive who was unapologetic about that fact. They all had a message of affordability, but they messaged very differently. Which of these political types is the future of the party?SABATO: Well, the future for the near term is certainly Sherrill and Spanberger, the two moderate Democrats who were elected governors of two important states, because they showed how it can be done on a broad scale. This is not to diminish Mamdani's victory in New York City, but New York is a bit different. Those of us who have been around for a while know that you don't look to New York City to set the national standard, but you can look to states like New Jersey and Virginia to do so.FADEL: Interesting. You know, as we think about last night's elections, the approval ratings for Democrats in Congress, generally, is quite low. I mean, what do Democrats have to do to win back some of the voters that they have lost in recent years, and what can they learn from what happened last night?SABATO: All three of the big winners - Mamdani, Sherrill and Spanberger - have an important thing in common. They are youthful and energetic. And Mamdani, certainly, is charismatic, and I think to some degree, Spanberger is, too. That's a combination you don't see very often in the Democratic Party - not as often as they need. And that's because the leadership, as we all know, has gotten older.FADEL: So are you saying some of the older leadership - establishment leadership - should be stepping aside to make way?SABATO: Yes. In a word, yes. I think most Democrats would agree with that.FADEL: Now that California, the country's most populous state, has voted for redistricting, where does this leave the fight to change congressional maps across the country?SABATO: The big picture is the Republicans are going to win that battle. They may not win the war, but they're going to win that battle because they have many more states with Republican governors and legislatures that will follow the instructions they're given by Trump and the White House, and they've done so. But Democrats are now fighting back. And the California victory, which was enormous - 62, 63%...FADEL: Yeah. With 7 million voters.SABATO: ...It approached 2-1. Yeah. I mean, it's pretty incredible. That has given Democrats new momentum, new energy and a resolve to at least counteract the Republican effort to the extent they can. So instead of Republicans gaining 12 or 13 additional seats through gerrymandering, maybe they will net only six or seven or eight. That still isn't good news for Democrats, but it's better than alternative.FADEL: Well, what's the news for democracy if each party just gerrymanders its way to power?SABATO: Oh, I think that this is a disaster all the way around. It was initiated by Trump and the White House using Texas. They knew they could get Texas to fall in line, and they pressured a bunch of other states to do the same thing.FADEL: Larry Sabato is a political analyst and the Robert Kent Gooch professor of politics at the University of Virginia. Thank you so much for your time and your insights.SABATO: Thank you very much.(SOUNDBITE OF ONRA'S \"WHERE I'M FROM\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Legal analysts have broadly described the strikes as illegal under both U.S. and international law — in part because they have not been authorized by Congress.   Trump officials invited a dozen members of Congress, including Republican and Democratic leaders and the top lawmakers on intelligence and armed services committees in both chambers. A growing bipartisan group of lawmakers have submitted months of demands for more information on the attacks.   \n   Since the strikes began in September, at least 66 have been killed in 16 strikes in the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean, according to the administration. Trump said last month he approved covert operations in Venezuela, which was followed by orders to send a surge of U.S. naval forces to the waters off South America. Pentagon officials said the country's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, and its strike group, which marks 20% of the Navy's deployed warships is now headed for the region.   On Tuesday, the White House disputed claims it wasn't being transparent enough with Congress regarding the strikes and military buildup in the region. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters the meeting is a top example of their cooperation and said his appearance marks the ninth briefing so far.   \"The president made it very clear if senators want to understand the administration's operations against narco-drug traffickers, we are very happy to speak with them about that,\" she said.   Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Jim Risch, R-Idaho, agreed.    \"The administration has kept me and other members fully advised, fully satisfied with what they're doing,\" Risch said after Wednesday's briefing.    However, several Democrats complained that earlier congressional briefings were limited in scope and key information was only shared with Republicans.   \n   Last week, top Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, criticized Trump administration officials for holding a closed-door briefing with about a dozen GOP Senators — and no Democrats. Warner said someone should be \"fired\" for the oversight.   \"We hit a new low, what the administration did in the last 24 hours is corrosive not only to our Democracy but downright dangerous for our national security,\" Warner, D-Va., said.   After Wednesday's meeting, Warner said he remains perplexed why the U.S. has upended its drug interdiction program that allows the Coast Guard to instead detain suspected drug vessels and pursue criminal charges after obtaining evidence.    \"Showing by interdiction, and drug recovery, and … that the individuals on the boats are known narco-terrorists would sure go a long way in convincing Americans and for that matter, the rest of the world,\" Warner, D-Va., said.    Top House Intelligence Committee Democrat Jim Himes said while there's high confidence in U.S. intelligence providing information on targets, he remains worried some of those killed are not who the administration claims and other information gaps. Himes said at least now, the administration is starting to share information.    \"In my world and the intelligence world, when something is done, we get a great deal of detail on every operation. That has not been shared,\" Himes, D-Conn., said. \"Finally they've started to notify Congress of this stuff, until basically ten days ago we had nothing.\"    He said the administration has finally shared their legal defense for the strikes at sea, and some additional information on military operations.   \"But don't misunderstand me, lots of mistakes could get made,\" he added. \"But they are applying the eyes and ears of our intelligence community to these boats.\"   Wednesday's meeting marked the first time Rubio and Hegseth briefed top lawmakers on the strikes since they began more than two months ago. During this time, members have complained they did not have a legal basis for Trump's orders for the attacks, access to a secret list of targets or broader information on evidence recovered and identities of those killed.   \n   A small bipartisan group of lawmakers intends to force a vote to block Trump's use of military forces to engage in hostilities within or against Venezuela. Behind closed doors, Trump officials have been lobbying Republicans to vote no.   Sens. Tim Kaine, D-Va., Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Adam Schiff, D-Calif., introduced the war powers resolution after Trump said he was entertaining the possibility of military strikes inside Venezuela. They argue that — as laid out clearly by the Constitution — Congress retains the authority to declare war, not the president.   An earlier vote to limit the strikes in the Caribbean failed. Two Republicans, Paul and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, joined Democrats in the 48-51 vote. However, Kaine argued this new vote has a shot at passage, reflecting the earlier resolution's focus on the Caribbean turned off some members and this resolution is more clear cut.\n",

The National Association of the Deaf (NAD) and two deaf men filed the lawsuit against Trump and Leavitt in May. The suit also names White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, along with the offices for president and vice president. It alleges the White House's failure to provide ASL violates Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The law prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in programs conducted by the federal government. The suit also claims the White House is in violation of the First and Fifth Amendments, which protect free speech and provide for due process, respectively.   NAD Interim CEO Bobbie Beth Scoggins said in a statement to NPR Wednesday that the organization is pleased that deaf and hard of hearing Americans will soon regain access to important information from the government.   \"American Sign Language and accurate captioning are both essential to ensuring full and equal access to information,\" Scoggins said. \"ASL and English are distinct languages, and captions alone cannot meet the needs of everyone in our community. The court's ruling affirms what we have long known: equal access to information from the White House is not optional. We deserve the same timely, direct access to White House briefings as everyone else.\"   \n   The White House did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment on the judge's decision.   Ali's order specifies that the ASL interpretation must be visible and signed by a qualified interpreter. He was not persuaded by White House arguments that it does provide closed captioning.   \n   \"The defendants correctly note that the plaintiffs are entitled only to reasonable accommodation. But it is not reasonable — indeed it can hardly be called an accommodation at all — to transcribe press briefings into a language that Ford and many NAD members do not know,\" Ali said in the opinion.   Ali is referring to plaintiff Derrick Ford, of Anderson, Ind. Matthew Bonn, of Germantown, Md., is also a plaintiff in the case.   According to the NAD, hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. communicate mainly in ASL, and many deaf and hard of hearing people do not know English. ASL has its own vocabulary and grammar that is different from English.   The judge stopped short of granting the group's request to require ASL interpretation at briefings and events conducted by the vice president, first lady, and second lady. Ali also declined at this time to require that interpretation be provided to news networks and uploaded to the White House website and social media pages. Scoggins says the NAD will continue to vigorously pursue all relief sought in its lawsuit.   The preliminary injunction is intended to give temporary relief to the group and the plaintiffs, as the case plays out in the legal system. Ali is ordering the White House to update the court on its compliance by Friday.\n",

Brown/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   ATLANTA — Democrats flipped two seats on Georgia's statewide Public Service Commission by wide margins, one of many surprise victories for the party Tuesday up and down the ballot in the handful of races across the country.   Polling shows the Democratic Party is historically unpopular, but at polling places this year voters have helped the party overperform in elections against the backdrop of President Trump's even less popular policies.   Beyond the blowout victories in the New Jersey and Virginia governors' races, Zohran Mamdani winning a majority of votes in New York City's mayoral election and California voters approving a plan to temporarily redraw the state's congressional districts to add Democrat-leaning districts, the party continued its trend of electoral success in the 2025 general election.   \n   Here are some other notable election results around the country:   In Georgia, Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson will be the newest members of the state's five-person public utility regulator after earning roughly 60% of the vote. It's the first time Democrats have won a nonfederal statewide office there since 2006 and one where soaring energy costs and displeasure with incumbents dominated the race.   Pennsylvania voters chose to retain three state Supreme Court judges that were first elected as Democrats after millions of dollars in outside spending driven by conservative billionaire Jeff Yass' efforts to reshape the state court's politics. Democrats also won special elections for a seat on Pennsylvania's Superior Court and a seat on its Commonwealth Court.   Also in Pennsylvania, Democrats swept the top \"row offices\" in the purple-hued Bucks County, electing the county's first-ever Democratic district attorney and defeating an incumbent Republican sheriff a year after Trump narrowly won there. Democrats similarly notched commanding victories in county executive races in Erie, Lehigh and Northampton counties, all bellwether counties in recent presidential elections.   At the state legislative level, Mississippi Democrats have broken a GOP supermajority in the state Senate after flipping two seats in that chamber plus another pickup in the state House. A federal court ordered lawmakers to redraw 14 total House and Senate districts after finding the maps drawn in 2022 discriminated against Black voters.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A lying Statue of Liberty is on display outside a polling station Tuesday in Arlington, Va. Virginians hit the poll on Election Day to pick their next governor but also expanded the majority for Democrats in the state's House of Delegates.\n                \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Democrats have also vastly expanded their control of the Virginia House of Delegates and in New Jersey's General Assembly, the party gained a supermajority.   \n   In many local races across the country, Democrats touted victories that will reshape their communities, like the flipping of all three city council seats in Georgetown, S.C., the unseating of the last remaining Republican city council member in Orlando, Fla., and winning back mayoral races in Connecticut.   For the first time in a half-century, Democrats control the Onondaga County legislature that includes Syracuse, N.Y. Democrats saw a city council seat in Charlotte, N.C., switch parties for the first time since 1999.    Democrats across the ideological spectrum won, too. Beyond Mamdani's victory in New York City, the Democratic Socialists of America touted municipal wins for members in Detroit, Atlanta and Cambridge, Mass., among others.   \n   Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin previously predicted in an interview with NPR that the party's success in special elections in 2025 — where the party has overperformed prior margins by an average of about 14% — would continue into the midterm cycle.   \"The important thing to remember is midterm elections are not a referendum on a party that's not in power,\" Martin said. \"So our numbers really don't matter here. Donald Trump is at an all-time low in terms of his favorability and his approval numbers… the Republican Party is as well.\"   Tuesday's results also show that the economy and affordability continue to be top of mind for voters, and voters have registered their displeasure with Trump and congressional Republicans' agenda on that front.\n",

Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at a campaign rally in October.

Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani won with a progressive platform focused on making the city more affordable, through free bus service, frozen rents, universal childcare and a higher minimum wage, among other ideas.   The state assemblymember represented both the Democratic Party and the Working Families Party on the ballot. He quoted prominent late-19th and early-20th century socialist Eugene Debs in his victory speech Tuesday night. And he is a longtime member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA).   \n   Its New York City chapter played a key role in Mamdani's campaign, providing an early endorsement and a legion of volunteers for canvassing and fundraising — and raising its own profile in the process.   \"Since [Mamdani's] primary win in June, Democratic Socialism has soared in popularity here and across the nation,\" the NYC-DSA tweeted after his general election win. \"Our unprecedented growth is a testament to our vision and our ability to inspire renewed hope and political engagement from the working class.\"   As Mamdani's campaign pushed democratic socialism further into the mainstream, it has also raised questions about what the political ideology is — and isn't.   \n   Most notably, President Trump has frequently and falsely criticized Mamdani as a communist in the lead-up to the election. Mamdani refuted that characterization in a June appearance on NBC's Meet the Press, to which he responded, \"I am not.\"   Mamdani went on to describe his brand of democratic socialism, a term that is largely up to interpretation.   \"When we talk about my politics, I call myself a democratic socialist in many ways inspired by the words of Dr. King from decades ago who said, 'Call it democracy or call it democratic socialism. There has to be a better distribution of wealth for all of God's children in this country,'\" he said, referring to a 1961 speech by Martin Luther King Jr. \"And as income inequality has declined nationwide, it has increased in New York City. And, ultimately, what we need is a city where every single person can thrive.\"   \n   What is democratic socialism?   There is no one-size-fits-all definition of democratic socialism, though its adherents broadly support the government taking control over certain sectors of the economy, such as health care and utilities, to benefit the public rather than private corporations.   \"We want to collectively own the key economic drivers that dominate our lives, such as energy production and transportation,\" reads the DSA's website.   The DSA, which has been around since the 1980s, calls itself the largest socialist organization in the U.S. It says it has more than 80,000 members organized into campus and community chapters across all 50 states.   \n   The group says its members are socialists because they reject an international economic order sustained by things like private profit, discrimination and violence \"in defense of the status quo,\" and instead envision a more equitable and humane social order \"based both on democratic planning and market mechanisms.\"   Democratic socialists often distance themselves from historic examples of socialism and communism, which have had largely negative connotations in the U.S. since the Cold War era. Proponents also say democratic socialism goes further than \"social democracy,\" which often involves a strong welfare state operating under capitalism.   \"We believe there are many avenues that feed into the democratic road to socialism,\" the DSA says. \"Our vision pushes further than historic social democracy and leaves behind authoritarian visions of socialism in the dustbin of history.\"   The Communist Party USA says that while it shares some values of democratic socialists — like opposing war and wanting higher minimum wage — it believes those can only happen through a fundamental restructuring of society.   Many democratic socialists acknowledge that radical transformation won't happen in the short term, so they use tools like organizing, lobbying and protesting in hopes of making change within the existing system, at least for now.   \"As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people,\" it explains, naming single-payer Medicare for All and the Green New Deal as examples.   \n   Why is democratic socialism on the rise?    Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont put democratic socialism on many peoples' radars during his 2016 presidential campaign.   While a registered independent, Sanders has described himself as a democratic socialist for decades, the ideology shaping his stances on everything from poverty to health care to higher education.   Sanders is not a member of the DSA. But his candidacy is credited with boosting the organization's membership and visibility, just in time for the first Trump presidency.   \n   Holly Otterbein, an Axios reporter who has covered the rise of socialism, told NPR's It's Been a Minute earlier this week that she saw the biggest increase in DSA membership after Trump's 2016 win.   \"When I've talked to people who have become members of the DSA or DSA leaders, they felt like that 2016 election sort of discredited the Democratic Party in their eyes,\" she said.   Many young voters have become discontented with the Democratic Party, a trend that has continued through the COVID-19 pandemic, economic turbulence and now Trump's second term. All of that has fueled the democratic socialist movement.   \"Socialism is a recurring talking point for people that still can't find ways to get out of the economic precarity that their generation and the immediately prior generations couldn't get out of,\" Lex McMenamin, head of the politics section at Teen Vogue, told It's Been a Minute.   A Gallup poll released in September found that roughly two-thirds of Democrats view socialism positively, up from 50% in 2010, even as Americans as a whole continue to view capitalism more favorably.   What could Mamdani's win mean for the movement?    Recent years have seen the elections of DSA members including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.   Both Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez — as well as the NYC-DSA — endorsed Mamdani before the primary in June, and have headlined rallies with him in the months since.   \n   After Mamdani's win on Tuesday, an NBC reporter asked Ocasio-Cortez how she would define democratic socialism.   \"To me, it's this radical idea that working people have economic rights,\" she said, listing housing, a livable wage, health care and child care as examples.   \n   Political scientists have cautioned that Mamdani's approach may not be a winning blueprint for democratic socialist candidates running outside of New York City, where registered Democrats heavily outnumber Republicans. But supporters see lessons in his success.   \"He had to defeat a Republican and the old guard of the Democratic party at the same time,\" Ocasio-Cortez told CNN, referring to Curtis Sliwa and former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. \"And he still won resoundingly.   \"And I think the message that that sends is that the Democratic Party cannot last much longer by denying the future, by trying to undercut our young, by trying to undercut a next generation of diverse and upcoming Democrats that ... our actual electorate and voters support.\"   NYC's DSA is already touting Mamdani's victory in recruitment efforts, calling it just the beginning. Notably, Mamdani stressed during his campaign that his platform differs from that of the DSA, and has taken a more moderate stance on issues like eliminating misdemeanor offenses and defunding the police.   McMenamin, of Teen Vogue, says Mamdani's mayorship could change what socialism means to people, depending on how he governs.   \"I think people are going to really want to talk about socialism if some of these policy changes actually start coming into effect,\" McMenamim adds. \"And so what could happen in New York over the next year could make a big change for people in all 50 states.\"\n",

Today's top stories   NPR's senior political editor/correspondent Domenico Montanaro joins the newsletter today to break down the 2025 off-year elections.   Up and down the ballot, Democrats did well, from the marquee gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey to a key redistricting ballot initiative in California and even state Supreme Court races in Pennsylvania. Here are five takeaways from the 2025 off-year elections:   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Voters cast their ballots at a polling station on Nov. 4, 2025, in Arlington, Virginia. Virginians hit the polls on Election Day to pick their next governor.\n                \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n    It's still the cost of living, stupid. Prices, prices, prices. Affordability was a through line in most of the races Tuesday. President Trump's lack of focus on it likely hurt his party, as voters overwhelmingly sided with Democrats on the economy. Republicans still have a Trump problem — in two different ways. Republican candidates are in a quandary — Trump is unpopular and a drag with independents, but without him on the ballot, they continue to have problems turning out base voters. The Trump slump with Latinos appears to be real. Trump made inroads with Latinos in 2024, but that has slid backward. Latinos chose Democrats in the governors' races by 2-to-1 margins. The redistricting arms race is on, and Democrats got a boost Tuesday on that front. Yes on Prop 50 won big, giving Democrats a chance to counterbalance GOP efforts to squeeze out more Republican House seats. It was a big win for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, too. The Democratic Party will have to wrestle with its identity over the next year. From Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York to Abigail Spanberger for Virginia governor, there's going to be a real debate on how best for Democrats to present themselves to win in next year's midterm elections.   \n   Stay informed with more news and analysis by subscribing to the NPR Politics newsletter and listening to the NPR Politics podcast.   Today marks day 36 of the ongoing government shutdown, making it the longest in U.S. history. It takes the title from the most recent shutdown, which stretched from December 2018 to January 2019 during President Trump's first term in office. With no end in sight, Americans are feeling the worsening impacts every day, from disruptions at airports across the U.S. to federal workers going without a paycheck. Here's how this shutdown compares to previous ones.   The Supreme Court hears arguments today on whether Trump can unilaterally set tariff rates under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Lower courts say he has exceeded his authority, while Trump argues that the measure allows him to impose tariffs to address trade imbalances and fentanyl imports. Tariffs are generating billions of dollars for the federal government, but they are also raising the costs of goods for consumers and frustrating businesses. Listen to the oral arguments in the case here.   Israeli authorities have arrested and detained the military's top lawyer after she admitted leaking footage of Israeli soldiers sexually abusing a Palestinian detainee at a facility where Israel has held Palestinian prisoners throughout the war in Gaza. The military advocate general, Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, stated in her resignation letter that she authorized the video's release to defuse attacks on investigators handling the case. Tomer-Yerushalmi has now been arrested for leaking the footage.

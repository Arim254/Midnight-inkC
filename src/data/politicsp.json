That money will then be handled in such a way that we will control how it is dispersed in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people, not corruption, not the regime.\"   \n   Rubio said step two will focus on \"recovery\" where access to the Venezuelan market will be restored in a way that is \"fair\" while \"at the same time, begin to create the process of reconciliation nationally within Venezuela, so that the opposition forces can be amnestied and released and from prisons or brought back to the country, and begin to rebuild civil society.\"   Step three will be \"transition,\" but Rubio did not offer details of how that would work. He said some phases would overlap.\n",

Representatives of Exxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips are expected to attend the White House meeting, according to a person familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss the plans.   Earlier Tuesday, officials in Caracas announced that at least 24 Venezuelan security officers were killed in the dead-of-night U.S. military operation to capture Nicolás Maduro and spirit him to the United States to face drug charges. And the country's acting president, Delcy Rodriguez, pushed back on Trump, who earlier this week warned she'd face an outcome worse than Maduro's if she does not \"do what's right\" and overhaul Venezuela into a country that aligns with U.S. interests, including by granting access to American energy companies.   \n   Rodriguez, delivering an address Tuesday before government agricultural and industrial sector officials, said, \"Personally, to those who threaten me: My destiny is not determined by them, but by God.\"   Venezuela's Attorney General Tarek William Saab said overall \"dozens\" of officers and civilians were killed in the weekend strike in Caracas and said prosecutors would investigate the deaths in what he described as a \"war crime.\" He didn't specify if the estimate was specifically referring to Venezuelans.   In addition to the Venezuelan security officials, Cuba's government had previously confirmed that 32 Cuban military and police officers working in Venezuela were killed in the raid. The Cuban government says the personnel killed belonged to the Revolutionary Armed Forces and the Ministry of the Interior, the country's two main security agencies.   Seven U.S. service members were also injured in the raid, according to the Pentagon. Five have already returned to duty, while two are still recovering from their injuries. The injuries included gunshot wounds and shrapnel injuries, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to comment on the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.   \n   A video tribute to the slain Venezuelan security officials posted to the military's Instagram account features faces of the fallen over black-and-white videos of soldiers, American aircraft flying over Caracas and armored vehicles destroyed by the blasts. Meanwhile, the streets of Caracas, deserted for days following Maduro's capture, briefly filled with masses of people waving Venezuelan flags and bouncing to patriotic music at a state-organized display of support for the government.   \n   \"Their spilled blood does not cry out for vengeance, but for justice and strength,\" the military wrote in an Instagram post. \"It reaffirms our unwavering oath not to rest until we rescue our legitimate President, completely dismantle the terrorist groups operating from abroad, and ensure that events such as these never again sully our sovereign soil.\"   Questions about the future of Venezuelan oil   With oil trading at roughly $56 a barrel, the transaction Trump announced late Tuesday could be worth as much as $2.8 billion. The U.S. goes through an average of roughly 20 million barrels a day of oil and related products, so Venezuela's transfer would be the equivalent of as much as two and a half days of supply, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.   \n   Despite Venezuela having the world's largest proven crude oil reserves, it only produces on average about one million barrels day, significantly below the U.S. average daily production of 13.9 million barrels a day during October.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Government supporters gather for a women's march to demand the return of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas, Venezuela, Tuesday, Jan. 6, 2026, three days after U.S. forces captured him and his wife.\n                \n                    Matias Delacroix/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Matias Delacroix/AP\n    \n\n   \n   The press office for Venezuela's government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump's announcement.   ExxonMobil is developing a mammoth offshore oil deposit in the waters off Guyana, Venezuela's neighbor to the east. The company's major oil discovery in 2015 prompted Venezuela to revive a century-old territorial dispute with Guyana and take steps to annex the remote region known as Essequibo, which comprises about two-thirds of Guyana's land mass.   The development has also led to wide-ranging accusations from Venezuela's government, including Rodríguez, against Guyana's leaders and ExxonMobil. Two years ago, Venezuelan lawmakers even considered banning any future operation in Venezuela of oil companies working in Guyana.   Earlier Tuesday, Trump pushed back against Democratic criticism of this weekend's military operation, noting that his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden had also called for the arrest of the Venezuelan leader on drug trafficking charges.   Trump in remarks before a House Republican retreat in Washington grumbled that Democrats were not giving him credit for a successful military operation, even though there was bipartisan agreement that Maduro was not the rightful president of Venezuela.   In 2020, Maduro was indicted in the United States, accused in a decades-long narco-terrorism and international cocaine trafficking conspiracy. White House officials have noted that Biden's administration in his final days in office last year raised the award for information leading to Maduro's arrest after he assumed a third term in office despite evidence suggesting that he lost Venezuela's most recent election. The Trump administration doubled the award to $50 million in August.   \"You know, at some point, they should say, 'You know, you did a great job. Thank you. Congratulations.' Wouldn't it be good?\" Trump said. \"I would say that if they did a good job, their philosophies are so different. But if they did a good job, I'd be happy for the country. They've been after this guy for years and years and years.\"   \n   What US opinion polls show   Americans are split about the capture of Maduro — with many still forming opinions — according to a poll conducted by The Washington Post and SSRS using text messages over the weekend. About 4 in 10 approved of the U.S. military being sent to capture Maduro, while roughly the same share were opposed. About 2 in 10 were unsure.   Nearly half of Americans, 45%, were opposed to the U.S. taking control of Venezuela and choosing a new government for the country. About 9 in 10 Americans said the Venezuelan people should be the ones to decide the future leadership of their country.   Maduro pleaded not guilty to federal drug trafficking charges in a U.S. courtroom on Monday. U.S. forces captured Maduro and his wife early Saturday in a raid on a compound where they were surrounded by Cuban guards.   In the days since Maduro's ouster, Trump and top administration officials have raised anxiety around the globe that the operation could mark the beginning of a more expansionist U.S. foreign policy in the Western Hemisphere. The president in recent days has renewed his calls for an American takeover of the Danish territory of Greenland for the sake of U.S. security interests and threatened military action on Colombia for facilitating the global sale of cocaine, while his top diplomat declared the communist government in Cuba is \"in a lot of trouble.\"   Colombia responds to Trump   Colombia's Foreign Affairs Minister Rosa Villavicencio said Tuesday she'll meet with the U.S. Embassy's charge d'affaires in Bogota to present him with a formal complaint over the recent threats issued by the United States.   On Sunday, Trump said he wasn't ruling out an attack on Colombia and described its president, who's been an outspoken critic of the U.S. pressure campaign on Venezuela, as a \"sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States.\"   \n   Villavicencio said she's hoping to strengthen relations with the United States and improve cooperation in the fight against drug trafficking.   \"It is necessary for the Trump administration to know in more detail about all that we are doing in the fight against drug trafficking,\" she said.   Meanwhile, the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom on Tuesday joined Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen in defending Greenland's sovereignty. The island is a self-governing territory of the kingdom of Denmark and thus part of the NATO military alliance.   \"Greenland belongs to its people,\" the statement said. \"It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      President Trump has shared mixed messages about the future of Venezuela after capturing the country's president. A look at his evolving plans for Venezuela.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  President Trump continues to suggest a lengthy and active U.S. role in Venezuela after capturing leader Nicolás Maduro. Well, he said the U.S. will run Venezuela for a period.MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Trump has proposed several plans for the future of Venezuela's government and economy, with U.S. companies playing a key role. And now, apparently, Venezuela is handing over oil to the U.S. In a few minutes, we'll talk about all this with former diplomat Tom Shannon. But first, let's get the latest information.FADEL: NPR's Franco Ordoñez joins us now to talk about all of this. Hey, Franco.FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, HOST:  Hey, Leila.FADEL: OK. So many questions about what's next for Venezuela, and it feels like everything is kind of happening ad hoc. Does the president have a plan?ORDOÑEZ: I mean, there really are so many questions. The truth is, President Trump and his aides are not really clear about the future of Venezuela. As we've reported, you know, they did not get behind the popular opposition leader, María Corina Machado, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, saying she didn't have enough support from the people. And while there have been a lot of calls for new elections in an interview about Venezuela's future, Trump told NBC News it's going to take a, quote, \"period of time,\" and the U.S. first needs to, quote, \"nurse the country back to health\" again.FADEL: OK. So who is running the country then? Who's going to run the country?ORDOÑEZ: Well, for now, Trump is backing Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodríguez. And there are also a number of other ministers from the Maduro regime, who are still in charge, including his interior minister and his defense minister. I was actually talking with Ambassador John Bolton, who served as national security adviser in the first Trump administration, and he told me that he doesn't see those officials just rolling over for Trump.JOHN BOLTON: I don't think that's what they think they're doing. I think they think they are still the Maduro regime, just without Maduro. And I think it's going to be very hard, much harder than Trump understands, to get them to do what he wants them to do.ORDOÑEZ: And, Leila, it sure looks like the regime is fighting all it can to hold on, cracking down on dissent in Venezuela, arresting journalists and others. And I should probably also note that Bolton has become a fierce Trump critic after he was fired from the administration. And more recently, Trump's Department of Justice is prosecuting Bolton for allegedly mishandling classified info.FADEL: Right. And there are a lot of questions about what Trump means when he says the U.S. will run Venezuela, right?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah, absolutely. Right now, and - you know, while Trump's secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has been having conversations with Rodríguez, a lot of eyes are also actually on Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller, who's also among the group of U.S. officials overseeing Venezuela. Now, of course, Rubio - he's a Cuban American from Miami, certainly well steeped in these issues, having worked on them for decades. Miller is better known for his immigration policies, and more recently, actually, depicting U.S. ruling over the hemisphere by force.FADEL: And President Trump has made it clear that a lot of this is about Venezuela's oil, and he made a pretty stunning announcement last night on Truth Social. What did he say?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, last night, Trump announced on social media that Venezuela will turn over 30 to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S., and then the U.S. will sell it at market price with proceeds overseen by him.FADEL: Is this all aboveboard? I mean, is this legal?ORDOÑEZ: I mean, I think the circumstances of which Venezuela is giving this oil are also very unclear. I mean, Trump is saying that U.S. may also subsidize the oil companies to help revive Venezuela's oil industry, which really indicates a much longer-term project for the U.S. Trump has said it could take less than 18 months to rebuild the Venezuelan infrastructure, but experts say it'll take much longer, multiple years to fix the decaying system.FADEL: OK. So many questions ahead. I'm sure we'll be talking again very soon. Thank you, Franco.ORDOÑEZ: Thank you.FADEL: That's White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

    "body": "\n      President Trump met with House Republicans and said his policies provide a roadmap to win the midterms. But GOP lawmakers might not view the intervention in Venezuela as something to brag about.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  Fresh off the military operation to seize the president of Venezuela, President Trump took a victory lap in front of House Republicans today. He spoke with the goal of laying out a winning midterm agenda, which raises the question, how will this international intervention be received among the America First wing of his movement? And do Republicans see it as an accomplishment they can tout? NPR's Mara Liasson joins us now from the White House. Hi there.MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi there.SUMMERS: So, Mara, tell us, what did we learn from the president's appearance today?LIASSON: Well, he was told to give a midterm speech, and he did do that after a while. He went to the House Republican retreat, and during what was meant to be a pep rally, he spoke for 80 minutes - a lot of minutes. But after many, many minutes, he detailed what he said was the roadmap to success for Republicans - giving Americans money directly to buy health insurance, lowering prescription drug prices and gas prices and continuing to ban transgender athletes from competition. Here's what he said.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And I think I gave you something. It's just a roadmap. And it's a roadmark (ph) - map to victory. You have so many good nuggets. You have to use them. If you can sell them, we're going to win.LIASSON: But the biggest news is what he didn't say. He did talk about the Venezuelan raid, but he said nothing at all about what happens next, and that I think is a clear indication that he doesn't want Republicans to run on Venezuela and he hopes that the midterms are not about Venezuela.SUMMERS: And those who know the anti-interventionist views of some parts of Trump's base might have wondered how his core supporters would view this Venezuelan intervention. What can you tell us so far?LIASSON: What we know is that in the flush of victory, there are very few Republicans that are critical, even though this was a huge departure from Trump's previous promises to stay out of foreign entanglements and wars. Now, what the raid and its aftermath might tell us is, what is MAGA? Is it whatever Trump wants on a given day? Or does it have core principles like non-interventionism that would transcend Trump? And Trump was asked this very question on NBC News yesterday about what will MAGA think about this? And he said, quote, \"MAGA loves it. MAGA loves what I'm doing. MAGA loves everything I do. MAGA is me. MAGA loves everything I do, and I love everything I do, too.\"Now, even by Trump standards, that's a stunning statement. He does have a firmer hold on his party's base than any modern president. Now, so far, he hasn't lost support among his base, but then again, his base is only 30% of the electorate.SUMMERS: And, Mara, as you mentioned earlier, there are so few Republican voices that are freely critical of Trump in the Republican Party today. But what do we know about people who might not identify with Trump's MAGA movement, but who were open to voting for Trump? Do we know how swing voters are responding?LIASSON: Well, that is the next big political question. We don't have polling yet on that. We do know that before the arrest of Maduro, 70% of Americans told CBS pollsters that they were against military intervention in Venezuela. So they're not so sure. They'd rather have him focusing on the cost of health care and groceries and not spending taxpayer dollars, quote, \"running\" Venezuela, whatever that means. So Trump clearly communicated today by leaving out Venezuela while rallying Republicans that while he is proud to brag about the raid, he doesn't really want to talk about what comes next.SUMMERS: Even if the modern Republican Party is, well, whatever Trump says it is, there is still this question about the future of MAGA because President Trump, as we know, is barred from running again for president in 2028.LIASSON: Yes, and I think the future of the Republican Party will be resolved in a competition between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance. Both of them are presidential hopefuls. Rubio now has the main role in Venezuela. He's being called the viceroy of Venezuela. He's also the national security advisor and the secretary of state. Meanwhile, Vance has been conspicuously absent. He wasn't at the big press conference yesterday. But he has represented the non-interventionist wing of MAGA up until now. So we'll see how Venezuela plays out, and that will affect the futures of these two ambitious men.SUMMERS: NPR's Mara Liasson, thank you.LIASSON: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

CLARY/AFP via Getty Images/AFP\n    \n\n   \n   Wall Street traditionally detests \"uncertainty.\" But in the first days after the United States removed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro from power, U.S. investors are shrugging off the geopolitical instability — and mostly focusing on the positive.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit record highs on Monday and Tuesday, lifted in part by some Venezuela-related stocks. The S&P 500 also closed at a record high on Tuesday. Meanwhile, investors who own Venezuelan bonds — including some large U.S. financial institutions — also saw those struggling assets surge in value.   \"We're in a different ballpark now,\" says Eric Fine, who invests in bonds as emerging-markets portfolio manager at VanEck Funds, and whose investment firm bought Venezuelan sovereign debt a few weeks ago.   \n   U.S. oil companies were the immediate, and stated, beneficiary of the country's attack on Venezuela: President Trump said during a weekend press conference that U.S. oil companies would now be able to invest in Venezuela, to \"fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country.\"   Big Oil stocks have swung up and down since. Shares in Chevron, the last major U.S. oil company remaining in Venezuela, soared on Monday before retreating on Tuesday. Other oil companies and oil field-services providers — including Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips, and Halliburton — followed the same trajectory.   Another potential Wall Street beneficiary: Elliott Investment Management, a hedge fund founded by billionaire and influential Republican donor Paul Singer. A U.S. judge in November approved Elliott's $6 billion bid to take over Citgo Petroleum, a subsidiary of Venezuela's state oil company. Maduro's government had denounced and appealed the sale, which has yet to be approved by the U.S. Treasury Department.   But the potential Wall Street winners from the United States' dramatic intervention in Venezuela go far beyond oil. Here are some other U.S. investor groups that are benefitting:   Venezuela's long-suffering bondholders   For years, Venezuela's debt seemed like a dud investment. In 2017, Venezuela missed payments on bonds issued by the government and its state-owned oil company — leaving foreign investors, including U.S. financial institutions, holding tens of billions of dollars of its debt.   \n   Now many of those investors are hoping that the United States's removal of Maduro — and its intention to take over Venezuelan oil — will boost the country's economy, and ultimately its ability to repay its creditors.   \"There are much, much greater upsides in the bond market than what investors went to sleep thinking they were on Friday,\" says VanEck's Fine.   His fund manager bought Venezuelan government bonds \"in the last few weeks,\" betting that the Trump Administration's increasingly aggressive rhetoric around Venezuela would eventually lead to some kind of action. Now Fine is hopeful that the interim presidency of former Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez will eventually lead to elections and a future Venezuelan government that is \"arguably more market-friendly.\"   For a long time, \"we really didn't see much [that was] interesting in Venezuela. It is highly indebted, and there was no prospect of regime change,\" Fine says.   But now, from a purely financial point of view, \"I think it's a great opportunity,\" he adds.   U.S. weapons makers are on the up and up   The surprise U.S. seizure of a foreign leader on his home soil did increase geopolitical instability, which sometimes can rattle Wall Street. But this week, it benefitted some equity investors — especially in weapons manufacturers and other defense contractors.   Shares in Lockheed Martin, Boeing, RTX Corp., and General Dynamics are all up this week, with the latter hitting an all-time high.   Precious metals are soaring    At the same time that stocks hit record highs, so did some of the precious metals that investors traditionally use as a hedge against uncertainty and risk. Gold prices rose early this week, while silver prices reached a new record high.   So did the price of copper — which may not be needed for pennies anymore, but which is in high demand for data centers, electric vehicles, and a host of other manufacturing purposes.   \n   Copper is also sometimes seen as an indicator of the nation's shift towards renewable energy — providing a greener contrast to Wall Street's excitement this week over Venezuelan oil.\n",

Johnson is one of many political influencers with close ties to the Trump administration.\n                \n                    Charly Triballeau/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Charly Triballeau/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Less than two weeks since YouTube personality Nick Shirley posted a 42-minute video alleging widespread fraud at Minnesota day care centers run by people of Somali descent, the Trump administration is freezing streams of federal funding — including $10 billion to five Democratic-led states — and has sent 2,000 federal agents to Minnesota to wage an immigration crackdown.   \n   Furthermore, Minnesota's Democratic governor and former vice presidential candidate, Tim Walz, announced Monday he will no longer seek a third term, citing the need to focus on running the state rather than his campaign.   Pro-MAGA influencers on X declared victory as they also shared new, unsubstantiated fraud allegations about other social service providers in both Minnesota and other states.   \n   \"Tim Walz was almost Vice President of the United States,\" wrote Rogan O'Handley, a pro-Trump commentator with more than 2 million followers on X. \"Now he's dropping out of the Governor's race in Minnesota in disgrace. All because a 23-year-old kid with a camera and a thirst for justice exposed billions of his fraud. May @nickshirleyy's work create 1,000 more Nick Shirleys.\"   Shirley himself posted to X on Monday, \"I ENDED TIM WALZ.\"   Shirley's video was amplified by Vice President Vance and has garnered more than 138 million views on X — though his claims about specific day cares and other businesses receiving public funds without providing services remain unsubstantiated. But the swift policy and political repercussions the video helped propel illustrate the symbiotic relationship between online content creators and the Trump administration's policy goals.   Online content that purports to show evidence of a problem, like fraud in a Democratic state, can be harnessed by policymakers to justify policy changes they wanted to pursue, said Kate Starbird, a professor at the University of Washington who studies the spread of online rumors during crises and breaking news events. She said a similar dynamic has played out in the past with content alleging wasteful USAID spending, or posts claiming that diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives are to blame for accidents.   \n   \"They become really effective for driving policy that aligns with where those policy makers want it to go,\" Starbird said. \"Whether that's de-fund social programs in blue states or eliminate DEI initiatives throughout all of the universities, these kinds of dynamics have been very effective for the second Trump administration.\"   One factor is that Trump's Cabinet is made up of people who understand the power of online content because that is the world they came from, said Shannon McGregor, a professor at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who studies the role of social media in politics.   \n   \"There's both people who are and were influencers with cabinet-level positions and other staff positions,\" McGregor said. \"This is sort of all about harnessing the attention economy where attention equals power.\"   McGregor said another time this dynamic has been on display is when Trump-aligned content creators in cities like Portland have made videos presenting anti-ICE protests as violent and disruptive that helped bolster the Trump administration's justification to crack down, including by sending in the National Guard. The White House has given some of these creators special access and invited several, including Shirley, to participate in a roundtable to discuss antifa in October.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Political influencer Nick Shirley speaks at an event at the White House on Oct. 8, 2025. Shirley's viral video alleging fraud at Minnesota day care centers that receive federal funding prompted the Trump administration to halt funding several Democratic-led states.\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Some child care employees featured in Shirley's video have received threatening phone calls or been the targets of vandalism. While Shirley's video appeared to show there were no children present at the day cares he visited, Minnesota state officials from the Department of Children, Youth and Families said they visited nine of the day cares featured in the video and found children at all of them except one, which was not yet open for families. The agency also told media outlets one day care featured in the video had been closed since 2022.   \n   At the same time, other fraud schemes in state social service programs have been well documented. At least 78 people have been criminally charged related to a $250 million scheme involving a COVID-era nutrition program. The majority are from the Somali community, which has a significant presence in the state and is often a target of Trump's ire.   These legitimate fraud cases make it difficult to interpret new unverified claims that have been made by social media influencers. Allegations that are now spreading online could be misinterpreting records or exaggerating minor issues — or could be exposing actual fraudulent activity.   \"It's so hard to fact check the claims that come out in these ways,\" said Starbird. \"And by the time they get fact-checked, the impact of those claims has already happened — people have already made up their minds of what they believe.\"   Content creators have posted videos of themselves in recent days knocking on the doors of what appear to be day cares and home health care businesses in other states, including in Ohio's Somali community. A parody video that purported to show a vacant day care in Los Angeles that received $42 million was also shared online in recent days by some users who did not appear to realize it was satire.   In an appearance on Fox News on Monday night White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt mentioned \"great independent journalists like Nick Shirley\" for helping the Trump administration uncover fraud, before describing the federal response in Minnesota and Trump's belief that Walz is \"criminally liable.\"   The Trump administration indicated this week it is freezing $10 billion in funds for child care centers and cash welfare payments for Minnesota, California, Colorado, Illinois and New York due to fraud suspicions. The freeze followed other announced changes to federal funding for child care centers nationwide.   \"California, under Governor Gavin Newscum, is more corrupt than Minnesota, if that's possible???? The Fraud Investigation of California has begun,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social early Tuesday but did not provide more details.   \n   Just 23 minutes later, pro-Trump podcaster Benny Johnson posted to his 4 million followers on X that he would be heading to California next week to investigate fraud and asked for tips. By Tuesday evening he claimed he had received \"over 1,000 messages from whistleblowers, public officials and State employees exposing California waste, fraud and abuse\" and alleged $250 billion in potential fraud.   \"The pipeline from rumor to policy is now shorter than the time it takes to verify a claim,\" wrote Renée DiResta, a Georgetown University professor who studies how information travels online, in her newsletter. \"That's a remarkable — and dangerous — shift. People have always believed rumors, but now government elites ride them when they provide justification for what they wanted to do anyway.\"\n",

The government planned to send about 2,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and officers to Minnesota, according to a U.S. official and a person briefed on the matter. The agents are expected to be dispatched in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the person said. The people were not authorized to publicly discuss operational details and spoke with The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.   \n   Immigrant rights groups and elected officials in the Twin Cities reported a sharp increase Tuesday in sightings of federal agents, notably around St. Paul. Numerous agents' vehicles were reported making traffic stops, outside area businesses and apartment buildings.   Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was also present and accompanied U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers during at least one arrest. A video posted on X showed Noem wearing a tactical vest and knit cap as agents arrested a man in St. Paul. In the video, she tells the handcuffed man: \"You will be held accountable for your crimes.\"   DHS said in a news release that the man was from Ecuador and was wanted in his homeland and Connecticut on charges including murder and sexual assault. It said agents arrested 150 people Monday in enforcement actions in Minneapolis.   \n   Minnesota governor blasts surge   Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, criticized the federal enforcement surge as \"a war that's being waged against Minnesota.\"   \"You're seeing that we have a ridiculous surge of apparently 2,000 people not coordinating with us, that are for a show of cameras,\" Walz told reporters in Minneapolis on Tuesday, a day after announcing he was ending his campaign for a third term.   Many residents were already on edge. The Trump administration has singled out the area's Somali community, the largest in the U.S. Last month, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara criticized federal agents for using \"questionable methods\" following a confrontation between agents and protesters.   \n   Molly Coleman, a St. Paul City Council member whose district includes a manufacturing plant where agents arrested more than a dozen people in November, said Tuesday was \"unlike any other day we've experienced.\"   \"It's incredibly distressing,\" Coleman said. \"What we know happens when ICE comes into a city, it's an enforcement in which every single person is on guard and afraid.\"   Julia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said there had been an increase in sightings of federal agents and enforcement vehicles in locations like parking lots.   \"We can definitely a feel a heavier presence,\" said Dieu Do, an organizer with the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, which dispatches response teams to reports of agents.   Surge includes investigators focused on fraud allegations   Roughly three-quarters of the enforcement personnel are expected to come from ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations, said the person with knowledge of the operation. The force also includes agents from Homeland Security Investigations, ICE's investigative arm, which typically focuses on fraud and cross-border criminal networks.   \n   HSI agents were going door-to-door in the Twin Cities area investigating allegations of fraud, human smuggling and unlawful employment practices, Lyons said.   The HSI agents are largely expected to concentrate on identifying suspected fraud, while deportation officers will conduct arrests of immigrants accused of violating immigration law, according to the person briefed on the operation. Specialized tactical units are also expected to be involved.   The operation also includes personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, the person familiar with the deployment said. Bovino's tactics during previous federal operations in other cities have drawn scrutiny from local officials and civil rights advocates.   Hilton drops Minnesota hotel that canceled agents' reservations   Hilton said in a statement Tuesday that it was removing a Minnesota hotel from its systems for \"not meeting our standards and values\" when it denied service to federal agents.   \n   The Hampton Inn Lakeville hotel, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) outside Minneapolis, apologized Monday for canceling the reservations of federal agents, saying it would work to accommodate them. The hotel, like the majority of Hampton Inns, is owned and operated by a franchisee.   The Hampton Inn Lakeville did not respond to requests for comment.   Federal authorities began increasing immigration arrests in the Minneapolis area late last year. Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel announced last week that federal agencies were intensifying operations in Minnesota, with an emphasis on fraud investigations.   President Donald Trump has repeatedly linked his administration's immigration crackdown in Minnesota to fraud cases involving federal nutrition and pandemic aid programs, many of which have involved defendants with roots in Somalia.   The person with information about the current operation cautioned that its scope and duration could shift in the coming days as it develops.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Michel Martin speaks to former diplomat Tom Shannon about what the Trump administration is planning next for Venezuela.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  We're going to talk about - more about all of these issues with Ambassador Tom Shannon because he served as a diplomat in Venezuela. He was later ambassador to Brazil. He was also undersecretary of state for political affairs under President Obama and during President Trump's first term. Now he is a senior international policy adviser at the law firm Arnold & Porter, and he was nice enough to come by our studios this morning. Good morning, Ambassador. Thanks for joining us.TOM SHANNON: Hi. Good morning. Delighted to be here.MARTIN: So let me just briefly start with the president's claims to Venezuelan oil. How might exactly the country turn over tens of millions of barrels of oil to the U.S. to then be sold at market price, as the president said is going to happen?SHANNON: It's not clear at this point. He did say that secretary of energy would handle this. The U.S. does purchase oil for our strategic oil reserves, but typically, the United States is not in the business of buying oil, refining it or selling it on a market. So it's not clear if he's going to use private brokers, private refineries, private companies or how this is going to be done, but I'm sure the details are going to emerge in the near term.MARTIN: So let me just talk about some of the things that Franco brought up, which is, first of all, much of the Maduro regime remains in place. As a diplomat, you worked with Maduro. You met the new interim leader, Delcy Rodriguez. First of all, what do you understand the president to mean when he talks about running Venezuela? And how is Delcy Rodriguez likely to react to what the president is saying about what he expects from her?SHANNON: When the president says we're running Venezuela, I don't believe he means we're governing it. I actually think the president wants to avoid the mistakes we made in Iraq and Afghanistan when we took over a country entirely and were responsible for all aspects of the administration of the state.What I think he's trying to say is that we're going to set a direction for it, that we're going to put it on an economic recovery path and that we're going to open up its oil and gas reserves to the world in a way that is consonant with U.S. interests. The challenge that he's going to face, however, is that by removing President Maduro, he did not effect regime change. He effected a leadership change. The Chavista state is still in place, and this is the group that he has chosen to work with.MARTIN: So do we have a sense of what the administration's goals for Venezuela actually are? I mean, is it to restore democracy, or is it to ensure a compliant regime? Because aren't - those aren't the same things. Is it to restore a decent standard of living? - which is one way to curtail this - these immigration flows because that's why so many people are fleeing the country. Or is it to control the oil resources to benefit the U.S. and to end drug trafficking? - as he claims that they are sort of a pivotal part of that. Do we have a sense of what his real priorities are?SHANNON: They're not entirely clear yet, but I think in the short term, he needs a compliant regime. And I think in the long term, he does have in mind some kind of political transition. To what is not clear. How is not clear. And it's not at all clear whether this compliant regime will comply. And this is the challenge that he is going to face because the leadership that has been left behind in Caracas is thoroughly Chavista, thoroughly committed to the vision of Hugo Chavez and Nicolas Maduro.And they believe themselves not only to be radical revolutionaries, but also the last of the South American anti-imperialists. And I have trouble imagining them, whatever concessions they make in the short term, to survive. I have trouble imagining them being our tool in reshaping Venezuela.MARTIN: Do you have a - any sense of why the president is so reluctant to embrace the opposition? There were elections. There is a sense that - this is one of the points that Venezuelans that we've spoken to in recent days have impressed upon us, that unlike Iraq, there were elections. There is an opposition, which is functional, which does seem to have legitimacy. The president seems to be very unwilling to embrace them in any way. Do you have any sense of why that is?SHANNON: I believe that he - I think he understands the importance of the Democratic opposition. I think he understands that Maria Corina Machado and the candidate who supposedly won the 2024 elections, Edmundo Gonzalez, did indeed overwhelmingly win that election and that they do have broad public support.But I think what the president realizes is that, as I noted earlier, the state - in other words, the security forces, the armed forces, the structures of state, the judiciary and beyond - are all Chavista. And I think he's reluctant to try to impose a democratic opposition on a state that has not been deconstructed. But the question is, how do you deconstruct it? And in the process, how do you show a degree of respect for the Venezuelan people? Because at the end of the day, the Venezuelan people are that part of the equation that has been left out.MARTIN: One question I have for you based on your long career at the State Department is given all of the draconian sort of cuts to the State Department and agencies like USAID and to organizations like the National Democratic Institute under this administration, are the resources there, the infrastructure in the United States there, to effectuate and support the kind of transition that the president seems to envision? Because those are the agencies and the people who would carry that out. I mean, when you talk about just providing sort of food assistance and things of that sort, I mean, those are the agencies that would carry that out. So does the infrastructure still exist in this country to support the kind of changes that the president is calling for?SHANNON: The short answer is no. The reality is is that by removing USAID, the United States no longer has neither the personnel nor the structures and systems, nor the capacity to deliver large amounts of development aid and assistance to other countries. And on top of that, we have no embassy in Caracas. We haven't had an embassy since 2019. And we've cut anywhere from a quarter to a third of our professional diplomatic staff around the world. And so we don't have people who could be surged into Venezuela to play a role, and we don't have the means to protect them, even if we could, on the ground.And so in order for the United States to play a role inside of Venezuela, we would have to reopen our embassy, put hundreds, if not thousands, of people on the ground and dedicate resources in a way that we just can't do right now.MARTIN: A lot to talk about here. Just to sort of clarify for folks who may not follow these issues as closely as you have done, you're saying - by Chavista, you mean followers of...SHANNON: Correct.MARTIN: ...Hugo Chavez...SHANNON: Yes, indeed.MARTIN: ...Who was the predecessor to Nicolas Maduro.SHANNON: Exactly.MARTIN: That is Ambassador Tom Shannon, former undersecretary of state for political affairs. He's currently with Arnold & Porter, an international senior adviser there. Thank you so much for coming by and sharing these insights with us.SHANNON: Thank you. A pleasure.MARTIN: I do hope we'll talk again.SHANNON: OK.(SOUNDBITE OF DIRTWIRE'S \"SAILING THE SOLAR FLARES\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Michel Martin asks GOP strategist Ron Bonjean about the Republican Party's legislative priorities and challenges ahead of the midterms.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Let's talk more about what Republicans realistically could accomplish ahead of the midterms in November. We've called Ron Bonjean for that. He's had key positions with Republicans in the Senate and the House. He's now with the communications firm ROKK Solutions. Ron Bonjean, welcome back. Thanks for joining us once again.RON BONJEAN: Hi. Good morning. Thank you.MARTIN: What's your sense of how the president's remarks went over with the caucus?BONJEAN: Well, I'd say that the - I'd say House Republicans wanted to hear President Trump talk about affordability, talk about the economy, talk about how they can get out of the health care - this health care Rubik's cube that they're in right now. They want leadership from the president. You know, they - this is the hard part. One-party rule of Washington is extremely difficult. And we've been through this before a number of times. And President Trump's right that the - during midterm elections, you know, the party in power usually loses the House. And to defy that, they have to be unified. They have to be focused on an agenda connecting with Americans on what they want to hear. So I'm sure some House Republicans were frustrated that they didn't hear about affordability in the economy right away, you know, and they were told that they have to handle the health care issue, when they- I think they need the president to say, here's how you get it done.MARTIN: So the math isn't great for Speaker Mike Johnson. He can only stand to have two defections on a party-line vote if all members are present for legislative priorities. But the question is, you know, are there really any? I mean, the logic of the president's One Big Bill last year was to run the table. They did that. So is health care really what they have to run on? And if so, how is that going to work going forward, since the president doesn't seem to be willing to put forward a bill?BONJEAN: Well, I think you're going to see an agenda coming out of House Republicans and coming out of the retreat. And I do think that the president has another opportunity, especially before the American people with the State of the Union. You know, that will happen, you know, early this year to unveil the agenda. And they have to decide whether or not they want to use the - you know, the approach he used last year for the One Big Beautiful Bill, the reconciliation process and what those priorities would be. Right now, we haven't heard about exactly what Republicans are going to accomplish. We do know that 20 million Americans are going to lose health care coverage with the ending of Obamacare sibsidies.MARTIN: Many of whom are Republicans and key Republican constituencies. I mean, they're entrepreneurs, small business people, farmers. People...BONJEAN: That's exactly right. Many of these are MAGA districts, you know, but you do have committee chairmen who do - are working on pieces of legislation that they need to start talking about and that the president needs to take the leadership and talk about the agenda, and here's what we're going to be doing - not only about the successes they did through the One Big Beautiful Bill, but here's the plan going forward on how to make your lives better - American lives better - and more - you know, more affordable for their bottom line.MARTIN: Let me run two more questions by you before we go. Trump - the president encouraged Republicans to be, quote, \"flexible\" on abortion restrictions in order to get a health care bill passed. That's a nonstarter for many Republicans. Is that possible? Is there a compromise possible, in your opinion?BONJEAN: I think that it's going - that's threading a needle that's very difficult. That's a very small needle to thread. And is it possible? Yeah. I would - I'd say it's possible, not impossible. Going to be very, very difficult. But right now, when you're facing, you know, the prospect of lots and lots of real hardship stories, the pressure is really on these folks to come through.MARTIN: So let's talk about Venezuela in the minute we have left. The administration's seizure of Venezuela's president, Trump's remarks about running the country - unpopular among many America First Republicans, or so - you know, self-described America First Republicans. What are you hearing from the rest of the conference, whatever they're saying publicly? What do you hear about their understanding of this and how this is playing with them?BONJEAN: Yeah. I'd say most Republicans think, OK, good, Maduro is a bad guy. We're glad he's out. But now what's the plan? And many Senate Republicans are waiting to comment, for example, because they're going to be hearing from the administration in a briefing today on - and taking - you know, and answering questions about the path forward in Venezuela. We do know that President Trump just talked about giving - you know, getting 30 to 50 million barrels of oil, which is a couple of billion dollars, which is - that's, you know, good news. But they want to hear what's the plan forward with Venezuela.MARTIN: That is Republican strategist Ron Bonjean. Ron, thanks so much for joining us once again.BONJEAN: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      In a meeting with House Republicans Tuesday, President Trump tried to offer his party a \"roadmap\" to maintain their congressional majorities in the midterms.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  There is something that Donald Trump can't quite wrap his head around.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But I wish you could explain to me what the hell's going on with the mind of the public because we have the right policy.MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  That was the president speaking to House Republicans on Tuesday about the possibility of losing the House in this year's midterm elections. He was trying to offer his party a road map to win, as he called it.FADEL: So was he successful? NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro watched the speech, and he joins me now. Domenico, good morning.DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning.FADEL: So what are the headwinds Republicans are facing at the start of this year?MONTANARO: Yeah. I mean, never mind the headline-changing action in Venezuela. You know, right at the beginning of his speech yesterday, Trump acknowledged the vulnerable position that he and his party are in simply because of history.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: We won everything. But they say that when you win the presidency, you lose the midterm.MONTANARO: And it's true that midterms are hard on a president's party. You know, on average, they lose more than two dozen seats, and it's worse when a president's approval rating is below 50%.FADEL: Right. And we know Trump's approval rating - certainly, it's been below 50% for a while.MONTANARO: Yeah. And he's facing his lowest approval ratings of his second term, and it's been in large measure because of the cost of living.FADEL: Yeah.MONTANARO: But Trump didn't offer much yesterday in his speech on that. In fact, it took him 48 minutes before he even started talking about the economy at all. And when he did, it was about the stock market being at historic highs, and he touted his tariffs, which have actively raised prices on many things. And people have been telling pollsters for months that they feel Trump's policies have made the economy worse.FADEL: So if he didn't talk about strategy on prices, what did he talk about?MONTANARO: I mean, it's culture issues mostly. That's, you know, hardly unusual for Trump. He's always - seems to be weaving back to that, as he calls it. He said being against transgender athletes in sports is such a winning issue that he'd save it for the week before the election. He did an imitation of a woman lifting weights, one he said that his own wife doesn't like. She says it's not presidential, but he went on to do it anyway. He talked about pushing for voter ID laws, immigration and crime, which in his mind are all related, he said, and his attempts at lowering drug prices on weight loss drugs, which he referred to as fat drugs. And he complained a lot about how he doesn't get the credit he feels he deserves. And he lamented at one point, what have you done for me lately? - is the way you have to run your life nowadays.FADEL: Now, Trump was speaking on the same day that Republican Congressman Doug LaMalfa of California died. He was 65. Republicans already had a historically small majority. Will it be even harder now for Republicans to pass legislation?MONTANARO: Well, it would if there was a clear legislative agenda from Republicans in Congress, but there really isn't one right now. And a lot of those culture issues are things that Trump has gone around Congress on using executive powers. Now, one area where they could do something would be on health care. Here's what Trump said about that.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: You can own health care. Let - figure it out. Let the money go directly to the people.FADEL: OK. Own health care. How feasible is that?MONTANARO: Well, Republicans, as we know, have had a long time to, quote, \"figure it out\" - more than a decade - and they haven't been able to, and they've been against extending Affordable Care Act subsidies. But it's one thing to campaign on a slogan like, let the money go to the people. It's very different to be president and to try to legislate on it. So if you're a Republican in a swing district, when the ACA is about as popular as it's ever been, you got to be scratching your head wondering, what is the strategy?FADEL: NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Thank you, Domenico.MONTANARO: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

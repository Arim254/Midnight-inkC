And it is a lot more than the administration has signaled it wants to spend. NPR's Fatma Tanis reports.FATMA TANIS, BYLINE: Congress is allocating $50 billion for foreign aid in the spending package. It includes some military aid to Egypt and Israel and funding for initiatives aimed at supporting democracy and health programs around the world. Last year, the administration dismantled much of America's foreign aid systems and sent back billions of dollars that Congress had earmarked for foreign aid in 2025. Those moves were largely approved by a Republican-led Congress, but this bill appears to signal a change of heart, says foreign aid expert Jonathan Katz.JONATHAN KATZ: The surprising factor is that you see Congress saying, we want to fund foreign assistance, from global health to food security to even democracy support.TANIS: Katz is with the Brookings Institution. He worked in foreign aid during the Obama administration. He says there's been concern from both sides of the aisle over how the reduction in funding last year impacted global health and humanitarian assistance. Many people lost access to clinics and medicine and food. And, Katz says, there's fear that this reduction in American aid could also lead to the U.S. losing influence around the world.KATZ: I think there's a bit of buyer's remorse when it comes to U.S. engagement globally - meaning the soft power withdrawal of the United States that President Trump's policies have been leading to.TANIS: But others in the foreign aid community wanted to see a Congress that's more aligned with the administration on foreign aid. The State Department's new strategy focuses on making one-on-one deals with low-income countries, investing in their health ministries and requiring those governments to chip in too. Max Primorac is an analyst with The Heritage Foundation. He previously held senior roles at USAID and thinks Congress has allocated too much overall.MAX PRIMORAC: It's always the problem of overfunding.TANIS: Primorac says he approves the lack of funding in the bill for programs that support gender equality, LGBTQ issues and climate solutions, which are in line with the Trump administration's views. But, he says, there was one surprise - $9.4 billion for programs aimed at curbing diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria and addressing maternal and child health and other issues. The global health bucket is largely similar to funding levels from previous years.PRIMORAC: It's too much money, and keeping alive an industry, quite frankly, that has been living off of the taxpayer money for far too long.TANIS: He says aid groups spend too much taxpayer money on overhead costs rather than actual health issues. Instead, he says, the administration's new strategy encourages self-sufficiency in low-income countries.PRIMORAC: My concern there is that it could actually upend the reforms of this administration by creating disincentives for these African states to take more financial ownership and therefore more responsibility if they see that this money has to be spent anyway.TANIS: The package is expected to be signed if and when it lands on the president's desk, but both Katz and Primorac agree that the administration could ask Congress to take back the funds like it did last year.Fatma Tanis, NPR News.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

The county said the search warrant served by the FBI was for records related to the 2020 election.    The FBI would only say it was executing a \"court authorized law enforcement action,\" but last month the Department of Justice announced it's suing Fulton County for records related to the 2020 election.   President Trump narrowly lost Georgia's 2020 presidential race by just under 12,000 votes and has repeatedly pushed baseless claims about how the state's election was conducted.   In its complaint against Fulton County, the DOJ cited efforts by the Georgia State Election Board to obtain 2020 election materials from the county.    \n   On Oct. 30, 2025, the complaint says, the U.S. attorney general sent a letter to the Fulton County Board of Registration and Elections \"demanding 'all records in your possession responsive to the recent subpoena issued to your office by the State Election Board.' \"   A Fulton County judge has denied a request by the county to block that subpoena.   Since the 2020 election, Fulton County has been at the center of baseless claims of election fraud by Trump and others.   Last week, while speaking at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, Trump said that \"people will soon be prosecuted for what they did,\" regarding the 2020 election.   In November the sweeping election interference case against Trump and allies was dismissed by a Fulton County judge.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Michel Martin talks to former Homeland Secretary Jeh Johnson about DHS Secretary Kristi Noem's culpability in the deadly shootings by federal agents.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  We wanted to hear another perspective on how DHS operates or could operate with someone with deep knowledge. That's Jeh Johnson. He served as secretary of Homeland Security in the Obama administration, and he's with us now. Good morning, Mr. Secretary. Thanks so much for joining us.JEH JOHNSON: Good morning, and thank you for having me.MARTIN: So the first thing I just wanted to ask you, as a person who led that department - when you watch the many videos of immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota, but also elsewhere, what do you see?JOHNSON: Frankly, I see a force that I used to lead that is now ill-trained, hot-tempered, undisciplined, that has lost its way. The Department of Homeland Security was created, as you know, in the wake of 9/11 to keep Americans safe from the videos. And videos don't always accurately portray what is going on in its entirety in a community. But what I see - what appears to be the case - is thousands of DHS personnel as an occupying force in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. And when you put such a large force like that in military-like apparel, masked, there are bound to be confrontations. It's bound to inflame people, agitate people, and it's tragic. Renee Good and Alex Pretti did not have to die, but it's almost inevitable in these kinds of circumstances.MARTIN: So let's dig into a couple of things that you've said here. I want to remind people, though - the Obama administration deported more than 3 million people across both his terms, more than...JOHNSON: Yes.MARTIN: ...Any other president in U.S. history. There were people who objected. There were people who criticized loudly. And yet those actions didn't trigger the kind of chaos and deadly shootings by...JOHNSON: Right.MARTIN: ...Federal agents like we've seen in Minneapolis today. What was different?JOHNSON: So an effective immigration enforcement policy - and I'm not saying we had it perfect in the Obama administration, but there are dual, seemingly conflicting objectives. One is a secure border. Americans want a secure border. If you go to Laredo, Texas, which is, like, 80% Mexican American, they want a secure border, and I believe Americans are entitled to a secure border. My second year in office as secretary, we had one of the lowest numbers of illegal border crossings in, like, 20 years. So a secure border is one objective. Another objective is, focus on the criminals who are undocumented for reasons of public safety while trying to treat, in a fair and humane manner, those who have been here for 20 years undocumented, committed no crimes, want to get on the books, want to be accountable. Give them an opportunity. So President Obama created DACA in 2012 for childhood arrivals, as you may recall.And so those are twin objectives, seemingly in conflict, but that has to be the overall goal of an effective immigration policy. And what I used to say to our enforcement and removal operations personnel, Tom Homan included, is when you're out on the streets in a big city like Minneapolis or Chicago or New York, use your common sense. One notorious incident - dragging a grandmother off a church steps or pulling a kid out of school - can derail your entire mission in a community by agitating the population there. And we're - unfortunately, we're seeing that in spades right now in Minneapolis.MARTIN: To that end, you presided over DHS after a big hiring surge for Border Patrol officers. So you mentioned training. Is this about training and onboarding, or is this about the political leadership and the direction that they've been given?JOHNSON: I suspect it's all of the above. You know, across law enforcement, Michel, whether it's Border Patrol, ICE, the FBI, New York City Police Department, there has to be training in tactics of de-escalation - learning how to de-escalate a conflict rather than see it escalate into something lethal. You know, Renee Good died over how she parked her car on a street. George Floyd, six years ago, died over an argument that began with a counterfeit $20 bill. Eric Garner in New York City, 2014, died through a chokehold in an argument that started over a carton of cigarettes. So tactics in de-escalation are so important - to de-escalate a situation, let tempers lower before an unnecessary death occurs.There's been a surge in hiring lately at DHS among ICE personnel, CBP. And I worry that in the effort to plus up, we may not be adequately training new people who are coming on board to learn how to be effective law enforcement officers.MARTIN: You worked with Tom Homan when you were leading DHS. Will sending Homan to Minnesota make a difference there?JOHNSON: I believe that it will. I - my educated speculation is that the president sent him there to try to calm things down. I worked with Tom when he was head of enforcement and removal operations at ICE during the Obama administration. He was a career senior civil servant at the time. And without a doubt, Tom's pro-enforcement. But, you know, to come at an effective immigration policy, I also had the benefit of people who reflected the activist point of view from the left at my conference table. And so you really do have to be able to balance all sides and hear all sides in this very, very difficult, sensitive issue.MARTIN: That is Jeh Johnson. He was Homeland Security secretary in the Obama administration. Mr. Johnson, thanks so much for sharing these insights with us.JOHNSON: Thank you.MARTIN: I do want to mention that we have asked current DHS and White House officials to join us for an interview. We've repeatedly asked, and those invitations remain open.(SOUNDBITE OF DIRTY THREE'S \"SIRENA\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      The capture of Nicolás Maduro has fueled questions about the future of U.S. policy in Venezuela. For Secretary of State Marco Rubio, it was part of a years-long push for change in South America.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Secretary of State Marco Rubio is testifying before Congress today. It's the first time he's appeared since the United States grabbed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. Senate Foreign Relations Committee members have questions. And a lot of Rubio's career has led up to this moment. Here's NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales.CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Secretary of State Marco Rubio has long argued for an aggressive U.S. role in the western hemisphere. That includes his earliest days in 2011 as senator from Florida, when Venezuela was run by former President Hugo Chavez.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARCO RUBIO: Venezuela, who today is governed by a clown...GRISALES: That continued with the failed 2019 uprising challenging the man who succeeded Chavez, Nicolás Maduro. During the first Trump administration, Rubio had the president's ear on the regime's abuses. Here's Rubio talking to NPR at that time.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)RUBIO: The bottom line is Venezuela's tragedy can no longer be ignored. It is destabilizing the entire region.GRISALES: Now as secretary of state, Rubio played a central role pivoting U.S. attention to the Western Hemisphere. Following Maduro's arrest, he was front and center in defending the mission. Here's Rubio on NBC's \"Meet The Press\" earlier this month, just after the dictator's capture.(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MEET THE PRESS\")RUBIO: This is the Western Hemisphere. This is where we live. And we're not going to allow the Western Hemisphere to be a base of operation for adversaries, competitors and rivals of the United States.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: As...GRISALES: The issue is personal for the Cuban American, who's taken aim at the dictatorship that took hold of his family's homeland. Rubio argues the Cuban government has provided the match that's helped light Venezuela's authoritarian regime, with protection for Maduro in exchange for discounted oil. Mario Diaz-Balart, a fellow Cuban American and House Republican from Florida, says the new focus provides long-awaited protection for the American people.MARIO DIAZ-BALART: The president said it. The secretary of state said it. And the secretary of war said it. We are going to take out these narco-terrorists who are responsible for the poisoning of hundreds of thousands of Americans.GRISALES: For a time, Rubio won praise from Senate Democrats, who unanimously confirmed him to be secretary of state. But in the wake of the Venezuela mission, that shifted. Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine explains why.TIM KAINE: And I knew when I voted for Rubio, with Rubio as secretary of state, we would finally pay attention to the Americas. Now, I think this is the wrong way to do it.GRISALES: Kaine is referring to the administration's decision to take military action in Venezuela without authorization from Congress. Earlier this month, Senate Republicans blocked Kaine's bill to limit the president's war powers in Venezuela. Republicans like Indiana Senator Todd Young credited Rubio with assuaging his concerns and securing key commitments from the Trump administration.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TODD YOUNG: If President Trump were to determine American forces were needed in any major military operations in Venezuela, the administration would come to Congress in advance.GRISALES: Rubio's approach has spurred President Trump to hand him an even longer list of duties. In addition to secretary of state, Rubio is also the acting national security adviser, national archivist, most recently chair of the U.S. bid to host the World Expo in 2035. His growing portfolio is a measure of Trump's confidence, a point the president underscored at the Davos World Economic Forum.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He's going to go down as the best secretary of state.GRISALES: Whether that prediction holds true may be decided by what happens in Venezuela in the months and years ahead.GRISALES: Claudia Grisales, NPR News, the Capitol.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

    "body": "\n      President Trump went to Iowa Tuesday, looking to change the subject to his economic agenda as his administration faces growing backlash over his immigration crackdown in Minnesota.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  President Trump spoke last night in Des Moines. It's the start of an election campaign that's more than nine months away.MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Iowa Republicans are defending an open Senate seat and other positions in a state they normally would expect to win without much effort. 2026 is shaping up to be a year that takes effort. The president wanted to focus on a top voter concern, the economy. He's distracted from it by attacking Venezuela, trying to take over Greenland and an aggressive mass deportation campaign that has horrified many voters, especially after federal agents killed two people, all of that this month.INSKEEP: Whew. That's a lot. NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben is here to tell us what he said to move back to the economy. Danielle, good morning.DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning.INSKEEP: Was the president able to focus?KURTZLEBEN: For the most part, yeah. I mean, you really got the feeling that he was trying to talk about something new after federal officers, like you said, shot and killed those two people in Minneapolis. Trump's tone last night was pretty typical for him. He was just trying to sell the economy as megastrong.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Just after one year of President Trump, our economy is booming, incomes are rising, investment is soaring, inflation has been defeated. Our border is closed. Totally closed.KURTZLEBEN: But data contradicts Trump's message here. I mean, inflation has cooled, but it's still elevated, and the job market appears to be slowing. And importantly, Americans don't feel that the economy is doing well. Trump's approval on the economy is double-digit negative right now. Now, all of that said, Trump brought in a lot of his usual attacks, including, as he often does, mocking Minnesota Democratic representative Ilhan Omar. Now, notably last night, someone in her town hall in Minnesota confronted and apparently sprayed her with something before getting tackled by security.INSKEEP: Yeah. I guess we'll just note that she seemed to be OK and continued the speech - insisted on continuing her speech. Now, Michel told us why Iowa is politically important, but let's mention why it might be politically vulnerable for Republicans. It's a rural state. Lots of farmers hurt by Trump's tariffs. How did he try to sell those tariffs?KURTZLEBEN: Well, he used his usual tariff arguments. He said the tariffs will drive new investment and that he's using the tariffs to strong-arm other countries on things like pharmaceutical prices. All that said, Trump did try another avenue of farmer outreach we really haven't heard him do much. He said he'd push Congress harder to loosen environmental restrictions on the sale of E15, which is a high ethanol blend of gasoline. But ultimately, Iowa farmers still know that tariffs have driven up the price of machinery and hurt soybean sales to China.INSKEEP: Danielle, you mentioned that Minneapolis didn't come up, but did we learn anything more yesterday about what Trump is doing there?KURTZLEBEN: Yeah. I mean, just before the speech, he did an interview with Fox News' Will Cain, in which Cain asked Trump whether removing Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino from Minneapolis constitutes a pullback. Here's how Trump responded.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: I don't think it's a pullback. It's a little bit of a change. Everybody in this room that has a business, you know, you make little changes. You know, Bovino's very good, but he's a pretty out there kind of a guy, and in some cases, that's good. Maybe it wasn't good here.KURTZLEBEN: So in other words, he's really just trying to brush all of this aside.INSKEEP: How much does the economy really matter to voters?KURTZLEBEN: Well, right now, it's a case of everything and. I mean, plenty of people have feelings about Greenland right now, Minneapolis and the price of milk all at the same time. Now, come the midterms, yeah, the economy will matter, but it's hard to separate out what one issue is driving an election. People vote based on feelings. Do they feel safe? Does the government care about them? So Trump won't be on the ballot, but his approval is negative, and his party pretty much does his bidding at this point. So his continuing choices are going to really matter.INSKEEP: We make a choice to listen to NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. Thanks so much.KURTZLEBEN: (Laughter) Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Juana Summers speaks with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., on recent developments around the federal immigration enforcement surge in her home state.   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED for NPR News. I'm Mary Louise Kelly in Washington.JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  And I'm Juana Summers in Minneapolis, where a memorial has sprung up for Alex Pretti, the 37-year-old protester killed by federal immigration agents on Saturday.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Vocalizing)SUMMERS: Last night, with temperatures around zero, people stood in an oval surrounding it, some offering cups of tea or hand warmers. There were flowers, candles and signs. One reads, you can't break us. Another reads, ICE will melt - spring will come. Pretti's killing and the shooting death of Renee Macklin Good by ICE officers have shocked the city and the country.The Trump administration has replaced the leadership of its Minneapolis operation with border czar Tom Homan. But criticism of the federal government's immigration enforcement surge, which continue over the objections of state and local authorities, has hardly stopped. For more, we've reached Senator Amy Klobuchar. She's one of two Democrats who represent Minnesota in the U.S. Senate. Welcome back to the program.AMY KLOBUCHAR: Thank you, Juana. It's wonderful to be on again.SUMMERS: It's great to talk with you. And there's a lot I want to get to, but I do want to start with this. There was an incident that happened last night in Minneapolis where your colleague, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, was rushed by a man during a town hall event Tuesday night and sprayed with liquid via syringe. She's posted on her social media and said that she's OK. I wonder, what's your reaction to this? And does it raise security concerns for you?KLOBUCHAR: My first reaction was, is Ilhan OK? And I actually talked to her about an hour after the town hall ended. And she was in good spirits, as good as she can be. And I think one of the things that was kind of extraordinary is she continued on with the town hall. The security was there. They had used wanding to make sure there were no weapons when people had come into the meeting. So under most accounts, for most members, you would think that was good enough. One of the things that happened here, which doesn't always happen, is there was widespread condemnation of this, including from the Republican Party of Minnesota that said these attacks had no place in our politics. And, of course, the Democratic Party.SUMMERS: Shifting gears a bit. Your state's governor, Tim Walz, and Minneapolis' mayor, Jacob Frey, have each met now with Tom Homan, who President Trump has dispatched to aid ICE operations here in Minnesota. And for his part, Mayor Frey characterized this as a productive conversation. But in a social media post, he did add that his main goal was for the federal government to end the operation here as quickly as possible. Senator, have you been in touch with Tom Homan or the White House recently about the operation here?KLOBUCHAR: Well, I will be talking with him soon. But I've been mainly focused on working with the White House, really over the last few weeks. I actually last week told them, high-ranking officials there, that someone else would be killed because of this operation. There are 3,000 ICE officers still in our state. And I am glad that the Border Patrol people have been pulled out, or at least a big chunk of them. But there are still ICE officers there. And you just can't have a situation where you have ICE officers that are overwhelming local police. Eleven hundred sworn police officers - Minneapolis, St. Paul, - 3,000 ICE officers. It's even more than the 10 metropolitan police offices combined. That means all these suburbs.And our police chiefs have been clear statewide, nationally that this isn't making Minnesota or other states safer. It's making them less safe. I believe that they need to get ICE out of Minnesota. The original idea that they were going to assist with fraud investigations? Great. But this has gone way beyond that. That they would be focused on apprehending violent offenders, that's worthy.SUMMERS: I just - if I can, Senator.KLOBUCHAR: Go ahead.SUMMERS: I want to put to you what President Trump said yesterday. He signaled that he wanted to de-escalate the crackdown in your state. But later on, he described people arrested by ICE in Minnesota here as, quote, \"hardened, vicious, horrible criminals.\" What is your response to his rhetoric?KLOBUCHAR: We know from reporting from The Wall Street Journal that about 4% of people that have been arrested nationally are what they call the worst of the worst. But what we've seen - and I'm sure there are some in Minnesota. I know there are, and that's fine, but that's not what's going on here. In fact, they've been picking up 2-year-olds, sending them to Texas. My office had to work on this case and got a successful result. And then we got this 2-year-old back to her mom.Hmong elders who are pulled out of their house by mistake in their underwear, 5-year-olds, schoolkids, teachers being chased in parking lots, legal citizens repeatedly. Our office is handling over 400 cases. So that is why right now in Congress, we are focused on getting this agency overhauled. They already have way too much money. They were given $75 billion from the Republican bill. They're bigger than the FBI.SUMMERS: That's in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.KLOBUCHAR: Yes.SUMMERS: So I have a question there about this funding issue, though. Given the fact that a huge increase in ICE funding that you mentioned already passed in that bill, what would limiting these appropriations actually effectively do to put pressure on DHS in the near term? I understand that Friday is the deadline to avoid another partial government shutdown.KLOBUCHAR: I am opposed, as are so many of my Democratic colleagues, to this budget that has been proposed for ICE. There is also a major effort underway to use the power of our votes to overhaul ICE. And I'll just give you some ideas. Stopping the surge, getting ICE out of Minnesota and other places. The training that has been reduced to 47 days, for the 47th president, when it should be months and months of training. Getting rid of these masks, and in fact, requiring mandatory body cameras.Ending the bounty system, which has resulted in them picking people up, sending them to detention and releasing them because they still get a bounty. Breaking into someone's home without a judicial warrant. Changing the leadership. I mean, that's just a few ideas here, because we all know your eyes don't lie when you see the video of the killing of Alex. You see what actually happened. So I think, having talked to Alex's parents, the rhetoric used by the administration calling him a domestic terrorist, calling him a would-be assassin has been the most hurtful thing to their family.SUMMERS: I just want to press you again on this issue of funding.KLOBUCHAR: Sure.SUMMERS: Are you and your fellow Senate Democrats willing to shut down the government over the issue of funding for the Department of Homeland Security?KLOBUCHAR: So here's what we want to see happen. There's a number of bills, five bills that have strong bipartisan support for different agencies that can be approved. Separate out Homeland Security, which includes ICE, and then make these necessary forms to ICE. So we are united on that. And I think the better question is, are Republicans willing to come to the table for once to actually talk about the changes that they know in their heart need to be made. If they believe in liberty and the Constitution - if they believe in the First Amendment right to assembly, the Fourth Amendment protection against search and seizure, the Second Amendment right to bear arms, the Fifth Amendment right to due process - then they should be standing with us.SUMMERS: Senator, have you heard that willingness from your Republican colleagues? Do they seem prepared to come to the table on this issue of reforming ICE, as you say, or to stop funding for ICE?KLOBUCHAR: They have been talking with us in small groups, one on one. And I think there is some interest. And so they're going to have to understand that Democrats are insisting on this. And that's what's happening right now.SUMMERS: Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat from Minnesota. Thank you so much.KLOBUCHAR: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Kennedy Jr. and Administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Mehmet Oz look on during a rural health roundtable on January 16, 2026 in Washington, DC.\n                \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   A nationwide experiment to give health care in rural America a $50 billion makeover is underway.   The Trump administration, in a late December announcement, revealed how much each state will get under an ambitious 5-year initiative known as the Rural Health Transformation Program.   \"This is a massive effort to change an unfortunate reality that has occurred to rural health care in America,\" Dr. Mehmet Oz, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told reporters as the awards went out, \"which is that your zip code has started to predict your life expectancy.\"   Research shows people are more likely to die younger in rural communities compared to cities, and the disparity has grown over the last three decades.   \n   Congress created this new pot of money last summer. States were given just 52 days to pull together applications and outline how they would use the funding to improve outcomes, grow the rural health care workforce and drive innovation.   Each state is guaranteed $100 million a year over the next five years. The rest of the money was awarded based on a series of factors — including how rural a state is, what states propose to do with the money and whether the states adopt policies aligned with the administration's Make America Healthy Again priorities.   There's bipartisan excitement about rural health finally getting some attention and investment. Democrats and many health policy experts argue, however, that this temporary $50 billion infusion pales in comparison to the roughly $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and Obamacare, also passed by Congress last year.   \"There's a lot of great things in these proposals,\" said Kevin Bennett, director of the Center for Rural and Primary Healthcare at the University of South Carolina. \"But I think if we really wanted to transform [rural health care], they would have gone a lot further.\"   Bennett spoke on a panel about the new funding co-hosted by the health policy news organization Tradeoffs and the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics at the University of Pennsylvania.   \n   Here are a few other key things to know about the Rural Health Transformation Program:   Why was the Rural Health Transformation Program created?   Congress added the rural funding to President Trump's massive tax and spending bill — sometimes called the Big Beautiful Bill — passed by Republicans last July. At the last minute, Congress doubled the funds for the program from $25 billion to $50 billion.   The new funding was included in part to satisfy some Republicans lawmakers who feared that major cuts to federal Medicaid funding would threaten the viability of rural hospitals. Nearly 200 rural hospitals have closed since 2005, and another 432 are vulnerable to closure, according to a recent report.   But the Trump administration pushed states to think more broadly about rural health, telling them they can only use up to 15% of this new funding for direct payments to providers.   \"The purpose of this fund is not to pay operating expenses,\" Oz told reporters in December. \"The purpose of this $50 billion investment is to allow us to right-size the system and to deal with the fundamental hindrances of improvement in rural health care.\"   How much money did each state receive?   Awards for the first year range from New Jersey's $147 million to $281 million for Texas.   Large rural states like Texas, Alaska, California and Montana got the most money, but according to an analysis from the health policy research group KFF, some small states like New Jersey, Rhode Island and Massachusetts got significantly more per rural resident.   Paula Chatterjee, a physician and researcher at the University of Pennsylvania did an analysis ahead of the awards being announced that found what she called a \"mismatch\" in how funds were targeted compared to where the greatest rural patient needs are.   \"If you look at where funding per rural resident is going under this program, it's not going to states that have the highest rural mortality rates,\" Chatterjee said at the recent panel. \"It's not going to states that are projected to have the greatest reductions in federal Medicaid spending. It's not going to places that are losing the most hospital beds.\"   \n   How do states plan to use this funding?    A number of states went after the new money to fund more telehealth, deploy artificial intelligence and expand the rural health care workforce.   States took on workforce shortages from many angles. Delaware asked for money to launch a new medical school. Alaska plans to spend funds on housing and child care for its health care workers. California wants to invest in a workforce mapping and planning tool. Many states said they would create more residency and fellowships for doctors and make it easier for nurses, pharmacists and other health workers to do more.   \"A lot of the workforce proposals in these are tried and true methods,\" Bennett said. \"Pipeline development, incentive programs, loan repayment, all of those sorts of things we know can be effective.\"   Will new rural funding make up for expected federal Medicaid cuts?    The same legislation that created the Rural Health Transformation Program also cut federal Medicaid spending by nearly $1 trillion over the next decade. A KFF analysis estimates that $137 billion of those cuts will hit rural areas — nearly triple the amount of the new rural health fund.   Rural health advocates say the looming cuts will leave hospitals struggling to survive, making it difficult to fully take advantage of the rural funding opportunity.   \"It's really hard to think about transformation if you're trying to keep your doors open and employees employed and patients served,\" Bennett said.   What happens next?   CMS launched an Office of Rural Health Transformation, which will oversee the program and offer support to states, according to federal health officials. Most states are planning to have their health departments or Medicaid offices manage their new initiatives.   States are expected to start work on their implementation immediately, with awards for 2027 due to be announced in October 2026.   Some of the money comes with strings. States could get bigger awards by promising to adopt health policies highlighted by the administration in its call for proposals.. But if states fail to pass those policies, they will receive less money in future years and could be forced to repay funds they already received.   \n   According to federal health officials, 24 states promised to reinstate the Presidential Fitness Test in schools; thirty-three states said they already have or would add restrictions to their food assistance programs to make it harder for people to buy soda and other unhealthy items; and 18 states got points for repealing or limiting certificate of need laws, which require health care providers to prove to state regulators that new services or facilities are needed before they can open up shop.   Oz said he sees this as a tool for governors to push policies through potentially uncooperative legislatures.   \"This is not a threat,\" Oz said. \"This is actually an empowering element of the One Big Beautiful Bill.\"\n",

Scott Applewhite/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Secretary of State Marco Rubio faced intense scrutiny in a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Wednesday over the Trump administration's military operation that ousted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, as lawmakers pressed for clarity on what comes next for the South American country and for U.S. involvement in the region.   In his opening remarks, Rubio rejected claims that the United States is at war with Venezuela, insisting the operation was a limited law-enforcement mission rather than a military occupation.   \"There is no war against Venezuela, and we did not occupy a country. There are no U.S. troops on the ground,\" Rubio said, framing the mission as a targeted law enforcement action rather than a military occupation.   \n   Republicans on the committee largely praised the administration's actions. Committee Chairman Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, called the mission an \"incredibly brief, targeted and successful raid,\" noting it resulted in no American casualties.   \n   But Democrats sharply criticized the cost and consequences of the operation. Ranking committee member Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H.,  questioned whether removing Maduro was worth the financial and political fallout, citing estimates that the raid and U.S. naval blockade could cost taxpayers up to $1 billion.   \"The U.S. naval blockade around Venezuela and the raid have already cost American taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars,\" Shaheen said. \"And yet the Maduro regime is essentially still in power — all the same people are running the country.\"   Shaheen and other Democrats also raised concerns about Venezuela's interim leader, former Vice President Delcy Rodríguez, arguing she has taken no meaningful steps to reduce Iranian, Chinese or Russian influence in the country. Some senators accused the administration of replacing one authoritarian figure with another.   \"The [Drug Enforcement Administration] has reportedly identified Delcy Rodríguez as a significant actor in the drug trade,\" Shaheen pressed.   Rubio responded that Rodríguez has not been indicted like Maduro and said Washington's immediate priority is stability — even if it requires working with leaders the U.S. does not fully trust.   \n   \"We are dealing with individuals that in our system would not be acceptable in the long term,\" Rubio acknowledged. \"But we are in a transition to stabilization phase. You have to work with the people currently in charge of the elements of government.\"   Lawmakers also questioned financial arrangements tied to Venezuela's oil sector, including reports that the U.S. granted no-bid licenses to two companies — one reportedly tied to a major Trump donor — to sell Venezuelan oil. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said the optics \"reek\" to many Americans.   \n   Rubio defended the move as a temporary measure, arguing Venezuela was running out of oil storage capacity.   \"We had to move that oil very quickly,\" he said. \"The long-term plan is not those two trading companies. The long-term plan is for Venezuela to have a normal energy program that sells directly into the market.\"   The secretary of state also defended the ongoing U.S. naval blockade, describing it as a \"quarantine\" rather than a military escalation. He said Venezuela's current leaders are cooperating with U.S. authorities by helping identify ships suspected of sanctions violations.   While most Republicans backed the administration's strategy, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., raised concerns about the legality of the operation and the precedent it sets. Rubio maintained the raid was lawful and necessary to disrupt what he called a \"criminal state.\"   Rubio warned that U.S. patience is not unlimited, signaling a willingness to escalate if cooperation breaks down.   \"Make no mistake,\" he said. \"We are prepared to use force to ensure maximum cooperation if other methods fail.\"   Throughout the hearing, senators repeatedly pressed Rubio on how success would be measured and how — or when — Venezuela would transition to democracy.   \"This is not a frozen dinner,\" Rubio told the committee. \"You don't put it in a microwave and 2 1/2 minutes later it's ready. These are complex things.\"   \n   The hearing marks Rubio's highest-profile test so far on Venezuela policy, as lawmakers from both parties demand clearer benchmarks, greater transparency, and a defined long-term strategy for U.S. involvement in the country.\n",

    "body": "\n    DAVE DAVIES, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies. Much of the country this week has experienced heavy snow, sleet and ice, and some regions will contend with subfreezing temperatures for many days to come. Scientists say extreme weather events have become more frequent and punishing with global climate change, so we thought this would be a good time to take stock of how U.S. policy on climate issues has changed under the second Donald Trump administration. Trump is a longtime climate change skeptic, known to refer to global warming at times as a hoax or a con job. His administration has moved aggressively to reverse the Biden administration's climate policies on many fronts.Our guest today is David Gelles, a reporter on The New York Times climate team who leads the paper's Climate Forward newsletter. Before joining the climate team, Gelles spent eight years as a business reporter at the Times, covering chief executives, tech, media, Wall Street and other issues. Gelles has written three books, including \"The Man Who Broke Capitalism,\" about influential corporate executive Jack Welch, and most recently, \"Dirtbag Billionaire,\" published last fall about Yvon Chouinard, founder of the firm Patagonia. David Gelles has just returned from the World Economic Forum at Davos, where he spoke to leaders of business and government about climate policy and other issues. We recorded our conversation yesterday.David Gelles, welcome back to FRESH AIR.DAVID GELLES: Thanks for having me.DAVIES: I wonder what, if anything, you heard when you were in Davos from corporate leaders or government officials regarding the events in Minnesota, where, you know, a second person was fatally shot by federal agents last week.GELLES: What's happening in Minnesota and more broadly in our country right now was impossible to ignore, even though I was in Davos and I was speaking with leaders and executives from around the world. It's weighing heavily on people's minds, and the latest shooting was one data point. But I would say more broadly, global leaders are looking at the United States with a real sense of concern. What I heard is that they believe that beyond a more erratic foreign policy, they are seeing the erosion of social norms and, frankly, the erosion of a rule of law that they had come to count on from the United States. And so whether it's what's happening in Minneapolis or events in Washington or, frankly, whatever the headlines are that I know we're all so overwhelmed by, this is front-page news around the world, as well.DAVIES: Yeah. And I'm wondering how they respond to this. You know, Mark Carney, the prime minister of Canada, made that pretty remarkable speech in which he - and it's hard to summarize, but, you know, he said essentially that, you know, the rules-based international order has given way to great power rivalry in which, you know, they use all of these tools, trade and supply chain weaknesses, to maneuver. And he said essentially that middle powers, like Canada and others, end up competing with each other to be the most accommodating, which is accepting subordination. What are you hearing about how they want to respond to Trump? Are they - do they want to challenge? Are they afraid?GELLES: Well, first, I'd say, that was a remarkable speech, and it really was the talk of the town in Davos until President Trump made his own speech on Wednesday. And I think it speaks to the fact that, indeed, leaders like Carney are having to respond in a number of ways. On the one hand, it is true that - call it middle powers, as he did, are finding themselves in a position where they need to be more assertive against a long-time, extraordinarily powerful ally.And it's not just on issues like trade. Over the past several weeks, we saw that this is true on an issue that concerns national security - Greenland. Until President Trump, while I was in the room on Wednesday, said he was not going to use force to seize Greenland, all of the talk among the security professionals I had been with that week was about whether European troops were going to have to defend European territory against American aggression.So there is a new question among middle powers and even our allies about whether and how adversarial they are going to have to be with the United States. And in the very same moment, I want to emphasize how much of a sense, frankly, of loss there is. There's a deep sense of worry, of concern that you might have for an old friend who's going through a hard time about what is happening in the United States. And so what I found is leaders having to hold both of these motions at once. On one hand, a deep sense of concern for an old friend and, at the very same moment, a recognition that they may have to take a tougher posture against that very same good friend.DAVIES: I mean, you know, Trump taking power after the 2024 election is a reminder that these policies can radically change with an election. And there's a congressional election coming up and then a presidential election beyond. Do leaders think, maybe we wait this out? Maybe this isn't a permanent posture of the United States?GELLES: I ask many leaders this very question. And I'm talking former heads of state. I'm talking executives of major international companies. And two - a man and a woman - they all said that they believed that this time was different. And it wasn't just because of the speed at which President Trump and his administration are undoing decades of norms. There's also a sense, as Carney alluded to, of a broader global reset. And yes, perhaps the United States and the Trump administration is precipitating some of that or hastening some of that. But the other factors that many alluded to that were a part of this sort of rupture are the rise of China, the changes in the Middle East, the reset in global trade and thus global alliances that we're seeing, the rise of other authoritarian leaders around the globe. There really is a sense that even if it were not for the extraordinary actions coming out of the White House every day, we would be in a moment that was going to move away from the past 70-plus years of international order since the last world war and towards something quite different that no one can entirely predict.DAVIES: On climate change, you know, you've written about corporate leaders and their policies towards global warming. And some years ago, there was a lot of commitment, or at least verbal commitment, to policies that would make this a priority. How have things changed?GELLES: Well, this was very much on my mind as I headed to Davos last week. It was there at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January of 2020, that many financial leaders started to really say climate change was going to be a defining issue for finance going forward. Larry Fink, who is the chief executive of BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, arrived in Davos that year wearing a scarf that depicted a hundred years of global warming. And just a week before, he had issued a letter to chief executives calling climate change a fundamental reshaping of finance. In the year that followed, so many other banks, asset managers, asset owners started making voluntary pledges, saying that they were going to be a part of this broad set of solution. And, in fact, Mark Carney, who's now the prime minister of Canada, who we just alluded to, he was a major figure in this, as well. He founded a new group called GFANZ in 2021, which aimed to use $100 trillion or more of assets at the disposal of the financial community to try to bend the curve on emissions to try to promote clean energy and, over time, reduce the use of fossil fuels. And as I went to Davos this year, it struck me that so much of that work has simply dissipated. Many of the alliances that had been formed had fallen apart. Many of the commitments that had been made had simply not been upheld. And what I tried to do over the past couple weeks was really understand what had happened. And this was very much the conversation - and it wasn't always an easy one to have - that I was engaging with with leaders at Davos.DAVIES: So what accounts for the dramatic change?GELLES: Several things. The first, and it's unavoidable, is President Trump. As we've already noted, he came back to office a year ago and unleashed a raft of radical policy changes that changed the energy trajectory in the United States, changed the incentive structure for corporations here and abroad who wanted to embrace clean energy, and that has had ripple effects. But as I did the reporting, it became clear that that was just one of a much broader set of realities that have changed on the ground and in the markets over the last six years.A couple others that have been really important in essentially silencing climate action over the past few years were, No. 1, a really strong Republican grassroots pushback against climate action in the business community. This is things like ESG and CSR. In 2020 and 2021, many corporations really took it upon themselves to say that it was their job not just to run profitable businesses, but to engage in the social issues of the day.DAVIES: Right. ESG stands for what?GELLES: ESG stands for environmental, social and governance factors. This is Wall Street jargon that - you know, depends on who you're talking to - can mean a whole lot of different things. But ESG became shorthand for companies caring about trying to tackle climate change. And what you found was that a lot of local Republicans - and I'm talking specifically about local Republican state treasurers - many of them were very uncomfortable with this. And they started pulling their money from companies like BlackRock, banning state governments from doing business with companies that were pursuing climate action and ultimately opening investigations into some of these companies and even suing them. So that was another big piece of why corporate America sort of backed off its engagement with climate change.And then the last thing I would note is that the energy politics and the energy markets have shifted dramatically since 2020. And of course, one of the major precipitating events was Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That was a moment that scrambled the energy markets, that made it much more difficult for some European countries to transition away from natural gas, that increased prices in some markets. And between all three of those - the Russian invasion of Ukraine, local American politics and the return of President Trump - all of that has made it much more difficult for companies to act on climate change.DAVIES: Before we talk about the Trump administration's climate policies, I wanted to ask one more question about the events in Minnesota and the business community. You know, recently, a bunch of major Minnesota companies - Target, Best Buy, General Mills among them - issued a statement along with three of the city's sports teams calling for a de-escalation of tensions in Minneapolis - a pretty neutral statement generally, but not a subject they typically wade into. What's happening here? What does this tell us?GELLES: Well, first, Dave, I wonder if we could go back in time nine years ago and think about something that happened in the first years of the first Trump administration, which was the Unite the Right rally that took place in Charlottesville, Virginia. This was another spasm of violence. It wasn't the government attacking American citizens, but it was a very heated moment. And what you saw then was the corporate community rise up in unison. And I'm talking the major CEOs of just about every American company come out and say, this is unacceptable. The president's rhetoric about this event was unacceptable. And many CEOs actually distance themselves from the White House at that point.I think that's instructive to consider at this moment because what we have seen not only in the past couple weeks around what's happening in Minneapolis, but more broadly, is that corporate America is not speaking out about the actions that are coming out of the White House. And more broadly, they're not speaking out about social and political issues in the same way they did just a few years ago. And the reason for that, and I know this because I've spoken with many CEOs about these very issues, is that they are concerned that if they speak out, President Trump and the White House might penalize them. They might attack them on social media. They might even launch a lawsuit against them.There is a climate of fear that exists in the C-suite, in the boardrooms, of corporate America that simply wasn't there several years ago. And this is why you see so many CEOs that, during the First Trump administration, were willing to come out and take very explicit stands against this administration, very explicit stands on social issues - they are simply keeping their heads down right now. And so what you've seen just in the last couple days, with some Minnesota business leaders coming out and saying, we need to de-escalate tensions - I mean, that's a first step. But it is shocking to see, frankly, the silence from so many other business leaders when just a few years ago, speaking out on an issue like this would have been not only expected by employees, by customers, but something that they would have been encouraging one another to do.DAVIES: We'll talk more in a moment. Let's take a break here, but let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with David Gelles. He's a reporter on The New York Times climate team who leads the paper's Climate Forward newsletter. We'll talk more after this short break. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF SLOWBERN'S \"WHEN WAR WAS KING\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and our guest is David Gelles, a reporter on The New York Times climate team. We're speaking about the Trump administration and business executives' approach to climate change policies. We recorded our conversation yesterday.Now, under the Biden administration, there were a whole series of government incentives, you know, many of them through tax breaks, to promote, you know, the development of renewables. There were incentives for people to install solar panels, tax breaks for buying electrical vehicles. What's happened to those incentives?GELLES: (Laughter) They're just about all gone. I don't know how else to say it. My colleagues and I at The New York Times spent most of last year covering this extraordinary unwinding of federal policy that was designed to gradually over time, shift the United States economy away from a fossil fuel economy and toward one that is powered by clean energy. In the first year of this second Trump administration, the White House has moved with extraordinary speed to undo so many of the incentives and regulations that were making that transition happen.And if I may, I'll just rattle off a few. I mean, when it comes to wind energy, you've seen in the headlines President Trump and the administration canceling, shuttering, these big wind farms that are essentially constructed off the East Coast and saying that even though that power is ready to plug into the grid, they're not allowed. More broadly, for land-based wind farms, you've seen a real ratcheting down of approvals and, in some case - I covered last year the cancellation of a loan that was meant to facilitate the construction of a large transmission line. And this is boring, but the country really needs more transmission lines. They canceled it because it was going to carry electrons that would have been powered in part by wind energy. And so there is this congenital aversion to all things wind from President Trump and his administration that is just decimating the industry here in the United States.DAVIES: And if I can just ask for a little clarification here. This may be too much down...GELLES: It's OK.DAVIES: ...In the weeds. But...GELLES: Let's go.DAVIES: How does the president have the authority to cancel a wind project that's practically finished? I mean, a lot of these are done by - they're, you know, business-government partnerships. State governments are actors in these. How does he have the authority to do this? Or is it clear that he does?GELLES: Well, no. Some of these are being litigated in the courts, and in some cases, the Trump administration has used sort of extraordinary measures, alleging that there are things like national security issues at play that give them the power to intervene in the private markets in a way that, previously, most executives would just have not expected the administration - any administration - to do so. And I think, just, if I may go on a little tangent here, this speaks to a broader issue that corporate America is wrangling with, which is that for a party, the Republican Party, that has for so long been associated with free markets and free enterprise, they are now confronting an exceptionally interventionist White House.You have a White House that is not only taking positions on individual projects and really trying to put their fingers on the scales of individual industries. But you have it playing out in extraordinarily personal ways. And so just to tie it back to our conversation earlier about whether corporations and CEOs were going to speak out about an issue or not, one thing that has shocked me is that if you think back to the first Trump administration, the issues - the political issues that CEOs were speaking up on really had very little bearing on their day-to-day business. These were issues in the headlines. They were issues about politics and race, in the case of George Floyd, and COVID. These were the issues that CEOs found themselves in dialogue with.Today you have a White House that is really intervening with their businesses in the case of tariffs, in the case of taking a stake in certain companies, in the case of putting their fingers on the scale of certain industries. And despite the fact that this administration is really meddling with business operations, much more than the first Trump administration did, you have CEOs unable to say almost anything in their own defense. That dichotomy has been really extraordinary for me to just meditate on.DAVIES: Yeah, yeah. We're going to take another break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with David Gelles. He's a reporter on The New York Times climate team who leads the paper's Climate Forward newsletter. We'll talk more about the impact of the Trump administration's climate policies after this short break. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF WAYNE HORVITZ & ZONY MASH'S \"COLD SPELL\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies. Today, we're talking about the Trump administration's aggressive push to reverse the climate policies of the Biden administration with David Gelles, a reporter on The New York Times climate team who leads the paper's Climate Forward newsletter. Gelles spent many years as a business reporter. And he attended the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, where he spoke to business and government leaders about climate policy and other issues. Gelles' latest book is \"Dirtbag Billionaire\" about Yvon Chouinard, founder of the innovative clothing firm Patagonia. We recorded our conversation yesterday.So a lot of tax incentives for solar panels and electric vehicles were actually overturned in a bill passed by Congress, right? The Republicans control both Houses. And it was signed by President Trump, correct?GELLES: Yes. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, as I believe it was originally known.DAVIES: Right. And then in August, the administration proposed to roll back fuel efficiency standards for cars and to prevent states from setting their own requirements, as California has done, which kind of gave automakers a strong incentive to make cars which met the California standards, which would reduce emissions. Now, what's happened here?GELLES: Well, you point out something really important, Dave, which is that this hasn't just been a congressional act, turning the dials on incentives here. What we're seeing, in fact, is a much more coordinated effort across Congress, the White House, the Department of Energy, the Department of the Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency to all work in concert to essentially promote the fossil fuel industry and tamp down the clean energy business. So it's important, I think, to see this as a whole rather than try to understand any one of these actions in isolation.DAVIES: I just wanted to talk a bit about for - what this means for automakers, because if California has enacted, you know, higher fuel efficiency standards and automakers - you know, it takes years to design cars and build plants to meet these standards. How are they reacting to this? I mean, this has got to be confusing to them.GELLES: They're not only confused, but I know, because I've spoken with them, they're incredibly frustrated. It's not just time. It's money. These designs and these plants and these supply chains require hundreds of billions of dollars of investment. And what you've seen is that many American automakers, including Ford, just a couple years ago came out with a vehicle like the F-150 Lightning, right? This was their classic pickup truck upgraded to be an all-electric vehicle. It was a marvel, and now you see them walking back and essentially discontinuing it. And while that may, in the short term, be a boon for the internal combustion engine in the United States, there is no question that the rest of the world is moving in the opposite direction.I mean, I can't tell you how many times, when I was in Davos just last week in Switzerland or last year when I was in Belem, Brazil, at the United Nations climate conference, I would call an Uber and what would arrive was a BYD Chinese electric vehicle that costs less than most American cars comparably and that performed exceptionally well, felt like a luxury vehicle and was a fraction of the price for something that you might pay that was equivalent out of the United States. So this is what is on automakers' minds as they look forward. It's not just about fuel efficiency standards in the next five years. It's about - how are they going to be able to compete for market share in the decades ahead?DAVIES: So where does this battle over fuel efficiency standards lie? I mean, is that settled?GELLES: Well, late last year, the Trump administration began the process of really drastically rolling back fuel economy requirements for new cars, new trucks, which is part of this broader pivot that we've mentioned away from cleaner technology more broadly. But the actual implementation of this is going to take years. And as with anything with these kind of standards, there could be additional lawsuits. So I don't think it's fully settled, but the Trump administration is certainly trying to move it in that direction.DAVIES: We've talked a bit about solar panels and wind power. The Environmental Protection Agency under the president - Trump - has really taken some bold policy steps to essentially change the way regulations are calculated, the very basis upon which climate change is considered and kind of economic factors are taken into consideration. Can you just give us a sense of how that world has changed?GELLES: I think when you step back and try to understand which government agency has undergone the most drastic change over the past year, I would argue that the EPA, which was founded by President Nixon, has to be at the top of the list. From the moment that current Administrator Lee Zeldin, a former New York congressman, took it over, we've seen the EPA really fundamentally reshape its mission. And this began very early in this most recent administration, when the president and the EPA did just that.They actually came out very early and said that the role of the EPA was no longer reducing pollution that was harmful to humans, but instead that its role was to support economic activity. And I think it's just worth dwelling on what a fundamental reversal that is, and that set the table for so many actions that have followed. They have repealed or tried to weaken regulatory standards for a raft of pollutants coming out of power plants, industrial facilities and vehicles. They have tried to challenge the very legal framework that allows the EPA to regulate harmful pollutants and greenhouse gases. And just a couple weeks ago, they actually recalculated the math by which they attribute value to a human life, and they determined that the value of a human life was zero.And so in all these ways, both abstract and very specific, you see the Environmental Protection Agency walking away from its historical role as the defender of public health and public air and clean air and clean water and, instead, embracing a posture that is almost entirely designed to support industry in being free to do whatever it wants.DAVIES: I have to ask you a little more about the value of human life. What was it before?GELLES: I mean, for the past 30 years, the EPA has assessed the value of a statistical life at around $11.7 million. Today it is now going to be zero.DAVIES: We are speaking with David Gelles. He's a reporter on The New York Times climate team. We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF JOHN COLTRANE QUARTET'S \"OUT OF THIS WORLD\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with David Gelles. He's a reporter on The New York Times climate team who leads the paper's Climate Forward newsletter.A lot of us are freezing right now. I certainly am. I'm recovering from heavy snow or ice. And some would say whatever this is, it is not global warming. Remind us why this kind of weather - you can't pin any particular weather phenomenon to climate change, but why this kind of weather might be more common with the climate change.GELLES: Dave, I'm in New York right now, and it is freezing cold right here. There's no doubt about it. It's also the truth that 2025 was the warmest year overall in global recorded history and that all 10 of the hottest years in recorded history have happened over the past decade. And so as you said, no one weather event can be directly linked to climate change or not. But what the science has been overwhelmingly clear about is that emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, from human activity, from agriculture are turning up the temperature on Earth overall. And as that happens, weather gets more extreme, and it gets less predictable.And so one of the things that we have been seeing over the past several years especially is that the Arctic has been getting warmer. And what has happened right now is that a lot of the Arctic air that typically sits up there on the North Pole - it has escaped. It has essentially come down into the United States, other parts of Europe as well. And what you're seeing if you look at a global temperature map is that it's actually warmer above us, to the north, than it is right here. So these are the scrambling of global weather patterns that science has told us for decades now are going to become more common as man-made global warming overall makes weather more extreme, more volatile, less predictable. So, yeah, we're going to see some very cold snaps, even on a hotter planet.DAVIES: You know, in May, I read in The Times that the White House ordered federal agencies to stop considering the economic damage caused by climate change when writing regulations, except in cases where it's plainly required by law. The assumption is that climate change has no economic impact in these regulations. That seems kind of wild.GELLES: And we just know that's not true. But here again, you see the reshaping of regulation to accommodate a new set of business priorities. And so even if businesses will tell you - and every CEO that I talk to can tell you how climate change is affecting their supply chains, how it's changing the way they have to air-condition large factories that I've been to in the Midwest, how it's changing how they have to protect or even move facilities on the coast. That's all happening. But what the Trump administration is now saying is that they don't have to consider those impacts when passing laws. In fact, it would be better if they didn't at all.DAVIES: You know, one of the other things that I read in your reporting on this was that the administration had eliminated monitoring of atmospheric changes at some of these stations around the world, one in particular in Hawaii that's many, many thousands of feet above sea level. They don't even want to gather this data?GELLES: And it's not just Hawaii. I had conversations while I was in Davos with international scientists about this very issue. And they were really concerned because one of the functions that the United States government has fulfilled for decades now is being, really, a leading compiler of research about our changing planet. Much of that work is simply being discontinued. It's being defunded. The scientists are losing access to their facilities. And what you're seeing is the emergence of sort of a dark ages when it comes to the United States' role in collaborative international science, at least when it comes to the government's role. Organizations like NASA, the space agency, have historically played a huge role in providing the international community with data about global temperatures, sea level rise, any number of things. And what you're seeing is that work is simply being discontinued.And all of this, I think, again goes back to this broader effort across the government to shift the federal government's posture away from climate action and toward a re-embrace of fossil fuels. And this is one more small way in which it's happening, which is that if you don't have the data that shows that climate change is happening and that it is dangerous and that it is indeed affecting our lives and the planet as a whole, well, then it's that much harder to make decisions and make the argument that climate change is something that needs to be addressed.DAVIES: Besides domestic policy, the - Trump has withdrawn the United States from certain international commitments, like the Paris Agreement to fight climate change. We're only one of four countries now not in the agreement. Iran, Libya and Yemen are the others. We've all heard of the Paris Agreement. I think most of us don't know much about it. I mean, the reporting makes me think it's a place where a company - countries all set goals that they ultimately will not meet. How meaningful is this withdrawal?GELLES: I think it's very meaningful for a number of reasons. And in fact, that was one of his first actions that he took when he was inaugurated just over a year ago, was withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement. And it's true, Dave, that the Paris Agreement itself is not particularly binding. It didn't automatically mean that the United States or any other country was going to rapidly embrace clean energy. But what it did was send a signal to industry, to policymakers, to local leaders that a country was on a path and that that path ultimately led toward a world in which we were not polluting so much and gave ourselves, as a collective, the opportunity to try to limit global temperature rise.By pulling out of that agreement, the United States sent a signal to the rest of the world that it simply wasn't even going to try. And in sending that signal, it made it much harder for other countries to galvanize their own coalition of policymakers and business leaders to do the same thing. So while on one hand, maybe this only affects the United States, it has sent shock waves around the world. And as you note, we are now - the United States - part of a pretty unusual club of countries who have said that they are not going to participate in this global agreement.DAVIES: And then, of course, early in the administration, the U.S. Agency for International Development was dismantled. I mean, I think Elon Musk's phrase was, I just put it in the wood chipper. Did that have environmental impacts?GELLES: Yeah. I mean, we could spend a whole nother hour and a half talking just about foreign policy here. But there is no doubt that while the United States Agency for International Development was mostly focused on traditional development work, things like hunger and health for developing nations, it was also doing a really meaningful amount of climate work - helping developing nations become more resilient, helping them prepare for storms, floods, fires and droughts. And all of that work has been shuttered as well.DAVIES: We are speaking with David Gelles. He's a reporter on The New York Times climate team. We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF ALABAMA SHAKES SONG, \"GIMME ALL YOUR LOVE\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with David Gelles. He's a reporter on The New York Times climate team who leads the paper's Climate Forward newsletter.I wanted to talk about your latest book. It's called \"Dirtbag Billionaire.\" And it's about Yvon Chouinard, who established Patagonia, this very successful manufacturer of outdoor gear, jackets, hats, vests. And it's known for being a company that made environmental responsibility a core tenet of its business. Let's just talk a little bit about him. He's quite an interesting character. And this term - dirtbag - had a very specific meaning, right?GELLES: Well, let's start there. Yvon Chouinard refers to himself as a dirtbag. He's a rock climber. He's someone who comes from this hardcore outdoor community. And in that context, the word dirtbag refers to someone who is so unenamored with materialism, so unconcerned with money, that they are literally content to sleep in the dirt if it means they are that much closer to their next adventure. And so when Yvon Chouinard heard the title of this book, \"Dirtbag Billionaire,\" about him, he was upset not because of the word dirtbag. He was upset because of the word billionaire because he never wanted to be a billionaire.DAVIES: He has a fascinating childhood story, doesn't he?GELLES: He was born in the woods of northern Maine in a French Canadian community. And in fact, he didn't even speak English until he was 10 years old, when his parents drove across the country to find warmer weather and he started going to school in Los Angeles.Now, at that point, he had a hard time fitting in because he didn't speak English. And as a teenager, he started training falcons. He started training birds of prey and pursuing this ancient art of falconing. And in the process of climbing down cliffs to search for and ultimately capture falcons and their eggs, he started rock climbing. And when that happened, everything changed. He became enamored and then became, in the 1950s, one of the great rock climbers of his age. And in doing that, he became a blacksmith. He did these big climbs, but he needed better equipment, so he hammered them out himself on an anvil he bought at a junkyard. And thus begins his journey as a businessman.DAVIES: Wow. And was he taking his profits and putting them into environmental causes?GELLES: Indeed. 1973, the same year he founds Patagonia, he writes his first check to an environmental activist. It's just a little money, but he also gives him some office space. And what this man, who I tracked down and spent time with, Mark Capelli, was doing was trying to protect the Ventura River, which ran behind the office of Patagonia in Ventura, California, and restore the native fish that were once there but that had been crowded out because of pollution and overdevelopment. Yvon loved this. And that began a tradition of donating small amounts of money initially to grassroots environmental activists, to conservation projects. And it was something that grew as the company grew.DAVIES: In your research, did you ever find a case where he betrayed his principles or pursue a course that kind of exemplified the contradictions in what he was doing?GELLES: Dave, it is not a neat and tidy story. He is not a perfect man. Patagonia is not a perfect company. And over and over, what I found was that whether it was in business decisions, whether it was in personnel decisions, whether it was in their relationships with other companies that they partnered with, they had to constantly and continuously balance these many competing priorities.DAVIES: Was he good to his employees? Did he share profits?GELLES: He didn't, Dave. And this is another contradiction. And while it's true that Patagonia embraced some very progressive human resources practices and really tried to give its employees time to enjoy nature, he not once ever shared profits and not once ever gave away stock in the company. He was always incredibly protective of Patagonia's equity. And that, I think, also works both ways. On the one hand, I spoke with employees who were really resentful of the fact that they gave decades of their lives to this company and did not walk away with a meaningful amount of money. On the flip side, it was only by controlling that equity so carefully that Chouinard was able to do this extraordinary thing that I broke the news about in The New York Times a few years ago which was that he essentially gave away the entire company into a new structure that now facilitates the donation of all Patagonia profits to environmental charities.DAVIES: Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure he could have, you know, sold the company for a fortune.GELLES: Well, he at one point had an offer for $6 billion. And yet, he didn't want it. His wife didn't want it. Dave, I spent time with them at their home in Wyoming, and they live in the same log cabin they built for themselves in the 1970s. The furniture is all from Goodwill or it's second hand. He cooks for himself every night. They don't have a chef. They don't have a cleaning lady. These people live incredibly modest, humble lives. And it was only because that was sort of who they were that they were able to do this extraordinary transaction a few years ago. And here's what they did just very briefly.The Chouinard family owned 100% of the equity in Patagonia. What they did, without getting too technical, was transfer the equity to a new series of trusts and nonprofit organizations that essentially transferred the equity out of their possession into the holding of a trust and some nonprofits. And then they instructed the trust to have the company itself donate all of its profits that are not reinvested in the company, which is somewhere $60 and $100 million a year, to the nonprofit organizations which now give away all that money to large-scale land conservation and environmental activism on an ongoing basis. One way I like to think about this story is that it's the compound interest of values. What you see is that the values Chouinard cared about in the 1970s are still the ones informing the company today, and as a result, the company and its profits are having these big, outsized impacts. And it's not just in the charity. Patagonia has had a hand in shaping the rest of the apparel industry with coalitions, with partnerships, with things like the rise of organic cotton, and all of that was made possible because these few individuals understood what they cared about more than a half century ago and stuck with it.DAVIES: A hopeful story in a world in which there aren't so many. Yeah. David Gelles, thank you so much for speaking with us.GELLES: It's always a pleasure.

The sweeping changes were made to accelerate development of a new generation of nuclear reactor designs. They occurred over the fall and winter at the Department of Energy, which is currently overseeing a program to build at least three new experimental commercial nuclear reactors by July 4 of this year.   \n   The changes are to departmental orders, which dictate requirements for almost every aspect of the reactors' operations — including safety systems, environmental protections, site security and accident investigations.   NPR obtained copies of over a dozen of the new orders, none of which is publicly available. The orders slash hundreds of pages of requirements for security at the reactors. They also loosen protections for groundwater and the environment and eliminate at least one key safety role. The new orders cut back on requirements for keeping records, and they raise the amount of radiation a worker can be exposed to before an official accident investigation is triggered.   Over 750 pages were cut from the earlier versions of the same orders, according to NPR's analysis, leaving only about one-third of the number of pages in the original documents.    Loading... \n   The new generation of nuclear reactor designs, known as small modular reactors, are being backed by billions in private equity, venture capital and public investments. Backers of the reactors, including tech giants Amazon, Google and Meta, have said they want the reactors to one day supply cheap, reliable power for artificial intelligence. (Amazon and Google are financial supporters of NPR.)   Outside experts who helped review the rules for NPR criticized the decision to revise them without any public knowledge.   \n   \"I would argue that the Department of Energy relaxing its nuclear safety and security standards in secret is not the best way to engender the kind of public trust that's going to be needed for nuclear to succeed more broadly,\" said Christopher Hanson, who chaired the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from 2021 to 2025, when he was fired by President Trump.   \"They're taking a wrecking ball to the system of nuclear safety and security regulation oversight that has kept the U.S. from having another Three Mile Island accident,\" said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"I am absolutely worried about the safety of these reactors.\"   \n   In a lengthy statement to NPR, the Department of Energy defended the changes. \"The reduction of unnecessary regulations will increase innovation in the industry without jeopardizing safety,\" it said.   It said that early copies of the new rules were shared with the companies as part of an \"iterative effort\" to develop a regulatory framework that would \"expedite our review process while maintaining safety and security standards.\"    (The orders seen by NPR were not marked as drafts and had the word \"Approved\" clearly displayed on their cover pages.)   \"The Department anticipates publicly posting the directives later this year,\" it said in its statement.   A new nuclear path   The origins of the changes can be traced to the Oval Office. In May of last year, Trump sat behind the Resolute Desk and signed a series of executive orders on nuclear energy.   \n   \"It's a hot industry, it's a brilliant industry, you have to do it right,\" Trump said as smiling executives from the nuclear industry looked on. \"It's become very safe and environmental, yes 100%.\"   Among the executive orders Trump signed that day was one that called for the creation of a new program at the Department of Energy to build experimental reactors. The document Trump signed explicitly stated that \"The Secretary shall approve at least three reactors pursuant to this pilot program with the goal of achieving [nuclear] criticality in each of the three reactors by July 4, 2026.\"    Loading... \n   In other words, the Department of Energy had just over a year to review, approve and oversee the construction of multiple, untested nuclear reactors.   That timeline has raised eyebrows.   \"To say that it's aggressive is a pretty big understatement,\" said Kathryn Huff, a professor of plasma and nuclear engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who served as head of the DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy from 2022 to 2024. Research reactors typically take at least two years to build from the point when construction begins, Huff said. Few — if any — have been built on the timescale laid out in the executive order.   Officials at the Energy Department knew the clock was ticking. In June, they met with the heads of several companies at the Nuclear Energy Institute, the nuclear industry's main lobby group in Washington, D.C. They briefed the gathering of CEOs, lawyers and nuclear engineers about the department's new \"Reactor Pilot Program.\"   \"One thing I do want to stress, this is not a funding opportunity,\" Michael Goff, the DOE's principal deputy assistant secretary for nuclear energy, said during the meeting, which was recorded. Rather than offering money, the Reactor Pilot Program was promising something else that the companies had long wanted — a pathway to quickly get new test reactor designs through regulatory approval.   \n   \"Our job is to make sure that the government is no longer a barrier,\" said Seth Cohen, a lawyer at the Department of Energy responsible for implementing Trump's executive orders.   The DOE was uniquely positioned to offer a speedy pathway to approval. The nation's commercial nuclear reactors are typically under the regulatory oversight of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Hanson says the NRC is independent and known for its rigor and public process.   Loading...\n   But since the NRC began its work in 1975, the Energy Department has retained the ability to regulate its own reactors, which have historically been used for research and nuclear weapons-related activities.   The rules governing DOE reactors are a mix of federal regulations and directives known as \"orders.\" Changes to federal regulations require public notice and comment, but DOE's orders can be legally changed internally with no public comment period. The orders have historically been made public via a DOE database.   Until now, the DOE's rules have typically applied to just a handful of reactors located on government property. The Reactor Pilot Program expands that regulatory authority to all reactors built as part of the program. Officials explained to the crowd in the June meeting that this includes DOE-contracted reactors built outside of the department's national laboratories.   And while broadening its oversight, officials said, safety personnel located primarily at Idaho National Laboratory would also rewrite the DOE's orders for these reactors.   \"DOE orders and standards are under evaluation as part of this regulatory reform,\" Christian Natoni, an official from DOE's Idaho Operations Office, told the gathering. \"What you will see in the near term is a streamlined set of requirements to support this reactor authorization activity.\"   Rules rewritten   The documents reviewed by NPR show just how extensive the streamlining effort has been.   The new orders strip out some guiding principles of nuclear safety, notably a concept known as \"As Low As Reasonably Achievable\" (ALARA), which requires nuclear reactor operators to keep levels of radiation exposure below the legal limit whenever they can. The ALARA standard has been in use for decades at both the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.   \n   Removing the standard means that new reactors could be constructed with less concrete shielding, and workers could work longer shifts, potentially receiving higher doses of radiation, according to Tison Campbell, a partner at K&L Gates who previously worked as a lawyer at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.   \"So the result could be lower construction costs, saved employment costs and things like that,\" Campbell said. \"That could reduce the overall financial burden of constructing and operating a nuclear powerplant.\"   Huff said that many people in the industry think the concept of ALARA has become overly onerous, and she agrees it's worth reconsidering the standard.   \"The argument against ALARA is that in a lot of cases it's been mismanaged and used overly stringently in ways that go beyond the 'reasonable,'\" Huff said.   But not everyone wants to rethink ALARA.   \"It certainly cost the industry money to lower doses [of radiation],\" said Emily Caffrey, a health physicist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. \"But I don't think it's been incredibly problematic.\"   In a memo issued earlier this month, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright gave approval to end ALARA, in part to \"reduce the economic and operational burden on nuclear energy while aligning with available scientific evidence.\" The existence of the memo was first reported by E&E News.   However, the orders seen by NPR suggest the department had already begun removing the ALARA requirement from the new rules as early as August, months before the secretary's approval was given.   \"The Department of Energy is, and always will be, committed to the highest standards of safety for workers and communities,\" the agency said in its statement. Although ALARA had been removed from the orders \"the ALARA standards have not changed,\" it said.   ALARA is not the only safety principle that has been stripped from the orders. Gone too is the requirement to have an engineer designated to each of a reactor's critical safety systems. Known as a cognizant system engineer, the idea is to task one person to take responsibility for understanding each part of a reactor that could lead to a severe accident if it failed. The department told NPR that the requirement for such an engineer was an \"unnecessary burden,\" and that it had other processes in place to ensure safety.    \n   The new rules also remove a requirement to use the \"best available technology\" to protect water supplies from the discharge of radioactive material.   \"Why wouldn't you be using the best available technology? I don't understand the motivation for cutting things like that,\" Caffrey said.   The revised orders leave out dozens of references to other documents and standards, including the department's entire manual for managing radioactive waste. Some lines from the 59-page manual have been integrated into a new 25-page order on radioactive waste management, but pages of detailed requirements for waste packaging and monitoring have been removed.   The Energy Department said the changes to the nuclear waste order maintained all necessary requirements and were made to provide nuclear waste rules in \"a more streamlined 'user friendly' format.\"    But perhaps nowhere are the cuts more obvious than in the new order on safeguards and security. Seven security directives totaling over 500 pages have been consolidated into a single, 23-page order.    Loading... \n   Gone are detailed requirements for firearms training, emergency drills, officer-involved shooting procedures and limits on how many hours security force officers can work in a day or week. Entire chapters specifying how nuclear material should be secured and what sorts of physical barriers should be built to protect it have been reduced to bullet points.   \"Security is an expense that the nuclear industry has long complained about,\" Lyman said. Paying for a guard force is costly and many companies would like to reduce the requirements, he said. \"They don't know why they have to pay so much money to protect against something they think is never going to happen.\"   Reviewing the new security rules, Lyman said he felt the general requirements are allowing companies \"to write their own ticket as far as security goes.\" He's especially concerned because several of the new reactor designs use higher levels of enriched uranium in their cores, which could make them targets of theft.   \n   In its statement the Department of Energy said that the changes \"did not remove any requirements significant to security.\" \"This order only removed requirements that were unnecessary for security and increased burden and costs,\" it said.   Loosening protections for the environment and workers   NPR's review of the new orders shows that, in certain cases, they also appear to loosen rules about discharging radioactive material.   For example, the previous version of an order titled \"Radiation Protection for the Public and the Environment\" states that discharging radioactivity \"from DOE activities into non-federally owned sanitary sewers are prohibited,\" then provides a limited series of exceptions.   The new standard says only that radioactive discharges into sanitary sewers \"should be avoided.\" Similar language changes were made to soften restrictions on groundwater discharges, and protections for the environment.   Experts who were asked to review the changes by NPR agreed that the net effect was to loosen the standards.   \"Anywhere they have changed 'prohibited' or 'must' to 'should be' or 'can be' — that is a loosening of regulation. That's a big change in words, in meaning,\" Caffrey said.    Loading... \n   The changes constitute \"very clearly a loosening that I would have wanted to see exposed to public discussion,\" Huff told NPR. She calls the relaxing of environmental rules \"especially disappointing\" because the Idaho National Lab, where several of the reactors are due to be built, has been the site of ecological preservation activities in the past. \"I think some of those preservation activities have had a great positive impact on the ecosystem there,\" she said.   In its statement, the Energy Department said that the changes continue to protect the public and environment from \"undue risks.\"  \"DOE follows applicable U.S. EPA requirements in these areas,\" it said.    There are signs that the Energy Department is seeking to change safety rules beyond the orders seen by NPR. Last week, the department published a plan to exclude some worker safety standards in order to help the reactor program move more quickly. The proposed rule change would strip out some standards for things like respiratory protection and welding. Because the worker safety rules are part of the Code of Federal Regulations, the department was required by law to publish the proposed changes. The agency said in its notice that the changes \"present significant advantages that can enhance operational efficiency and safety for DOE contractors.\"   \n   Concierge service   The new orders are now being used by around 30 experts across DOE and around a dozen experts on loan from the NRC to conduct design and safety reviews of 11 reactor designs being built by 10 private companies.   Each company also has access to a \"Concierge Team\" to \"provide assistance to the applicant to ensure expeditious processing of its application,\" according to a memo also obtained by NPR, which has not been made public.   The team is made up of \"representatives from the Secretary's office, the Office of the General Counsel, the Office of Nuclear Energy\" and each team member reports directly to the secretary of energy — raising the possibility that senior officials could exert pressure on lower-level staff to speed safety evaluations of the new reactors.   The DOE said that the Concierge Team's only purpose was to \"add efficiency\" to the application process. \"Membership on the Concierge Team does not provide any authority over DOE's safety reviewers,\" it said.   Reactors by July   Ultimately, experts who viewed the new rules had doubts about whether they really would help the Reactor Pilot Program reach its goal of building three new reactors by July.   Hanson said he believes the numerous cuts to the new orders will not necessarily simplify the review process. One of the benefits of having things explicitly written down was that \"contractors and others knew how to comply with the rules,\" he said. \"If you take that away, you might have more flexibility, maybe, but it's also less clear how to do that.\"   The orders also clearly laid out the steps needed to ensure companies abided by other relevant laws, Campbell said. He worries that the rewrites that loosen rules on things like radiological discharges could actually lead companies to violate other environmental and safety laws. For example, radiological releases into public sewers might violate legal limits under the Clean Water Act.   \n   Companies may not read those underlying laws, \"so I think you're setting them up to violate statutes or regulations that are going to remain in place,\" he said.   But above all, the fact that the rewrites were done without public knowledge could be the most damaging, said Huff. In the past, public distrust has been a huge barrier to the development of nuclear power, and transparency is an important way to counter that mistrust.   \"In the best world, the public should expect as much openness from the government as is possible,\" she said. \"If it's possible to share with the companies at this point, then there's a really important question as to why it's not public.\"   \n",

Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services offered no explanation of its decision to terminate and later restore grant money for mental health and addiction programs.\n                \n                    Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   After a tense day of confusion and backroom negotiations, the Trump administration moved Wednesday night to restore roughly $2 billion in federal grant money for mental health and addiction programs nationwide.   The money had been cut off late Tuesday without warning, sending shockwaves through a segment of the country's patchwork system of public health that relies on grant funding.   \"After a day of panic across the country, non-profits and people with mental health conditions are deeply alarmed, but also hopeful that this money is being restored,\" said Hannah Wesolowski with the National Alliance on Mental Illness.   \n   An administration official confirmed to NPR that the cuts, first announced by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), were being reversed. They asked not to be identified because they didn't have permission to speak publicly about the decision.   They said all of the roughly 2,000 organizations affected by the whiplash series of events were being notified that full funding would be restored.   NPR was unable to confirm who triggered the initial decision to terminate the grants by sending letters that abruptly signaled programs no longer \"aligned\" with the Trump administration's public health agenda.   After sending the letters, officials at the Department of Health and Human Services and SAMHSA went silent, offering no clarification to health care providers or the public about what would happen next or where patients should go for care.   The sudden defunding and lack of communication triggered a backlash from local officials and care providers, who said the American public would see a rapid dismantling of essential safety net programs.   \"We provide treatment, life saving treatment,\" said Dan Lustig who runs the Haymarket Center, the largest non-profit addiction treatment program in Chicago, which treats people at high risk while using illicit drugs like fentanyl and methamphetamines.   \n   \"If people don't get access to treatment they just die. That's a fact,\" Lustig said. \"You can spin this any way people want to, but people are going to die.\"   The American Medical Association weighed in, issuing a statement saying it was \"deeply concerned\" by the cuts and calling for grants to be restored.   \"At a time when patients already face too many barriers to care, sudden funding disruptions risk leaving them without the support and treatment they urgently need,\" the statement said.   That message reached members of Congress. Republican and Democratic lawmakers scrambled to urge White House and Health and Human Services officials to reverse course.   \"We heard from offices on both sides of the political aisle who were working on this issue throughout the day,\" said Wesolowski. The bipartisan pressure, she added, \"really speaks to the power of the collaboration on this issue.\"   While most of the talks happened behind closed doors, some Democratic lawmakers publicly blasted the Trump administration and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for what they described as roughshod treatment of front-line care providers.   \"After national outrage, Secretary Kennedy has bowed to public pressure and reinstated $2 billion in SAMHSA grants that save lives,\" said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut.   \"Our policy must be thoughtful – not haphazard and chaotic. This episode has only created uncertainty and confusion for families and health care providers,\" she added.   While confusion over funding was apparently short-lived, public health organizations and other sources told NPR that the termination letters demoralized staff in a system already weakened by deep cuts to Medicaid, enacted by the Republican-controlled Congress last year.    \n   For 24 hours, it was unclear which programs would survive and who would still have jobs when the dust settled.   Dr. Yngvild Olsen, an addiction treatment physician who served as the director for the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment inside SAMHSA until July 2025, said the turmoil also raised questions about who in the Trump administration is making key public health decisions.   \"My understanding is that much of the staff at SAMHSA was caught unaware,\" Olsen said. \"These were decisions made without the input of experts in these programs and experts in this [addiction and mental health] field.\"   \n   For months, Trump administration officials have been signaling they think many of the country's current public health programs are ineffective and need to be replaced.   But public health experts told NPR there has been little or no communication with frontline groups that provide much of the actual in the U.S. Meanwhile, no clear plan from the administration has emerged. Instead, local government agencies and non-profits caring for patients have faced a series of threats, disruptions and funding chaos.   \"This sparks a lot of uncertainty about who's making public health decisions in this country,\" said NAMI's Wesolowski. \n",

Vásquez/AP\n    \n\n   \n   A federal court has upheld the new congressional map approved by California voters last month, giving Democrats a chance to counter the nationwide redistricting effort led by President Trump and his Republican allies.   The court challenge to the redistricting plan had been brought by the California Republican Party and the U.S. Department of Justice. The court found that the new district map did not violate laws against racial gerrymandering.   The Republicans argued that the new map was motivated by a desire to increase the voting power of Latinos. The court, in a two-to-one ruling, rejected that claim, noting that voters approved the measure, called \"Proposition 50\" and there was no evidence they acted on racial grounds.   \n   \"The evidence presented reflects that Proposition 50 was exactly what it was billed as: a political gerrymander designed to flip five Republican-held seats to the Democrats,\" wrote U.S. District Judge Josephine L. Staton in the majority opinion.   The court denied the Republican plaintiffs' request the court issue an injunction blocking the redistricting as the case proceeds to a final judgement. The Republicans could still appeal the ruling.   \n   Usually states redistrict early in the decade after the decennial census. But Trump set off a mid-decade redistricting race as he tries to prevent Democrats from taking control of the House. This summer he pushed Texas Republicans to redraw that state's districts, potentially helping the GOP win five House seats in 2026. Missouri and North Carolina have each redistricted to help the GOP in one seat.   After the Texas redistricting, California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom vowed to respond by redrawing the map in his state. At his urging, lawmakers put the matter on the ballot and California voters approved a redistricting plan there in a special election Nov. 4. That measure passed with 64 percent of the vote.   For Democrats, it's been about confronting Trump   For Democrats who supported California's redistricting measure, it was not as much about redrawn lines as it was an ideological battle. Supporters largely viewed it as an opportunity for the blue state to push back against the Trump administration. Newsom argued the approach was necessary to counter the GOP-led redistricting effort in Texas and \"fight fire with fire\" and boost Democrats' chances ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.   \n   The Republican-led lawsuit against the measure contended it violated the law by disproportionately giving the state's Latino voters a stronger voice over other racial voting blocs.   In a dissenting opinion, Judge Kenneth Lee, who was appointed by President Trump in 2018, said the designer of the map, hired by the Democrats, had publicly said that he was aiming to boost Latino voting power.   \"The Democratic supermajority in the California state legislature wanted to curry favor with Latino groups and voters—and to prevent Latino voters from drifting away from the party,\" Lee wrote.   The majority ruling rejected that argument, finding that it was not the mapmaker or even the legislature that held the deciding power but rather the voters on the proposition and that it was debated by proponents and opponents as a partisan move.   In her opinion, Staton, appointed to the bench by President Obama, found a \"mountain of evidence produced by Defendants that the voters intended to enact a partisan gerrymander.\"   \"Republicans' weak attempt to silence voters failed,\" wrote Newsom in a statement. \"California voters overwhelmingly supported Prop 50 – to respond to Trump's rigging in Texas – and that is exactly what this court concluded.\"   Overall, the redistricting race is close with Republicans on track to tilt a couple or few more seats their way than Democrats have. Indiana Republicans refused to follow Trump's lead last month and redistrict there. But Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has vowed to lead his state in drawing a new map that will favor the GOP.   Meanwhile, Virginia Democrats have started the redistricting process to favor their party in that state. Currently, the House stands at 218 Republicans and 213 Democrats and if Democrats take control, they could slow Trump's agenda or launch investigations into his administration.

Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., says she found out about the investigation when she received a call from the office of Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. The New York Times first reported Slotkin's knowledge of the investigation.   Rep. Maggie Goodlander, D-N.H., Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., and Rep. Chris Deluzio, D-Pa., say federal prosecutors have also asked to question them about the video.    \n   A spokesperson for Pirro's office declined to \"confirm or deny the existence of an investigation\" of either Democrat.    The video, posted on social media in November, featured six congressional Democrats, all with military or intelligence backgrounds, pointing to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.   \"No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution,\" the lawmakers said in the video.   President Trump called the video message \"treasonous\" and amplified a social media post suggesting the six members should be hanged. The White House later said the president was not suggesting the six members be killed. Still, several reported receiving death threats and bomb scares.   \"This is the President's playbook,\" Slotkin said Wednesday. \"Truth doesn't matter, facts don't matter. And anyone who disagrees with him becomes an enemy and he then weaponizes the federal government against them. It's legal intimidation and physical intimidation meant to get you to shut up.\"   Slotkin said she has received 1,000 threats, including a bomb threat at her house, and that her parents were victims of swatting — the term for when someone makes a false report of a crime to law enforcement to elicit an overwhelming police response.   \"Right now speaking out against the abuse of power is the most patriotic thing we can do,\" Slotkin said.   \n   In a separate statement on Wednesday, Crow said President Trump was \"pressuring his political appointees to harass me for daring to speak up and hold him accountable.\"    \"I won't be intimidated and will keep fighting to uphold my oath to the Constitution and defend our country,\" Crow wrote in a statement.   \"These threats will not deter, distract, intimidate, or silence me,\" Goodlander wrote. \"I will continue doing my job and upholding my oath to our Constitution. And I will never give up the ship.\"   A spokesperson for Deluzio said in a statement that the congressman \"won't be intimidated.\"    In November, the FBI requested interviews with the members who participated in the video.   And Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said this week that the Pentagon would censure one of the lawmakers, Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., a retired Navy combat pilot.   That could allow the Pentagon to demote Kelly or reduce his retirement pay. Kelly sued Hegseth and the Pentagon on Monday, saying the government is retaliating for speech protected by the First Amendment.   The action comes as the Trump administration is wielding the Justice Department to target other political opponents, including Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

The case before the court was brought by Illinois Republican U.S. Rep. Michael Bost and other candidates, who wanted to challenge a state law that allows election officials to count mail ballots that arrive up to two weeks after Election Day, as long as they're postmarked on time.    Many states have laws that offer a buffer, or grace period, to voters to return mail ballots in case there are issues with the postal service, for example.   \n   A lower court ruled that Bost did not have standing to challenge the Illinois law.   The conservative-majority Supreme Court, in a 7-2 ruling, disagreed.   Chief Justice John Roberts authored the opinion, writing that \"[c]andidates have a concrete and particularized interest in the rules that govern the counting of votes in their elections, regardless whether those rules harm their electoral prospects or increase the cost of their campaigns.\"   Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote a concurring opinion, joined by liberal Justice Elena Kagan. Liberal Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor dissented.   In her dissent, Justice Jackson argued that the court was giving candidates the ability to sue in advance of provable harm, despite the fact that most voters don't have that ability.   \"In a democratic society like ours, the interest in a fair electoral process is common to all members of the voting public,\" she wrote. \"I believe that political candidates can and should be held to the same actual-injury requirements as other litigants.\"   \n   The ruling was cheered by the conservative group Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections, with its president, Justin Riemer, writing in a statement that the decision is \"a major win for the rule of law in our elections. Too many courts for too long have avoided grappling with legitimate and meritorious challenges to election rules by dismissing cases on standing grounds.\"   But Wendy Weiser with the Brennan Center for Justice warned that allowing candidates to challenge laws without proving harm first could also create an influx of frivolous lawsuits.   \n   \"At a time of conspiracy theories & stress on elections, SCOTUS just opened the floodgates to candidates challenging election rules,\" she wrote on X, \"regardless of whether those rules will impact their races. Bost could unleash frivolous suits to undermine election confidence or disrupt results.\"   Richard Pildes, a legal scholar at NYU School of Law, wrote for Election Law Blog that he believes the court's decision was right, however. He wrote that it \"will advance the important systemic interest in having the legality of election laws resolved in advance of elections.\"   He wrote that waiting until actual harm is provable creates \"fraught circumstances\" by forcing any sort of legal resolution until after voting — and often counting — has completed.   \"One of the important policies about the conduct of election[s] is that the rules be clearly settled in advance of the election,\" he wrote. \"The Bost decision will contribute to that important aim of the election system.\"   While the Bost case dealt with the narrow issue of legal standing, the Supreme Court will also consider a separate challenge to mail ballot grace periods themselves.   \n",

Josh Hawley, R-Mo.,  talks to reporters as he heads to a vote at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. Hawley reversed his initial support for a Venezuela war powers resolution and voted to block the legislation after receiving assurances from the White House.\n                \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Republicans in the Senate have blocked a war powers resolution that would have required President Trump to secure authorization from Congress before launching any further military operations in Venezuela.   The resolution's defeat came less than a week after five Republicans broke ranks with their party and joined Democrats on a procedural vote to advance the measure — a rare rebuke for President Trump from within the GOP. The initial vote was an immediate response to the surprise operation earlier this month that led to the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.   Those votes drew a furious response from President Trump, who called for the Republican defectors to lose their seats in Congress.   \n   By Wednesday, Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., was able to flip two of those five Republican votes against the measure. The final vote was 51-50, with Vice President Vance brought in to break a tie.   The resolution was blocked with the support of Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Todd Young, R-Ind., two of the five Republicans who had sided earlier with Democrats. Speaking to reporters, Hawley said his concerns about U.S. intervention in Venezuela had been alleviated by speaking with Secretary of State Marco Rubio. For his part, Young said he changed his mind after receiving assurances from senior national security officials \"that there are no American troops in Venezuela.\"   \"I've also received a commitment that if President Trump were to determine American forces are needed in major military operations in Venezuela, the Administration will come to Congress in advance to ask for an authorization of force,\" Young said in a statement.   The positions of the three other Republicans who sided with Democrats on last week's vote — Maine's Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul of Kentucky — went unchanged.   \"Republicans should be ashamed of the Senators that just voted with Democrats in attempting to take away our Powers to fight and defend the United States of America,\" Trump wrote after last week's vote.   \n   The vote was the latest setback in efforts by Senate lawmakers to reassert control over the use of military force. A pair of similar measures were also defeated last year. But as President Trump continues to raise the prospect of military force in other parts of the world, including Iran and Greenland, Senate Democrats have signaled they intend to continue forcing additional war powers votes.\n",

Letters terminating funding went out late Tuesday night, sending shockwaves through the country's public health system. Letters will be sent soon restoring that funding.   \n   After a political backlash from Republicans and Democrats, the Department of Health and Human Services has reversed course and the grant money will be restored.   This decision to terminate the funding caught care providers across the United States completely by surprise, triggering a powerful negative response from lawmakers in Washington and from organizations all over the country. The story was first reported by NPR.   Now an administration official with direct knowledge of the decision, who asked NPR not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak about the change, says the decision is being reversed and the grants are being restored.   \n   More than 2,000 organizations and grant recipients are being notified as quickly as possible, according to the source.   Public health advocates said their organizations were breathing a sigh of relief but were also alarmed and shaken.   \"It was a day of panic across the country.  People are deeply alarmed but hopeful that this money is being restored,\" said Hannah Wesolowski with the National Alliance on Mental Illness.   \"This speaks to the bipartisan support in Congress for mental health. We heard from offices on both sides of the political aisle who were working on this issue throughout the day,\" she added.   The termination letters that were sent out Tuesday said bluntly that a wide variety of mental health and addiction programs didn't align with the Trump administration's public health agenda and would no longer be funded. This took care providers by surprise.    The backlash triggered a series of high-level meetings inside the Trump administration, and by Wednesday evening the decision had been rescinded.    NPR hasn't been able to determine who made the initial decision to cut these funds, nor would sources say who made the decision to restore the money.    Public health officials around the U.S. described the last 48 hours as chaotic.\n",

You're reading the Up First newsletter. Subscribe here to get it delivered to your inbox, and listen to the Up First podcast for all the news you need to start your day.   Today's top stories   Some media executives are calling the FBI's search of a reporter's home yesterday an alarming intrusion into the freedom of the press. The agency searched Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson's house as part of the Trump administration's investigation of a leak. Agents seized two computers and her smartwatch. Last month, Natanson documented the purge of hundreds of thousands of federal employees by relying on over 1,000 sources.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Washington Post Building at One Franklin Square Building on June 5, 2024 in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 It is highly unusual for the agency to search a reporter's home instead of an office, NPR's David Folkenflik told Up First. The government has informed the newspaper that Natanson is not the focal point of the investigation. Marty Baron, a former executive editor of The Washington Post, told Folkenflik that this administration has displayed a pattern of trying to undermine an independent press and attempting to interfere with its work.   Denmark's foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, says there is still a \"fundamental disagreement\" between his country and President Trump regarding Denmark's territory island Greenland. After meeting with Vice President Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio yesterday, Løkke Rasmussen said Trump clearly wants to \"conquer\" the territory. However, the two sides did agree to form a working group to continue discussing U.S. security concerns.    \n   🎧The U.S. seeking to acquire Greenland challenges the rules of international order, specifically the U.N. charter that says a member cannot use force against another country to seize territory, says Stewart Patrick, formerly of the George W. Bush State Department. Denmark has announced plans to build its military presence in Greenland, in what could be considered a pushback at allegations that it can't defend the country, according to NPR's Franco Ordoñez. Sweden and Germany also announced they would send military forces to the region, potentially conveying a message to the U.S. that Denmark is not alone.   A Trump administration official confirmed to NPR that sweeping cuts to over $2 billion in funding for mental health and addiction programs are being reversed. The reversal comes after letters about the news went out late Tuesday, sending a shockwave through the U.S.' public health system. Originally, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration was ending grants for roughly 2,000 organizations, which are frontline programs helping some of the most vulnerable people in the country.    🎧 The reversal comes as relief to people like Hannah Wesolowski, who is with the National Alliance on Mental Illness. She says these organizations are deeply demoralized, and over those 24 hours, many people thought they were going to lose their jobs and thought their really sick patients would lose care. NPR's Brian Mann says people he has been talking to feel rudderless due to the unexplained defunding, and then there was no clear explanation as to why the money was restored. This comes as the Trump administration has been signaling for months that it thinks many of the nation's public health programs are ineffective and need to be replaced.   \n   Deep dive   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Elementary students in Computer Lab\n                \n                    Adam Kaz/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Adam Kaz/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The risks of using generative artificial intelligence to educate children and teens currently outweigh the benefits, according to a new study by the Brookings Institution's Center for Universal Education. The study found that using AI in education can \"undermine children's foundational development\" and that \"the damages it has already caused are daunting,\" though fixable. Here's what the report discovered:    💻 AI can help students learn how to read and write. It has been found to be most effective when supplementing, rather than replacing, the efforts of a teacher.💻 Students increasingly offloading their own thinking onto the technology can lead to the kind of cognitive decline more commonly associated with aging brains.💻 An issue with kids' overuse of AI is that the technology has been designed to reinforce users' beliefs, which can be a concern when it comes to developing social-emotional skills.   Explore these recommendations to help harness the benefits of AI without exposing children to the risks that the technology currently poses.

Body dissatisfaction is increasing among young people, and it is starting to impact more boys, according to clinicians, including Dr. Jason Nagata. This developing trend challenges a long-held tendency in medicine that associates body image concerns mainly with girls. Some teenage boys striving for muscularity like their social media idols can develop compulsive, dangerous gym and diet habits. Nagata says negative body image attitudes in boys often stem from the feeling that they aren't muscular enough. A small portion of those young men develop an obsession with getting bigger and more muscular, also known as bigorexia.    🏋️‍♂️ Bigorexia was first described in a 1993 case report, but it has remained relatively understudied until recently.🏋️‍♂️ The three major pressures that contribute to the rise of muscle dysmorphia and men's desire to build muscle are family, peers and the media.🏋️‍♂️Nagata estimated that a third of teenage boys in the U.S. try to bulk up. However, the lack of awareness of the condition makes it harder to pin down how many develop bigorexia.   \n   3 things to know before you go   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                This screengrab from video provided by NASA TV shows the SpaceX Dragon capsule departing from the International Space Station shortly after undocking with four NASA Crew-11 members inside on Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026.\n                \n                    AP/NASA\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        AP/NASA\n    \n\n   \n   NASA's Crew-11 splashed down in the Pacific Ocean off San Diego in their SpaceX Dragon capsule after a nearly 10-hour journey from the International Space Station, completing the first medical evacuation from the orbiting lab.Let Freedom Ring, an annual signature concert celebrating the life of Martin Luther King Jr., is moving from the Kennedy Center to the Howard Theatre to save money.This week's Far-Flung Postcard takes you to the Hospitaller Fortress in Acre, Israel.

Big Stick policy. Gunboat diplomacy.   Until recently, the terms were relegated mostly to the pages of dusty history books. But President Trump is leaning heavily on his own understanding of these concepts to justify his attack on Venezuela, his bullying tactics aimed at acquiring Greenland and his latest threats to strike Iran.   At a news conference this month, Trump said U.S. troops captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro because his actions amounted to a \"gross violation of the core principles of American foreign policy dating back more than two centuries … to the Monroe Doctrine.\"   \n   \"And the Monroe Doctrine is a big deal, but we've superseded it by a lot, by a real lot. They now call it the 'Donroe Doctrine,'\" he said.   What is the Monroe Doctrine?   In 1823, President James Monroe cautioned Europe in his address to Congress, declaring that \"any attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of\" the Western Hemisphere would be seen as \"dangerous to our peace and safety.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A painting of James Monroe, the fifth president of the United States, who served from 1817 to 1825. The doctrine named after him has served as a justification for U.S. intervention in Latin America and elsewhere.\n                \n                    National Archives/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        National Archives/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Monroe's declaration came at a time when Spain was struggling to hang on to its North American possessions — areas on the continent that included parts of Florida and vast areas of the present-day U.S. Southwest.   The Monroe Doctrine \"emerged from a geopolitical context in which the United States was a rising power, staking a claim to the Western Hemisphere as its sphere of influence,\" says Jay Sexton, director of the Kinder Institute on Constitutional Democracy at the University of Missouri.   \n   At its inception, the doctrine \"simply stated what European powers could not do in the Western Hemisphere\" but was deliberately open-ended, allowing \"later Americans [to] redeploy it or reimagine it for a new context,\" adds Sexton, who is author of The Monroe Doctrine: Empire and Nation in Nineteenth-Century America.   In fact, eight decades later, President Theodore Roosevelt reimagined the Monroe Doctrine as a more muscular policy — in part as a response to Britain, Germany and Italy's naval blockade of Venezuelan ports over that country's failure to pay on foreign debts. In his 1904 annual message to Congress, Roosevelt argued that \"chronic wrongdoing\" on the world stage required \"intervention by some civilized nation.\"   \n   \"In the Western Hemisphere the adherence of the United States to the Monroe Doctrine may force the United States, however reluctantly, in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or impotence, to the exercise of an international police power,\" he said.   \"Roosevelt strongly believed that the real advances are through diplomacy — slow, patient diplomacy — and not through military instruments,\" says Jon Alterman, the Brzezinski chair in global security and geostrategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a bipartisan research organization in Washington, D.C.   \n   In contrast, he says, Trump \"seems to think that the diplomacy stuff is slow and hard and imperfect, and the nice thing about the military is that things … [are] sharp and clear and successful.\"   In 1907, Roosevelt famously dispatched a flotilla of 16 U.S. battleships, dubbed the \"Great White Fleet,\" on a global circumnavigation to showcase American strength to potential rivals, particularly an increasingly assertive Japan. However, Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University, emphasizes that Roosevelt's flotilla \"didn't go to war,\" but rather \"he brought it to the Pacific and said, 'Look at how large our navy is.'\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Theodore Roosevelt (center) sits on a steam shovel at the Culebra Cut of the Panama Canal in November 1906.\n                \n                    U.S. Library of Congress/AFP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        U.S. Library of Congress/AFP\n    \n\n   \n   Even so, the Roosevelt Corollary, as it came to be known, justified intervention in Latin America to maintain regional stability, such as the U.S. support for Panama's secession from Colombia, which allowed the construction of the Panama Canal, and the sending of U.S. troops to Cuba in 1906 to quell an insurrection there. The corollary reflected Roosevelt's broader Big Stick philosophy — \"speak softly and carry a big stick\" — prioritizing diplomacy first, with military force as a last resort. Trump's approach appears to flip those priorities, says Michael Cullinane, chair of Theodore Roosevelt studies at Dickinson State University.   Cullinane notes that in the case of Venezuela, \"the lead-up to what Trump did is very similar to what Roosevelt did, but the 'speak softly' bit was missing.\" Trump, he says, \"didn't conduct diplomacy before using the big stick. He just used the big stick.\"   \n   The emergence of American \"gunboat diplomacy\"   Expanding on the policies of Monroe and Roosevelt, President Woodrow Wilson took \"gunboat diplomacy\" to a new level.   Using America's growing naval power, Wilson demonstrated a more aggressive, interventionist approach than his predecessors, sending U.S. Marines to invade Haiti and the neighboring Dominican Republic to secure U.S. financial interests on Hispaniola. He inherited a U.S. Marine presence in Nicaragua ordered by his predecessor, William Howard Taft. Wilson later ordered the U.S. Navy to occupy the Mexican port of Veracruz as part of a campaign to depose Mexico's dictator. He also sent U.S. forces across the border in pursuit of Mexican guerrilla leader Pancho Villa.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                This political cartoon depicts President Woodrow Wilson handing a thick, heavy olive branch, representing the League of Nations, to a dove of peace, in 1919.\n                \n                    Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Wilson's policies may be the better analogy to Trump's own interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine. Like Trump, Wilson wanted to be seen as a peacemaker, famously pushing for the League of Nations — a predecessor to the United Nations — in the wake of World War I. \"The paradox of the Wilson years is that Wilson is the president that orders the most interventions in the Caribbean and Central America,\" Sexton says.   But Brinkley warns against \"overthinking Trump's thinking\" on foreign policy. He argues that Trump \"just cherry-picks what's convenient from the bushel of American history.\"   Ultimately, Trump's famously transactional nature translates into a type of realpolitik that informs his relations with others.   Roosevelt is on Mount Rushmore and helped negotiate an end to the Russo-Japanese War, for which he won the Nobel Peace Prize — an honor that Trump has repeatedly insisted he deserves.   But Trump is no Teddy Roosevelt, Cullinane says. Among other things, \"disrespecting international law is something that Roosevelt would not have done.\"   \"Roosevelt supported international arbitration. ... That is very different from how Donald Trump is approaching international relations,\" Cullinane says.   U.S. interventions in Latin America continued after World War II, but the Monroe Doctrine was invoked less often, Sexton says. That's because the doctrine \"arose from a geopolitical context in which the United States was a rising power and was staking a claim to the Western Hemisphere to its sphere of influence.\"   \n   With the U.S. emerging from World War II as a truly global power, it didn't seem to fit.   \"But as that world order has begun to unravel [and has] begun crashing down, spheres of influence are making a return,\" he says.\n",

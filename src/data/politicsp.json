Josh Shapiro has dealt with plenty of weighty topics. He's investigated abuse in the Catholic Church as Pennsylvania's attorney general. He and his family were the victims of an arson attack in 2005 – an attack that was motivated, in part, by his Jewish faith. And the Democrat dislikes what he's seeing from the Trump administration, which he describes as \"chaos and cruelty.\"   But the governor, in his first term leading Pennsylvania, tells NPR, \"I see people who are bringing light in their communities every single day, solving problems.\"   Shapiro is often mentioned in conversations about Democrats who might vie for the White House in 2028, but for now, he says, he's focused on the midterms. He's running for a second term, and he's got his eye on election security, in anticipation of conspiracy theories and lawsuits that could undermine the process.   \n   Shapiro sat down with All Things Considered in an interview timed to the release of his memoir, Where We Keep the Light. He shares his memories of that terrible night during Passover, when for the first time, he listened to a law enforcement briefing not just as a leader, but as a victim.\n",

The newfound focus on the South American country and future uncertainty has raised questions about whether Rubio, a Venezuela hawk who also serves as the national security adviser, has too much influence.   Rubio is the first person to hold both roles at the same time since Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in the 1970s.   But the White House says the old National Security Council structures were too bloated and are ultimately unsuited for how this administration does business.   \n   \"This is a top-down, not a bottom-up process. The president was elected by the American people to carry out his foreign policy agenda, and he ultimately decides, based on what he feels, is the best choice for the American people,\" said a White House official not authorized to speak on the record.    John Bolton, who served as Trump's national security adviser in the first administration, says it's no knock on Rubio, but \"I'm not sure anybody, including Henry Kissinger, really has the bandwidth to do it.\"   The national security adviser is supposed to help make sense of the different complexities facing the U.S. and guide the president toward more measured choices.   Trump asked Rubio to take on yet another full-time role managing the sprawling national security apparatus last year, replacing Michael Waltz, who had come under scrutiny for adding a reporter to an online chat discussing the U.S. military strike in Yemen.   According to Bolton, Trump and Rubio have made it harder by slashing the NSC and upending the process that's traditionally served as the hub for all the different agencies, like the departments of State and Defense and Treasury.   \"There's no guarantee that following the process will result in a successful policy,\" Bolton said. \"But the odds are you're going to have more success. If you think about the pluses and minuses of the different options, weigh the considerations and try to have some coherent plan you're following.\"   \n   Bolton became a fierce critic after he was fired from the administration. Since then, Trump's Justice Department launched a prosecution into Bolton for allegedly mishandling classified information, which he denies.    It's not only Venezuela that Rubio must deal with. It's also Ukraine, Gaza, Iran and Greenland.   Emily Horne, who served as NSC spokesperson in the Biden administration, questioned how much advanced analysis was conducted on the geopolitical implications of the Venezuela operation. She says it's unclear how extensively they gamed out how the operation plays with adversaries and allies, despite the obvious, careful military planning.   \"However, that's a different thing than saying that we were bringing everything we could to both executing this operation and ensuring that we know what the day after or the week after and beyond look like,\" said Horne, who now writes an online newsletter on politics and policy.   The White House official pushed back on such characterizations, describing them as \"inside baseball\" complaints that did not resonate considering the success seen so far.   \"I feel like that's totally negated by the fact that things are stable and going well and there is a cooperative economic relationship in place, and we have maximum leverage over the regime,\" the White House official said.   The White House official says the fact Rubio is handling both roles and the streamlining process of NSC operations allows for Rubio to be more effective at carrying out Trump's directives. Rubio is at the White House almost daily, the official said.   A senior administration official, not authorized to speak on the record, pointed to Rubio's three-phase plan, which he is expected to go into further detail with to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   Step one is stabilization and not allowing the country to devolve into chaos. The second phase is moving to recovery, while ensuring American companies have access to the Venezuelan market. The third phase is transition.   \n   The senior administration official said many critics want to jump to the last phase and elections, but they're forgetting about the lessons of Iraq.   \"That wasn't exactly ideal, right!\" the official said. \"When you sort of decapitate all the instruments of government, you create an insurgency that takes 20 years to quell.\"   The official pointed to a more streamlined NSC that is focused on executing the president's priorities, instead of serving as a policy-making apparatus competing with other agencies.   Alexander Gray, who was chief of staff for the White House National Security Council in Trump's first term, told NPR's Tamara Keith that an \"honest broker\" is less necessary when you have a general meeting of the minds on the big issues.   \"The benefit, so to speak, of a national security adviser who's also secretary of state in terms of shaping the process is less significant when people are generally aligned,\" said Gray, who now serves as a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, which promotes geopolitical cooperation between the U.S. and allies.   Rubio is at the center of it all. And he's taken aim at the foreign policy apparatus, describing institutions like the NSC and State Department as having been ossified and out of touch.   Following Maduro's capture, Rubio said the message to the world is that this administration isn't going to let any kind of internal hemming and hawing stop the U.S.   \"I can tell you, I've watched this process now for 14, 15 years,\" Rubio said. \"I've been around it. Everybody talks. 'I'm going to do this. I'm going to do that. When I get there, we're going to do this.' This is a president of action. I don't understand how they haven't figured this out.\"\n",

It's the latest rebuke of the Trump administration's handling of the escalating political unrest in the city, just two days after intensive care nurse Alex Pretti was shot and killed by a federal agent during protests over the weekend. Both Pretti and Good were U.S. citizens and 37 years old.   \n   Despite originally supporting ICE's effort in the city, known as Operation Metro Surge, Madel called it \"an unmitigated disaster\" in his video, arguing it had \"expanded far beyond its stated focus on true public safety threats.\"   \n   \"United States citizens, particularly those of color, live in fear,\" he added. \"United States citizens are carrying papers to prove their citizenship. That's wrong.\"   Madel, a political newcomer, announced his bid for governor in December, vowing to make supporting law enforcement a priority of his campaign. He told the Minnesota Star Tribune earlier this month that he was providing legal counsel for the ICE agent who shot Good and that it did not change his political ambitions.   Despite Madel's exit from the race, there's still a crowded field of GOP candidates vying to lead Minnesota, a state that hasn't elected a Republican governor in roughly 20 years. Several candidates still in the race have not criticized the administration over ICE practices, while others have voiced continued support for the federal response.   The Minnesota gubernatorial race garnered national attention after the state's current governor, Democrat Tim Walz, announced he would no longer seek a third term amid blowback from the White House over his oversight of alleged social service fraud in the state.   \n   The fraud scandal unfolded as Minneapolis was already quickly becoming the center of a political fight between President Trump and Minnesota Democrats over the state's immigration laws and practices.   Both fatal shootings of Good and Pretti this month have further intensified that fight. But it also prompted several national Republicans to call for the Trump administration to cooperate with state and local authorities after shutting them out in both investigations.   \n   \"The events in Minneapolis are incredibly disturbing,\" Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said in a statement on Saturday. \"The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake. There must be a full joint federal and state investigation. We can trust the American people with the truth.\"   Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., echoed those calls for a federal-state probe, adding that \"any administration official who rushes to judgment and tries to shut down an investigation before it begins are doing an incredible disservice to the nation and to President Trump's legacy.\"   Administration officials have claimed that Pretti — who had a lawful permit to carry a handgun — was a \"domestic terrorist,\" and defended the response by federal agents as self-defense. However, footage captured in bystander videos and witness accounts contradicts that argument, and there has been no evidence that NPR has verified of Pretti brandishing his handgun at any time during the encounter with federal agents.   \"Lawfully carrying a firearm does not justify federal agents killing an American—especially, as video footage appears to show, after the victim had been disarmed,\" Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said in a statement Sunday.   \"A comprehensive, independent investigation of the shooting must be conducted in order to rebuild trust and Congressional committees need to hold hearings and do their oversight work\" she added. \"ICE agents do not have carte blanche in carrying out their duties.\"   Oklahoma Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt expressed concern about the administration's handling of the situation in Minneapolis, telling CNN in an interview Sunday that the president was \"getting bad advice.\"   \n   \"President Trump closed the border, promised to get violent criminals out of our country,\" Stitt said, adding that while he believes \"everybody agrees with that,\" Americans are unsure about the administration's \"endgame.\"   \"What's the goal right now? Is it to deport every single non-U.S. citizen? I don't think that's what Americans want,\" he said. \"We have to stop politicizing this. We need real solutions on immigration reform.\"   \n   On Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt doubled down on the administration's goal of deporting criminals living in the country without legal status, but acknowledged that no one in the White House wants to \"see people getting hurt or killed in America's streets.\"   \"This includes Renee Good, Alex Pretti, the brave men and women of federal law enforcement and the many Americans who have been victimized at the hands of illegal alien criminals,\" she said.   In a post on Truth Social Monday, Trump said that he spoke with Walz and that the two \"seemed to be on a similar wavelength\" in trying to reduce additional violence in Minneapolis, and said that the two leaders would speak again in the \"near future.\"   Walz also acknowledged a more \"cordial\" tone with the president in an interview with MPR News on Monday.   \"Whatever has happened here, there is a definite change of tone,\" Walz said. \"There is a definitely a more collaborative tone. I want to make sure that I'm not jeopardizing that, that I'm going to take them for their word right now, that they're going to reduce this force.\"   Walz also said that Greg Bovino, a Border Patrol commander, will be leaving Minnesota.\n",

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent canceled a total of 31 contracts with Booz Allen, totaling $21 million. The company's stock fell more than 8%.    \"Canceling these contracts is an essential step to increasing Americans' trust in government,\" Bessent said in a statement.  \"Booz Allen failed to implement adequate safeguards to protect sensitive data, including the confidential taxpayer information it had access to through its contracts with the Internal Revenue Service.   \n   That information was the basis of explosive stories in the New York Times and ProPublica, showing how wealthy people like Donald Trump, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos manage to minimize their tax obligations.     A Booz Allen contractor, Charles Edward Littlejohn, pleaded guilty in 2023 to leaking the confidential data to reporters. He was sentenced to five years in prison.     Booz Allen said it was surprised by the Treasury Department's decision to cancel its contracts.    \"Booz Allen has zero tolerance for violations of the law and operates under the highest ethical and professional guidelines,\" the company said in a statement. \"When Littlejohn's criminal conduct occurred more than five years ago, it was on government systems, not Booz Allen systems. Booz Allen stores no taxpayer data on its systems and has no ability to monitor activity on government networks.\"   The company also said it assisted the government in its investigation of Littlejohn, which aided in his prosecution.  \n",

In a letter to Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Bondi wrote: \"You and your office must restore the rule of law, support ICE officers, and bring an end to the chaos in Minnesota.\"   The letter was dated Saturday, the same day Alex Pretti, a nurse and U.S. citizen, was shot and killed by immigration officers — the second fatal shooting by federal agents this month.   \n   Bondi urged Walz to embrace what she called \"common sense solutions,\" including repealing what the Trump administration terms \"sanctuary policies\" and cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Minnesota state officials say the Trump administration is making false claims about its cooperation with ICE.   Walz, who's called on the Trump administration to end its operation in Minnesota, dismissed the letter in a news conference Sunday.   The letter also calls on the state to \"share all of Minnesota's records\" relating to Medicaid and food assistance programs, including SNAP, with the federal government.   The Trump administration has cited allegations of fraud, especially relating to immigrants of Somali descent, in its immigration crackdown.   Minnesota is one of more than 20 states that has so far refused to comply with a demand from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to turn over personal information about people who have applied for or received SNAP benefits over the last six years. The states have argued the demand is unlawful and a federal judge in California issued a preliminary ruling indicating they were likely to prevail in that claim.   Minnesota was also one of 22 states that sued to block the Department of Health and Human Services from sharing sensitive Medicaid data with the Department of Homeland Security to aid in immigration enforcement efforts. In December, a different federal judge in California ruled that limited data sharing, including addresses and immigration status, could go forward.   \n   Bondi makes new demand for voter data   Bondi also made a seemingly unrelated request: for Minnesota's voter data.   It's not the first time the Department of Justice has sought the state's voter information — and it's an ask that's not isolated to Minnesota.   Instead, it's the latest escalation in the Trump administration's nationwide attempt to consolidate data and execute unprecedented oversight into the country's voting systems.   The DOJ is currently suing Minnesota and roughly two dozen other states — all states Trump lost in the 2020 election — trying to compel them to share unredacted versions of their voter lists with the federal government. The DOJ has claimed it needs the data to enforce federal election law.   Those suits have yet to be successful anywhere, though.   A federal judge in California recently dismissed a suit there, writing that the request was \"unprecedented and illegal,\" and another judge in Oregon signaled that he planned to do the same. A third judge in Georgia dismissed the suit in that state based on a jurisdictional issue.   Minnesota's chief voting official, Democrat Steve Simon, alluded to those outcomes in a statement declining Bondi's request.   \"The law does not give the federal government the authority to obtain this private data,\" Simon said. \"It is deeply disturbing that the U.S. Attorney General would make this unlawful request a part of an apparent ransom to pay for our state's peace and security.\"   Election law expert Rick Hasen, of UCLA School of Law, echoed those concerns in a strongly worded blog post over the weekend.   \"This is outrageous and reprehensible,\" Hasen wrote. \"It shows ICE is not in Minneapolis for law enforcement or immigration purposes. They are there to stir up s*** in blue states and try to extort them …\"   The federal government has not been clear on exactly how it plans to use or securely store the data, but it's become clear that part of their plans include running voting lists through a revamped system at the Department of Homeland Security meant to search for noncitizens.   \n   NPR was the first news outlet to report on the details of the system, known as SAVE, but tens of millions of records have now been run through it, and no evidence of the sort of widespread voter fraud Trump has long talked about has come to light.   It's also unclear how accurate the system is. In one county in Texas, a state that voluntarily agreed to run its list through the system, at least 15 of the 84 voters the system flagged as noncitizens there were false positives.   NPR's Jude Joffe-Block contributed reporting.\n",

    "body": "\n      Data centers used to fuel artificial intelligence are popping up all over the country, and they're  becoming a midterm issue for voters that's now drawing White House attention.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Voters around the country are pushing back against the building of data centers for artificial intelligence. The large-scale facilities are necessary to match the demand for AI, but there are high energy costs that come with them. It's an issue that was critical in key state elections last year. Now it's becoming a midterm issue and is drawing White House attention. NPR White House correspondent Deepa Shivaram traveled to Hanover, Virginia, and brings us this report.DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: The most popular sign for anti-data-center protesters in Hanover County reads, grow tomatoes, not data centers. They're everywhere, says Jennifer Corpus, a Hanover resident.JENNIFER CORPUS: And I think it's, like, that emotional tie to being, like, this is our county, and this is something that our county's known for. Like, why do we want to be known for data centers? We don't.SHIVARAM: Corpus has been leading protests to convince local leaders to vote against plans for four new data centers in the area.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) The data center's bound to fail.UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: Hanover is not for sale.SHIVARAM: She's concerned about everything from how data centers will impact rural land to higher energy costs.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CORPUS: Hanover residents do not want data centers.(CHEERING)SHIVARAM: The rise of data centers has become a particular issue in Virginia, which has the highest number of data centers than anywhere in the world. An independent review commissioned by the state government showed that by 2040, Virginians could be paying up to $37 more per month in energy costs. In other states, like Wisconsin, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, similar fights are popping up. Brendan Steinhauser leads The Alliance for Secure AI, a group pushing for more AI safeguards. He says the pushback against data centres reflects people's larger fears.BRENDAN STEINHAUSER: There's a fear that's out there that is real and that is palpable that is informing the way they think about these huge facilities that they see in their neighborhood. And they're like, what is happening? Why is this happening so fast? Why didn't I get a say in this?SHIVARAM: Proponents say they're crucial for everyday technology use and bring jobs to the area. But the debate has started to become seeped in politics, and it's not exactly divided by party. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucuses with Democrats, has pushed for a nationwide moratorium. Republicans like Missouri Senator Josh Hawley and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis are both pushing for more regulations. Here's the governor last month.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RON DESANTIS: There are some people that say, you know, the right policy is to just give Big Tech whatever they want, subsidize it and all this stuff, and somehow that's going to lead us to some happy place. You know, I reject that.SHIVARAM: And while President Trump and his AI czar, David Sacks, have been advocating for more data centers and working closely with tech companies, the White House is starting to respond to voters' cost concerns, though they have no authority over how private companies can operate. Tech companies, though, are starting to act amid the public backlash. OpenAI and Microsoft both announced initiatives to lower energy and water usage around their data centers. Here's Dan Diorio from the Data Center Coalition, a group that represents companies like Meta and Amazon.DAN DIORIO: The industry is committed to being a responsible partner in the communities and where they locate, but also a responsive partner.SHIVARAM: As both parties gear up for elections later this year, how they talk about data centers could be critical, especially because it hasn't been defined by party lines, says Steinhauser.STEINHAUSER: On this issue, for whatever reason, people are just so concerned about it. And they're so worried about it that I think they're just cheering anyone who is saying the right things or is expressing skepticism.SHIVARAM: That's certainly true for Hanover residents, including Corpus. She says the issue will be a big part of how she votes in local elections.CORPUS: If someone told me they were anti-data center, they'd have my vote.SHIVARAM: All the other disagreements, Corpus says, can wait.Deepa Shivaram, NPR News, Hanover, Virginia.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

Senate Democrats say they will not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security without new guardrails for immigration enforcement.   But that opposition may also torpedo the larger $1.3 trillion spending package needed to keep large swaths of the federal government operational past Friday night.   \n   \"The appalling murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis must lead Republicans to join Democrats in overhauling ICE and CBP to protect the public,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote on Sunday. \"People should be safe from abuse by their own government.\"   Democrats were already raising alarms about the conduct of immigration officers before the latest killing in Minneapolis on Saturday.   Last week, all but seven House Democrats voted against the funding bill covering homeland security, which includes money for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.   \n   At the time, a few Senate Democrats also pledged to vote against the funding when it reached them this week, though the response across the Capitol was far from the near-unified opposition in the House.   That is because the House sent the DHS funding over to the Senate tied together with billions in spending for defense, health, transportation and other federal agencies, in part to expedite the process as Congress races to meet a Friday deadline to keep the government fully open.   \"The hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need,\" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Senate appropriations committee, wrote in a statement last week saying she would vote for the total package.   After Pretti's shooting on Saturday by a Border Patrol agent, Murray said she would join her Democratic colleagues in opposing the funding.   Congress faces Friday deadline to avert a partial shutdown   The timeline was already tight once a winter storm delayed the first Senate votes of the week until Tuesday night. But the renewed debate over immigration enforcement is complicating the task more.   Schumer wants to cleave the DHS measure from everything else. The other remaining spending measures have overwhelming bipartisan support. Democrats want to continue negotiating the DHS funding bill without shutting down large parts of the government.   \n   The funding measure needs to reach a 60-vote threshold to pass, meaning some Democratic support is needed for it to clear the Senate. But disentangling different parts of the legislation requires buy-in from Republicans, and so far, GOP leadership has not indicated that they are willing to separate the funding bills.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Flowers, signs and mementos are seen Monday at a makeshift memorial in the area where Alex Pretti was shot dead by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis. On January 24, federal agents shot and killed Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, while scuffling with him on an icy roadway.\n                \n                    Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Senate Majority Leader John Thune's communications director, Ryan Wrasse, wrote on X on Monday that the Senate will proceed as planned to consider all the funding bills together.   \"A government shutdown, even a partial one, does not serve the American people well,\" he wrote. \"Hopefully Senate Democrats, who are actively engaged in conversations, can find a path forward to join us before this week's funding deadline hits.\"   Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the appropriations committee chair, told The New York Times over the weekend, \"I'm exploring all options. We have five other bills that are really vital, and I'm relatively confident they would pass.\"   Collins, who is up for reelection and whose state is also a target of immigration raids by the Trump administration, is among the Republicans who have expressed fresh concerns about the tactics, calling for an investigation.   A handful of Republicans have called for congressional hearings or offered sharper criticism.   \"My support for funding ICE remains the same,\" Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., wrote in a statement. \"But we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble.\"   Even if Democrats could convince Republicans to agree to separate DHS funding from the rest, that would mean the legislation needs approval again in the House, which is on recess until Feb. 2. It is unlikely that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., would call members back to Washington early, increasing the risk of a partial shutdown.   Why Democrats are willing to risk another shutdown   Before this weekend, few lawmakers expressed appetite for another shutdown after a record 43-day one this fall. For weeks, Democrats withheld their votes from a short-term funding measure to reopen the government without a deal to extend expiring health insurance subsidies.   \n   Eventually, a handful of Democrats joined with Republicans to reopen the government, with the promise of a vote on the subsidies. That vote failed in December. The deal included the passage of three bipartisan spending packages for veterans, agriculture and other areas through the end of September 2026 and a short-term extension for everything else through Jan. 30.   Congress has already passed several more full-year funding bills through September, but the measures still awaiting final passage in the Senate account for 75% of annual federal discretionary spending.   But even Democrats who ultimately voted with Republicans to end the last funding stalemate now say they will vote against the DHS funding despite the risk of another shutdown.   \"We have bipartisan agreement on 96% of the budget,\" Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto, D-Nev., wrote in a statement. \"We've already passed six funding bills. Let's pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans' constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement's essential role to keep us safe.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Federal agents look on as demonstrators gather near the site of where Alex Pretti was fatally shot by.\n                \n                    Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Holding up the DHS funding bill would not halt the administration's immigration crackdown. Last summer, Congressional Republicans allocated $75 billion for ICE over four years in President Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill.\"   Democrats say they do not want to give ICE the roughly $10 billion base funding that is on the line now. But more so, Democrats see this as rare leverage in the minority to extract policy changes.   Democrats already negotiated to include $20 million in funding for officer-worn body cameras, plus more funding for oversight and a reduction in funding for enforcement and removal operations and detention bed capacity. But most Democrats said this did not go far enough.   Democrats want more sweeping reforms to reign in the tactics, such as prohibiting ICE from deploying excessive force and explicitly preventing them from raiding places of worship, hospitals and schools. Republicans previously rejected these demands.   \n   The DHS funding bill also includes funding for the Transportation Security Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.   But Democrats are betting that the American public is on their side. A recent New York Times poll found that a majority of respondents said the federal immigration tactics have gone too far.   Nearly $1.3 trillion in federal funding is at stake   The funding fight over DHS is the latest dispute over funding in Congress. Last year, the Trump administration moved to rescind billions in federal funding appropriated by Congress for foreign aid and public broadcasting — and proposed a budget slashing nondiscretionary funding by some 20%.   Instead, the final legislation keeps federal nondiscretionary spending essentially flat. For example, the administration called for cutting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by 50%. Under the bipartisan health spending bill, the agency's funding would remain roughly unchanged.   Bill Hoagland, senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former longtime appropriations committee staffer, said this is striking considering Congress has mostly followed Trump's lead.   \"Congress is starting to show a little bit of backbone,\" Hoagland said. \"I think there is increasing recognition of the need to have Congress exert its power of the purse.\"   Hoagland also notes that Congress is nearly a quarter of the way into the fiscal year, so once lawmakers greenlight the remaining funding, it will not be too long before the appropriations process begins again.\n",

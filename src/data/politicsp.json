Under the plan, the Senate will vote on five appropriations bills before the weekend, according to sources familiar with the agreement who were not authorized to discuss details publicly. They will not vote on the sixth bill — which funds the Department of Homeland Security — as it is currently written. Instead, they'll vote on a separate two-week continuing resolution for DHS.   This will allow various federal agencies to be funded, pending House approval, while carving out time for negotiators to make changes to the DHS appropriations bill.    \n   President Trump endorsed the deal on social media, writing he was working with Congress \"to ensure that we are able to fully fund the Government, without delay.\"   \"Republicans and Democrats in Congress have come together to get the vast majority of the Government funded until September, while at the same time providing an extension to the Department of Homeland Security (including the very important Coast Guard, which we are expanding and rebuilding like never before). Hopefully, both Republicans and Democrats will give a very much needed Bipartisan \"YES\" Vote,\" Trump wrote.    After Senate passage, the House will need to pass these bills in order to avoid a lapse in government funding. Because the House is currently on recess until Monday, a short-term shutdown appears all but inevitable.   If the House acts quickly upon returning, the effects of a shutdown could be extremely limited, as most federal offices are closed on the weekend.   Democrats want to see major changes to DHS   In the aftermath of the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis by federal agents on Saturday, Democrats have demanded significant reforms at the Department of Homeland Security and the ongoing immigration enforcement actions led by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).   \n   Democrats are calling for broad changes to the way DHS agents are carrying out their work. This includes barring them from wearing masks, requiring body cameras, setting rules around warrants and creating a uniform code of conduct and use-of-force rules.   \"Until ICE is properly reined in and overhauled legislatively, the DHS funding bill doesn't have the votes to pass,\" Schumer said Wednesday.   The Senate failed to advance the complete six-bill funding package Thursday, as eight Republicans joined with Democrats to prevent the plan from clearing a procedural vote. The final tally was 45 to 55.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Steve Inskeep asks Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff whether his party is willing to allow a partial government shutdown in order to block new funding for the Department of Homeland Security.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  The Democrats who say they're willing to block funding include Senator Adam Schiff of California, who's on the line. Senator, welcome back.ADAM SCHIFF: Thank you. Good to be with you.INSKEEP: I think I understood from Claudia what happens there if you don't reach a deal by tomorrow night. It sounds like the whole government may be affected, not just DHS. Is that right?SCHIFF: Maybe not the whole government because some funding passed in previous legislation that continues for many months more, but much of the government will shut down unless there is a deal reached by midnight tomorrow.INSKEEP: And you're willing to pay that price.SCHIFF: Well, it'll be the Republicans who make that decision. We want the bill separated from DHS. I'm not prepared to spend another dime on ICE unless there's just a massive set of reforms that include things like ending these indiscriminate sweeps of cities, the deployment of mass numbers of ill-trained ICE troops to places that mayors and governors don't want them, the continued wearing of masks. The masks should be gone. They should be wearing bodycams and have ID. We also want to make sure that there's compliance with the law when it comes to warrants. There should be arrest warrants. If you're going to go into someone's home, you need a judicially signed warrant. None of these administrative warrants signed within DHS. There's going to have to be a lot of wholesale reforms, including an end to the excessive use of force and accountability - real investigations with the participation of state and local police.INSKEEP: We heard John Thune there say that he's reluctant to write those provisions into law, wants you to work something out with the White House, some kind of executive order. What do you make of that?SCHIFF: That's a no-go. I mean, there's absolutely no trust in this administration. And even though the president sounds like he is backpedaling at the moment, you know, that changes from hour to hour. He made some mitigating statements, and then they - he followed them with, again, more attacks on Alex Pretti, more lies about Alex Pretti. So there's no trust in this president. So I think in order for this to work, there's going to have to be real written statutory limits on what ICE and the Customs and Border Protection could do.INSKEEP: Is Senator Thune effectively telling you who's in charge here? Republicans in Congress are going to defer to him anyway.SCHIFF: Well, I don't know. Many Republicans are speaking...INSKEEP: I mean to Trump, of course, is what I mean. But go on, please.SCHIFF: Yeah. Well, look, ultimately, Republicans in Congress have a statutory and a constitutional duty themselves, and that duty is not to do whatever the person or the president wants. It's to do their constitutional duty. So they need to rise up and grow a spine and make sure that we put an end to the murder of people in our streets. You're hearing some Republicans speak out and differ with the president. But whether that will continue, you know, past his prologue, I'm not optimistic. But in this moment, we're going to insist on real changes to ICE. Otherwise, they're certainly not going to have my vote.INSKEEP: You've just made an argument for lawmakers not necessarily doing what the president wants but following their duty. And this raises another question about people in the executive branch. We have some news here, Senator. On Wednesday, we're told the FBI served a search warrant at the election headquarters in Fulton County, Georgia, which includes most of Atlanta. They're looking for ballots from the 2020 election. What do you make of the FBI taking such a step seemingly in support of President Trump's baseless theory that he won in 2020?SCHIFF: Americans really need to, you know, wake up to what's happening here. If they're going to use the FBI unlawfully to do an investigation to once again prove nonexistent fraud from an election the president continues to lie about, then what are they prepared to do in the midterm election? What abuse of power will they use? Will they invoke the Insurrection Act and station police outside of polling stations or military outside of polling stations to try to intimidate people? Will they seize ballots, as they're trying to do in Georgia now? If they'll do that over a past election, will they do that over a present election? So this needs to be a wake-up call, I think, for all of us.On the January 6 Committee, I handled the hearing that looked into Georgia. I still remember vividly that call the president made where he badgered the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to find 11,780 votes that didn't exist. If he was willing to do that then, what more is he willing to do in this much more lawless administration to try to overturn the results or prevent people's vote from counting?INSKEEP: Senator, I'm glad you mentioned the elections coming this fall. A few days ago on this program, we had Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, on. And she described Democrats - really smart Democrats, in her opinion - being around the tabletop, making plans for what might go wrong, what might happen and how to respond. Can you talk to me a little bit about that? What are Democrats doing, so far as you know, to prepare for whatever you think might happen this fall?SCHIFF: We are doing exactly that, which is making all the contingency plans we can. But I'll say this - I was part of the same effort four years ago during the last election, when we came up with about a thousand things that might go wrong in the election except the one that did, which was the insurrection.INSKEEP: Got it.SCHIFF: We never anticipated a mass attack on the Capitol. So I'm circumspect about everything we can anticipate. Look, a lot is going to count on whether our institutions hold, whether our military refuses to execute illegal orders, whether our Republicans are willing to defend our democracy or whether they're still going to go along with a president who simply wants to accumulate more power. There are no, you know, magic buttons to push here. Ultimately, I think it's going to count on the most important player in the political process, and that is our citizens, to make sure they overcome every hurdle to vote - and they're going to try to put hurdles in the way - and to insist that their votes count. That's the best protection we have.INSKEEP: I'm really interested to hear you say that before the 2020 election, you tried to game out what might go wrong and didn't figure out the thing that ultimately did go wrong, in your opinion. I'm just curious if you understand the state of play now. Are Democrats, for example, lining up lawyers, getting ready to make legal arguments? Is there something you can do other than going to court if something wrong, in your opinion, is taking place?SCHIFF: Yes. We are doing exactly that, and litigation is a big part of the strategy, as it was during the previous contested election. I think the challenge is the Supreme Court has never been trustworthy. It certainly isn't now, and litigation has its limits. We counted on a lot of state and local officials - Republican state and local officials to do their duty, which they did. People like Brad Raffensperger and others who said no to the president when the president was asking them to do things illegally, like Rusty Bowers, the Republican speaker in Arizona. Will Republican local elected officials - elections officials - again refuse to do things that are unethical and illegal? That was an important check that we're not sure we will have this time.INSKEEP: Adam Schiff is a Democratic senator from California. Senator Schiff, thanks very much for the time. Really appreciate it.SCHIFF: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF ROB FORD EXPLORER'S \"SPIRIT OF THE SPEED EDITION\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

PAUL, Minn. — Sen. Amy Klobuchar announced her run for Minnesota governor early Thursday with a video posted on X, following Gov. Tim Walz's recent announcement that he was ending his bid for a third term in the role.   \"Minnesotans, we've been through a lot,\" Klobuchar said in the video, going on to recount several tragedies the state has faced in recent months, including the separate shootings of two American citizens by ICE agents.   \"We cannot sugarcoat how hard this is,\" she said. \"But in these moments of enormous difficulty, we find strength in our Minnesota values of hard work, freedom and simple decency and goodwill.\"    \n   \"I believe we will stand up for what's right and fix what's wrong,\" Klobuchar added before making it official. \"That's why, today, I'm announcing my candidacy for governor of Minnesota.\"   \n            Minnesotans, we’ve been through a lot.And I believe this moment calls for grit, resilience, and faith in each other. I believe we must stand up for what’s right. And fix what’s wrong. Today, I’m announcing my candidacy for Governor. pic.twitter.com/yVnbvmMyxO— Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) January 29, 2026\n   \n   Klobuchar, who won a fourth Senate term in 2024, has racked up double-digit wins in each of her races. In 2020, she ran an unsuccessful presidential campaign among a crowded field of Democratic candidates.   When Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz announced that he would drop his bid for reelection, the idea of Klobuchar entering the race began to emerge.   \"I like my job very much,\" Klobuchar told Minnesota Public Radio on Wednesday, ahead of Thursday's announcement. \"And Minnesota has given me this honor of serving them in the Senate. But I love my state more.\"   Walz faced criticism from state Republicans to President Trump for allegations of rampant social-services fraud on his watch. There is no evidence that Walz took part in the fraud or committed any other crimes, but his political opponents say that he failed to stop the wholesale theft of taxpayer funds during his time in office.   As a sitting governor, Walz was not facing any competition from other Democratic hopefuls. Yet more than a dozen Republicans are in the governor's race, including House Speaker Lisa Demuth, the state's top Republican, businessman Kendall Qualls, state Rep. Kristin Robbins and My Pillow founder and CEO Mike Lindell.   \n   Klobuchar's entrance could upend that GOP field as well, as some of the candidates reassess their chances of defeating a durable statewide official instead of the politically wounded Walz.   Last week, when Klobuchar filed initial paperwork to run for governor, the Minnesota Republican Party called on her to resign from the Senate while she campaigns for another office.   \"Minnesota needs a governor who is all in — not a Washington insider running a gutless political audition,\" Minnesota Republican Party Chair Alex Plechash said in a statement. \"If Klobuchar can't even choose which job she wants, Minnesotans can be confident she won't have the backbone to fix the problems Democrats created.\"   Former Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty is among those who have said Republicans' chances at winning the governor's seat for the first time in 20 years would weaken if Klobuchar joined the race.   \"That's going to fundamentally change the governor's race in Minnesota,\" Pawlenty told MPR News. \"She would be a very, very formidable candidate in that race and so it changes everything.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      Democrats are demanding changes to a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security. The fight over spending could cause a partial government shutdown at the end of the week.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Senate Democrats say they're going to block a government funding package that includes money for the Department of Homeland Security until there are reforms to how immigration agents are working in this country.LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer spoke with reporters in the Capitol yesterday.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHUCK SCHUMER: Senate Democrats are united on a set of common sense and necessary policy goals that we need to rein in ICE and end the violence.INSKEEP: Either lawmakers make some agreement or there will be another partial government shutdown at the end of the day on Friday. In a few moments, we'll speak with Democratic Senator Adam Schiff. We begin with the facts.FADEL: NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales has been following this and joins us now. Good morning, Claudia.CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila.FADEL: OK, so this same package passed with significant bipartisan support last week in the House. But then we saw the killing of Alex Pretti over the weekend in Minneapolis by federal agents. So how did that change what we expect to happen in the Senate?GRISALES: Well, in some ways, it changed everything. The Senate is supposed to vote today to advance this $1.3 trillion package. It's a six-bill package, and one of those funds DHS while the other five addresses other parts of the government. And yesterday, we heard Democrats detail this list of reforms. They want to see input implemented before they support the DHS funding after federal immigration officers shot and killed Alex Pretti in Minneapolis over the weekend.FADEL: So what are they asking for?GRISALES: They want to pass those five other spending bills in the package and leave DHS out while they renegotiate those terms. Schumer told reporters he also wants new rules set around warrants. He wants tightened cooperation with local law enforcement, create a new uniform code of conduct, as well as use-of-force rules. They want more accountability and transparency, including taking off the masks and putting body cameras on. But it's unclear if the Senate can reach a deal on this in time. Otherwise, we could see other parts of the government in addition to DHS, like the Defense Department, Health and Human Services, lose funding starting this weekend.FADEL: And it takes months to negotiate...GRISALES: Right.FADEL: ...These bipartisan funding packages. So is it even possible for them to pass those kinds of changes at this point?GRISALES: Well, it is a tall order. The Senate would need consent from all of its members to split up these bills, perhaps setting up a series of new votes, renegotiate a DHS bill in time to try and pass it.FADEL: And how have Republicans responded?GRISALES: Well, Thune and other leaders maintain they can't split this package up. They know it would be a hard pass in the House. Here's Thune.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN THUNE: I think it's really important, if possible, to do it here, not to have to send it back to the House of Representatives where the future of an appropriations package, I think, would be somewhat uncertain.GRISALES: But we should note, we heard some mixed signals last night.FADEL: OK.GRISALES: Some rank-and-file Republican senators said they're on board. I heard one say at least a bunch of his colleagues would agree to the move. So it's an indicator of how at least some Republicans see this as a high political stakes moment to respond to Pretti's death.FADEL: Are there any other ways they could come to a solution without the risk of this partial shutdown?GRISALES: Well, Thune is one key Republican saying yes. He says Democrats need to work this out directly with the White House. Some suggest that could come in the form of executive orders. So we're watching ongoing conversations between Schumer, other Democrats and the White House for any clues of a different off-ramp. But we should note, many Democrats don't trust something that does not become law, so that sets up this stalemate with no clear solution at the moment.FADEL: That's NPR's Claudia Grisales.

Scott Applewhite/AP\n    \n\n   \n   With the government on the brink of a partial shutdown, the Senate is scrambling to keep funding flowing and address bipartisan distress over President Trump's immigration enforcement tactics.   But even with an agreement to fund the government, a short-term partial shutdown appears all but inevitable. The Senate still needs to vote on a plan announced by Senate Democrats, and then the House, which is in recess until Monday, needs to sign off, too.   The agreement reached Thursday night and endorsed by President Trump will fund much of the government through the end of September and temporarily fund the Department of Homeland Security for two weeks while lawmakers negotiate provisions to rein in federal immigration agents.   \n   Just a week ago, Congress was on track to approve nearly $1.3 trillion in spending for defense, health, transportation, housing and more before government funding expires Friday at midnight.   But the second deadly shooting of a U.S. citizen in Minneapolis by federal immigration officers on Saturday upended those plans, as Democrats pledged to withhold support for the funding package without policy changes on immigration enforcement.   And unlike the shutdown standoff last fall over expiring health insurance subsidies, more Republicans acknowledged that what was unfolding in Minneapolis was an inflection point that could not be ignored.   Democrats are demanding changes to how immigration officers carry out arrests and incidents are investigated, as well as mandating the use of body cameras and other reforms.   Some of the recommendations could attract Republican support. But there is still an arduous road ahead for any of them becoming law.   Why some Republicans are alarmed   In an era when congressional Republicans rarely criticize the Trump Administration, the killing of 37- year-old Alex Pretti in Minneapolis sparked unease from unexpected corners of the caucus.   \"Initial rushes to judgment did not meet the standard that Americans should expect from their government officials,\" Sen. Ted Budd, R-N.C., wrote on social media, referring to remarks by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and others who had swiftly labeled Pretti a \"domestic terrorist.\"   \n   \"Enforcing our immigration laws makes our streets safer. It also protects our national security,\" Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., wrote in a statement the day after the shooting. \"But we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble.\"   Several Republicans called for hearings and an independent investigation; DHS leaders are expected to testify in back-to-back oversight hearings next month and Noem is now due to testify in March. Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., more frequent Trump critics, have called for her resignation.   Tillis told reporters that the images coming out of Minneapolis were souring the public on the Trump administration's handling of immigration more broadly.   \"It is regrettable that the issue that Republicans always lead on, we're losing on,\" Tillis told NPR.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., speaks to reporters at the Capitol on Thursday. Tillis says the images coming out of Minneapolis have soured the public on the Trump administration's immigration policy.\n                \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   And despite initially resisting Democrats' demands to split the homeland security funding bill from the overall spending package, key Republicans eventually softened to the idea.   \"If the pathway exists that we get these five bills done and then we have time to continue to review Homeland [Security], I'm here for it,\" said Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., an appropriations committee member.   But divides continue to persist within the Republican party.   \"We're not going to keep ICE from doing their job,\" said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla. \"The American people wanted the president to enforce law and order and ICE is doing their job.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., says Republicans are \"not going to keep ICE from doing their job.\"\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican who sits on the homeland security committee, said he did not see a need for any further policy changes. He noted that the current DHS funding bill awaiting a vote already includes additional funding for body cameras and oversight.   \"I don't see one that's needed above and beyond what's already there,\" Lankford said.   What Democrats want: judicial warrants, masks off and cameras on   Democrats secured a handful of wins in the current version of the spending bill, such as reducing funding for immigration enforcement and reducing capacity at detention centers. But in the wake of Pretti's death, they say further reforms are needed.   \n   Senate Democrats have outlined three buckets of policy changes they are pursuing.   Democrats want rules around the kinds of warrants immigration officers can use to enter homes and an end to so-called \"roving patrols\" when officers conduct broad searches and stops of people they suspect of being in the country illegally.   An ICE memo unveiled in a whistleblower complaint first reported by the Associated Press last week, detailed how Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were using administrative warrants as opposed to judicial warrants, which are signed by a judge.   These administrative warrants, according to the whistleblower report, are signed by immigration agents and deportation officers.   In a letter to DHS, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said these kinds of warrants are an unlawful method of entering private residences. Administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance, have defended the approach as lawful, saying administrative warrants are still warrants.   The broad authority DHS is using has alarmed some Republicans.   \"I am not a big fan of administrative warrants. I think warrants to enter someone's house should be Fourth Amendment warrants,\" said Senate Homeland Security Committee Chair Rand Paul, R-Ky.   Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, had called for an end to the large-scale operation in her state, which resulted in the arrest of over 100 people in what ICE dubbed, \"Operation Catch of the Day.\"   \"I have been urging Secretary Noem and others in the Administration to get ICE to reconsider its approach to immigration enforcement in the state,\" Collins said in a statement, writing that she had spoken to Noem and the operation there was no longer ongoing.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem speaks during a news conference following the death of Alex Pretti. Noem and other administration officials have faced criticism, including from some Republicans, for accusing Pretti of domestic terrorism.\n                \n                    Al Drago/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Al Drago/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   But Democrats want guardrails to prevent similar \"roving\" operations in other places.   Democrats want to make it easier to pursue legal action against immigration officers and \"independent investigations\" into ICE and other federal enforcement misconduct.   Democrats have previously raised questions about the efficacy of DHS oversight mechanisms to investigate employee misconduct and critics have pointed out that the department, which houses ICE, is investigating itself in the most recent deadly incidents.   \n   In the aftermath of the shooting of Renee Macklin Good, the 37-year-old killed by an ICE officer earlier this month, the Federal Bureau of Investigations and ICE announced they would run parallel investigations and not conduct a joint investigation with state officials.   The move prompted backlash from local officials, like Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who argue that the investigation may not be fair since agency leaders were already defending the officers' conduct.   Democrats want to mandate that agents display clearer identification, not cover their faces and wear body cameras.   DHS leaders have defended the use of masks arguing that there is an increased threat of doxxing and physical threats to identified agents and their families.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A member of the U.S. Border Patrol confronts the driver of a vehicle that was following them on Jan. 29, in Minneapolis. Democrats want immigration officers to not cover their faces and wear body cameras, among other changes.\n                \n                    Stephen Maturen/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Stephen Maturen/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Body camera requirements have also come into focus after the two shootings in Minneapolis. DHS has long said it does not have enough body cameras for every single agent.   To address concerns about the lack of body cameras, the current version of the DHS spending bill, which has already passed the House, includes $20 million for cameras for ICE and Customs and Border Protection. But the bill only mandates the money be spent -- it does not mandate the use of the cameras.   \"Funding them without wearing them means nothing,\" Blumenthal told NPR.   Why Democrats feel emboldened    After a record 43-day shutdown last fall, many Democrats were weary of even a short funding lapse.   But that environment changed this week. Even five of six Democrats who broke with their party to end the last stalemate now said the risk of another shutdown was something they were willing to take on.   \"ICE is out of control, Donald Trump is out of control,\" said one of those Democrats, Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada. \"Our Constitution, not a suggestion, our Bill of Rights, not a suggestion.\"   \"I think if we're fighting for these reforms, we're exactly where the American people want us to be,\" said Sen.

And I think this is one of the few opportunities with a lawless president to have any impact.\"   Republican Capitol Hill veteran Antonia Ferrier says her old boss, former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, used to describe shutdown standoffs as box canyons — narrow gorges with no exit on the other end. \"You're making demands and there is no way out,\" Ferrier said.   But she says Democrats may feel emboldened because this moment is spurring anger and passion on both sides of the aisle that strikes at something more fundamental about the direction of the country in a way that the health subsidies debate did not.   \"What I think we're seeing right now is markedly different,\" she said. \"It was a very significant inflection point, and I think now there is just so much attention and outrage that many Republicans agree there has to be some kind of changes made.\"\n",

The Jan. 29, 2025, directive targeted antisemitism on campus and launched investigations at five schools — later widened to 60.   But within weeks of the executive order, federal agencies started withholding billions of dollars in contracts and grants from several high-profile schools and pressuring them to align their policies more closely with Trump's on a range of issues that extended beyond antisemitism.   \n   Elite universities soon began reaching settlements, starting with the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University in July. Harvard University was a notable exception, challenging the administration's actions in court. In September, a federal judge ruled in Harvard's favor that the government illegally froze more than $2 billion in federal grants and contracts, a decision the government is appealing. Despite Harvard's victory, more schools agreed to deals.    Some universities paid the government millions of dollars; others paid nothing but agreed to policy or personnel changes. But a common theme has emerged over the past year: The administration is seeking to alter the culture at these powerful institutions, barring them, for instance, from supporting programs aimed at diversity, equity and inclusion.   \n   Loading...\n   What is the administration's goal? And can it do that?    Universities have stressed that reaching a settlement doesn't mean they admit to any wrongdoing. But the deals have called for colleges to agree to policy changes, like adopting definitions of gender as laid out by the president's executive orders, affecting everything from campus housing to athletic programs.   \"In just a year, President Trump has completely transformed American higher education by restoring merit, enforcing civil rights, and eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse,\" White House spokesperson Liz Huston told NPR in an email. Huston said the Trump administration \"will keep holding even more [higher education institutions] accountable over the next three years — to promote academic excellence and maintain America's advantage for generations to come.\"   \n   But Trump's use of federal funds to force changes has raised questions from constitutional scholars about whether his tactics violate the law.   \"What I find striking and disturbing about what's happened here,\" says Thomas Berry, the director of constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, \"is that the federal government started by simply pausing all of this funding\" without proving its allegations.   Berry says that Cato doesn't love the idea of private universities being dependent on federal funds. But he also says the government shouldn't use that relationship to meddle in how schools would normally operate.   \n   \"To me, it's a blatant violation of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine of the First Amendment,\" says Berry.   The idea behind that doctrine is that a government can't say someone has to give up a constitutional right such as free speech or they won't get a benefit — like federal money.   Echoing Berry's point, Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors, says, \"Six or seven [Supreme Court] rulings from 1920 onwards all held that the federal government cannot use purse strings to control speech.\"   \n   The government has formal processes to enforce civil rights statutes and court rulings, but Berry says the Trump administration isn't using those tools. Instead, he says, the administration seems to be channeling Trump's history of filing lawsuits to accomplish his business and personal goals.   \"Trump has such a long history as a private citizen of suing individual people or individual entities and dealing with them one at a time,\" he says. \"But it's concerning when it's from the federal government.\"   \n   The American Association of University Professors has sued the Trump administration in several venues over its withholding of funds and grants. Its president, Wolfson, is blunt in characterizing the settlements.   \"It was extortion.\"   He also says the government's actions are unconstitutional and undermine academic freedoms, while endangering research projects that can benefit the American public.   Still, the government secured significant payments and concessions from a slate of well-regarded universities in 2025:   Northwestern University:    The Illinois school agreed in late November to pay $75 million to the government over three years to unlock some $790 million in frozen federal money and end civil rights investigations by several agencies.The Trump administration had accused Northwestern of allowing antisemitism to spread on campus, related to protests against Israel's attacks on Gaza.Northwestern's interim president, Henry Bienen, said that the university had been paying some $40 million every month to maintain research and that the deal was \"the best and most certain method\" to restore federal funding. A legal battle would likely have lasted for years, he said.Policy changes that Northwestern agreed to included terminating the Deering Meadow Agreement, a 2024 pact with demonstrators under which the university had, among other things, provided temporary space for two Middle Eastern and Muslim student groups.   \n   Cornell University:    Faced with losing more than $250 million in federal funds, Cornell announced a deal with the government on Nov. 7. The government closed civil rights investigations that focused on Cornell's compliance with antidiscrimination laws in its admissions procedures.Cornell will pay a total of $60 million over three years: $30 million to the government and $30 million for \"research to strengthen U.S. agriculture,\" according to the university's president, Michael Kotlikoff.Cornell also agreed to use guidance from the Justice Department \"as a training resource to faculty and staff.\" That July 2025 memo from Attorney General Pam Bondi equates DEI programs to \"discriminatory practices.\"   University of Virginia:    UVA's interim president, Paul Mahoney, signed a deal with the Justice Department on Oct. 22, months after then-President Jim Ryan resigned. Ryan had said the federal government threatened to gut funding if he remained. The university received more than $400 million in federal research funds in the 2024 financial year. The Justice Department had opened seven investigations into UVA in nine weeks, many of them related to the school's response to Trump's order to end diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.UVA isn't required to pay a fine or set up an external monitor of its practices. The school affirmed it will follow civil rights laws, and it also agreed to adopt Bondi's guidance on what constitutes discrimination.   Brown University:    On July 30, Brown University agreed to pay $50 million over 10 years to local workforce development organizations. The deal emerged after the White House said it would freeze $510 million of federal funding due to allegations of antisemitism on Brown's campus and the school's diversity, equity and inclusion work.Under the deal, Brown also pledged to adopt definitions of \"male\" and \"female\" as laid out in a Trump executive order, and to not consider race in its admissions and programming.   Columbia University:    In late July, the White House and Columbia University said the university would pay some $221 million to resolve several investigations, as NPR reported. The school previously said the government suspended \"the majority\" of $1.3 billion in federal research funding.The settlement calls for Columbia to pay $200 million over three years related to the administration's allegations of discriminatory practices, and $21 million to settle an investigation into workplace harassment related to the college's Jewish employees.Among other measures, the settlement stipulates that Columbia won't consider race in admissions, programming or hiring, will provide a demographic and academics breakdown of all rejected and admitted students, and will review its international admissions process.   \n   University of Pennsylvania:    On July 1, the school, Trump's alma mater, reached an agreement that included revising records related to a transgender swimmer's results, as well as its policies on transgender athletes, after the Trump administration froze $175 million of federal funding. In 2022, Lia Thomas, a transgender athlete at Penn, won high-profile swimming titles at the women's Ivy League championships.\n",

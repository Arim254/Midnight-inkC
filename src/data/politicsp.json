    "body": "\n      House Speaker Mike Johnson says one of the first orders of business once Congress is back will be swearing in Democrat Adelita Grijalva, who won a special election to replace her father in Congress.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  Let's go way back to September 23. That's when Democrat Adelita Grijalva won a special election to replace her late father in Congress, representing an Arizona district that borders Mexico. Seven weeks later, she has still not been sworn in to start that work. Now, with the end of the government shutdown in sight, House Speaker Mike Johnson says one of the first orders of business when Congress - when the House is back in session will be swearing Grijalva  in. Representative-elect Grijalva joins us now. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.ADELITA GRIJALVA: Thank you so much for having me.DETROW: How much time have you been spending in Washington during the past seven weeks?GRIJALVA: I've gone back and forth four times, and every time thinking that, you know, we - I could get sworn in during a pro forma session or - but that hasn't happened. And so four different times, a couple days each time, and then I came back to district.DETROW: How confident are you at this point in time that you'll be sworn in tomorrow?GRIJALVA: I'm 90%. I mean, we've been waiting for 49 days, so tomorrow will be 50 days. And several times during that period of time, we thought we were going to get sworn in, and so I do think we're closer to certainty than we have been in the past.DETROW: Have you had direct conversations with the House speaker's office about this?GRIJALVA: No, the speaker's office has never communicated with me directly.DETROW: Interesting. Now, let's talk about one of the reasons why you may not have been sworn in. On the campaign trail, you promised to sign a bipartisan petition to force a House vote to release the Epstein files. Your signature would be decisive. It would compel a vote. Speaker Johnson has called the idea that the delay in swearing you in - the idea that it's related to that - partisan manufactured thing. What is your understanding of the situation?GRIJALVA: No, I do believe that there is absolutely a connection with me pledging to be the 218th signature on the discharge petition to release the Epstein files, and that has resulted in denying representation to more than 800,000 Arizonans for the last seven weeks.DETROW: Is that something you still plan to do, sign that petition as quickly as you can?GRIJALVA: Absolutely. Yes, I do.DETROW: What do you hope releasing those files would achieve?GRIJALVA: Justice for the survivors and consequences for those who committed crimes against children and women.DETROW: What are your other priorities once you become an actual representative after this long wait?GRIJALVA: Well, you mean what people actually elected me to do (laughter)?DETROW: If you put it that way.GRIJALVA: You know, I mean, well, the people in our district really want me to fight for our democracy, for immigration rights, for tribal sovereignty, for environmental justice and for public education. These - and our economy - these are the issues that are so important to our community. Arizona, the 7th District shares the three ports of entry with Mexico. It's a very diverse community with rural spots and urban, you know, centers, and all of the needs are very diverse and different. Very similar to our nation.DETROW: You're going to be - one of your first votes, if not your first vote, will be on a big issue - possibly ending the federal government shutdown. Which way are you going to vote on that? Are you going to vote to reopen the government or are you going to vote with most House Democrats to keep it closed?GRIJALVA: You know, the reason why we're closed has nothing to do with - I mean, we shouldn't be closed at all. I was elected five days before the shutdown, and we should have consistently been working to negotiate a solution. The fact that we've been closed this long is absolutely the fault of Republicans and leadership here. But I will not be voting for that continuing resolution. It has a lot of hidden benefits to specifically senators in relating to - I mean, enriching themselves. It does nothing for affordability for the American people when it comes to health care and continues to cut people out.DETROW: So you're a no on that particular vote. What did you think of the concessions the handful of Senate Democrats were able to get to vote yes?GRIJALVA: They weren't significant in making a difference for anybody who's fighting to keep their health care. In Arizona, I spoke to a mom whose monthly bill to insure her and her three children was $500 a month. Her new bill is $2,400 a month. She will not be able to insure her or her family with that kind of cost. And what concessions were made were negligible when it is in relation to the problem that we have.DETROW: We've got about 30 seconds left. I want to squeeze in one more quick question. You said you've been to D.C. four times. What have the conversations been like with other members of Congress?GRIJALVA: Very supportive, very frustrated, advocating to swear me in because there's a lot of work to do.DETROW: That is Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva, waiting to be sworn in as the newest member of the House. Thank you so much for talking to us.GRIJALVA: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Moderate Democrats made a political calculation to end the shutdown but try to keep health care in the spotlight.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  The Senate approved legislation to reopen the government last night. The House is expected to vote on the package as early as tomorrow evening. But most Democrats are criticizing the deal for not delivering on their key demand, the renewal of expiring health care subsidies. NPR congressional correspondent Deirdre Walsh joins us now from the Capitol. Hi, Deirdre.DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa.CHANG: OK, so for weeks now, we've been hearing about what the Democrats have been demanding, and that is they would not back a funding bill unless it included a plan to preserve these health care subsidies for the millions of people who rely on them. So what exactly changed when a group of Democrats got on board with Senate Republicans?WALSH: Well, the talks about how to address these health care subsidies really started on the first day of the shutdown. That's according to New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who was part of this small group of moderate Democrats who negotiated this deal. But she told me and other reporters that the one thing that didn't change over the last six weeks was that Republicans were not changing their position at all, that they weren't going to negotiate on health care until the government reopened. She said yesterday the pain of federal workers not getting paid, people not receiving food assistance was only going to get worse, and they needed an off-ramp. She was 1 of 7 Democrats and one independent to join Republicans to vote for this deal that funds some programs through the end of January, includes some full-year funding for programs like SNAP and veterans' benefits, and reverses the layoffs of federal workers.CHANG: All right. Yes. But what about health care? Like, what exactly did these Democrats get then?WALSH: Not much. I mean, they got a commitment for a Senate vote by mid-December on a bill that they will write. Shaheen said she negotiated that directly with Senate Majority Leader John Thune. But there's no guarantee, even if the Senate could pass something, that the House Speaker Mike Johnson would put that on the House floor. But Shaheen says the White House was part of these discussions, and she pointed out that people in red states rely on these tax credits more than people in blue states.JEANNE SHAHEEN: I think the president is going to engage. And if he isn't, well, shame on him. He says he's going to help even though he hasn't to date, but he says he's going to address affordability. Well, this is one of the big issues that are facing people in terms of affordability.CHANG: Yeah. But the majority of Senate Democrats voted no. So I imagine a majority of Senate Democrats are not thrilled with this deal, right?WALSH: Not at all. I mean, they are calling it a mistake. A lot of them are saying it undercuts the Democratic Party, which was mostly united over the course of the shutdown about making this fight all about health care. Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said the message coming out of last week's off-year elections, where Democrats had some big wins in governors' races, was that voters wanted the party to stick together, and he even said that President Trump admitted the shutdown was hurting the GOP.CHRIS MURPHY: This is a very, very hard moment. I am angry about how this went down.WALSH: The top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, voted no on this deal, but there are still growing calls from some House Democrats, from Democrats running in Senate Democratic primaries for Schumer to step down from his leadership post. He was looped in on these talks, but they criticize him for not holding the party together.CHANG: So what do you expect to see when the House votes on this package? Like, do you think any Democrats will back it?WALSH: I think there will be a small number, but top House Democratic leaders are urging their party to stick together and vote no, force Republicans in the House to pass it without any real help from Democrats. It is expected to pass sometime tomorrow night, which could end, pretty soon, the longest shutdown in American history.CHANG: That is NPR's Deirdre Walsh. Thank you, Deirdre.WALSH: Thanks, Ailsa.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Mississippi is one of those states, and in June, its top election official asked the court to hear a lawsuit filed by the Republican National Committee that argues the state's five-day mail ballot grace period violates federal law.   An appeals court sided with the RNC. The ruling, which came while voters were casting ballots in last year's presidential election, did not go into effect immediately.   \n   Sixteen states plus Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Washington, D.C., currently accept and count mail-in ballots that are received after Election Day — typically, only if those ballots are postmarked on or before Election Day. More states have grace periods like that just for military and overseas voters.   \n   States provide this wiggle room to voters in case they forget to return their mail ballots ahead of time, if there are issues with the postal service, or if there are other unforeseen issues like bad weather and natural disasters.   The GOP has argued that Congress alone — not states — has the right to decide when elections end, and that Congress established a uniform Election Day.   The RNC filed multiple legal challenges to various state grace period laws ahead of the 2024 election, including in the swing state of Nevada. Since then, GOP-led states including Utah have eliminated their mail ballot grace periods, and President Trump has sought to end them nationally via executive order.   During the 2024 election, hundreds of thousands of mail ballots were counted that were received by officials after Election Day. In Washington state, for instance, where the vast majority of voters cast mail ballots, officials reported that \"more than 250,000 Washington ballots postmarked on time arrived after Election Day.\"   \n   Joyce Vance, a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law, told NPR last year that Republicans are \"trying to set up a possible rule for the future where only ballots that are cast and counted on Election Day count,\" which she said made more sense for voting patterns a hundred years ago.   \"It doesn't reflect the modern reality where we have early voting days and have mail-in voting days precisely to accommodate the fact that not everybody can get away during normal business hours on a Tuesday to vote,\" she said.   \n   The Mississippi case becomes the third related to voting taken up by the Supreme Court this term.   Justices are considering another mail-ballot case that centers on whether candidates have standing to sue over voting regulations, and a high-profile challenge to the Voting Rights Act.\n",

The Senate approved a funding bill by a 60 to 40 vote.LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Speaker Mike Johnson called the House of Representatives back to Washington after more than a month off. The House would have to pass the measure, and President Trump would need to sign it. The federal government could open within days, although a debate over health insurance subsidies remains unresolved.INSKEEP: NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas is here. Sam, good morning.SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: Hey, Steve.INSKEEP: OK, so what exactly did the Senate pass?GRINGLAS: So some of this is very similar to what the Senate has been voting on for weeks now, a temporary funding measure to fund the government for just a few weeks, in this case, through January 30. But this time, lawmakers also included three bipartisan annual appropriations bills that cover specific agencies, like the Department of Agriculture and the FDA. So instead of a short-term extension, those areas will be funded now through next September.INSKEEP: OK, this is useful to know. This means the government could shut down again at the end of January but not the whole federal government.GRINGLAS: Yeah, it would be just a partial government shutdown. And SNAP benefits, for example, they would not be in danger of running out this time. The package also includes a measure to undo the firings of federal workers during the shutdown and ensures federal workers get back pay. Here's Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SUSAN COLLINS: This is a great victory for the American people. And it shows that the Senate can work, that we can produce the results that are needed.GRINGLAS: Now, I should note a key element that you will not find in the text of this measure, and that's an extension of expiring health care subsidies, which has been the crux of Democrats' shutdown fight. What Senate Republicans have promised is a vote on that in the future.INSKEEP: Oh, Republicans did promise the Democrats a vote, but they could've given them that vote a month ago. They were promising that vote a month ago. It doesn't sound like Democrats got anything near what they wanted.GRINGLAS: Yeah, Democrats really wanted something a lot more concrete. So in the end, all but seven Democrats and one independent who caucuses with them, they voted against this deal. Senate majority leader John Thune says he'll hold a vote by mid-December on separate legislation to address the subsidies, but what exactly Democrats put forward is an open question. They need something that can win enough Republican votes. And while some Republicans do talk about wanting to prevent premiums from skyrocketing, they also want reforms. And a few weeks is not a lot of time for an overhaul.INSKEEP: Well, even if a health care bill were to pass the Senate in that vote in December, what are the odds it gets a vote in the House and gets signed by the president?GRINGLAS: You know, this is exactly what many Democrats, like Wisconsin Senator Tammy Baldwin, are worried about.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TAMMY BALDWIN: A handshake deal with my Republican colleagues to reopen the government and no guarantee to actually lower cost is simply not good enough. The people I work for need more than that.GRINGLAS: House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters yesterday he could not guarantee a vote. And it's also unclear what Trump is willing to support.INSKEEP: OK, so we don't know what's going to happen with people who rely on Obamacare subsidies, Affordable Care Act subsidies, the extra subsidies, we should add. But people who rely on food assistance, who are traveling for Thanksgiving - we're thinking about the FAA and air traffic controllers - do they have relief?GRINGLAS: House members have been told to report to Washington for a vote Wednesday. After being out for weeks, Johnson may have his work cut out for him to get this shutdown-ending deal to the president. But he says it will get done. The dispute over health care, though, does remain unresolved, along with this contentious political debate about how this shutdown played out with the midterm elections just around the corner.INSKEEP: NPR's Sam Gringlas. Thanks so much.GRINGLAS: Thanks, Steve.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The order keeps in place at least for a few more days a chaotic situation. People who depend on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to feed their families in some states have received their full monthly allocations, while others have received nothing.   \n   The order will expire just before midnight Thursday.   The Senate has approved a bill to end the shutdown and the House of Representatives could vote on it as early as Wednesday. Reopening the government would restart the program that helps 42 million Americans buy groceries, but it's not clear how quickly full payments would resume.   The justices chose what is effectively the path of least resistance, anticipating the federal government shutdown will end soon while avoiding any substantive legal ruling about whether lower court orders to keep full payments flowing during the shutdown are correct.   \n   Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was the only one of the nine justices to say she would have revived the lower court orders immediately, but didn't otherwise explain her vote. Jackson signed the initial order temporarily freezing the payments.   \n   Beneficiaries in some states have received their full monthly allocations while in others they have received nothing. Some states have issued partial payments.   How quickly SNAP benefits could reach recipients if the government reopens would vary by state. But states and advocates say that it's easier to make full payments quickly than partial ones.   Carolyn Vega, a policy analyst at the advocacy group Share Our Strength, also said there could be some technical challenges for states that have issued partial benefits to send out the remaining amount.   An urgent need for beneficiaries   In Pennsylvania, full November benefits went out to some people on Friday. But Jim Malliard, 41, of Franklin, said he had not received anything by Monday.   Malliard is a full-time caretaker for his wife, who is blind and has had several strokes this year, and his teenage daughter, who suffered severe medical complications from surgery last year.   That stress has only been compounded by the pause in the $350 monthly SNAP payment he previously received for himself, his wife and daughter. He said he is down to $10 in his account and is relying on what's left in the pantry — mostly rice and ramen.   \n   \"It's kind of been a lot of late nights, making sure I had everything down to the penny to make sure I was right,\" Malliard said. \"To say anxiety has been my issue for the past two weeks is putting it mildly.\"   The political wrangling in Washington has shocked many Americans, and some have been moved to help.   \"I figure that I've spent money on dumber stuff than trying to feed other people during a manufactured famine,\" said Ashley Oxenford, a teacher who set out a \"little food pantry\" in her front yard this week for vulnerable neighbors in Carthage, New York.   \n   SNAP has been the center of an intense fight in court   The Trump administration chose to cut off SNAP funding after October due to the shutdown. That decision sparked lawsuits and a string of swift and contradictory judicial rulings that deal with government power — and impact food access for about 1 in 8 Americans.   The administration went along with two rulings on Oct. 31 by judges who said the government must provide at least partial funding for SNAP. It eventually said recipients would get up to 65% of their regular benefits. But it balked last week when one of the judges said it must fund the program fully for November, even if that means digging into funds the government said need to be maintained in case of emergencies elsewhere.   The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to pause that order.   \n   An appeals court said Monday that full funding should resume, and that requirement was set to kick in Tuesday night before the top court extended the order blocking full SNAP payments.   Congressional talks about reopening government   The U.S. Senate on Monday passed legislation to reopen the federal government with a plan that would include replenishing SNAP funds. Speaker Mike Johnson told members of the House to return to Washington to consider the deal a small group of Senate Democrats made with Republicans.   President Trump has not said whether he would sign it if it reaches his desk, but told reporters at the White House on Sunday that it \"looks like we're getting close to the shutdown ending.\"   Still, the Trump administration said in a Supreme Court filing Monday that it shouldn't be up to the courts.   \"The answer to this crisis is not for federal courts to reallocate resources without lawful authority,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer said in the papers. \"The only way to end this crisis — which the Executive is adamant to end — is for Congress to reopen the government.\"   \n   After Tuesday's ruling, Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on social media: \"Thank you to the Court for allowing Congress to continue its swift progress.\"   The coalition of cities and nonprofit groups who challenged the SNAP pause said in a court filing Tuesday that the Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, is to blame for the confusion.   \"The chaos was sown by USDA's delays and intransigence,\" they said, \"not by the district court's efforts to mitigate that chaos and the harm it has inflicted on families who need food.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Leila Fadel asks Illinois Democrat Mike Quigley, who serves on the House Appropriations Committee, about his opposition to the Senate-brokered shutdown deal.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  The lack of a concrete deal on health care has many Democrats fuming. Illinois Congressman Mike Quigley is among them. He sits on the House Appropriations Committee, and he joins me now. Good morning, Congressman.MIKE QUIGLEY: Morning.FADEL: I want to start with why you're so angry at your colleagues in the Senate for voting for this deal.QUIGLEY: Sure. Twenty-two million Americans' health insurance premiums are going to be increasing, I don't know, 114% on the average, from about 888 to about $1906. The Senate deal completely abandons them. During this Trump administration, my constituents ask me, what are you doing? I tell them all I have is my voice and my vote. This is giving up my vote if I were to vote yes on this. I think that my office would be surrounded by crowds with torches if I voted yes on this. This is absolutely critical in terms of affordability and what's most important to the American people.FADEL: But then what is the answer? I mean, the Republicans have refused to budge. Do you just keep the government shut down forever?QUIGLEY: No. I think what we saw last Tuesday is some cracks in what the Republicans are doing. They were seeing that they weren't winning this, if anybody wins in a shutdown. I think even the president recognized that. And fundamentally, you've got to ask yourself, at what point do you draw the line? This is a president who has reneged on past deals that we've passed into law - spending deals. This is a president who's unilaterally pushed back on the power of the purse of the House and the Senate. So why would you trust them in the first place? Fool me once is probably the lesson of the day.FADEL: Now, I understand you're trying to get back to D.C. from Chicago for the vote. When do you expect to vote in the House, and are you and your colleagues going to be able to get back in town with everything going on at the airports?QUIGLEY: Yeah. I suspect that they'll probably figure this out and get these flights there, but I think most members would be smart to book multiple flights coming back today. We're hearing that the earliest the vote would be is around 4 o'clock Eastern time Wednesday. So we're trying to head back tonight. One way or another, we'll get there. It does remind me of COVID when we were going back to vote for emergency supplementals and there were no flights and people drove to D.C.FADEL: Now, I know you say you're going to vote against this bill. Another Senator, Dick Durbin from your home state of Illinois, is one of the eight senators who broke with the party and did vote for this bill. His explanation of why was that although he blames the president and Republicans for the shutdown, he, quote, \"cannot accept a strategy which wages political battle at the expense of my neighbor's paycheck or the food for his children,\" unquote. Now, Congressman, this bill does not extend health care subsidies, but it does fund SNAP food benefits through September of 2026. Nearly 2 million people in Illinois receive those benefits. Is this something your constituents needed or need?QUIGLEY: Absolutely. And I've been at the Chicago Food Depository programs, where we were dispensing the food, people waiting four hours for a single box. But we sound like characters from a Dickens novel. You know, can I have more, please? This is fundamental of what they should have had already. And to say, just to give you what the status quo is, you're going to have to sacrifice health care for millions of Americans. It's just not a deal you need to make, especially at a time when the Republicans seem to be cracking.FADEL: Given the vote and Democratic senators breaking with the leadership, do you have faith in the leadership of your party in this moment, specifically Senator Chuck Schumer?QUIGLEY: Yeah. I mean, look, I'll leave the senators to deal with their leadership. You know, my leader, Mr. Jeffries, has said that they're going to stand firm. I believe...FADEL: Is he whipping the vote against the bill?QUIGLEY: Yeah. I - he is, and I believe that the Democrats will stand pat. I think last time we only had one or two break from the party. I suspect that'll be the case tomorrow. I don't know what's happening on the Republican caucus. There's always a few who hold out until they get a call from the president, get a photo op and then they go back to their constituents and declare victory.FADEL: Do Republicans need you to pass the bill? We just have a few seconds.QUIGLEY: I think they'll get this bill passed, unfortunately, and we go through the status quo. And unfortunately, while people will be getting fed, they won't have health care.FADEL: That's Democratic Representative Mike Quigley of Illinois. Thank you for your time.QUIGLEY: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Most congressional Democrats were against the deal that eight of the senators, who caucus with them, crossed the aisle to vote and reopen the government.   Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren called the move a \"terrible mistake\"; Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said it was indefensible; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, declared it a \"policy and political disaster.\"   And there were far harsher things said about the deal on social media across the political spectrum of people left of center, not just the most progressive.   \n   Make no mistake: bridging the divide is going to be a significant challenge. But despite the intense blowback, the result in the end might not be all that bad for Democrats in next year's midterm elections.   Consider that affordability was the dominant issue in the off-year elections, where Democrats won sweeping victories. If it's the most important issue next year — and it very likely will be — then Democrats will likely retain the advantage.   What's more, if Republicans do vote against health care subsidy extensions in December — when a promised vote is to take place as part of this shutdown deal — then the GOP will fully own the increased health care costs that come with it.   Democrats could also look like the adults who took the high road, recognizing the very real pain that a lot of people were beginning to feel when President Trump and his administration were beginning to turn the screws on the most vulnerable.   So, Democrats' biggest challenge heading into next year's midterms may be keeping progressives on their side — and fired up to vote — after what many of them are viewing as the latest show of weakness from a party, as they see it, defined by that weakness.   \n   A Democratic vise   Democrats put themselves in a very difficult position from the very beginning of this fight. Any acute observer could have seen this coming — and realize Democrats had nothing but bad options.   Republicans dug in, figuring at least enough Democrats couldn't handle the pain of millions losing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits as well as federal worker furloughs and layoffs.   And they were right.   \"Most of us up here have voted repeatedly with the Democratic strategy,\" Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said. \"But after 40 days, it wasn't going to work.\"   It's hard to \"win\" a fight when one side broadly cares about whether the government is open and working properly and the other thinks government is the problem.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                This combination photo of eight senators who are facing criticism from the Democratic Party for their deal to end the government shutdown shows Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., top row from left, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., and bottom row from left, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H.\n                \n                    AP/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        AP/AP\n    \n\n   \n   For Kaine and the seven others who crossed over to join most Republicans in voting to end the shutdown, a commitment to hold a vote to extend health care subsidies, combined with the protections for federal workers and SNAP benefits, was enough.   \"I don't think much of anything has been accomplished for the last 40 days except a lot of chaos and a lot of upheaval,\" said Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who voted repeatedly to end the shutdown.   Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with the Democrats, is one of the three Democrats who has also been voting to end the shutdown, said bluntly: \"It wasn't working. It's been six weeks. Republicans made it clear they weren't going to discuss the health care issue, Affordable Care Act tax credits, until the shutdown was over.\"   \"Waiting another week, or another month, wouldn't deliver a better outcome,\" New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said. \"It would only mean more harm for families in New Hampshire and all across the country.\"   Not everyone agrees with that reasoning, including swing-state Sen. Elissa Slotkin from Michigan.   \n   \"I always said it's got to do something concrete on health care,\" she said of an agreement to reopen the government. \"And it's hard to see how that happened.\"   Leadership problems   Democratic leaders also were ostensibly against the deal to reopen the government.   Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer voted no, though there are questions about whether Schumer allowed the senators, who went ahead with the votes, to do so.   None of the senators who came out in favor of the shutdown deal are in imminent political jeopardy, given they're not facing reelection next year, and two of them are retiring.   \n   \"The overwhelming majority of Senate Democrats, led by Leader Schumer, are opposing this bill in the Senate,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Monday.   He pointed out that the Trump administration's actions when it comes to federal workers leaves most Democrats \"deeply skeptical\" of their \"intentions.\" And on health care, Republicans, he noted, have not acted in \"good faith,\" given that it's the party that tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act dozens of times.   \"It doesn't change the core problem here,\" Jeffries said of the shutdown deal. \"We need to decisively address the Republican health care crisis on behalf of working-class Americans, everyday Americans and middle-class Americans.\"   But Schumer already faced significant pushback when he abandoned the fight in March and voted to keep the government open. And given the party's movement toward ousting older leaders, the shutdown deal could spell trouble for the 74-year-old New Yorker as a party leader, even if he didn't vote for it.   A changing party — from pragmatism to pugilism in the age of Trump   Schumer is certainly not representative of how the Democratic Party is changing. And the moderates, who signed onto this deal, also very much represent the old guard of the party.   \n   For as much that's made of how much the GOP has changed since Trump came into office — and it has been a lot — the Democrats have changed as well.   Democrats have moved from pragmatism to pugilism. As an example of that, in April of 2017, just after Trump began his first term, an NBC poll found that 6-in-10 Democrats favored making compromises with Trump to gain consensus on legislation.   But that has completely flipped. As of March of this year, the last time there was a threat of a shutdown, two-thirds of Democrats said they think Democrats in Congress should instead stick to their positions even if this means not getting things done in Washington.   Not every progressive sees what happened as a total disaster for the left. Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo, who is generally a pretty pragmatic progressive, sees a silver lining. He described the deal as \"embarrassing,\" but sees progress for the left:   “[T]here’s a difference between the deal itself and where the deal leaves Democrats and the broader anti-Trump opposition. This deal shows us that Democrats still don’t have the caucus they need for this fight that will be going on at least through this decade. But the shutdown also accomplished a lot. And not withstanding the WTF fumble at the 10-yard line, it’s still a dramatically different caucus than we had in March. … Democratic voters need to keep demanding more, keep up the pressure and keep purging the Senate caucus of senators who are not up to the new reality.”   He also points out that if this deal goes through, there will be another funding deadline at the end of January. At that point, if Democrats don't extract health care extensions or anything else of consequence, there will be another opportunity for leverage.   \n   Over the next year, there will also likely be primaries from the left and expect the shutdown positioning to be a litmus test for those primaries — and for 2028.   In the meantime, Democratic officials are banking on voters having a short-term memory, that with time, progressives will take a victory in the progress they've made in moving the party to a more fighting stance — and the issue landscape will propel them to winning next year.   And winning cures a lot of divisions.\n",

Today's top story   The U.S. Senate voted 60 to 40 last night to approve a continuing resolution to reopen the government. Speaker Mike Johnson called the House of Representatives back to Washington, D.C., as they will have to pass the measure before President Trump can sign it into law.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The U.S. House of Representatives is seen on the 40th day of a government shutdown on Nov. 9, 2025, in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 In addition to voting on the temporary funding measure, lawmakers voted on three bipartisan annual appropriations bills that cover specific agencies like the FDA, NPR's Sam Gringlas tells Up First. Moving forward with these measures means there is a chance of a partial government shutdown at the end of January, but programs like SNAP, would continue. A provision to extend expiring health care subsidies was not included in the measure, but Senate Majority Leader John Thune says he will hold a vote by mid-December. In the legislation for the subsidies, Democrats who are in favor of them will need something that can win enough Republican votes.🎧 Seven Senate Democrats and one independent joined Republicans in voting to reopen the government, a move drawing backlash from voters on the left who say the party keeps caving on key priorities. NPR's Domenico Montanaro notes Democrats may have an advantage heading into next year's midterms if affordability and the cost of living remain top concerns.   \n   Delegates from nearly 200 countries have begun climate negotiations at the COP30 in Brazil. As with previous summits, the negotiations begin on a weak note as countries are still not meeting their goals to cut heat-trapping emissions from burning fossil fuels.    🎧 The world is on track for five degrees Fahrenheit of warming currently, NPR's Lauren Sommer reports, which could lead to heatwaves and storms becoming more intense, as well as ecosystems like coral reefs having a low chance of survival. But there's good news: over 90% of new power projects built last year were renewable showing electricity is becoming cleaner globally.➡️ Stay up-to-date with the latest news from the COP30 with this app-exclusive playlist of stories.   Some white Afrikaners and Afrikaans groups are now pushing back against the U.S. administration's claims, labeling them as \"lies\" and \"falsehoods\" made in their name. The backlash follows Trump's announcement that no U.S. officials will attend the G20 Summit, which South Africa is hosting as the current rotating chair of the group of major world economies, later this month in Johannesburg, citing \"human rights\" concerns.

In recent years, efforts to improve Americans' health have focused on reducing the consumption of ultra-processed foods, which comprise the majority of Americans' diets. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said these foods are \"poisoning\" Americans. But public health and nutrition experts still don't agree on a definition of ultra-processed foods:    \n   🍟 The term describes how much processing foods undergo, from unprocessed or minimally processed to those with manufactured ingredients and additives.🍟 Some experts argue that certain ultra-processed foods, such as plant-based milks, can be beneficial for health.🍟 For many, they are also more affordable and accessible. However, consumers seeking healthier options can aim to make more informed decisions within the ultra-processed category and reduce their sugar intake.

This week, Quil Lawrence released a two-part podcast on The Sunday Story from Up First, which follows the story of Dave Carlson, an Iraq war veteran who he has been talking to for over a decade.   Back in 2015, I was doing a story that led me to talk to some veterans who were incarcerated. That's when someone told me a surprising fact: when you get incarcerated, you become a ward of the state. Meaning, it doesn't make sense for the Department of Veterans Affairs to be taking care of you, because a different part of the government is taking care of you. And you lose a lot of your veteran's benefits.   I wanted to know: what's it like to have combat PTSD and then be thrown into this environment where you can't let your guard down, where you can't really heal, and where you don't have access to services that could help? So I was looking for an incarcerated veteran to interview. And that's when I found a website featuring Carlson's writing from prison. His mom had set it up for him and she helped me get in touch.   There's this question that's been nagging me ever since I was a war reporter embedded with active duty troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Those were the first major set of wars we've had without a military draft, which means a lot of American families weren't forced to endure the experience of fighting or sending loved ones to fight these wars. That can make veterans kind of feel this loneliness and this cultural divide.   \n   I wanted to know: What do we owe the people who were sent to war and came back with painful but often invisible wounds? I don't know that I've fully found the answer, but this podcast helped me process that question through Carlson's story. Ultimately, I think what we owe veterans mostly is an open mind. And remembering that most vets are just like you and me.

It only takes a few seconds of listening to get a sense of who hosts Jennifer Welch and Angie \"Pumps\" Sullivan consider their target audience — and the target of their ire.   \"Patriots, Gaytriots, Theytriots, Blacktriots, Browntriots and to all the crusty motherf****** that don't support them, you can f*** off,\" one recent episode began.   Welch is an interior designer. Sullivan, an attorney. They're two middle-aged suburban women from Oklahoma — and one-time Bravo reality TV stars — whose show has come to represent a vocal coalition of a liberal base who has, well, had it, with Democrats.   \n   \"It feels like the 'Preservation Party,' that they want to preserve the status quo,\" Welch said in an interview. \"It almost feels conservative in the sense that they are not evolving and they are not moving.\"   Speaking to NPR at the end of October, Welch and Sullivan talked about the show's rising popularity and the Democratic Party's unpopularity among voters who say its leaders don't fight against President Trump enough.   \n   \"Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, they're writing strongly worded letters and it's like, this guy's tearing down democracy,\" Sullivan said of the House and Senate Democratic leaders. \"We need more action than we need strongly worded letters.\"   The two hosts have different backgrounds — Welch is a lifelong liberal atheist who's always been outspoken and just moved to New York City for a spell, while Sullivan was raised as a conservative evangelical Christian who has slowly become more comfortable with sharing her political views.   Both say that key Democratic Party leaders are not doing enough to stand up for marginalized groups, to support young and progressive candidates like mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani in New York City, or to push back against Trump policies.   One of those recent moments on display was with New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who was asked about Israel's war in Gaza. More specifically, he was asked if he thought Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was \"a war criminal,\" allegations that Netanyahu has rejected.   \n   \"These are questions that a lot of people think are the important litmus tests that are loaded and hot,\" Booker said, visibly flustered. \"My urgency is to be an effective leader in bringing an end to this crisis. And I get these questions all the time that, to me, undermine my urgency.\"   The same senator who spoke for 25 hours on the floor in April to protest the Trump administration, Welch said, filibustered what should be a simple yes or no question.   \"The thing with Cory Booker is, I can disagree with him if he's f***** honest,\" Welch said of the interaction. \"But to give us a chicken**** cowardice answer about 'Is Benjamin Netanyahu a war criminal?' The answer to that is objectively yes.\"   Her answer illustrates another reason some folks can't get enough of I've Had It: a brand of raw, unvarnished and often impolite descriptions of American politics right now.   In an episode called \"America's Dumbass Dictator\" that premiered on Election Day last week, Sullivan bemoaned what she called the \"propaganda machine of MAGA\" around the suggestion that Trump could illegally run for a third term.   \"I feel like we've gone from either you're on the side of legality, the Constitution and democracy, or you're full-blown fascist and you don't give a s***,\" she said.   Welch says the podcast's tone is just how people talk: \"a little bit of gossip, a little bit of policy, a little bit of 'F yous'... it's more digestible, it's more interesting that way.\"   She also points to Trump's new media successes and how he makes politics more conversational.   \"I disagree with everything he says, I think he's a compulsive liar, etcetera… but the way we talk is really the way Trump has been doing it the last ten years on podcasts,\" Welch said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Jennifer Welch (L) and Angie Sullivan (R) attend a GLAAD Pride Month event on June 26, 2025 in Brooklyn, New York.\n                \n                    Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for GLAAD\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for GLAAD\n    \n\n   \n   Sullivan adds that the duo's self-deprecating humor is key.   \n   \"I do think that since we don't take ourselves so seriously — like so many politicians — it makes us more like just a gal pal that you're running around with,\" she said.   Online, clips from the show have gone viral for their salty language and pejorative descriptions of Trump, Vice President Vance, House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republicans.   But it's their withering rebukes of Democratic Party leaders — sometimes to their faces — that have also helped the duo gain millions of followers across Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and more.   \"Hakeem and Chuckles – that's what we call Chuck Schumer – and the Cory Bookers of the Democratic Party, if they don't get their s*** together, a grifter much like Donald Trump will come in and fill that void,\" Welch said.   The twice-a-week \"I've Had It\" and its shorter twice-a-day news counterpart \"IHIP News\" find themselves on top podcast charts next to shows like the Rachel Maddow Show and the Charlie Kirk Show, amassing hundreds of thousands of views and listens a week across mediums.   \n   \"We have all age groups, red states, blue states, rural areas, big cities,\" Welch added, when asked about who is consuming their content. \"What is so interesting about us is that we're middle-aged women from a red state, and it's like, 'Oh my God, white people do care! Also, the fact that we're novel — that, I think, is kinda sad.\"   At a time when the political podcasting space is dominated by the manosphere and a search for the \"Joe Rogan of the Left\" to bring voters back to the Democratic Party, the \"I've Had It\" hosts say their show is trying to nudge elected officials back towards the voters.   \"I'm cautious to have the mentality that a lot of leftists do: 'Let's just burn it all down, it's the only way we're going to get better,'\" Welch said. \"I say, let's confront and push the politicians we have as far as we can. And if that makes them both vulnerable to primary, then they weren't the right leader for us anyway.\"\n",

Now, two decades later, she's back with What to Eat Now, a revised field guide for the supermarket of 2025.   Nestle recommends what she called a \"triple duty\" diet aimed at preventing hunger, obesity and climate change: \"Eat real food, processed as little as possible, with a big emphasis on plants,\" she says.       Interview highlights   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        North Point Press\n    \n\n   \n   On how supermarkets are in the business of selling products, not providing nutrition    The more products you see, the more you're likely to buy. Therefore, the products that are organized so that you cannot miss them are in prime supermarket real estate. And companies pay the supermarkets to place their products at eye level, at the ends of aisles — those have a special name, end caps — and at the cash register. When you see products at the catch register, they're paying fees to the supermarket by the inch of space. And that's how supermarkets make a lot of their money, is through slotting fees. And, of course, what this does is it keeps small producers out, because they can't afford to make those kinds of payments. ... I mean, we're talking about thousands, or in some cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars. And every single product that is in a supermarket is placed where it is for a reason.   \n   On how dollar stores got into the food business   \n   They started out by selling the most popular ultra-processed foods. ... They're going to have chips. They're going to have sugar-sweetened cereals. They're going to have every junk food you could possibly think of. That's what they make their money off of. They will have a few fruits and vegetables, a few sad bananas, a few sad apples, maybe some pears, maybe some green vegetables, but not very many, and they'll be in a case off somewhere because they have to offer those. Because they're taking SNAP benefits, they're required to meet the stocking requirements of the SNAP program, which requires them to have a certain number of fruits and vegetables. … And [dollar stores are] just everywhere. And during the pandemic, particularly, they just proliferated like mad, and they undercut local stores. They're cheaper. They have poorer quality food, but the prices are lower. Price is an enormous issue.    \n   If you want a Trader Joe's or a Whole Foods or a Wegmans in your neighborhood, you've got to have hundreds of thousands of people within walking distance or quick driving distance who make very, very good incomes or the [people] aren't gonna go there. They're going to close the stores that are not performing well, meaning having lots and lots of people spending lots and lots of money at them. And so as the big grocery stores have closed in inner city neighborhoods, the dollar stores moved in.   On food waste in America   \n   Our food system in the United States produces 4,000 calories a day for every man, woman and little tiny baby in the country. That's roughly twice what the population needs on average. So waste is built into the system. Because that's how the subsidies work. The agricultural subsidies encourage food producers to produce as much food as possible because they get paid for the amount of food that they produce.    On initially agreeing with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \"Make America Healthy Again\" approach to the food industry   I was very hopeful when he was appointed, because he was talking about, let's get the toxins out of the food supply. Let's make America healthy again. Let's make America's kids healthy again. Let's do something about ultra-processed foods. Let's do something about mercury and fish. And a lot of other issues that I thought, \"Oh, how absolutely terrific that we're going to have somebody who cares about the same kind of issues I do. This is very exciting.\"    \n   When President Trump introduced his nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on social media, President Trump talked about the food industrial complex. I nearly fell off my chair! I thought, \"Here's the president sounding just like me. What's going on here?\" So then we had the first MAHA report, the first Make America Healthy Again report, which talked about a lot of these issues and put in an aspirational agenda. \"We're going to work on this, this and this\" — all of that sounded terrific. And then the second report came out and they had backed off on nearly all of the things that I thought were really critically important.   \n   On why she believes the food system needs a revolution   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Marion Nestle recommends a diet aimed at preventing hunger, obesity and climate change: \"Eat real food, processed as little as possible, with a big emphasis on plants.\"\n                \n                    Peter Menzel\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Peter Menzel\n    \n\n   \n   I think it would start with transforming our agricultural production system to one that was focused on food for people instead of animals and automobiles. We would need to change our electoral system so that we could elect officials who were interested in public health rather than corporate health. We would need to fix our economy so that Wall Street favors corporations who have social values and public health values as part of their corporate mission. Those are revolutionary concepts at this point because they seem so far from what is attainable. But I think if we don't work on that now, if we do not do what we can to advocate for a better food system, we won't get it. And it's only if we advocate for it that we have a chance of getting it. And you never know, sometimes you get lucky. …   I tell people that they can't do it on their own, that even the act of going into a grocery store and trying to make healthy choices means that you, as an individual, are up against an entire food system that is aimed at getting you to eat the most profitable foods possible, regardless of their effects on health and the environment. So you have to join organizations. You have to join with other people who are interested in the same issues and concerned about the same problems and get together with them to set some goals for what you'd like to do and then work towards those goals. Because if you don't do it, who will?   Therese Madden and Anna Bauman produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

    "body": "\n      President Trump's unpredictable rhetoric and actions when it comes to foreign policy amount to what some experts call a \"madman strategy.\" Other analysts say Trump is actually a realist in this area.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  If there is one thing you can say when it comes to President Trump's foreign policy, it's that he likes to keep people on their toes. Trying to pin down Trump's vision of global affairs has, in fact, become a parlor game of sorts for foreign policy specialists who are searching for just the right label. NPR international affairs correspondent Jackie Northam looks at some of the theories.JACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: Last month, President Trump made it clear he wanted the U.S. to acquire Greenland, by military force if necessary. Then at the World Economic Forum in Davos, he seemed uncharacteristically coy.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Would you like me to say a few words of Greenland?NORTHAM: Trump announced he wouldn't use force against Greenland but sent a clear warning he still wanted the island in a way that left his audience guessing.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: They have a choice. You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no, and we will remember.NORTHAM: For many, such a move made no sense. But Stacie Goddard, a political science professor at Wellesley College, says Trump's moves seem incoherent because you're looking at them through the wrong lens.STACIE GODDARD: And it becomes really logical if you apply this kind of 16th century dynastic politics - say, \"Game Of Thrones.\"NORTHAM: Goddard says Trump is using a neo-royalist approach to foreign affairs, shifting policies at whim and using his enormous power as leverage. Goddard argues this imperious approach has less to do with the country's national interests and more to do with ensuring Trump's personal wealth and status.GODDARD: So he is the absolute sovereign.NORTHAM: A sovereign surrounded by a royal clique.GODDARD: Some of it is family. Some of it are loyalists. Some of them are financiers, you know, people who can actually give him the capital to do what he wants to do, and he can also pay them the spoils. And then there are also the ideologues, the people surrounding him that are giving him the legitimacy that he needs in order to be able to conduct this foreign policy.NORTHAM: Seva Gunitsky, an associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto, agrees the Trump administration operates with all the power concentrated on one individual. Gunitsky calls it a personalist style of foreign policy, which is an extension of one person's ego or psyche.SEVA GUNITSKY: Personalist leaders - they're driven purely by their own private fixations, their own incentives, not coherent national interests. And for Trump, those incentives are, you know, being flattered, not being mocked.NORTHAM: Gunitsky points to a letter Trump sent earlier this year to the prime minister of Norway trying to justify an invasion of Greenland.GUNITSKY: Where he said, you know, I've been denied the Nobel Peace Prize, and therefore, I'm no longer going to be the peace president - that's a clear indication of where his personal grievances interact with national policies.NORTHAM: But Trump's erratic rhetoric and actions could just be an act, says Roseanne McManus, a political science professor at Penn State University. She says since his first presidential campaign, Trump has claimed that U.S. foreign policy needed to be more unpredictable. McManus says Trump is employing what she calls a madman strategy.ROSEANNE MCMANUS: I think Trump doesn't really want people to know what he's thinking or how far he's willing to go. You know, it's not clear what strategy he's going to use at any time.NORTHAM: McManus says Trump's rhetoric suggests he's aware of his madness reputation and thinks it helps him get what he wants.MCMANUS: You don't actually have to follow through every single time. People just have to believe that there's some chance you might do absolutely anything.NORTHAM: Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a Mideast analyst at Rice University's Baker Institute, believes Trump is more of a realist when it comes to foreign policy - power through strength.KRISTIAN COATES ULRICHSEN: He feels that the U.S. has the upper hand and that maybe other leaders in the past haven't acted as he would see it in the U.S. national interest, by putting U.S. interests first and foremost.NORTHAM: Including invading another country.COATES ULRICHSEN: To the extent that the U.S. has the capability and the power to do that, I think he probably thinks, why wouldn't we do it if we can?NORTHAM: There are plenty of other theories about Trump's approach to foreign policy - isolationist, sovereign decisionist, the Monroe Doctrine, which has morphed into the Donroe (ph) Doctrine. Some believe Trump's style is based on reality TV. Trump's handling of foreign policy could be a bit of all of these. Only one person knows, and he's not telling.

McLaughlin has become the public face and voice defending the Trump administration's mass deportation policy and immigration tactics over the past year.   \"McLaughlin started planning to leave in December but pushed back her departure amid the aftermath of the shootings of U.S. citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal immigration officers, according to the people briefed on her exit,\" DHS said in a statement to NPR.   POLITICO first reported her departure. It is not clear where she is going next. McLaughlin in a statement said Lauren Bis, currently her deputy, will replace her as assistant secretary for public affairs, while Katie Zacharia will become deputy assistant secretary.   \n   \"I am immensely proud of the team we built and the historic accomplishments achieved by this Administration and the Department of Homeland Security,\" McLaughlin said in the statement. \"I look forward to continuing the fight ahead.\"   \n   McLaughlin's exit comes at a tumultuous time for the agency. DHS is currently shut down after lawmakers failed to pass a budget to fund it through the end of the fiscal year in September.   And high-ranking immigration officials, including DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, have been summoned to Capitol Hill to testify on the immigration crackdown after immigration agents shot and killed Good and Pretti in Minneapolis.   McLaughlin has been among the most public-facing agency spokespeople, participating in several network interviews. Beyond speaking on DHS' immigration initiatives, McLaughlin also fielded interviews and questions about Noem's handling of national disaster relief and resources, and other parts of the sprawling agency.   Noem praised McLaughlin's work in a statement online, saying she \"served with exceptional dedication, tenacity, and professionalism.\"   \"While we are sad to see her leave, we are grateful for her service and wish Tricia nothing but success,\" she wrote on the social platform X.   \n   Immigration has been the largest part of McLaughlin's portfolio. She often took to network shows and to social media to promote immigration arrests made by the administration, defend actions by DHS agents, and encouraged immigrants to \"self-deport.\"   House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries praised news of her departure online; \"Another MAGA extremist forced out of DHS. Noem next,\" he posted on X.   Most recently, McLaughlin defended Noem's description of Pretti as a \"domestic terrorist\" after Customs and Border Protection officers shot and killed him — claims that eventually drew sharp scrutiny from lawmakers, including some Republicans.   \n   \"Initial statements were made after reports from CBP on the ground. It was a very chaotic scene,\" McLaughlin told Fox Business late last month. \"The early statements that were released were based on the chaotic scene on the ground and we really need to have true, accurate information to come to light.\"   During last week's congressional hearings, the heads of Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement both denied that they, or anyone under their chains of command, had given Noem information to substantiate that claim that Pretti was a domestic terrorist.   An NPR analysis published in January showed that DHS has made unproven or incorrect claims on social media or in press releases when describing immigrants targeted for deportation or U.S. citizens arrested during protests.\n",

Now, they're debuting a tool to help track criminal cases that appear to involve irregular charging practices, including aggressive legal theories and possible political retribution against President Trump's foes.    \"We created the Case Tracker because you cannot defend against an enemy you cannot see,\" said Steven Salky, a lawyer in the Washington, D.C., area who oversees the project. \"The Tracker is intended to spotlight for the next several years the unusual cases being prosecuted by the Department of Justice.\"   \n   The new database includes the federal cases against Sean Charles Dunn, who threw a sub sandwich at a federal immigration officer, and Jacob Samuel Winkler, a homeless man accused of directing a laser pointer toward the Marine One presidential helicopter. Juries in Washington, D.C., acquitted both men.   \n   The tracker, sponsored by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL), also monitors cases where government charges of resisting federal law enforcement have been undercut by videos and eyewitness accounts from protesters.   Last week, in testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Pam Bondi batted away allegations that politics have motivated federal law enforcement decisions.   \"I came into office with the goal of refocusing the Department of Justice on its core mission after years of bloated bureaucracy and political weaponization,\" Bondi said. \"The Department of Justice's core mission is to fight violent crime; protect the American people; and defend the rule of law above all else. While our work is never done, we have made tremendous progress to make America safe again.\"   \n   But judges and juries have been turning a skeptical eye toward the work of the Justice Department. Federal jurists have questioned whether the executive branch is complying with court orders on immigration and other issues at the heart of Trump's agenda — giving rise to concerns that federal prosecutors will no longer get the benefit of the doubt in court.   Grand juries across the U.S. have rejected efforts by prosecutors to bring indictments, once considered to be a cinch because of the low bar to charge defendants at that early stage in the criminal process.   \n   The new tracker features a map that allows people to follow some of these trends across states, a way to search for specific statutes, and links to key court filings and judges' decisions.   \"This tracker is an essential tool for an era where federal overreach has become the standard operating procedure,\" said NACDL Executive Director Lisa Wayne.\n",

The officer was accompanied by a police dog named Petey.   As they approached the car, Petey began barking. Something about this car was clearly strange. Sure enough, they discovered that the vehicle had about 66 pounds of cocaine stashed in a hidden compartment.   \"Drugs off the street, smuggler went to jail, and our good boy got a steak,\" the Upland Police Department posted about the drug bust on social media.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Upland Police Department\n    \n\n   \n   Drug busts like these are mounting around the nation, but they are just a small fraction of what's estimated to be a record-breaking surge in the supply of cocaine. In their most recent annual World Report, the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime found that, after a decade of rapid growth, \"Global cocaine production has hit an all-time high once again, accompanied by significant increases in cocaine seizures, cocaine users and – most tragically – cocaine-related deaths in many countries.\"   \n   So what's behind this surge? And how is it affecting us in the United States? A new working paper from economists Xinming Du, Benjamin Hansen, Shan Zhang, and Eric Zou — \"Coca's Return and the American Overdose Fallout\" — has some answers.   Why cocaine supply is surging   A decade ago, it seemed like the heyday of the cocaine market was mostly behind us. The drug was still popular in certain places, but it was also something of a relic, associated more with discos in the 1970s and Wall Street in the 1980s.   Du and the other economists suggest that at least part of cocaine's decline was the result of fierce supply-side interventions in Colombia. With significant U.S. involvement, Colombia \"waged an aggressive campaign against the plantation of coca, the raw plant used to make cocaine,\" they write. As a result, \"Colombia's coca fields shrank from about 168,000 hectares in 2000 to just 48,000 by 2013, and cocaine became much less available in the United States.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                TOPSHOT - A Colombian police officer hugs a dog during an operation to eradicate illicit crops in Tumaco, Narino Department, Colombia on December 30, 2020.\n                \n                    JUAN BARRETO/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        JUAN BARRETO/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   But around 2015, the economists write, a couple of policy changes \"created a perfect storm for coca's resurgence.\" First, the Colombian government ended its U.S.-supported aerial fumigation program on public health grounds. Many feared that the chemical they sprayed (glyphosate) was carcinogenic. Then, in late 2016, the Colombian government signed a historic peace deal with the Marxist revolutionary guerilla group FARC. For decades, FARC had tried to overthrow the Colombian government, and to finance their war, they got heavily involved in the cocaine trade.   \n   \"For years, the FARC had tightly controlled and taxed coca production in the areas it dominated,\" the economists write. \"When the rebels demobilized, a power vacuum formed in remote coca-growing regions. A variety of other armed groups ranging from dissident FARC factions to cartels rushed in to seize these territories. These new traffickers actively encouraged local farmers to plant more coca as they consolidated control.\"   Also, in a classic case of unintended consequences, the Colombian government introduced \"a coca crop substitution program that promised stipends and development aid to farmers who eradicated their coca,\" but that plan backfired because farmers \"quickly realized they needed to have coca plants in the ground to qualify for compensation, which led many to start new coca plots or expand existing ones in hopes of securing the promised subsidies.\" (Side Note: Check out a recent Planet Money episode about a U.S. effort to get Peruvian coca farmers to grow blueberries).   Because of these and other factors, the program to eradicate coca farming in Colombia failed, and production exploded. \"By 2022, Colombia's coca cultivation area and potential cocaine output were more than three times their 2015 levels,\" the economists write.   Much of this cocaine came to the United States (as well as Europe, which has also been seeing a historic cocaine boom). Data from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) shows that, after 2015, \"the average size of cocaine seizures jumped markedly, while seizures of other drugs did not follow the same pattern.\"   And, hello classic supply and demand, with a surge in cocaine production and distribution, prices fell, helping to stoke a demand boom.   Ben Hansen, an economist at the University of Oregon who co-authored this study, says cocaine is an \"experience good,\" meaning it's a kind of product users have to experience to stimulate demand. \"Because cocaine is an experience good, if you have a big supply shock, that leads to more people potentially using it and therefore experiencing it, and liking it,\" Hansen says. \"And then they want it again.\" In this way, a flood of new supply generates a surge in new demand.   \n   Cocaine has many negative side effects, but the scariest one is overdoses. Following a long period of \"stable cocaine-related mortality,\" the economists write, cocaine-related overdose fatalities began surging in the United States by the late 2010s.   The fallout from the cocaine surge   Du, Hansen, Zhang, and Zou estimate what this surge of cocaine supply has meant for American overdoses. The economists calculate that had the post-2015 Colombian cocaine explosion never happened, there would be around 1,500 fewer overdose deaths in the United States every year.   For context, in 2023, the last year with complete data, there were about 30,000 overdose deaths involving cocaine, according to the CDC. That was about 28% of all overdose deaths.   That's significantly less than overdose deaths from synthetic opioids (primarily fentanyl), which were involved in nearly 73,000 deaths, or about 69% of the total.   Hansen, who has also studied the opioid market, says they were particularly sensitive to the reality that, at the same time as this cocaine surge, there was also a fentanyl surge, and sometimes people overdosed after ingesting both drugs (sometimes unintentionally because the cocaine was cut with fentanyl). \" And when we restrict to overdose deaths that were only involving cocaine, we still continue to find this relationship, suggesting that this is not just a fentanyl correlation that we're accidentally picking up here,\" Hansen says.   The United States, of course, isn't the only nation to experience negative effects from the dramatic expansion of cocaine production and distribution. Another new working paper by economists Gianmarco Daniele, Adam Soliman, and Juan Vargas, \"Cocaine Goes Bananas: Global Spillovers from an Illicit Supply Shock,\" documents that this post-2015 cocaine surge \"coincided with a sharp increase in homicide rates of about one-third, with substantially larger effects in port areas\" in Colombia. They also find that violence from the cocaine trade spilled over to Ecuador, which is one major transit hub for cocaine, and that contributed to a \"nearly five-fold increase in homicide rates\" in that nation. The economists also link the explosion of cocaine supply to an explosion of use in Europe, which likely has had negative effects similar to ones seen in the United States.   \n   Policymakers are paying attention. For instance, the Colombian cocaine surge has been one big reason for a fraying of relations between the U.S. and Colombia under President Trump. Earlier this month, President Trump and the President of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, met and fighting the cocaine trade was at the top of their agenda.   One clear implication of this new study from Du, Hansen, Zhang, and Zou is that supply-side interventions can work to reduce cocaine use, particularly at the source where cocaine is coming from.   Hansen compared drug traffickers to multinational corporations. Like corporations, \"They're going to respond to the bottom line,\" Hansen says. \"And if you make it a lot harder to produce things, well, they're gonna probably scale back production, just like when we regulate other companies or raise their taxes.\"\n",

Today's top stories   Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg will take the stand in Los Angeles today in a trial that could reshape social media. The plaintiffs are accusing platforms like Instagram and Facebook of being intentionally designed to hook teenagers, sparking a nationwide youth mental health crisis. The case hinges on whether the tech companies engineer \"defective products\" to exploit vulnerabilities in young people's brains.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg will testify Wednesday in a major lawsuit against social media companies that claims their products are defective and harmful to children.\n                \n                    Nic Coury/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Nic Coury/AP\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 For years, social media companies have avoided legal consequences by using a legal shield known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, NPR's Bobby Allyn says. The law protects online platforms from liability for user-generated content by treating sites as intermediaries rather than publishers. Now, lawyers are suing the tech companies under product liability laws. They argue that the platforms are essentially defective products because of features such as infinite scroll and autoplay. The plaintiffs say that the social media sites' impact on children's brains is similar to that of a slot machine and that the companies should be held accountable. If the jury sides with the plaintiffs, the case could result in a multi-billion-dollar settlement and significant changes to social media apps' operations.   \n   Tricia McLaughlin, the public face of the Trump administration's mass deportation policies, is leaving the Department of Homeland Security. The agency confirmed her exit yesterday from her role as the DHS' assistant secretary for public affairs. McLaughlin's departure comes as the agency is shut down after lawmakers failed to pass a budget to fund it through the end of the fiscal year.   The U.S. and Iran have committed to further negotiations after representatives from the two countries held indirect talks in Geneva this week. Both parties said they would meet again to attempt to reach a deal on Iran's nuclear program. The Trump administration wants Iran to have no nuclear weapons and zero enrichment. Iran insists it has the right to enrich uranium for research and civilian usage.    🎧 The next meeting is expected to be in a couple of weeks, NPR's Jackie Northam says. Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said yesterday's meeting was constructive and negotiators made some progress. However, Araghchi added that there is still more work to be done before the two countries meet again.   Warner Bros. Discovery has given CBS' parent company, Paramount Skydance, one last chance to sweeten its bid against Netflix for the company. The news comes as Anderson Cooper announced his departure from 60 Minutes after nearly two decades as a correspondent. Stephen Colbert also recently accused CBS of blocking an interview with Democratic Senate candidate James Talarico from airing on TV.    \n   🎧 The recent headlines should not be seen as separate incidents, NPR's David Folkenflik tells Up First. The Ellison family, who are behind Paramount, is close to President Trump and wants to stay on his good side. The family's connection to the president has shaped decisions surrounding the company's news division. One of those choices is the network's recent pick for CBS News' editor-in-chief, Bari Weiss. She came to CBS with the proposition that the mainstream media is too woke and anti-Trump, Folkenflik says. He adds that many of her decisions have been unwelcome by the journalists at CBS. Cooper says he is leaving the show to spend more time with his children. NPR spoke to three associates, who are not authorized to discuss what is happening within CBS, who say Cooper has also expressed concerns about Weiss' leadership.

The growth of the 287(g) program is one of the most visible shifts in Trump's immigration strategy. In 2019, during Trump's first term, local police agencies signed just 45 of these 287(g) agreements. As of Feb. 13, ICE reported 1,412 active agreements across 40 states and territories — signing over 1,130 of them in 2025 alone. Here's a look at how the program works:    ➡️ The jail enforcement model of the program involves local authorities checking everyone entering jail with criminal convictions or pending charges for legal U.S. status. If they are in the country illegally, ICE will be notified, and they will be held in jail pending ICE removal.➡️ The warrant service officer model, similarly to the jail enforcement model, allows police to execute administrative warrants on migrants in their jails.➡️ The task force model of the program allows officers to stop, question and make arrests for immigration violations. This model makes up the majority of 287(g) agreements in place, according to ICE data.➡️ The Department of Homeland Security says task force model training includes 40 hours of education on immigration law, ICE's Use of Force policy, civil rights law and more. Previously, local police needed about a month of training to obtain certification.   \n   Life advice   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Westend61/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   There are times when you meet someone and the conversation just flows, and you want to know more about them. Then you might say, \"We should get together sometime.\" This statement can be vague. Kat Vellos, author of We Should Get Together: The Secret to Cultivating Better Friendships, says the best thing you can do is schedule an actual time to hang out. In a conversation with Life Kit, she shared some insight on how to turn a stranger into a friend:    🫂 The spark can fizzle out if you wait too long to see the person again. Research shows that if you spend a lot of time together at the beginning of the relationship, it is more likely to stick.🫂 Try picking a memorable activity you can do together. Doing something out of the ordinary will give you both a memory you can share.🫂 Remember, it is OK that this person might not be your bestie. There are different levels of friendship. You might also decide it is best for you both to be strangers.   For tips on how to make a friendship stick, listen to this episode of NPR's Life Kit.

The president wants the government he leads to pay him billions of dollars.   Trump has filed multiple claims arguing he's been hurt by Justice Department investigations and the leak of his tax returns years ago. Now it's up to his own political appointees to determine whether to settle with their boss — and for how much taxpayer money.   \"There is a glaring conflict of interest with Trump being on both sides of the claim,\" said Edward Whelan, a former lawyer at the Justice Department and a political conservative who once clerked for the late Justice Antonin Scalia. \"It is outrageous that he and those answering to him would be deciding how the government responds to these extravagant claims.\"   \n   Unfinished business   For Trump, filing lawsuits, including those that are frivolous or where he has little chance of success, has long been standard operating procedure, a way of communicating displeasure. A White House official, speaking on background because he was not authorized to speak on the record, said these claims amount to unfinished business for the president.   It's clear they have been weighing on his mind. In December, Trump was in North Carolina nearing the end of a speech about the economy when out of nowhere, he started talking about the FBI search of his Florida resort in 2022.   \"I had these animals trying to attack me at Mar-a-Lago,\" he said. \"They went into my wife's closet.\"   \n   Federal agents seized classified documents from a bathroom, a ballroom and an office, part of a sprawling and court-approved investigation into unlawful retention of government secrets and alleged obstruction of justice.   The president viewed that search as an attack, part of an ongoing weaponization of the government against him personally. So, he filed a claim with the Department of Justice, seeking $230 million over the Florida operation and an earlier probe into his campaign's ties to Russia.   \"And they do say that, you know, it's never been a case like this,\" the president said at a rally this December, taking on the animated voice of a newscaster. \"'Donald Trump sues the United States of America. Donald Trump becomes president. And now Donald Trump has to settle the suit.'\"   \n   Trump was out of office when the administrative claims were first filed. The Russia investigation ended with no charges against Trump. Then, after he won the 2024 election, the Justice Department abandoned its appeal of the classified documents case against him in Florida. And now Trump finds himself on both sides of the dispute.   \"But isn't that a strange position to be in,\" the president said at the rally. \"I've gotta make a deal. I negotiate with myself.\"   \"An order of magnitude greater\"   There's a process in place at the Justice Department for people who say they've been harmed by the federal government.   In the normal course of business, those claims get evaluated by career lawyers. They rarely involve high profile criminal investigations like Trump's.   \"Some of them are run of the mill, right?\" said Rupa Bhattacharyya, a former Justice Department lawyer who evaluated these kinds of allegations. \"Postal vehicles get into traffic accidents, VA doctors have malpractice claims brought against them, people slip and fall in federal buildings.\"   Even in the most serious cases, like ones that involved injuries to people cleaning up after the terrorist attack on Sept. 11, 2001, Bhattacharyya said the payouts almost never amounted to more than $10 million.   \n   Trump wants a lot more than that — 23 times more — for the Justice Department investigations against him.   \"Two hundred thirty million dollars would be an order of magnitude greater than any administrative settlement the department has ever agreed to in a Federal Tort Claims Act case,\" said Bhattacharyya.   Typically, the Justice Department would fight claims in court and defend the work of its career prosecutors and FBI agents. And in this case, they would have strong legal defenses. After all, a federal judge approved the search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago property — finding probable cause.   Given how much money is at stake, people at the top of the Justice Department would make the final call. And that adds another complication.   \n   Attorney General Pam Bondi and Todd Blanche, her deputy, both used to work as Trump's personal attorneys. The third-in-command at Justice, Stanley Woodward, represented Trump's valet, who was charged as an alleged co-conspirator in the Mar-a-Lago case.   \n   \"The fear that many have is that the Department of Justice will simply fold and ask Donald Trump the individual how much money Donald Trump's administration should funnel to him,\" said Whelan, the former DOJ lawyer.   In a recent interview with NBC's Tom Llamas, Trump didn't do anything to bat down the suggestion that he would be the final decider. \"Well, what I would do, tell them to pay me but I'll give 100% of the money to charity,\" the president said.   A $10 billion lawsuit   But Trump wasn't just upset about those old Justice Department investigations. He had more scores to settle. Last month he filed another claim against the federal government, a $10 billion lawsuit over the 2019 leak of his tax returns by a contractor for the Internal Revenue Service.   Experts in tax law say that case has some big flaws. For one thing, the statute of limitations seems to have expired. What's more, the leak took place during Trump's first term in office, so the president is suing the government for actions that occurred when he was in charge. The contractor is currently serving prison time for the leak.   \n   Congressional Democrats pressed top administration officials about the IRS case in recent weeks. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told lawmakers it was an issue for the Justice Department, which is defending the Treasury and IRS in the case.   In a separate hearing, Attorney General Bondi didn't shine any additional light, telling a senator she would not discuss pending litigation.   A Justice Department spokesperson told NPR: \"In any circumstance, all officials at the Department of Justice follow the guidance of career ethics officials.\"   \n   Last summer, Bondi fired the top in-house ethics lawyer at the Justice Department, after he said he raised questions about gifts and tickets to her.   \n   Taxpayer-funded settlement   Whelan, the conservative lawyer, said one solution is to pause the IRS case until Trump is no longer president.   If the Justice Department eventually approves a settlement, the money would come from something called the judgment fund, a taxpayer funded pot of money.   Bhattacharyya said that means \"the American people are on the hook for these claims if liability is assessed against the government.\"   A spokesman for Trump's private legal team said in a statement, \"The IRS wrongly allowed a rogue, politically-motivated employee to leak private and confidential information about President Trump, his family, and the Trump Organization to the New York Times, ProPublica and other left-wing news outlets, which was then illegally released to millions of people. President Trump continues to hold those who wrong America and Americans accountable.\"   \n   Pressed during a recent press gaggle on Air Force One on whether it is fair to ask the American people to pay out such a large settlement, Trump dismissed any concern, insisting that anything he wins would go to charity.   \"They give money to charity anyway,\" Trump said. \"They give $40 billion a year to charity, our government.\"   It's unclear where Trump pulled that number. The White House did not respond to questions about it or which charities would get the money.   But at a time when Americans say their top concern is the cost of living and making ends meet, the idea of the president receiving a massive windfall from the government he leads may not sit well with voters — even if it is donated to charity.\n",

A lawsuit filed in Boston says orders by President Donald Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum have forced park service staff to remove or censor exhibits that share factually accurate and relevant U.S. history and scientific knowledge, including about slavery and climate change.   \n   Separately, LGBTQ+ rights advocates and historic preservationists sued the park service Tuesday for removing a rainbow Pride flag from the Stonewall National Monument, the New York site that commemorates a foundational moment in the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement.   The changes at exhibits came in response to a Trump executive order \"restoring truth and sanity to American history\" at the nation's museums, parks and landmarks. It directed the Interior Department to ensure those sites do not display elements that \"inappropriately disparage Americans past or living.\" Burgum later directed removal of \"improper partisan ideology\" from museums, monuments, landmarks and other public exhibits under federal control.   \n   The groups behind the lawsuit said that a federal campaign to review interpretive materials has escalated in recent weeks, leading to the removal of numerous exhibits that discuss the history of slavery and enslaved people, civil rights, treatment of Indigenous peoples, climate science, and other \"core elements of the American experience.\"   \n   The suit was filed by a coalition that includes the National Parks Conservation Association, American Association for State and Local History, Association of National Park Rangers and Union of Concerned Scientists. It comes as a federal judge on Monday ordered that an exhibit about nine people enslaved by George Washington must be restored at his former home in Philadelphia.   The park service removed explanatory panels last month from Independence National Historical Park, the site where George and Martha Washington lived with nine of their slaves in the 1790s, when Philadelphia was briefly the nation's capital. The judge ordered the exhibits restored on Presidents Day, the federal holiday honoring Washington's legacy.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                New York politicians and activists prepare to raise a rainbow flag on a pole in Christopher Park across the street from the Stonewall Inn, Thursday, Feb. 12, 2026, in New York, a few days after it was removed by the National Park Service to comply with guidance from the Trump administration.\n                \n                    Yuki Iwamura/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Yuki Iwamura/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Besides the Philadelphia case, the park service has flagged for removal interpretive materials describing key moments in the civil rights movement, the groups said. For example, at the Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail in Alabama, officials have flagged about 80 items for removal.   \n   The permanent exhibit at Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park in Kansas has been flagged because it mentions \"equity,\" the lawsuit says. Signage that has disappeared from Grand Canyon National Park said settlers pushed Native American tribes \"off their land\" for the park to be established and \"exploited\" the landscape for mining and grazing. At Glacier National Park in Montana, Park Service officials ordered removal of materials describing the effect of climate change on the park and its role in driving the disappearance of glaciers, the suit said.   \"Censoring science and erasing America's history at national parks are direct threats to everything these amazing places, and our country, stand for,\" said Alan Spears, senior director of cultural resources at the parks conservation association.   \n   \"National parks serve as living classrooms for our country, where science and history come to life for visitors,\" Spears added. \"As Americans, we deserve national parks that tell stories of our country's triumphs and heartbreaks alike. We can handle the truth.\"   The Interior Department said Tuesday it has appealed the court's ruling in the Philadelphia case. Updated interpretive materials \"providing a fuller account of the history of slavery at Independence Hall would have been installed in the coming days\" in the absence of a court order, an Interior spokesperson said in an email.   \n   The new lawsuit is premature and \"based on inaccurate and mischaracterized information,'' White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said Tuesday.   \"The Department of the Interior is engaged in an ongoing review of our nation's American history exhibits in accordance with the president's executive order,\" but actions are not yet finalized, she said.   U.S. District Judge Cynthia Rufe ruled Monday that all materials from the Philadelphia exhibit must be restored in their original condition while a lawsuit challenging the removal's legality plays out. She prohibited Trump officials from installing replacements that explain the history differently.   \n   Rufe, an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush, began her written order with a quote from George Orwell's dystopian novel \"1984\" and compared the Trump administration to the book's totalitarian regime called the Ministry of Truth, which revised historical records to align with its own narrative.   The lawsuit over the Stonewall flag calls its removal \"the latest example in a long line of efforts by the Trump administration to target the LGBTQ+ community for discrimination and opprobrium.\"   The Pride flag was installed in 2022, becoming the first such banner to fly permanently on federal land. After the banner vanished this month, the park service cited a Jan. 21 memo that largely limits the agency to displaying Interior and POW/MIA flags, although exemptions include providing \"historical context.\"   The lawsuit argues the rainbow flag provided such context and says the park service continues to make exceptions for other banners, including Confederate ones, that help explain certain sites' history. New York politicians and activists raised their own Pride flag at the Stonewall monument on Thursday.   The Interior Department on Tuesday repeated past criticisms of New York City and its Democratic officeholders, who aren't party to the suit.   Jeff Mow, who retired in 2022 as superintendent at Glacier, said the park service \"has always taken great pride in its scholarly research, its focus on telling the truth and being very straightforward about that.\" He called Trump's order a \"disservice\" to the public, \"and it makes it very hard for those that are trying to do their jobs and being storytellers and speaking the truth.\"   \"You cannot tell the story of America without recognizing both the beauty and the tragedy of our history,\" said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, a nonprofit legal organization that filed the lawsuit on behalf of the advocacy groups.\n",

What followed was a weeks-long federal immigration enforcement surge that led to upheaval in and around Minneapolis, thousands of arrests and the deaths of two U.S. citizens.   Minnesota Democrats have blamed Republicans for the turmoil, but Republicans say a national spotlight was necessary to take on fraud claims in Minnesota's government programs.   \"Much of the information that one of the gentlemen in that video was providing was due to information he got from the House Republican staff,\" Minnesota Rep. Harry Niska, the party's floor leader, told reporters in December. \"We have been ready and willing to provide information to anyone who wants to pursue this.\"   \n   GOP candidates in the state could face repercussions ahead of the midterm elections.   \"Immigration definitely overshadows fraud,\" said Kathryn Pearson, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota. \"It has backfired on Minnesota Republicans, I think, in several ways.\"   Pearson said Democrats will likely have the upper hand when it comes to voters' attitudes on which party is better able to handle immigration and which candidates have the better message on the issue. And in Minnesota, Democrats are leaning in.   \"I think the fraud issue is a pretext for this president to do what we have seen, which is fairly lawless, violent and, in cases, reckless actions against the people of Minnesota,\" Democratic Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy said last week.   \"I also think the pretext was caused by the action of the Republicans to invite Nick Shirley, a YouTuber, into town.\"   Viral video prompts Minneapolis surge   In December, Shirley posted a video of himself holding up his phone, knocking on the doors of several Minneapolis child care centers. He alleged the Somali-American-run daycares were inflating enrollment to get more money from the state.   The claims – some false, some already under investigation – got a lot of attention. Fraud has been a subject of ongoing reporting and federal investigations in Minnesota for years.   \n   The most well-known scheme took place during the COVID pandemic, involving a child nutrition program that was defrauded of more than $250 million. Dozens were convicted in connection with that scheme. The majority were Somali American, though not the leader.   \n   Shirley's video gained the attention of the White House. Vice President JD Vance reposted it on social media. Days later, on Jan. 5, Democratic Gov. Tim Walz dropped his bid for reelection to focus on the problem. That pleased Republicans who had called for his resignation.   The White House doubled down on the emphasis on fraud.   \"The Trump administration has activated thousands of federal agents, doubled the number of U.S. attorneys in the DOJ office in Minneapolis and surged resources to hold fraudsters accountable and demand justice for law-abiding American taxpayers and citizens across our country,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said.   Soon, thousands of federal agents arrived in and around Minneapolis. They detained immigrants and some citizens. On Jan. 7, one agent shot and killed Renee Macklin Good. Protests over her death rippled across the city.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A demonstrator carries a sign honoring the life of Renee Macklin Good on Jan. 9 in Minneapolis.\n                \n                    Ben Hovland/MPR News\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Ben Hovland/MPR News\n    \n\n   \n   Jan. 9, the Trump administration announced the creation of a division for National Fraud Enforcement and said they would send more immigration agents to the state.   But those anti-fraud efforts have been undermined as some federal prosecutors, including the lead prosecutor, working on them resigned in the wake of the ICE surge, said Minnesota House Democratic Leader Zack Stephenson.   \"This has crippled our fraud response, and Minnesotans should be outraged by that, and it was all done in the name of supposedly addressing fraud,\" he said. \"Republicans are more interested in distracting and pursuing their other partisan agendas and getting retribution. That's what the president said this is all about.\"   By Jan. 24, agents had killed Alex Pretti, another U.S. citizen.   Minnesota Republicans say fraud spotlight is key   But Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, a Republican who is running for governor, said the fraud issue and immigration are not connected. And she defended efforts to spotlight fraud in order to root it out.   \n   \"So if it took a YouTuber, an independent YouTuber, to get the word out and get Minnesotans to know what was actually going on, and then the national attention – that is good for Minnesota,\" Demuth said, \"because it was our tax dollars that were stolen.\"   Another Republican candidate for governor, businessman Kendall Qualls, agreed that it shouldn't matter how the issue of fraud came to light — just that it's getting addressed.   \"The cases don't go away. The problem doesn't go away,\" Qualls said. \"There's still $9 billion that was last reported that Minnesotans were on the hook for that, that were taken away. So that is a problem under the watch of our leaders in St Paul.\"   While they dispute who's to blame for the last two months, state lawmakers begin a legislative session Tuesday where fraud and immigration will top the agenda.\n",

    "body": "\n      President Trump's immigration crackdown is complicating Republicans' attempts to maintain control of Congress in this year's midterm elections. That dynamic is evident especially in Maine.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  President Trump's immigration crackdown is complicating attempts by Republicans to maintain their majorities in Congress. In Maine, Republican Senator Susan Collins now faces potentially the most difficult campaign of her decades-long career. Kevin Miller with Maine Public Radio has more.KEVIN MILLER, BYLINE: As the only Republican senator up for reelection in a state that didn't back Donald Trump in 2024, Senator Collins was already considered one of the GOP's most vulnerable incumbents. Then came an immigration enforcement surge, targeting some of the state's largest and most diverse communities.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Frigid temperatures did not stop ICE from hitting the ground running here...MILLER: While Homeland Security officials said they were targeting, quote, \"the worst of the worst,\" eyewitness reports and videos of masked, heavily armed agents allege they were casting a much wider net - two asylum-seekers legally working at county jails, a month-old baby showered with glass after agents broke a car window to snag his father, an immigrant with no criminal record. In stepped Collins.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)SUSAN COLLINS: I called Secretary Noem, whom I know, and I told her that I felt that ICE officials had gone too far, that they were not focusing on people who were here illegally and had criminal records.MILLER: That's Collins in a recent interview with Maine Public Radio. The 30-year Senate veteran holds arguably one of the most influential positions in Congress as chair of the Senate committee that controls federal spending, including for Secretary Kristi Noem's agency, the Department of Homeland Security.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)COLLINS: I kept pushing her to suspend and cease the enhanced operation in the state of Maine, and she agreed to do so.MILLER: But Collins' critics back home aren't buying it.GRAHAM PLATNER: Susan Collins did not make that happen.MILLER: That's Graham Platner, the gruff-talking oysterman and Democrat, whose explosive Senate campaign has attracted huge crowds since the summer. Platner argues that the real reason ICE reduced its presence in Maine is because communities organized against them.PLATNER: She has done absolutely nothing to try to rein in the behavior of the Trump administration over the last year. Hell, she did nothing to rein it in last time either.MILLER: Platner's chief opponent in the June Democratic primary, two-term Governor Janet Mills, has also made ICE and the immigration crackdown a key campaign issue. And like Platner, Mills accused Collins of not using her position to push back on ICE.JANET MILLS: And right now, she's voting to fund ICE without any standards, without any substantive controls, without any accountability.MILLER: Collins responds to such criticisms by pointing to $22 million for body cameras and de-escalation training for ICE agents that's in the Republican version of the DHS budget bill still stalled in Congress. The agency is currently shut down as Democrats demand broader reforms within ICE, such as prohibiting masked agents before approving funding. Collins says it, quote, \"remains to be seen\" whether President Trump's policies will be a factor in her reelection bid.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)COLLINS: I am running on my record of independence. I support the president, as I have every other president that I've worked with, when I think he is right. I oppose them when I think he is wrong.MILLER: Collins' repeated use of the word independence is strategic. Nearly one-third of Maine voters are independents, making them the second largest voting bloc after Democrats. And Collins will need a significant number of independent voters to win in November, when many Democrats are expected to turn out, motivated by their anger over Trump policies, with immigration potentially topping that list.For NPR News, I'm Kevin Miller in Augusta, Maine.(SOUNDBITE OF MINUTEMEN'S \"COHESION\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

Jesse Jackson, an American civil rights leader, minister, and politician, who was a protégé of Martin Luther King Jr. and in the 1980s reshaped Democratic politics with two galvanizing presidential campaigns, died Tuesday at the age of 84.   \"Our father was a servant leader — not only to our family, but to the oppressed, the voiceless, and the overlooked around the world,\" the Jackson family said in a statement. \"We shared him with the world, and in return, the world became part of our extended family.\"   According to the Jackson family, public commemorations will take place in Chicago.   \n   Jackson was born Oct. 8, 1941, in a tiny house in Greenville, S.C., where he began his lifelong work fighting for civil rights.    \n   While visiting home for Christmas break during his freshman year at the University of Illinois,  Jackson needed to borrow a book but couldn't get it from the town's white-only library. Six months later, on July 16, 1960, he and seven other students held a sit-in at the library and were arrested for protesting. After his experience as a member of the \"Greenville Eight,\" Jackson transferred to North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College, a historically Black school in Greensboro, N.C.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. stands with other civil rights leaders on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tenn., on April 3, 1968, a day before he was assassinated. From left are Hosea Williams, Jesse Jackson, King and Ralph Abernathy.\n                \n                    Charles Kelly/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Charles Kelly/AP\n    \n\n   \n   His burgeoning activism would bring him in 1965 to march alongside Martin Luther King Jr.  and others in Selma, Ala., answering King's call for supporters of a local voting rights campaign. Jackson became a close ally of King — eventually leaving his graduate studies at the Chicago Theological Seminary to join King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference. He became the Chicago coordinator and a year later, in 1967, the national leader of the SCLC's Operation Breadbasket, which was dedicated to improving the economic conditions of Black communities in the U.S.   In April 1968, Jackson traveled with King to Memphis, Tenn., where he witnessed the civil rights leader's assassination.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Rev.

By 1971, he split with the group and formed his own organization, called Operation PUSH. The group continued Jackson's work to increase Black Americans' political strength and political opportunities.    \n   Jackson later merged Operation PUSH with his National Rainbow Coalition to form the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, which became a prominent civil rights organization.   Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Jackson, who became an ordained Baptist minister in 1968, increasingly became an influential player on the national stage.   In 1983, Jackson organized a voter registration drive in Chicago that is credited as being the key factor for the election of the city's first Black mayor, Harold Washington.   Presidential bids   In November 1983, he announced his first bid for president, becoming the second Black person to seek a major party's nomination after Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm in 1972. His rousing speech at the 1984 Democratic Convention in San Francisco appealed to a \"Rainbow Coalition\" of disenfranchised Americans and people of color.     \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Rev.

We're not a perfect people,\" Jackson said. \"Yet, we are called to a perfect mission. Our mission to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to house the homeless, to teach the illiterate, to provide jobs for the jobless, and to choose the human race over the nuclear race.\"   Though Jackson had significant support for his bid, with his campaign registering more than a million new voters and winning 3.5 million votes, his run for president was not without controversy. Jackson drew heated criticism for making a disparaging remark about New York's Jewish community and for his relationship with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who has said the Jewish community is to blame for Black oppression.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The 1984 Democratic presidential candidates pose for photographers prior to the Democratic debate at Dartmouth College.

He placed third in the Democratic primary behind former Vice President Walter Mondale and Sen. Gary Hart. Still, it was a landmark achievement for Jackson and a growing Black political movement.   In 1988, he ran again, expanding his outreach to more white Americans, and reached an emotional crescendo during an impassioned speech at that year's Democratic convention. Although Jackson won major presidential primaries, the first African American to do so, he came in second to the Democratic Party nominee, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. Until Barack Obama's election in 2008, Jackson was the most successful Black U.S. presidential candidate.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Democratic presidential hopeful Rev.

In several instances, he negotiated and secured the release of  American hostages held captive abroad — most notably from Syria, Cuba and Serbia.  From 1992 to 2000, he also hosted a weekly discussion show on CNN, Both Sides with Jesse Jackson, where he addressed current social and political issues.    \n   In 2000, Jackson received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest honor a civilian in the U.S. can receive. But controversy was not far behind. A year later, news that Jackson fathered a daughter with a former member of his staff became public.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Bill Clinton embraces the Rev.

I fully accept responsibility and I am truly sorry for my actions.\"    Jackson found himself apologizing again in 2008, this time to Obama, for crass remarks he made about the presidential candidate in an aside to a reporter on a Fox News program. Obama accepted the apology. And despite other comments critical of the tone of some of Obama's campaign speeches, Jackson was present at his victory party at Grant Park in Chicago and wept.     \"I knew that people in the villages of Kenya and Haiti, and mansions and palaces in Europe and China, were all watching this young African American male assume the leadership to take our nation out of a pit to a higher place,\" Jackson told NPR after Obama's election night.   Jackson saw the rise and painful fall of the promising political career of his oldest son, Jesse Jackson Jr., who was elected to Congress from Illinois in 1995 and resigned in 2012 citing health issues. After leaving office, he was investigated for misuse of campaign funds and pleaded guilty in 2013 to spending $750,000 in campaign funds for personal use. He was sentenced to 30 months in prison.     \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Rev.

Jackson Jr. was sentenced to 30 months in prison and his wife, Sandi, received a year sentence for separate felonies involving the misspending campaign funds.\n                \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"I speak really today as a father,\" Jackson Sr. said at the courthouse the day of the sentencing. \"Most of my career has been spent outgoing — helping someone else on something I really understood socially and politically. But this one, of course, is home.\"   \n   In 2017, Jackson announced he had Parkinson's disease, a degenerative disorder that affects movement.  In November, his organization revealed Jackson was diagnosed in April with progressive supranuclear palsy, a rare neurological disease similar but different from Parkinson's disease.  Despite his illness, Jackson often showed up at protests against police brutality, calling for justice for victims of police shootings.    In August 2020, Jackson spoke at a news conference in Kenosha, Wis., where police shot Jacob Blake, a Black man, several times.    \"Today, there's a moral desert, top-down. The acid rain is coming, top-down,\" he said. \"That kind of moral desert hurts all of America.\"    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Rev.

The marches were \"hopeful signs,\" Jackson said. \"The marchers are full of hope. They believe something can happen. On the move, we're not going backwards.\"    \n   In 2021, Jackson contracted COVID-19. He was hospitalized and spent several weeks in a rehabilitation facility.  He stepped down as president of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition in 2023.    On Nov. 12, the coalition announced Jackson was hospitalized for PSP, which affects body movements, balance, vision, speech and swallowing.    Jackson is survived by his wife, Jacqueline, and six children.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Rep.

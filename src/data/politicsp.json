One of the failed bills was a Republican-backed measure to allow employees who are deemed essential to receive a paycheck during a shutdown. Those workers, including troops, TSA agents and federal law enforcement like the Capitol Police, are currently working without pay.   An alternate version introduced by Democrats called for paying all federal employees – and blocking more mass layoffs by the Trump administration's Office of Management and Budget during the shutdown.   \n   \"We certainly shouldn't set up a system where the president of the United States gets to decide what agencies to shut down, who to pay and who not to pay, who to punish, who not to punish,\" said the sponsor of that bill, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md.   \n   Earlier this month, the White House fired several thousand federal employees, a move the courts later put on hold.   \"I don't think we should limit the president's ability, the chief executive's ability, to properly manage the federal government, and make the tough decisions sometimes to reduce the workforce,\" said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., who introduced the GOP funding measure.   The Republican-backed measure did not receive the 60 votes needed to pass. Republicans blocked the Democrats' version from a vote.   The names themselves of the rival proposals highlight the growing tensions between Democrats and Republicans as the shutdown stretches on. Republicans named their measure, \"The Shutdown Fairness Act.\" Democrats titled theirs the, \"True Shutdown Fairness Act.\"   During a Thursday press conference, House Republicans called attention to air traffic controllers who are working without pay.   \"We are all about safety,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said. \"But I can't guarantee you that your flight's going to be on time. I can't guarantee you that your flight's not going to be cancelled.\"   \n   The federal government has now been closed for 23 days, the second-longest in U.S. history and the longest full shutdown.   \n   Senate Republicans want to advance a House-passed bill that would temporarily fund the government at current levels, while Democrats are holding out for a deal to extend health insurance subsidies expiring soon.   Many Republican lawmakers think Thanksgiving travel headaches will be a tipping point for Democrats. Democrats are also under pressure as states are beginning to announce that funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Program, known as SNAP or food stamps, will run out soon.   Democrats have also said that premium spikes during the open enrollment period beginning Nov. 1 for health plans purchased on the Affordable Care Act marketplace will push Republicans to budge.   The Senate has now voted 12 times on the Republican-backed funding bill. The House has not held votes for several weeks, and senators are preparing to leave town for the weekend.   Top congressional leaders, Republican and Democrat, say they are no closer to agreeing to a path to reopen the government.\n",

According to a review of deaths by NPR, at least 20 people have died in ICE custody so far this year. The number comes as ICE is also holding nearly 60,000 people in immigration detention, the highest number in several years.    Loading...\n   Deaths reached a peak in 2025 for the first time since 32 deaths were recorded in 2004, and 20 deaths were recorded in 2005.   Former agency officials are warning that increased detention population, decreased oversight, an increase in street and community arrests and continued difficulties staffing medical teams will result in more deaths. This summer, ICE received about $70 billion to hire more staff, including deportation and detention officers, and increase its detention space. Across the country, media and immigration advocates have reported overcrowding, unsanitary conditions and issues with food and health care access — a byproduct of a rapid scaling-up of immigration arrests.   \"Can staffing actually keep pace with the increase in population? And that becomes particularly challenging in more remote locations where it was already difficult to find qualified staff willing to come out and work,\" said Peter Mina, who worked at ICE for nearly a decade and then six years as a deputy officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties at DHS. \"And that just places risk all across the system, including, unfortunately, individuals in detention facing medical conditions that might result in their death.\"   \n   ICE did not respond to an immediate request for comment on the count.   Mina's former office at DHS was among those that would conduct investigations following a detainee death. Additional investigations were conducted by the ICE Health Services Corps and the Immigration Office of Detention Oversight. CRCL was among the oversight offices at the department that saw hundreds of staff cuts earlier this year. Other CRCL employees have previously told NPR that the gutting of their office could result in more deaths in custody.   During the ongoing government shutdown, DHS has confirmed, the Office of Detention Oversight is not working.   So far this month, two more detainees have died in custody. Medical conditions surrounding deaths over the last calendar year have included tuberculosis, strokes, respiratory failure and about three possible suicides. Each preliminary report includes a synopsis of the detainees' immigration and criminal histories, as they have for past administrations, as well as the events leading to the time of death.   One reason for the rise in deaths, former employees said, is that there are just simply more people in detention.   \n   \"With that kind of spike in population, there's going to be a need for additional staffing both on the medical and mental health side, as well as even from an officer standpoint,\" Mina said.   The types of arrests being made by federal immigration officers this year are different, too. Claire Trickler-McNulty, a former ICE official who worked under former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, said that previously most of the agency's detainees either came from the border or from local law enforcement custody.   \n   In these cases, she said, those coming from the border tended to be younger and healthier; or health care records were generally established for those who had been previously detained in prisons or jails.   \"Whereas when you pick somebody up on the street, it's a lot of unknowns. Do they have chronic medical conditions they're not even aware of? Do they have addiction issues?\" McNulty said. \"The systems and triaging and maybe even the resources to really appropriately care for people when taking in such a varied population probably should increase.\"   Since the early months of the administration, officials have touted focusing their arrests in the \"interior\" of the country, as numbers of crossings at the southern border have steadily decreased.   DHS Spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told NPR in a statement that detainees receive medical, dental and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility and access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care.   \"With all these healthcare services and access to medical care ICE provides illegal aliens in detention, it should come as no surprise to the media that as we expand detention space, we need to hire more medical professionals,\" McLaughlin said.   \n   But both Mina and McNulty said that hiring medical staff at immigration detention facilities has long been a challenge for the agency. According to a review of detainee deaths since 2004, three detention facilities have held the most deaths: Eloy Federal Contract facility just outside Phoenix; Krome Services Processing Center in Florida; and Stewart Detention Center in Georgia.   A 2021 DHS Office of Inspector General report identified \"remote locations, a cumbersome hiring process, and competing opportunities\" among the challenges to retaining and recruiting medical staff. The Eloy and Stewart facilities were specifically mentioned as among those experiencing these difficulties.   \n   DHS has begun a process to hire more medical professionals including nurses and pharmacists as it expands its hiring across ICE, including deportation officers and detention personnel.   \"ICE is actively recruiting healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, psychiatrists, pharmacists, and health administrators, to support the expanded detention capacity enabled by the historic funding provided under President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill,\" McLaughlin told NPR in a statement.   \n   \"Just like with the general population, unfortunately, people will die over a period of time for any series of medical ailments,\" Mina, former deputy officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties at ICE, said. \"But the real question is: In a given case, were there circumstances or actions taken or not taken that suggest that that death may have been preventable?\"\n",

About 1 in 8 U.S. residents get an average of $187 a month through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. One of those people is Shari Jablonowski. The 66-year-old widow, who lives outside Pittsburgh, is bracing to lose the $291 in food aid her disabled nephew gets each month. She raised her now-adult nephew and two nieces as her own, and even without this looming crisis, her budget is a tightrope.   \n   \"This month, I could not afford to pay … anything, gas or electric,\" she says. Instead she paid her monthly car payment, since she needs to drive to doctors' appointments, visit her mother, and one niece uses the car to get to work.   \n   If her nephew's food benefit disappears in November? \"I am very concerned I will not have heat,\" she says. It would also ruin Thanksgiving.   SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, is the country's largest anti-hunger program.   \n   \"The vast majority are children, working people, older Americans, veterans and people with disabilities,\" Joel Berg, CEO of Hunger Free America, says of food stamp recipients. \"If the SNAP program shuts down, we will have the most mass hunger suffering we've had in America since the Great Depression.\"   For most people, SNAP is the only money they get directly. Cash welfare was dramatically reduced in the 1990s, Berg notes, and Medicaid payments go directly to doctors, hospitals and drug companies.\"The only thing that really helps moderate income and low-income Americans meet their basic monthly expenses is the SNAP program. And that's why it's so vital, not only in terms of fighting hunger, but just keeping tens of millions of Americans afloat each month,\" he says.   \n   In addition, a separate nutrition program for 7 million pregnant women and new parents is also at risk of running out of money. The Trump administration tapped $300 million in tariff funds to keep WIC — the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children — afloat, but it's expected to run out within a few weeks. Some states say they'll help fill that funding gap, but not all have the resources for that.   There's pressure on USDA to keep funding SNAP   Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has warned that SNAP funding will run out on Nov. 1, and USDA has told states that payments are on hold \"until further notice.\"   The agency blames Democrats, who say they won't vote to end the shutdown unless Republicans agree to extend tax credits for the Affordable Care Act to keep health insurance premiums from skyrocketing.   \n   In a statement to NPR a USDA spokesperson said, \"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. Continue to hold out for healthcare for illegals or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments.\"   Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for the Affordable Care Act.   Food aid advocates say USDA can and should keep funding SNAP. \"SNAP still has billions of dollars in what are called contingency reserves,\" says Katie Bergh, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a non-partisan research and policy institute. That wouldn't cover the entire amount, but she says the agency could legally transfer additional funds, as they've done for the WIC nutrition program. In fact, Bergh argues USDA has a legal obligation to fund SNAP since it's an entitlement program.   Department officials did not respond to an NPR query about whether there is such a legal obligation.   The origins of U.S. food benefits go back to the Great Depression. If funding does lapse next month, Bergh says, \"We would be in uncharted territory.\"   \n   And for some SNAP recipients it could be double whammy. That's because many will be subject to new work requirements tied to the benefit starting November 1 – the same day their benefits might end.   The work requirements, passed by Congressional Republicans earlier this year, are expected to push 2.4 million people off the program over the next decade.   States and food banks are scrambling to help   In a letter Thursday, the U.S. Conference of Mayors also urged USDA not to let SNAP benefits be disrupted, saying the program helps stabilize local economies.Each month, the federal government pays $8 billion in SNAP benefits. The money is automatically added to a debit-like card that recipients can then use at groceries, farmers markets and other places. More than 250,000 food retailers count on that income, says Berg with Hunger Free America.   It's not clear whether the government will act in time to prevent SNAP benefits from ending. And if it does – but waits until the last minute – it would take days to get the benefits distributed to states and then onto people's spending cards.   Meanwhile, states are preparing for a spike in demand at food banks. Virginia, for example, declared a state of emergency and said it would provide food benefits. Colorado's governor urged people to donate to food banks, and California said it would send National Guard troops to help out at food banks, as it did during the COVID-19 pandemic.   But advocates say even expanded food charity will nowhere near make up for the loss of billions in federal funding.   Meanwhile, Shari Jablonowski struggles to think how she'll cope with a major hole in her budget. She already visits food pantries and plans to step that up. But \"there's nothing I can do to make money,\" she says. \"I'm not in the greatest of health.\"   \n   For now, she's making big batches of soup and freezing some for later.\n",

Trump's call for an abrupt end to negotiations could further inflame trade tensions that already have been building between the two neighboring countries for months.   Trump posted, \"The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs.\"   \n   \"The ad was for $75,000. They only did this to interfere with the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, and other courts,\" Trump wrote on his social media site. \"TARIFFS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY, AND ECONOMY, OF THE U.S.A. Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED.\"   Carney's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The prime minister was set to leave Friday morning for a summit in Asia, while Trump is set to do the same Friday evening.   Earlier Thursday night, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute posted on X that an ad created by the government of Ontario \"misrepresents the 'Presidential Radio Address to the Nation on Free and Fair Trade' dated April 25, 1987.\" It added that Ontario did not receive foundation permission \"to use and edit the remarks.\"   The foundation said it is \"reviewing legal options in this matter\" and invited the public to watch the unedited video of Reagan's address.   Carney met with Trump earlier this month to try to ease trade tensions, as the two countries and Mexico prepare for a review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement — a trade deal Trump negotiated in his first term, but has since soured on.   \n   More than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the U.S., and nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border daily.   Trump said earlier this week that he had seen the ad on television and said that it showed that his tariffs were having an impact.   \"I saw an ad last night from Canada. If I was Canada, I'd take that same ad also,\" he said then.   In his own post on X last week, Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, posted a link to the ad and the message: \"It's official: Ontario's new advertising campaign in the U.S. has launched.\"   \n   He continued, \"Using every tool we have, we'll never stop making the case against American tariffs on Canada. The way to prosperity is by working together.\"   A spokesperson for Ford didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night. But Ford previously got Trump's attention with an electricity surcharge to U.S. states. Trump responded by doubling steel and aluminum tariffs.   The president has moved to impose steep U.S. tariffs on many goods from Canada. In April, Canada's government imposed retaliatory levies on certain U.S. goods -- but it carved out exemptions for some automakers to bring specific numbers of vehicles into the country, known as remission quotas.   \n   Trump's tariffs have especially hurt Canada's auto sector, much of which is based in Ontario. This month, Stellantis said it would move a production line from Ontario to Illinois.\n",

The demolition is part of President Trump's plan to build a ballroom.\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   All that's left of the East Wing of the White House is a pile of rubble.   A White House official not authorized to speak on the record tells NPR the demolition phase of President Trump's project to build a 90,000 square foot ballroom, is ahead of schedule.   Although Trump initially said the project wouldn't \"interfere with the current building\" and would be \"near it but not touching it,\" he explained Wednesday that \"in order to do it properly, we had to take down the existing structure.\"   The East Wing demolition, the White House official said, is going directly up to the edge of the residence and includes tearing down the East Garden Room, Family Theater and East Colonnade, as well as the complex of offices. The sight of excavators tearing into the East Wing set off alarms among preservationists, but the White House is doubling down, insisting the demolition is necessary.   \n   \"The plans changed, and the president heard counsel from the architects and the construction companies who said that in order for this East Wing to be modern and beautiful for many, many years to come, for it to be a truly strong and stable structure, this Phase 1 that we're now in was necessary,\" said Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, in a briefing on Thursday. \"The president wants to do right by the People's House.\"   \n   The offices and other facilities that were in the East Wing will be rebuilt and modernized, said Leavitt. There will also be security enhancements involving the underground bunker built under the East Wing during World War II, known as the Presidential Emergency Operations Center.   The East Wing will \"be more beautiful and modern than ever before,\" said Leavitt. \"And in addition, there will be a big, beautiful ballroom that can hold big parties and state visits for generations to come.\"   Going back at least to the year 2010, Trump has complained that the White House doesn't have an appropriate space for State Dinners and other large gatherings, often requiring large tents to be set up on the South Lawn.   When it was first announced over the summer, the White House said the project would cost $200 million. Costs have already ballooned, with the president now describing it as a $300 million project, which the White House says will all still be funded by private donors.   \n   In a letter earlier this week, The National Trust for Historic Preservation called on the Trump administration to pause demolition until the ballroom plans go through \"the legally required public review processes,\" which includes input and approval from the National Capital Planning Commission.   \"We are deeply concerned that the massing and height of the proposed new construction will overwhelm the White House itself — it is 55,000 square feet — and may also permanently disrupt the carefully balanced classical design of the White House with its two smaller, and lower, East and West Wings,\" the letter said.   In a social media post by Steven Cheung, White House director of communications, said The National Trust for Historic Preservation is \"run by a bunch of loser Democrats and liberal donors who are playing political games.\"   A fact sheet released by the White House slammed criticisms as \"manufactured outrage\" by \"unhinged leftists and their Fake News allies\" who are \"clutching their pearls over President Donald J. Trump's visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom to the White House.\"   In a statement to NPR, the White House Historical Association said it created a historic record of the East Wing prior to the demolition through digital scans and photographs.   \"The East Wing and gardens have been captured in detail for the benefit of our nation and historic artifacts from the East Wing have been preserved and stored,\" the statement read.   But the White House has not yet submitted construction plans to the National Capital Planning Commission, the agency tasked with approving major renovations and construction projects on federal grounds in Washington, D.C. The White House official said they do not have a timeline for submitting the plans, but do intend to seek approval before the construction phase begins.   Will Scharff, a top Trump aide and chair of the commission, said during a public commission meeting in September that the commission doesn't have jurisdiction over demolition, therefore it did not need to approve Trump's plan to tear down the East Wing to make way for the ballroom.   \n   \"Any assertion that this commission should have been consulted earlier than it has been or that it will be is simply false and represents a misunderstanding of this commission's role in that project,\" Scharff said. \"When we are submitted a plan, we will review that plan.\"   The commission is currently closed due to the government shutdown and their October meeting has been canceled.   Preston Bryant, the former chair of the commission for nine years and appointed by then-President Barack Obama and Trump during his first term, doesn't agree with Scharff's assertion over jurisdiction. In an email to NPR, Bryant said the commission's review and approval process includes the entire project design.   \"In that process, what's demolished would be part of the project plan to be reviewed and approved. What's demolished is inherent in the design. Site preparation also is inherent in the design,\" he said.   The ballroom has a hefty price tag attached to it. Trump said during a meeting on Wednesday that the project will cost around $300 million. That's up from previous estimates of $200 to $250 million. But Trump claims the ballroom is exclusively paid for by himself and private donors.   The White House official said the project has secured $200 million in donations so far and provided a list of donors to NPR. The donors include big names like Amazon, Google, Meta and Lockheed Martin.

So Weeks was shocked and dismayed when she learned President Trump was looking to import more beef from another country.   \" It feels like a slap in the face to rural America,\" she said. \"It makes you feel invisible and overlooked.\"   Beef prices have been soaring in the U.S. as a result of a shrunken cattle supply. On Sunday, Trump suggested buying beef from Argentina could be one way to lower costs. It comes as the president already agreed to a $20 billion currency swap to boost the South American ally's struggling economy.   \n   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Destinee Weeks said her husband's farm in northern Oklahoma has been in his family for over a hundred years. Her dream is to one day pass down the farm and ranch to their children.\n                \n                    Destinee Weeks\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Destinee Weeks\n    \n\n   \n   American cattle ranchers and agricultural groups swiftly opposed the possible deal, arguing that it would hurt ranchers. But Trump defended the move while talking to reporters on Sunday, asserting that \"Argentina is fighting for its life.\" He also claimed on Truth Social that his global tariffs have helped ranchers.   \"The Cattle Ranchers, who I love, don't understand that the only reason they are doing so well, for the first time in decades, is because I put Tariffs on cattle coming into the United States,\" Trump wrote in his Wednesday post.   Despite days of verbal clashes between president and ranchers, the White House on Wednesday confirmed plans to quadruple the tariff-rate quota for beef imports from Argentina. The same day, the Department of Agriculture announced an action plan to support domestic cattle ranchers.   The United States Cattlemen's Association said the USDA's initiative was a positive step forward, but the group was still \"deeply concerned\" about the move to purchase more foreign beef.   \"A deal of this magnitude with Argentina would undercut the very foundation of our cattle industry,\" USCA president Justin Tupper said in a statement.   Cattle ranchers say it's not their fault that prices are high   The U.S. cattle inventory is at its lowest levels in decades — a trend driven by drought and rising operation costs, which has forced many ranchers to shrink their herds.   \n   In August, the cost of ground beef per pound was about $6.63 — about two dollars more than it was four years ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. At the same time, higher prices have offered a path to recovery for some ranchers like Weeks.   \"I wanna make it very clear, when we say it's profitable, no one's riding off into the sunset in a yacht,\" she said. \"We're healing up.\"   \n   Meanwhile, some ranchers argue there's another key player shaping beef prices: the four meatpacking firms that control over 80% of U.S. beef processing.   \" The American rancher is not in control of the price of beef in this country,\" said Christian Lovell, an Illinois cattle producer and senior director of programs at Farm Action, a nonpartisan advocacy group.   Recently, two of those companies — Tyson Foods and Cargill — agreed to pay a combined $87.5 million to settle a class-action lawsuit accusing them of fixing beef prices. It's a big reason why Lovell called the cattle market \"broken.\"   \"Importing more beef is not going to fix that problem,\" he said.   Some are skeptical that importing Argentine beef will lower prices   The U.S. already imports a record amount of beef from other countries, including Argentina, according to David Anderson, a livestock economist at Texas A&M University.   The challenge with relying on foreign meat to bring down prices is that the U.S. is the world's largest consumer of beef. Anderson said it's unlikely that Argentina has nearly enough supply to satisfy America's appetite.   \"They just don't have the kind of supplies that they could export to us that would make much of a noticeable impact on U.S. beef prices to consumers,\" he said.   Anderson added that ultimately, it will take time for beef prices to stabilize.   \"There's no easy solution to bringing down prices — particularly an easy, quick solution,\" he said.   \n   The moves comes after a fallout with other farmers    John Boyd Jr., a cattle and crop farmer in Virginia and the founder of the National Black Farmers Association, has already been reeling from Trump's trade war with China, which has caused it to stop buying U.S. soybeans. Now, Boyd is concerned about his cattle business.   \"Everything that the president is messing with and interfering with affects my farming operation,\" he said.   The USDA on Wednesday responded to the ranchers' concerns by laying out a slew of plans to strengthen the country's beef industry. That includes expanding grazing access and bolstering natural disaster relief.   \n   Still, Boyd said purchasing more meat from Argentina does not sit right with him.   \"I'm opposed to Argentina getting anything else from the United States,\" he said.   These clashes are particularly notable because farmers and ranchers are a major voting bloc for Trump. Weeks, from Oklahoma, said she simply wants the president to stick to his agenda of putting America first.   \"I think that we should always choose to support our domestic producers,\" she said.\n",

House Speaker Mike Johnson called them \"Hate America\" rallies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that they would attract \"the most unhinged in the Democratic party.\"   Instead, the rallies were most notable for a funhouse Noah's Ark of frogs, pandas, koalas, woodchucks, sharks and lobsters. Taking a page from the protest playbook in Portland, people showed up in inflatable animal costumes.   In Washington, a poodle and a chicken danced to drum music with three dinosaurs next to the National Gallery, a short walk from the U.S. Capitol. Scott Rohrbach, a senior optical engineer at NASA, came dressed as a unicorn. It was not his first choice.   \n   \"I would have come as a frog, but I couldn't find a frog,\" said Rohrbach, disappointed that all the frog costumes were sold out.   Rohrbach said he came to protest because he fears that under President Trump, future elections may not be fair. He wore the costume to counter the Republican narrative that protesters like him are hate-filled, anti-American radicals.   Inspiration from a frog suit   \"One of the things fascists can't handle is humor,\" said Rohrbach, who added that fellow protesters posed with him for selfies and kids gave him high-fives.   President Trump has said repeatedly that he is neither a fascist nor a king and dismissed the rallies.   \"I think it's a joke,\" he told reporters. \"I looked at the people. They're not representative of this country.\"   The president answered the demonstrations with his own brand of humor, posting an AI-generated video of him wearing a crown while flying a jet and dumping what looked like excrement on protesters.   So what inspired Rohrbach and so many others to dress up like animals and mythical creatures last weekend?   It all started earlier this month in Portland. A man in a frog suit was trying to help a fellow protester at an anti-ICE rally. A law enforcement officer responded by spraying the suit's air valve with a chemical agent as captured on video.   \n   The image of the officer in a black helmet and shield going after the protester in the frog costume caught the eye of many, including Jordy Lybeck, a political streamer. Lybeck began brainstorming in real time with his viewers.   \"How much are those outfits?\" Lybeck wondered aloud. \"Are you thinking what I'm thinking? What if somebody bought a lot of them and distributed them at the facility?\"   That's exactly what Lybeck and Brooks Brown, who streams about philosophy, did. They raised money online, bought more costumes and drove them to the ICE facility in Portland.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Protesters dressed as a chicken, a poodle and a dinosaur danced to drum music a short walk from the U.S. Capitol. The No Kings protest had a carnival-like feel.\n                \n                    Frank Langfitt/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Frank Langfitt/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   They call it \"Operation Inflation.\" The goal: Undermine Trump's argument that he had to deploy troops because Portland was, as he put it, a \"war zone.\"   Absurdist humor as an effective tactic   \"People who were watching at home saw that we were mocking the lies about how Portland is a wasteland of burning nightmares,\" Brown told NPR.   He also said the costumes make protesters seem less threatening — it's hard to see out of or move quickly in an inflatable suit. Brown said he spoke to a police officer on the scene who thought the same.   \"He said he knows anyone in these costumes isn't going to be doing something that they've got to run from,\" said Brown, \"which is fair, because if you haven't been in one of these costumes, you cannot run in them.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Brooks Brown, who streams about philosophy, raised money and distributed inflatable animal costumes in Portland earlier this month. He said the strategy was to undermine President Trump's claim that protests had turned the city into a \"war zone.\"\n                \n                    Courtesy of Brooks Brown\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Courtesy of Brooks Brown\n    \n\n   \n   Kim Lane Scheppele is a Princeton professor who studies democracy and authoritarianism. She says absurdist humor can be an effective tactic against autocrats, which is how she views Trump. Scheppele recalled a case in the Siberian city of Barnaul in 2012.   Critics of Vladimir Putin, who was running for a third term as Russian president, put dozens of children's toys in the main square. The toys, which included teddy bears and Transformers, held signs criticizing corruption and calling for fair elections.   \n   Toys in Siberia    City officials in Barnaul determined the demonstration was unsanctioned. When demonstrators petitioned to hold a second protest, officials rejected it on the grounds that the toys were \"inanimate objects\" and not \"citizens of Russia,\" according to Britain's Guardian newspaper and the U.S. government's Radio Free Europe.   Scheppele says stunts like this publicize a political message while laying a trap for officials.   \"They do it in such a way that any response from the government makes them look worse,\" she told NPR.   Brown, the streamer, says dressing up as animals serves a similar purpose here. He says the funny-looking outfits change the optics of protests so that government force looks more like farce. After all, it's not easy to portray an inflatable frog — or unicorn — as \"the enemy from within.\"\n",

The Trump administration dismissed widespread criticism as \"manufactured outrage\" in a fact sheet released Tuesday, which outlines the various renovations that presidents have made to the property over the last century and suggests this one is no different.   \n   \"Unhinged leftists and their Fake News allies are clutching their pearls over President Donald J. Trump's visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom to the White House — a bold, necessary addition that echoes the storied history of improvements and additions from commanders-in-chief to keep the executive residence as a beacon of American excellence,\" the White House said.   The White House has undergone renovations both large and small since its creation in 1792. But this would be the biggest addition — in scope and size — since the 1940s, Priya Jain, the chair of the Society of Architectural Historians' Heritage Conservation Committee, told NPR.   \n   \"In the list that was issued yesterday, if you look at it closely, all the changes after 1942 have been limited to the interior,\" Jain said. \"And the ones on the exterior either involved simple restoration or minor site additions like the tennis court and the pavilion, which are limited by their scope, size and visibility to have any negative impact on the historic building.\"   Here's a look at how presidents have changed the White House.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The only known sketch of the original White House before it was burned by British troops in the War of 1812.\n                \n                    File/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        File/AP\n    \n\n   \n   1700s and 1800s: The White House is built and rebuilt   The cornerstone for the White House was laid in the newly designated nation's capital in October 1792, a year after President George Washington selected the site himself.   The neoclassical building was designed by Irish-born architect James Hoban and constructed by a team of enslaved and freed Black Americans and European immigrants over the course of eight years.   \n   President John Adams and his wife, Abigail, were the first to inhabit the residence, which was still unfinished by the time they moved in toward the end of his term in November 1800. President Thomas Jefferson moved in the following year and went on to decorate the \"president's house\" with furnishings he had inherited from all of his presidential predecessors.   But almost all of it was lost in 1814, when British troops set fire to the building during the War of 1812. President James Madison and first lady Dolley Madison both fled Washington, D.C., to safety, the latter managing to bring a full-size portrait of former President George Washington with her. Both returned to a temporary residence to finish out his presidency.   \n   Hoban oversaw the rebuilding of the White House. Its second incarnation, which closely resembled the first, officially reopened with President James Monroe's arrival in 1817.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                This etching shows the south front side of the White House in 1825, a year after the completion of the curved South Portico.\n                \n                    File/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        File/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Monroe later tasked Hoban with the building's first major addition, the South Portico — the iconic rounded entrance lined with Ionic columns — was completed in 1824. Construction of the North Portico was completed in 1830, under President Andrew Jackson.   Early 20th century: The creation and expansion of the West Wing   The next big changes happened under President Theodore Roosevelt.   In 1901, he renamed it the \"White House\" in all formal communications, making its longtime nickname official. (It was originally called the \"president's house\" or \"executive mansion\", but most people started referring to it by its limestone white-wash coloring in the early 1800s.)   In 1902, Roosevelt began a major renovation of the physical building that \"transformed it from a crazy quilt of alterations over time into a cohesive statement of modern times,\" the late author and historian William Seale wrote.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                An aerial view of the White House in August 1934.\n                \n                    File/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        File/AP\n    \n\n   \n   The biggest change was the relocation of his office from the second floor to the West Wing, originally called the Executive Office Building. The separate, one-story structure was accessible by walkway and housed the offices of presidential staff and secretaries as well as a Cabinet meeting room.   The project expanded the first family's living quarters (necessary, since the Roosevelts had six young kids) and modernized the building's heating and plumbing systems. It also created the East Terrace — a new entryway for guests that would later become the East Wing.   \n   Subsequent presidents continued to build on Roosevelt's renovations.   President William Taft remodeled and expanded the West Wing in 1909 to create the Oval Office. President Calvin Coolidge had the roof rebuilt and a third floor added in 1927, after an engineering report showed that the roof trusses were weakened and unsafe.   The West Wing was remodeled after a 1929 fire and further expanded in 1934, when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt relocated the Oval Office to its current location for more privacy, built more offices underground and installed an indoor swimming pool for his polio therapy (financed by private donations).   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The indoor White House swimming pool, pictured in1965.\n                \n                    File/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        File/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Mid-20th century: Controversial additions and a major renovation   FDR also had the East Wing created in 1942, primarily to cover up an underground bunker and to house more staff and offices during the war.   \n   According to the White House Historical Association, the wartime construction of the East Wing was highly controversial. Republicans criticized it as wasteful and accused Roosevelt of \"using the project to bolster his presidency's image.\"   \n   \"The secretive nature of the construction, tied to military purposes, further fueled suspicions,\" wrote association president Stewart McLaurin. \"However, the East Wing's utility in supporting the modern presidency eventually quieted critics.\"   The next major renovation, and perhaps the biggest one, happened under President Harry Truman in the late 1940s.   In response to structural deficiencies, his architects decided to gut the entire interior, leaving only the exterior walls intact, between 1948 and 1952. The project cost the equivalent of $60 million — funded and authorized by Congress — and drew intense scrutiny from preservationists and the public.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                As President Harry Truman and General Dwight Eisenhower greet military officials at the White House in June 1952, First Lady Bess Truman and First Daughter Margaret Truman hang over the railing on the upper balcony.\n                \n                    Charles Gorry/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Charles Gorry/AP\n    \n\n   \n   One of the most controversial changes was the addition of a balcony to the second floor of the South Portico. While opposed by some architectural purists and Truman's opponents in Congress for both aesthetic and financial reasons, the Truman Balcony has become a hallmark of both first family leisure and official White House events (think: Easter Egg roll).   \"The Truman Balcony was something that was really controversial at the time, and now it's one of the most beloved parts of the White House for the president and their family to be sitting outside looking out on the South Lawn,\" Kate Andersen Brower, author of The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House, told NPR's Here & Now.   Truman funded the balcony himself, using money from his allocated household account. Brower said Trump's ballroom is the biggest renovation since then — but is different in key ways.   \"[Truman] wasn't going to take no for an answer, but he did go through the channels to get approval for this renovation. And we're not seeing President Trump do the same thing,\" she added.   \n   Late 20th century onward: Presidents personalize the grounds    Recent decades have seen frequent but relatively minor changes to White House grounds.   President John F. Kennedy created the modern Rose Garden in 1963 — and it remained relatively unchanged until this August, when Trump had it paved over and turned into a patio.   \n   In the 1970s, President Richard Nixon converted the indoor swimming pool into the White House Press Room and installed a one-lane bowling alley, while President Gerald Ford had a swimming pool (also privately funded) built outdoors.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Jimmy Carter, center, inspects the new White House solar hot water heating system located on the roof of the West Wing in June 1976.\n                \n                    Harvey Georges/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Harvey Georges/AP\n    \n\n   \n   In the early 2000s, President George W. Bush modernized the press briefing room and the Situation Room and installed the first-ever solar electric system on White House grounds (President Jimmy Carter first installed solar heating panels on the White House roof in 1979, but they were removed in the 1980s).   President Barack Obama adapted a tennis court so it could also be used for basketball, and First Lady Michelle Obama planted the White House Kitchen Garden on the South Lawn.   Trump has changed the grounds already   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Donald Trump speaks during an October 2025 lunch with Republican senators in the White House Rose Garden, which he paved into a patio earlier this year.\n                \n                    Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Trump himself has made a slew of renovations since his second term began in January, and not just to the Rose Garden.   He's also bedecked the Oval Office with gilded frames and golden details, and added a Presidential Walk of Fame to the walkway between the West Wing and executive residence. It features portraits of every previous president except for President Joe Biden. Instead of a headshot, Biden's frame features a picture of an autopen, which Trump has repeatedly accused him of using (despite the fact that the practice is not prohibited).   \n   The White House says Trump is carrying on a \"proud presidential legacy\" of making upgrades to the building, in this case increasing its capacity to host major functions. The East Room currently seats about 200 people for dinner, meaning many large White House events are hosted outside in fancy tents with floors and chandeliers.   Brower, the author, says there is a case to be made for expanding the entertaining space at the White House, with caveats: \"I don't think that it has to be of this size and scope, two football fields big and larger than the White House itself.\"\n",

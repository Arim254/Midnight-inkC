The deal, worth almost $49 billion, comes at a particularly difficult time for Tylenol-maker Kenvue, after the Trump administration linked acetaminophen — the active ingredient in this common painkiller — to autism. The assertions came despite a lack of clear scientific evidence, and Kenvue has called them simply false.   For Kimberly-Clark, the deal adds a new swath of consumer brands. Besides Tylenol, Kenvue also owns other pharmacy mainstays such as Band-Aid, Listerine, Neutrogena and Aveeno.    \n   Kimberly-Clark CEO Mike Hsu said in Monday's announcement, that the two \"iconic companies\" would create \"a global health and wellness leader.\"    Executives from both companies said the combined entity would serve people \"at every stage of life\" and benefit from Kenvue's relationships with dermatologists, dentists, pediatricians and other healthcare professionals.    Kimberly-Clark has been attempting to challenge the dominance of consumer goliath Procter & Gamble, whose business spans all drugstore aisles, including cold and digestion medicines.    And Kenvue has been on the selling block for a while now, ever since it was spun off from Johnson & Johnson in 2023. Its share price collapsed a few months after going public, losing a third of its value since the start of the year before Monday's news.   On Monday morning, Kenvue's stock price jumped around 17%, while Kimberly-Clark's fell about 12%.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., about how the start of health insurance open enrollment and other issues might change his party's shutdown strategy going forward.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  As we've been reporting on this increasingly lengthy government shutdown, we've been talking with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress about the politics around the shutdown and also about the substantive issues that Selena just told us about. This morning, Senator Chris Van Hollen is with us. He is a Democrat. He is the senior senator from Maryland, and he sits on the Senate appropriations and budget committees.Good morning, Senator. Thanks for joining us.CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Michel, good morning.MARTIN: So as we just heard from Selena's reporting, the Affordable Care Act marketplace open enrollment period is underway, and millions of people are about to see what their health insurance is going to cost them. The prediction is there's going to be sticker shock. Do you think that this might unlock the stalemate in Congress?VAN HOLLEN: Well, I certainly hope so. This is the ticking time bomb on health care costs that we've been warning about, and now people are seeing that sticker shock. And you would hope that that would get President Trump to finally focus and come to the table to talk to Democrats to resolve these matters, instead of spending all this time either at Mar-a-Lago or traipsing around the world or providing a $20 billion taxpayer bailout to his buddy in Argentina or trying to build a new ballroom. We've been trying, Michel, to get the president to the table to talk about these things.MARTIN: So I see that you're bypassing your Republican colleagues. You're saying you want to go straight to President Trump, that he's the key to this. Is that what I'm hearing you say?VAN HOLLEN: President Trump is really the only Republican in Washington, D.C., who matters because, at the end of the day, all the other Republicans do what he says to do - with one exception, which is his call to change the supermajority on the filibuster. But with that one exception, Trump is the only Republican in town who I think we can - we hope to make a deal with. And that's why it's important that he finally come to the table.MARTIN: So President Trump told \"60 Minutes\" he is willing to work with Democrats on health care. Let's listen.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Obamacare is terrible. It's bad health care at far too high a price. We should fix that.UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: And...TRUMP: We should fix it, and we can fix it with the Democrats. All they have to do is let the country open, and we'll fix it.MARTIN: So, Senator, I recognize that Democrats are frustrated that Republicans complain about the Affordable Care Act but, to this point, haven't really presented an alternative, certainly not in the current Congress. But having said that, first of all, let me just ask you - do you believe that? Do you believe that the president will negotiate if you do vote - if the Democrats do - if enough Democrats join Republicans in voting to end the shutdown?VAN HOLLEN: No, I don't believe the president. And I have now voted, Michel, seven times to open the government, but do it without giving Donald Trump a blank check for lawless activities and to deal with this health care crisis. And so this really is the moment that the president needs to come to the table, like all other presidents have done before.MARTIN: So - and to that other issue that Selena talked about in her reporting, the expiring ACA tax subsidies are just part of the issue that increased health insurance costs. Do Democrats also have a plan for issue like the repayment cap that was eliminated by the Republican tax and spending bill in the summer?VAN HOLLEN: Well, we'd like to deal with that issue. But the immediate issue is simply extending the existing tax cuts - right? - that allow middle-class and working-class families to afford health care. It's the one tax cut that the - that Republicans refused to extend when they passed their so-called Big Beautiful Bill, right? They extended tax cuts for billionaires permanently, but they are allowing this one to lapse. So the priority is to fix this. We're happy to also discuss the cap and other issues if the president wants to sit down at the table and get it done.MARTIN: So, you know, this shutdown is causing some real pain, which you certainly know. I mean, you have a lot of constituents who are affected by it. Beyond rising health care costs, federal workers are going unpaid. People are losing federal food aid. Access to the free early childhood development program, Head Start, for low-income families might be, you know, shut down. The head of AFGE, the American Federation of Government Employees, is now calling for Democrats to vote for a bill to reopen the government. At what point does the juice not become worth the squeeze from prolonging this fight?VAN HOLLEN: Well, I'd like to end the fight. And the way to do it is to get Donald Trump to talk about it, as we've been discussing. Again, there are big issues here, and we need to resolve them. I have, as I said, voted to reopen the government. The president is deciding to try to make this even more painful than it has to be. I mean, they've been withholding food assistance intentionally. They claim they had to do that. Turns out, as we said, they did not have to do it. In fact, a judge has said that they're required by law to use the contingency funds. So, Donald Trump, quit trying to increase the pain more than necessary and let's get this done.MARTIN: That is Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland. He's a Democrat. Senator Van Hollen, thank you so much.VAN HOLLEN: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF THE AMERICAN ANALOG SET SONG, \"DIANA SLOWBURNER II\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Virginia voters will elect a new governor Tuesday, as Democratic lawmakers in the state also prepare to redraw the state's congressional map to counter Republican redistricting efforts.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Virginia voters are choosing a governor. The election ends on Tuesday. Some things are normal here. It's an off-year election, and those elections tend to lean against the party in power nationally. Virginia's race also has had some surprises. For example, a lot of Virginia voters are furloughed because of the government shutdown. Text messages from the Democratic candidate for attorney general have shaken this race, and Democrats are saying they intend to redraw Virginia's congressional map to counter President Trump's attempt to hold on to Congress. Jahd Khalil of VPM News reports on the campaign's final week in Richmond.JAHD KHALIL, BYLINE: Monday afternoon, the Virginia Capitol's six white columns are under a gray sky. Standing in front of them is Virginia's lieutenant governor, Winsome Earle-Sears. She's this year's Republican candidate for governor.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)WINSOME EARLE-SEARS: Well, all right.KHALIL: A small crowd holds, Winsome for Governor, signs. But the Republican says it's not a campaign event as Lieutenant Governor Earle-Sears runs the proceedings of the Senate.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)EARLE-SEARS: I am standing here today not as a candidate, not on the campaign trail, but as your lieutenant governor, fulfilling my oath to speak for the people in our great Senate chamber and to defend the principles that make Virginia strong.KHALIL: The Democrats in control of the legislature called a SNAP meeting. It was a reaction to Trump's push to get Republican-led states to redraw their congressional maps with a GOP advantage ahead of the midterms. Earle-Sears says she'd rather be out talking to voters.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)EARLE-SEARS: It's no surprise that this political power grab would come one week before an election. They want to hear from us, from our own mouths, what it is that we're about. They want to touch us and, you know, all that good stuff. And unfortunately, I can't do it. But you know who can? Abigail Spanberger is still going to be able to be on the campaign trail.KHALIL: Abigail Spanberger is a former congresswoman and the Democrats' nominee. As Earle-Sears spoke, Spanberger was on a bus tour in Southwest Virginia. It's one of the reddest parts of the state and just about as far as you can get from Richmond. It's difficult to know what kind of effect taking the Republican off the campaign trail may have had on the race.Henry Chambers Jr. is a constitutional law professor at the University of Richmond. He says strong candidates have a ground game, with volunteers and staff knocking doors and talking to voters.HENRY CHAMBERS JR: I'm not sure that the candidate him or herself necessarily needs to be out there doing the campaigning.KHALIL: Earle-Sears isn't the only one taken off the campaign trail. All 100 seats for the House of Delegates are up for election, and both incumbent Republicans and Democrats are in close races.CHAMBERS: I imagine some people will be a little - they'll feel a little like cats on a hot tin roof.KHALIL: Before lawmakers announced a redistricting meeting, about a million Virginians had already voted. Republicans are arguing that those early voters didn't have the chance to consider the redistricting effort when casting their ballots.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MORGAN GRIFFITH: I submit to you they should have done it before the election started.KHALIL: Congressman Morgan Griffith is one of the Republican members who could see their districts tilted against them next fall.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GRIFFITH: If they put something on the table as a constitutional amendment, you had an opportunity as a voter to throw the bums out.KHALIL: A new congressional map in Virginia could give Democrats two more seats. But it would have to go through the next legislature, too, and then on to voters in the spring. Spanberger, who has a comfortable lead in polls and a well-funded campaign, hasn't come out and says she supports the redistricting effort, but a spokesperson for her campaign gave NPR a statement. TaNisha Cameron said Spanberger thinks it's prudent the legislature keep all possible options open and that she looks forward to future discussion.For NPR News, I'm Jahd Khalil in Richmond.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "\n      The leading candidates in New York City's mayoral race spent the weekend rushing from campaign event-to-event ahead of Tuesday's election.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  More than 730,000 New York City voters have already cast their ballots for mayor, a huge number for a nonpresidential election. There is a lot at stake in this race - leadership of the largest city in the U.S., but also a fight over the future of the Democratic Party. Over this last weekend of campaigning, front-runner Zohran Mamdani has been fending off increasingly intense attacks from his chief rival, former Governor Andrew Cuomo. With the final day of voting tomorrow, we're joined by Gwynne Hogan - she works for the local news outlet The City - and also by NPR's Brian Mann. Good morning to you both.GWYNNE HOGAN: Good morning.BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Michel.MARTIN: So, Gwynne, I'm going to start with you. You've been on the campaign trail with Mamdani. What are you seeing?HOGAN: Big crowds, lots of energy. I was at this rally over the weekend. Mamdani was greeting hundreds of volunteer canvassers in Queens. Some had traveled from across the country to come knock on doors in these final days of the election.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Your next mayor, Zohran Mamdani.(CHEERING)HOGAN: This is a campaign that's amassed more than 100,000 volunteers. They're knocking on doors all over the city. And over the weekend, Mamdani was seemingly everywhere. He was trick-or-treating with kids Friday night. He went to six different nightclubs on Saturday night, and he cheered on runners at the New York City Marathon on Sunday. He's really giving off this tireless energy in the final days of his campaign.MARTIN: And, Brian, you were with Cuomo over the weekend. What did you see?MANN: Yeah, Michel, much more low energy. Cuomo is 67, so he hasn't been out at night clubs. He did canvas over the weekend. His crowds were a lot smaller. But, you know, Cuomo's been a fixture in New York politics for decades and still has deep support, especially in the Black and Jewish communities. I spoke with Shareen Frantz (ph) at a Cuomo event in Queens on Saturday.SHAREEN FRANTZ: I think he's more experienced. The other guy, he's younger, and I don't think he has the experience, and I don't think it's a right choice right now.HOGAN: One thing worth mentioning, Cuomo's been helped at the close of this campaign by tens of millions of dollars of Super PAC ads, some supporting him, some attacking Mamdani. So while the energy on the street tilts towards Mamdani, Cuomo is benefiting from this deluge of ad spending funded in large part by a handful of billionaires.MARTIN: OK, so two very different campaigns. What about the messages? What kinds of closing arguments are you each hearing?MANN: Well, really, from Cuomo, it's a message of fear. He's been saying Mamdani would make the city less safe. He's saying Mamdani's democratic socialism would scare away businesses. Really, the tone was grim when I was with him in Queens. And, Gwynne, my sense is that what you were hearing when you were with Mamdani was pretty different.HOGAN: Yeah. That's right, Brian. Mamdani does always take a beat to fend off these attacks, but he's really stayed on message in these final days. It's that message of making New York City more affordable, promising to freeze the rent for the city's 1 million rent-stabilized tenants, making the city's buses faster and free and providing universal child care. And for a lot of the voters I've been talking to, that message of affordability is resonating.MARTIN: OK. So along with affordability, though, this campaign has included accusations of Islamophobia and antisemitism. I mean, how has this escalated?HOGAN: You know, if Mamdani wins, he'll be the city's first Muslim mayor. And in late October, Cuomo went on this conservative talk show, and the host said Mamdani would be cheering if another 9/11-style terror attack happened. Cuomo didn't push back and said, I'm quoting here. That's another problem. There are also these attack ads attempting to associate Mamdani with, quote, \"jihad on NYC.\" Over the weekend, Mamdani was speaking to this large crowd, many of whom were Muslim and of South Asian descent. He asked people to raise their hands if they've ever been called a terrorist, and a lot of hands went up. Mamdani went on to predict more bigotry and racism from Cuomo's allies in the coming days.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ZOHRAN MAMDANI: And our answer to that is a vision of a city where all of us belong.(CHEERING)MAMDANI: All of us.MANN: And, Michel, I was there over the weekend when Andrew Cuomo was asked about these accusations of Islamophobia and bigotry in his campaign. He pushed back. He said Mamdani hasn't done enough to support Israel and the city's Jewish residents.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ANDREW CUOMO: His verbiage with the Jewish community has been highly offensive to the Jewish community. If you don't realize that, then you haven't been in this city.HOGAN: This really has been a flashpoint in this race. It's also roiled the Democratic Party nationally. A September poll by Siena found most New York voters favor Mamdani's position on the Israel-Palestinian conflict, but more than 1,000 U.S. rabbis have signed a letter condemning Mamdani's rhetoric.MARTIN: You know, there's a third candidate in this race, Republican Curtis Sliwa. Has he been a factor? Brian?MANN: Well, in a way, he has been a big factor. Yeah, Sliwa's has been a fixture in the city for years. He founded a neighborhood safety group called the Guardian Angels. And while he's running in third place in this heavily Democratic city, he's made it harder for Cuomo to really square off one-on-one against Mamdani. Cuomo has hoped to win a lot of Republican votes. And there was pressure on Sliwa to drop out, but he's refused.HOGAN: And Sliwa's run for mayor before and lost in a landslide, but he says Republican voters - they don't want Cuomo or Mamdani as their next mayor. Sliwa said Cuomo is the one who should drop out, not him.MARTIN: I want to go back to one of the things we talked about at the beginning of this conversation, the contrast in this race between excitement for Mamdani versus Cuomo's experience. So how are the candidates talking about that?MANN: Yeah. This is one of Cuomo's big arguments. He says he has the deep experience in government needed to run this city. He wasn't just governor, remember. He was also a state attorney general. He served as housing secretary in the Clinton administration, and his resume does include some progressive legislation here in New York, including prison reform, strict gun control law and legalization of same-sex marriage.HOGAN: But Cuomo resigned as New York state governor after a sexual harassment scandal in 2021, and he's faced criticism for his handling of the COVID pandemic. He denies those allegations, but his resume hasn't given him the boost he's looking for. Mamdani, meanwhile, has said what he lacks in experience, he'll make up foreign integrity. And he's promising to surround himself with experienced civil servants. But, clearly, this is a big question voters will answer tomorrow, and it's a really pivotal moment in New York City. We're facing funding cuts from Trump's federal government. Do people want someone like Mamdani, with new and different ideas for New York City, or someone like Cuomo, who's been a fixture in the state's politics for decades?MARTIN: Before we let you go, Brian, I have one more question for you. Mamdani won the Democratic primary, which is why Cuomo is running as an independent. Does this say something about Cuomo and his ambitions, or does this say something about the Democratic Party writ large?MANN: Yeah. It's a fascinating question, and it's complicated. You know, the excitement Mamdani's generated in this race does thrill a lot of Democrats, especially younger voters, not just here, but around the country. He's emerged, really, as a national figure. But Mamdani's embrace of the socialist label makes a lot of more centrist Democratic leaders nervous. Many New York Democrats, Michel, refused to endorse him. Others held off and have offered only lukewarm support. A huge age divide in all of this. And what we've been hearing on the campaign trail is younger voters are much more skeptical of capitalism. They're much more critical of Israel. So, you know, if Mamdani is the next mayor of America's largest city, he's going to have a big bully pulpit to talk about a much younger, more left-leaning version of the Democratic Party.MARTIN: That is NPR's Brian Mann, along with Gwynne Hogan from The City.

Andrew Cuomo talks about Zohran Mamdani's lack of experience, it's impossible to miss the outrage that drives Cuomo as he fights to end his own time in the political wilderness.   \n   \"He is dangerously unqualified,\" Cuomo said Saturday during an appearance in Queens. \"When you are mayor of the city of New York, that is a big job. You are responsible for eight and a half million lives. Mayor of New York City should not be your first job.\"   This would not be a first job for Mamdani, who turned 34 last month. He was once a rapper who performed under the name Mr. Cardamom, a gig Cuomo regularly mocks. But Mamdani was elected as a state assemblyman serving in New York's legislature since 2020.     \n   Still, the difference between the two leading mayoral candidates' resumes is significant.    Cuomo, age 67, led the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development under President Clinton in the late 1990s. In 2006, he was elected New York state attorney general, and he served as governor for a decade beginning in 2011.    Cuomo was often controversial — clashing with Democrats in Albany and Washington, D.C., almost as often as he feuded with Republicans — but he also built a reputation as a leader who tackled big problems and took on large-scale projects.     \n   \"He has governed as a pragmatist, focused on solving problems rather than engaging in ideological or partisan warfare,\" said former NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg, in his endorsement of Cuomo.     \"And he has shown that he can get big things done, including the redevelopment of LaGuardia Airport, the opening of the 2nd Avenue Subway, and the creation of Moynihan Station — all long-stalled projects that he jump-started and completed,\" Bloomberg said.    \n            I care deeply about the future of our city, and since leaving office, it has been difficult to watch its struggles, especially since the pandemic. In sizing up the field in the race for mayor, there is one candidate whose management experience and government know-how stand above… pic.twitter.com/Whqxc8Daql— Mike Bloomberg (@MikeBloomberg) June 10, 2025\n   \n   Cuomo's long run at the top of the Democratic Party's elite — his father was Democratic icon Mario Cuomo — peaked in 2020 during the COVID pandemic. As governor, his folksy, hopeful online webcasts drew national viewership.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Andrew Cuomo, then governor of New York, spoke during a news conference at Grand Central Terminal in New York, U.S., on Thursday, May 27, 2021.\n                \n                    Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images/Bloomberg\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images/Bloomberg\n    \n\n   \n   Cuomo's downfall and his bid for NYC mayor   But questions began to surface about his administration's management of elderly nursing home residents during the pandemic. Cuomo also faced a growing number of accusations of sexual misconduct involving women, including some who worked under his authority.     Cuomo has denied any wrongdoing, but in August 2021, he announced he would resign as governor: \"Given the circumstances, the best way I can help now is if I step aside and let government get back to governing,\" Cuomo said.   \n   It was a stunning downfall, and in the mayoral race, Mamdani has blasted Cuomo for that portion of his track record. \"What I don't have in experience, I make up for in integrity,\" Mamdani said during a mayoral debate.  \"And what you don't have in integrity, you could never make up for in experience.\"   \n   Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, has positioned himself as the progressive in this race, a symbol of change. He would be the city's first Muslim mayor, and he's promised many left-leaning policies — including a rent freeze and free bus service — aimed at improving affordability in the city.     But Cuomo himself has a long list of progressive accomplishments, including criminal justice reforms and victories for same-sex rights, which once earned him staunch support on the left. In 2011, he pushed a bill through New York's legislature legalizing same-sex marriage. In 2013, Cuomo championed the SAFE Act, which was then one of the strictest gun control laws in the U.S.     Cuomo also launched a statewide initiative to downsize New York's prison system, which now holds roughly half as many inmates. Cuomo later campaigned for \"cashless bail,\" a policy he signed into law in 2019.   \"Experience matters and Assemblyman Mamdani doesn't have the same experience compared with Cuomo,\" said J.C. Polanco, a political analyst and professor at the University of Mount Saint Vincent in the Bronx.      But Polanco said in modern populist politics, on the left and right, a deep resume doesn't hold as much sway with voters. \"Experience doesn't count as much,\" he said. \"A bunch of Democrats are saying it doesn't matter.\"    Cuomo himself has acknowledged that Mamdani's hopeful social media messages — which often go viral on platforms like TikTok and Instagram — appear to have captured the imagination of voters in a way his more old-school campaign has failed to do.     \n   Mamdani defeated Cuomo handily in the Democratic Party primary. Polls show Mamdani has led the general election by double-digit margins for weeks.     Now running as an independent, and with time running out, Cuomo has also struggled to talk about his accomplishments, in part because he has tacked aggressively to the right. On the campaign trail in the final days, Cuomo described himself not as a progressive, but as a pro-business, pro-law-and-order centrist Democrat.   \"He is a socialist,\" Cuomo said of Mamdani, during a stop at a shopping mall in Queens. \"Democrats don't believe in socialism, they're not anti-business, they're not anti-wealth, they're not anti-jobs. And they're not anti-public safety and they're not anti-NYPD. They want safe communities.\"\n",

The program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and is a major piece of the nation's social safety net — and it costs about $8 billion per month nationally.   The situation leaves millions with uncertainty about how they will feed themselves. Benefits will be delayed in November regardless of the outcome of the court cases because many beneficiaries have their cards recharged early in the month and the process of loading cards can take a week or more in many states.   \n   Democratic state attorneys general or governors from 25 states, as well as the District of Columbia, challenged the plan to pause the program, contending that the administration has a legal obligation to keep it running in their jurisdictions. Cities and nonprofits also filed a lawsuit.   On Friday, judges in Rhode Island and Massachusetts ruled separately that the administration must continue to pay for SNAP. They both gave the administration leeway on whether to fund the program partially or in full for November.   The USDA has a $5 billion contingency fund for the program, but the Trump administration reversed an earlier agency plan to use that money to keep SNAP running. Democratic officials argue that the administration could also use a separate fund of about $23 billion.   U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell in Providence, Rhode Island, said SNAP must be funded using at least contingency funds, and he asked for an update on progress by Monday.   \n   He said all previous work requirement waivers must continue to be honored. During the shutdown, the USDA has terminated existing waivers that exempted work requirements for older adults, veterans and others.   In Boston, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani ruled the suspension was unlawful and said USDA has to pay for SNAP. Talwani ordered the federal government to advise by Monday whether they will use emergency reserve funds to provide reduced SNAP benefits for November or fully fund the program using both contingency funds and additional available funds.   \n   Advocates and beneficiaries say halting the food aid would force people to choose between buying groceries and paying other bills. The majority of states have announced more or expedited funding for food banks or novel ways to load at least some benefits onto the SNAP debit cards.   To qualify for SNAP in 2025, a family of four's net income after certain expenses can't exceed the federal poverty line, which is about $32,000 per year. Last year, SNAP assisted nearly 42 million people, about two-thirds of whom were families with children.\n",

Today's top stories   President Trump has shown little interest in negotiating with Democrats to end the government shutdown. He spent the weekend in Florida, one of five trips he's taken since the shutdown began. On Air Force One last night, he told reporters it is up to the Democrats to end it. Check the latest news on the shutdown from our coverage here.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump salutes a Marine as he arrives at the White House on Nov. 2 in Washington, D.C.

Unlike past presidents who stayed in Washington to negotiate a deal, Trump hasn't changed his schedule. The GOP-led House of Representatives passed a short-term funding bill in September. The GOP's goal is to apply pressure on Senate Democrats to vote for the House bill.   Two federal judges on Friday ordered the Trump administration to use emergency money to keep the national food aid program SNAP going. The program ran out of money on Saturday, and it is unclear how quickly the administration could restart the program. The administration has argued that using contingency funds for regular SNAP benefits is illegal because they are intended for situations such as natural disasters.    \n   🎧 NPR's Joe Hernandez reports the lapse – affecting 42 million people – is unprecedented for the program. Democratic state officials behind one of the lawsuits argue that stopping benefits will lead to worse food insecurity.📷 Food banks and pantries in the U.S. are scrambling to feed families amid the government shutdown. Here's how they are stepping up to help.   Tomorrow is Election Day, with voters in Virginia and New Jersey choosing new governors. Several cities across the country will also choose new leaders, including New York City, America's largest city. In the final stretch of the race, the face off between Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani and former governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an Independent, could heavily influence the Democratic Party. Early voting has surged compared to previous elections.    🎧 The excitement that Mamdani has garnered in this race has been exciting for a lot of Democrats, not just in the city he is campaigning in, but across the country, says NPR's Brian Mann. However, Mamdani embracing the \"socialist\" label has made many Democratic leaders nervous. Some top Democrats have withheld endorsements, and his support skews heavily toward younger voters.

Rising prices for cars, parts and repairs needed, and medical bills have increased, driving up the price of insurance. Here's how people are handling the rising car insurance costs:    \n   🚗 Over 58% of drivers say car insurance is a financial burden, and more than a third have driven without it, a LendingTree survey found.🚗 Experts urge shoppers to check insurance costs before buying a car to avoid surprises.🚗 Adding a teen driver can be pricey — and waiting until the family budget allows can save money.

But she voted yes on Proposition 50, a California ballot measure that would allow the state's Democratic leaders to temporarily bypass California's independent redistricting commission and enact a more Democratic-friendly congressional map ahead of next year's midterm elections.   Van Gessel and others who back Prop 50 told NPR the proposal provides the Democratic-leaning state a rare opportunity to directly counteract President Trump and Republican efforts to redraw political maps in their favor in other states.   \"What we're doing is gerrymandering to stop gerrymandering,\" she said. \"And that's not really the best solution, but it is something that we find ourselves in this kind of environment having to do.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Adelaide Stone Van Gessel stands with her dog, Guinness, outside the Oakwood Community Center and voting site in the Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles.\n                \n                    Gabriella Angotti-Jones for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Gabriella Angotti-Jones for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Voting for the one-issue special election concludes Tuesday, with polling showing that Prop 50 is likely to pass. If it does, California's Democratic state leaders can use a new congressional map that makes five U.S. House seats more favorable to the party, offsetting the five districts Republicans shifted their direction in Texas earlier this year.   \n   GOP lawmakers in Missouri and North Carolina have also enacted new maps, and a bipartisan deal reached last week in Ohio tilts that state's congressional map further to the right. Lawmakers in other states, including Virginia Democrats, could join the redistricting fight.   In Southern California, many left-leaning voters approving Prop 50 reported having mixed feelings about the measure, but ultimately felt that allowing a partisan gerrymander is one of the only options they have to stop Trump from shutting out a Democratic win in Congress next year.   \"We can't play the game like decent people anymore,\" said Stephanie Eberstein, who, like Van Gessel, lives in the liberal LA neighborhood of Venice. \"I mean, those rules are out the window. So, we have to do what we have to do.\"   In Orange County, Eva Hernandez agrees.   \n   \"We got to do something,\" Hernandez said. \"Can't just sit back and let things roll like they've been rolling. … California's got to do it. We're a blue state. We got to do what we got to do to counteract that.\"   Republican voters in California fear losing representation   With surveys showing Prop 50 likely to be approved, it appears none of the opposition's arguments against the measure is truly landing in a state that is strongly Democratic.   A number of voters told NPR they're focused on the current proposal, and could not recall how they voted about 15 years ago, when the state's citizen-led, nonpartisan redistricting commission was enacted.   \n   Kathy Brewer voted no on Prop 50. She lives in Rancho Santa Margarita, one of a few GOP-leaning enclaves in Southern California. She told NPR she thinks this special election and redraw are unnecessary.   \"It's a waste of money,\" she said. \"Of good California money that we need.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Betty Roth stands outside of the Rancho Santa Margarita Library in Orange County.\n                \n                    Gabriella Angotti-Jones for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Gabriella Angotti-Jones for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Betty Roth is another no vote. She says that as a Republican she already feels pretty powerless in the state.   Out of the 52 seats California has in the U.S. House, only nine are currently held by Republicans. Roth says she doesn't want the GOP to lose what little representation it has.   \"They're trying to take away the vote from a good portion of the American people by, you know, gerrymandering,\" she said.   But a lot of Democratic voters don't feel much sympathy for this argument.   Aaron Leal, who also lives in Rancho Santa Margarita, says Republicans are trying to rig the midterms in their favor because they aren't sure they can win on policy. He says the party is practically forcing Democrats to react.   \"If one side is going full force pushing their agenda, we cannot bring, as they say, like a knife to a gunfight,\" he said.   Leal says he also likes that the measure is temporary. After 2030, the state would go back to the independent redistricting commission.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Aaron (left), Maria, Evelyn, Isaac and David Leal stand outside the Rancho Santa Margarita Library. Aaron likes that the ballot measure is temporary and after 2030 the state would revert to the independent redistricting committee.\n                \n                    Gabriella Angotti-Jones for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Gabriella Angotti-Jones for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"Somebody has to do something\"   Polling shows the Democratic base has been largely frustrated with their leaders — mostly because they haven't been able to do much.   \"The Democrats haven't really fought back and done anything to combat what's going on with the Republican Party and Trump,\" said David Checel in Culver City. \"So, yeah. I don't know what you're supposed to do on this, and I'm glad I'm not a politician.\"   Checel wasn't thrilled about Prop 50 but voted in favor of it because it's better than doing nothing, he said.   \n   Other Democrats say they are really excited to see their leaders fight back, including Reina Santiago in Venice.   \"I'm glad that our state is taking the charge against this because somebody has to do something,\" she said. \"The GOP is totally complicit with Trump, and if we let them walk all over us, they'll do it. So that's what this vote is about.\"   And while Jim Lind, who lives in Irvine, agrees with this sentiment, he said he's also pretty sad that this is what politics has become.   \"It's unfortunate that any party, whatever it may be, has to stoop to a lower level to get things done,\" he said. \"You know, all my life I've probably been more idealistic as far as the honesty of people. And it's just not working out.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Reina Santiago stands outside of the Oakwood Community Center in Venice.\n                \n                    Gabriella Angotti-Jones for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Gabriella Angotti-Jones for NPR\n    \n\n   \n",

Adams has metastatic prostate cancer and he appealed to President Trump to help save his life by solving a bureaucratic problem with his health insurance. It worked: His appointment is Tuesday.\n                \n                    Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Like many, many Americans, Scott Adams had health insurance problems.   But Adams — made famous first by his long-running Dilbert cartoon, and later for a racist rant on YouTube — counts some powerful people in his social media circle: President Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr. and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.   So Adams posted his complaint on X, saying Kaiser of Northern California, his health insurer and care provider, had \"dropped the ball\" in scheduling a procedure needed to treat his metastatic prostate cancer. Adams wrote he was going to ask Trump to help save his life, and he added: \"I am declining fast. I will ask President Trump if he can get Kaiser of Northern California to respond and schedule it for Monday.\"   \n   Donald Trump Jr. responded to the post on X first, saying: \"Going to make sure that my dad sees this.\"   Just after 11 am on Sunday morning, Kennedy responded, saying, \"Scott. How do I reach you? The President wants to help.\"   Later that day, President Trump posted a screen shot of Adams' original post and responded  \"On it!\" on his favored social media platform, Truth Social.   And on Monday, Adams posted that he had an appointment to receive the infusion he needed of the cancer drug, Pluvicto, on Tuesday.   \"For context, I waited months for the drug, like everyone else,\" Adams wrote. \"But I think my files got misplaced or something and that glitch just got corrected. Not sure.\"   \n   The U.S. health care system is notoriously complex, confusing and expensive, and many Americans have had similarly frustrating experiences as Adams did. Few, though, have the social media reach to enlist such powerful helping hands.   \"Our health system shouldn't be one where we need the intervention of the president or the HHS secretary to weigh in on behalf of a high-profile political backer,\" said Anthony Wright, the executive director of Families USA, a health care advocacy organization.   Wright added that he is gratified Adams got the help he needed and said it should be available to all. \"Glad the President is offering to do casework,\" Wright said, noting that federal workers who do similar problem solving have been fired and navigators who help people sign up for Affordable Care Act health insurance have been cut by 90%. Wright also called out the\" \"current shutdown over the issue of tax credits that help millions access and afford health care.\"   \n   NPR reached out to Kaiser for comment and they e-mailed this statement: \"Mr. Adams' oncology team is working closely with him on the next steps in his cancer care, which are already underway. Since it was approved by the FDA three years ago, Kaiser Permanente's nuclear medicine and medical oncology experts have treated more than 150 patients with Lu-177 PSMA (Pluvicto) in Northern California alone. We know this drug and this disease.\"   Adams' experience drummed up a chorus of well-wishes online, as well as those who called out the preferential treatment he apparently got.   \n   \"There are Americans all over America who are currently going through similar circumstances,\" wrote one X poster, responding to Kennedy's offer to help Adams.   Another responded: \"How about promoting UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE, like the rest of the Industrialized 1st World Nations, so EVERYONE can be treated, not just Celebrity & the Wealthy?\"   In the shutdown health care fight that started Oct. 1, about 24 million Americans who buy their insurance on the ACA marketplaces will see their premiums skyrocket — the average plan will double in price — if Congress doesn't act. Democrats say they will not reopen the government unless the tax subsidies that bring down the cost are renewed. Republicans say they will not discuss renewing the subsidies until the government is reopened.\n",

The courts are weighing in on their legality. But — if successful — they could also fulfill a long-running administration goal of employing America's military to aid in the mass deportation of immigrants without legal status, according to an NPR review of past comments from Trump and his allies. It's a move that would stray significantly from past federal use of the Guard, challenging laws that dictate how the U.S. military can be used domestically. And with the 2026 midterms looming, some experts worry Guard troops could even be used as a tool of systemic voter suppression and intimidation.   \n   Trump has sent troops into four Democratic-led cities and threatened to send them to several more, claiming they are needed to crack down on crime and protect federal immigration facilities and officers. Those deployments, and the White House's rhetoric around them, have regularly conflated violent crime and illegal immigration into a single crisis, blurring the lines around the role of the Guard and federal agents.   \n   Taken one at a time, the deployments can seem random or fickle — Trump will often muse about sending troops into a city, only to back track his comments and focus on a different city days later.   But the president and several others in his inner circle — most notably Stephen Miller, a senior aide to Trump in his first term, and now Trump's right hand man on immigration — have long talked about using the National Guard to help with mass deportations and immigration raids, despite U.S. laws broadly preventing the military from being used for domestic policing. To get around those laws, both Trump and Miller have talked about invoking the Insurrection Act, which allows the president to deploy the military within the U.S. in certain situations.   Legal experts, activists and watchdog groups worry the Trump administration could fundamentally change the way the military is used on U.S. soil, specifically raising concerns about the upcoming 2026 midterm elections and what armed troops on the streets could mean as voters cast ballots.   \n   Laying the groundwork   Much of Trump's campaign ahead of the 2024 election was focused on drumming up anti-immigrant sentiment and pushing his plan for mass deportations. He vowed several times on the campaign trail that he would launch the largest deportation operation in American history.   In his first term, Trump and his administration had similar ambitions, but struggled to scale up infrastructure and manpower needed to carry out the goal.   In a TIME Magazine interview in April of 2024, then-candidate Trump was asked specifically if his plan included the use of the U.S. military.   \"I can see myself using the National Guard and, if necessary, I'd have to go a step further. We have to do whatever we have to do to stop the problem we have,\" Trump responded.   Using the National Guard for immigration enforcement is an idea that Miller had talked about publicly in the years before.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                White House Deputy Chief of Staff for policy and U.S. Homeland Security Adviser Stephen Miller speaks after President Trump signed an order sending National Guard to Memphis, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on September 15, 2025.\n                \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   In 2023, Miller appeared on the late right-wing activist Charlie Kirk's podcast to talk about how mass deportations under Trump's hopeful second term could work.   \n   \"In terms of personnel, you go to the red state governors, and you say, give us your National Guard. We will deputize them as immigration enforcement officers,\" Miller explained. \"The Alabama National Guard is going to arrest illegal aliens in Alabama, and the Virginia National Guard in Virginia.\"   Miller doesn't specify how that would be legal — under U.S. law, the military can't be used for domestic policing unless authorized by the Constitution or Congress. For Democratic-run states that don't comply, Miller said, the federal government would simply send the National Guard from a nearby Republican-run state.   The deployments   In recent months, the Trump administration has deployed Guard troops to states against the wishes of their Democratic governors — including sending troops from Texas into Illinois. The administration said their purpose was to protect federal immigration facilities and officers. Those deployments are tied up in court challenges.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Members of the Texas National Guard stand guard at an army reserve training facility on October 07, 2025 in Elwood, Illinois.\n                \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Scott Olson/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   Miles Taylor, former chief of staff in the Department of Homeland Security during Trump's first term, worked closely with Miller. He's since become a vocal critic of the president and his policies.   \n   Taylor says he's not surprised to see Miller's plan coming to fruition.   \"Trump was deeply deferential to Stephen and I think you've seen that with a vastly more empowered Stephen Miller in a second term,\" says Taylor, an author and commentator.   Taylor says that during Trump's first term, the president wasn't talking publicly about using the U.S. military for immigration enforcement, but it was something that was discussed behind closed doors.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Miles Taylor, former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security during President Trump's first term, holds up his phone outside of the U.S. courthouse in Alexandria, Va., ahead of the arraignment hearing for former FBI director James Comey on Oct. 8\n                \n                    Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"I can remember in meetings with him in the Oval Office, or on Air Force One, or at the border, him starting to bring up this idea of using the United States military to solve the problem,\" he says.   It wasn't something that Trump just talked about. In 2017, The Associated Press reported on a memo it obtained from DHS, outlining a draft proposal to use the National Guard to round up unauthorized immigrants throughout the U.S. At the time, the White House denied it, saying there was no such plan.   Taylor says there very much was — but it was also more than that.   \"It was the invocation of the Insurrection Act to deputize the military to enforce domestic law to basically become a domestic police force,\" he says, noting that this particular idea was something that troubled him and several other staffers.   \n   \"It rocked us to our core,\" he says.   Trump invoking the Insurrection Act would legally allow for the military to act as police on U.S. soil — to carry out immigration enforcement, but possibly other enforcement too, according to legal experts.   NPR asked the White House about potential plans to deputize the Guard for law enforcement and to use the Insurrection Act, but it did not directly respond to those questions, instead criticizing Taylor and NPR. Spokeswoman Abigail Jackson also referenced Trump's \"highly successful operations to drive down violent crime in American cities.\"   \n   Project 2025   The broader themes of these National Guard deployments are also embedded in Project 2025, a conservative action plan written by the Heritage Foundation after Trump's first term that's more than 900 pages long.   Trump has incorporated many of its policies, and authors into his second administration. So much so that the report's architect, Russell Vought, is the head of the White House's Office of Management and Budget.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, in September.\n                \n                    Dominic Gwinn/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Dominic Gwinn/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty\n    \n\n   \n   Matt Dallek, a professor at The George Washington University who studies the American conservative movement, says that Project 2025 essentially opens the door for Trump's National Guard deployments — particularly to Democratic-led cities — without explicitly calling for them.   \"The subtext of Project 2025 is to take any and all steps at the executive level to go into cities and states to enact the priority — which is to root out illegal immigration,\" Dallek says.   The idea of bullying states and cities into following orders from the president is a key part of the text, says David Graham, a journalist for The Atlantic who also wrote a book on the project. So is the use of the military.   \"There is this idea in Project 2025, and among the authors, that the military is just an underused resource for policing immigration,\" Graham says, noting that often illegal immigration is presented as a national security problem. He says the report's authors believe that the U.S. has \"this huge, huge resource of armed people, and we're not doing anything with it, and we need to use it to secure the border.\"   Beyond mass deportation   In recent weeks, Trump has talked about invoking the Insurrection Act often, especially in regard to deploying the National Guard. Earlier this month, he said that he was \"allowed\" to invoke it if the courts deny his deployments in places like Portland, Ore., or Chicago, where prosecutors and federal judges have questioned the need for troops on the ground.   \n   Trump invoking the Insurrection Act to allow troops to help with immigration enforcement is also something that Stephen Miller has talked about.   He told the New York Times back in 2023: \"President Trump will do whatever it takes.\"   That possibility has both legal experts and immigration advocates worried, especially about the implications it could have for Americans at large.   Kica Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center, an immigration rights advocacy group, says it has her worried about the upcoming 2026 midterm elections and what the presence of troops might mean for voters as they cast ballots.   \n   \"What I have said repeatedly is that the path to authoritarianism in this country is being built on the backs of immigrants. They will begin with immigrants. They will not end with immigrants,\" she says.\n",

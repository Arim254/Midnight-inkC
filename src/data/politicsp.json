The Democratic socialist opted to take the oath of office past midnight on New Year's Eve in the old City Hall subway station in Lower Manhattan, as an act meant to capture the spirit of the city's history of serving working people as he signals his incoming administration's civic priorities.   The subterranean site, which closed 80 years ago, is noted for its architectural grandeur with chandeliers, glass skylights and tiled vaulted tunnels.   \n   Mamdani told Streetsblog NYC, which first reported the news, that when the station first opened in 1904, \"it was a physical monument to a city that dared to be both beautiful and build great things that would transform working peoples' lives.\"   \"That ambition need not be a memory confined only to our past, nor must it be isolated only to the tunnels beneath City Hall: It will be the purpose of the administration fortunate enough to serve New Yorkers from the building above,\" Mamdani said in the statement to Streetsblog.   The small, underground ceremony's invitees included Mamdani's family and political ally New York Attorney General Letitia James, tapped to deliver the oath of office. A public inauguration in the afternoon has been planned to take place near City Hall, followed by a block party.   James said on social media that she was honored to swear in Mamdani at the historic subway station: \"Our subways connect us all, and they represent exactly what our next mayor is fighting for: a city every New Yorker can thrive in,\" she wrote.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Old City Hall Station, an abandoned subway terminal in Manhattan, features vaulted ceilings, brass chandeliers and skylights.\n                \n                    Felix Lipov/Alamy\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Felix Lipov/Alamy\n    \n\n   \n   A relic of civic innovation   Trains first departed the City Hall station on Oct. 27, 1904, as the first stop on the city's first subway line. It took passengers as far as the Bronx, the borough where Mamdani attended high school.   \n   When train cars got longer to make room for the city's growing ridership, they became incompatible with the platform's curved design, according to The New York Times. The city shut down the station in 1945 with service stopping for good that New Year's Eve.   What's now regarded as a relic of transit innovation was once hailed as \"an underground cathedral\" and \"the Mona Lisa of subway stations.\"   The station, designed by George Heins and Christopher LaFarge with Guastavino vaulted ceilings, features large brass light fixtures, glass skylights that look out to the park above, and green- and cream-colored tilework.   The public can still see the historic tunnels from a train car on Manhattan's 6 line, which has a turnaround point looping through the terminal, or on a guided tour with the New York Transit Museum.\n",

The document shows how Smith during the course of a daylong deposition repeatedly defended the basis for pursuing indictments against Trump and vigorously rejected Republican suggestions that his investigations were politically motivated.   \n   \"The evidence here made clear that President Trump was by a large measure the most culpable and most responsible person in this conspiracy. These crimes were committed for his benefit. The attack that happened at the Capitol, part of this case, does not happen without him. The other co-conspirators were doing this for his benefit,\" Smith said, bristling at a question about whether his investigations were meant to prevent Trump from reclaiming the presidency in 2024.   \"So in terms of why we would pursue a case against him, I entirely disagree with any characterization that our work was in any way meant to hamper him in the presidential election,\" he added.   The Dec. 17 deposition was conducted privately despite Smith's request to testify publicly. The release of the transcript and video of the interview, so far Smith's only appearance on Capitol Hill since leaving his special counsel position last January, adds to the public understanding of the decision-making behind two of the most consequential Justice Department investigations in recent history.   Trump was indicted on charges of conspiring to undo the 2020 election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden, and of willfully retaining classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Both cases were abandoned after Trump's 2024 election win, with Smith citing Justice Department policy against the indictment of a sitting president.   \n   Smith repeatedly made clear his belief that the evidence gathered against Trump was strong enough to sustain a conviction. Part of the strength of the Jan. 6 case, Smith said, was the extent to which it relied on the testimony of Trump allies and supporters who cooperated with the investigation.   \"We had an elector in Pennsylvania who is a former congressman, who was going to be an elector for President Trump, who said that what they were trying to do was an attempt to overthrow the government and illegal,\" Smith said. \"Our case was built on, frankly, Republicans who put their allegiance to the country before the party.\"   Accounts from Republicans willing to stand up against the falsehood that the election had been stolen \"even though it could mean trouble for them\" created what Smith described as the \"most powerful\" evidence against Trump.   When it came to the Capitol riot itself, Smith said, the evidence showed that Trump \"caused it and that he exploited it and that it was foreseeable to him.\"   Asked whether there was evidence that Trump had instructed supporters to riot at the Capitol, Smith said that Trump in the weeks leading to the insurrection got \"people to believe fraud claims that weren't true.\"   \"He made false statements to state legislatures, to his supporters in all sorts of contexts and was aware in the days leading up to Jan. 6th that his supporters were angry when he invited them and then he directed them to the Capitol,\" Smith said.   \"Now, once they were at the Capitol and once the attack on the Capitol happened, he refused to stop it. He instead issued a tweet that without question in my mind endangered the life of his own vice president,\" he added. \"And when the violence was going on, he had to be pushed repeatedly by his staff members to do anything to quell it.\"   \n   Some of the deposition focused on Republican anger at revelations that the Smith team had obtained, and analyzed, phone records of GOP lawmakers who were in contact with Trump on Jan. 6. Smith defended the maneuver as lawful and by-the-book, and suggested that outrage over the tactic should be directed at Trump and not his team of prosecutors.   \n   \"Well, I think who should be accountable for this is Donald Trump. These records are people, in the case of the senators, Donald Trump directed his co-conspirators to call these people to further delay the proceedings. He chose to do that,\" Smith said. If Donald Trump had chosen to call a number of Democratic senators, we would have gotten toll records for Democratic senators.\"   The communications between Trump and Republican supporters in Congress were an important component of the case, Smith said. He cited an interview his office did with Mark Meadows in which Trump's former chief of staff referenced that Rep. Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican and current chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, had been in touch with the White House on the afternoon of the riot.   \"And what I recall was Meadows stating that 'I've never seen Jim Jordan scared of anything,' and the fact that we were in this different situation now where people were scared really made it clear that what was going on at the Capitol could not be mistaken for anything other than what it was,\" Smith said.   Smith was also asked whether his team evaluated former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson's explosive claim that Trump that grabbed at the steering wheel of the presidential SUV when the Secret Service refused to let him go to the Capitol after a rally at the Ellipse on Jan. 6, 2021.   Smith told lawmakers that investigators interviewed the officer who was in the car, \"who said that President Trump was very angry and wanted to go to the Capitol,\" but the officer's version of events \"was not the same as what Cassidy Hutchinson said she heard from somebody secondhand.\"\n",

In a Truth Social post on Wednesday, Trump praised the deployments and claimed they have helped curtail crime.    \"Portland, Los Angeles, and Chicago were GONE if it weren't for the Federal Government stepping in,\" he said.   The deployments in Chicago and Portland were blocked by the courts. Guard members left California after a sharp rebuke from a U.S. District Court judge earlier this month. On Wednesday, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Trump administration must return control of the Guard to California Gov. Gavin Newsom.   \n   That decision came after the Supreme Court last week ruled against the administration's emergency appeal to deploy troops to Chicago. It was the first time the high court waded into the matter. While not precedent-setting, the ruling brought some clarity to Trump's presidential powers.   Trump had argued that the Guard was needed in the Democratically-led cities to quell crime and protect federal immigration officers and facilities. Democratic governors in those states staunchly opposed the deployments and federal judges were also wary of allowing the military to intervene in civilian matters.   \"This principle has been foundational to the safeguarding of our fundamental liberties under the Constitution,\" U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut wrote in her November ruling freezing Trump's deployment of troops to Portland, Ore.   Trump has also deployed National Guard troops to other U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C., where more than 2,000 members of the Guard  have been patrolling since August.   Those deployments have also faced legal challenges — earlier this month a federal appeals court ruled that troops can remain in the capital city while a panel of judges examines whether the deployment is legal.   A handful of Republican-led states have welcomed the Guard. In Tennessee, troops began patrolling in October. And moments after the Supreme Court ruling, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said 350 troops would deploy to New Orleans. National Guard members arrived in the city Tuesday, member station WWNO reported.   \n   In his Truth Social post on Wednesday, Trump promised \"We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again - Only a question of time!\"\n",

The first known direct operation on Venezuelan soil since the U.S. began strikes in September marks a significant escalation in the administration's months-long pressure campaign on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's government. The strike has not been acknowledged by Venezuelan officials.   President Donald Trump first made reference to the operation in an interview Friday with John Catsimatidis on WABC radio in New York, saying the U.S. had knocked out some type of \"big facility where ships come from.\"   \n   In an exchange with reporters Monday as he hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump added that the operation targeted a \" dock area where they load the boats up with drugs.\" But the president declined to comment when asked whether the attack was conducted by the military or the CIA.   The CIA and White House officials also declined to offer further comment on the matter. Col. Allie Weiskopf, a spokesperson for Special Operations Command, which oversees U.S operations in the Caribbean, said in a statement that \"Special Operations did not support this operation to include intel support.\"   The strike escalates what began as a massive buildup of U.S. personnel in the Caribbean Sea starting in August, which has been followed by at least 30 U.S. military strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. More recently, Trump has ordered a quasi-blockade aimed at seizing sanctioned oil tankers coming in and out of Venezuela.   CNN first reported on the CIA's involvement in the operation.   Trump for months had threatened that he could soon order strikes on targets on Venezuelan land. He's also taken the unusual step of publicly acknowledging that he had authorized the CIA to carry out covert action inside Venezuela.   \n   The administration is required to report covert CIA actions to senior congressional officials, including the chair and ranking members of both the Senate and House intelligence committees. But Trump, by entrusting what appears to be the first land strike of the Venezuelan campaign to the intelligence agency, could be calculating that the action would face less scrutiny from lawmakers than a military strike.   \"I authorized for two reasons, really. No. 1, they have emptied their prisons into the United States of America,\" he said in October as he confirmed to reporters his approval for the CIA to act. \"And the other thing, the drugs, we have a lot of drugs coming in from Venezuela, and a lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in through the sea.\"   All the while, Trump has repeatedly said Maduro's days in power are numbered. The Venezuelan leader and members of his inner circle have been under federal indictment in the United States since 2020 for narcoterrorism and other charges.   Maduro has denied the charges. The U.S. Justice Department this year doubled to $50 million the reward for information that leads to his arrest.   The Venezuelan president made no mention of the CIA operation during an hourlong speech Tuesday at an international leadership school for women.   —   AP writer Regina Garcia Cano in Caracas, Venezuela, contributed reporting.\n",

She matched his take-no-prisoners style, from social media postings trashing those she disagreed with to loudly heckling people on the street and at public events.But something has changed. She broke with Trump over his reluctance to release the Epstein files, among other issues. She's begun appearing on legacy media outlets she previously shunned. And just last month, she decided to resign from Congress. Through it all, she began talking with longtime journalist Robert Draper, who wrote a piece about her for The New York Times Magazine. Draper told me the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk was a turning point for Greene.ROBERT DRAPER: Kirk was shot on September the 10 of this year, and about a week later, there was this huge memorial service where all these luminaries were speaking. Greene was at home watching it, like a lot of people were, and was deeply moved by Erika Kirk's speech where she openly forgave her husband's killer.But as moved as Greene found herself being by that, she was so filled with consternation by the follow-up speaker, President Trump, who, as a kind of counterpoint to Erika Kirk, said, I don't forgive my enemies. I hate my enemies and I wish nothing but the worst for them. And so Greene began to realize, you know, I'm a Christian, and I want to be much more like Erika Kirk. That, to me, seems like a true modeling of Christian behavior, while this guy, who I've been this leading proponent of, is now saying stuff that's antithetical to Christianity. And I think that's really when the worm began to turn for her.MARTIN: One thing in your piece that struck me is that you described something that I have seen in other fervent Trump supporters, which is that you asked her about something the president said and has said repeatedly, which is that he was going to exact retribution against his opponents, and when you asked her about that, she seemed actually offended by it. Like, he's not going to do that. He's going to work for the American people. How do you understand that?DRAPER: Well, I think, for one thing, President Trump is - he's a very astute reader of people and he's very good at presenting a face to people that they'd like to see. He's very good at flattering people. With the evangelical community, you would never hear him say anything profane or sexist. To veterans, he's very respectful. To Marjorie Taylor Greene, he's going to sound like he's always for the working class. And she really believed that he was a fellow true believer in how America First meant taking care of the folks at home.And another factor, Michel, that we have not discussed is the matter of the left and how for any moment in which a person on the right might have reservations about Trump, all they need to do to remind themselves of why they are with Trump is to look at the other side. And this is what Marjorie Taylor Greene did constantly. She would look at the left and she would say, but these are the people who are really incorrigibly evil.MARTIN: So how did it change?DRAPER: Well, it began to change when she began to recognize that she was in an echo chamber. She began, months before she broke from Trump, to stop watching Fox News and start reading and watching mainstream news outlets. She found some of it objectionable, but not all of it. And so her pores, as it were, began to open, and she began to absorb things in a way that she had not before.Look; to this day, she still has very far-right views when it comes to, say, transgender ideology, when it comes to immigration. I don't think anyone should expect any of that to cease. But she began to wonder, if really what the most important issues are are about taking care of folks at home first, is my party and is my president really doing something about that? She began to have doubts.MARTIN: And when she voiced those doubts, the president turned on her.DRAPER: Yes.MARTIN: Started calling her Marjorie Traitor Greene. She started getting death threats. Her son was threatened. I mean, on her personal email, as has been reported, she recounted these concerns to the White House. They basically dismissed her. Is that a cautionary tale? How does she understand that?DRAPER: Well, one thing that Greene said to me, and, you know, I think in a moment of self-awareness, was that, look, believe me, I understand. I am not the first person this has happened to. I don't want to make myself as being special. This is Trump. This is what he does. He attacks people...MARTIN: And what she used to do.DRAPER: Yes, yes. No, that's exactly right. And, of course, Dana Bash on CNN was the first to kind of call her out for that. And that's when Greene said, you know, humbly, I want to apologize for the role that I've played in our toxic politics.And I pushed her on that when I spoke to her and said, what exactly were you referring to? And she wasn't, like, ready to do this fulsome apology. So I started bringing up matters of her harassing Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Nancy Pelosi, David Hogg, the then-18-year-old gun activist. And she said, yes, you know, I'd come to Congress with a lot of anger, also emotionally raw because of things going on in my personal life, and I let my anger get the better of me. And those were the things that I was referring to when I was referring to toxic politics that I now wish to apologize for.MARTIN: Robert Draper is a political reporter for The New York Times. We're talking about his big piece on Marjorie Taylor Greene, which appeared in The New York Times Magazine this week. Thanks so much for coming by.DRAPER: It was really a pleasure, Michel.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

U.S. Southern Command, which oversees South America, did not reveal where the attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday occurred. Previous attacks have been in the Caribbean Sea and in the eastern Pacific Ocean.   \n   A video of Tuesday's attack posted by Southern Command on social media shows three boats traveling in a close formation, which is unusual, and the military said they were in a convoy along known narco-trafficking routes and \"had transferred narcotics between the three vessels prior to the strikes.\" The military did not provide evidence to back up the claim.   The military said three people were killed when the first boat was struck, while people in the other two boats jumped overboard and distanced themselves from the vessels before they were attacked. Southern Command said it immediately notified the U.S. Coast Guard to activate search and rescue efforts.   \n   Southern Command's statement did not say whether those who jumped off the boats were rescued.   Calling in the Coast Guard is notable because the U.S. military drew heavy scrutiny after U.S. forces killed the survivors of an attack in early September with a follow-up strike to their disabled boat. Some Democratic lawmakers and legal experts said the military committed a crime, while the Trump administration and some Republican lawmakers say the follow-up strike was legal.   \n   U.S. forces attacked two more boats on Wednesday, killing five people who were allegedly smuggling drugs along known trafficking routes, Southern Command said in a separate statement. It did not provide evidence of the alleged trafficking or reveal the body of water in which the attacks occurred. Videos posted with the statement on social media showed a boat in the water and explosions.   The latest attacks bring the total number of known boat strikes to 35 and the number of people killed to at least 115 since early September, according to numbers announced by the Trump administration.   \n   President Trump has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States and asserted that the U.S. is engaged in an \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels.   Along with the strikes, the Trump administration has built up military forces in the region as part of an escalating pressure campaign on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who has been charged with narco-terrorism in the United States.   Meanwhile, the CIA was behind a drone strike last week at a docking area believed to have been used by Venezuelan drug cartels, according to two people familiar with details of the operation who requested anonymity to discuss the classified matter.   \n   It was the first known direct operation on Venezuelan soil since the U.S. began strikes in September, a significant escalation in the administration's pressure campaign on Maduro's government.\n",

    "body": "\n      President Trump issues his first vetoes of his second term.   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  Yesterday, more than 11 months after being inaugurated, President Trump vetoed his first bills of this term. Both had passed Congress with broad bipartisan support. These were not divisive bills. So these vetoes pit the president against his fellow Republicans and raise the question of how far they might go to defy the president. NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben is here to walk us through details. Hey there.DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey there.KELLY: What did he veto?KURTZLEBEN: Well, the first is a bill that would have helped communities in southeastern Colorado pay for a conduit that would carry clean water. The bill would have done that by giving them more time to repay money without interest to the federal government. Now, that conduit is important because residents there have dealt with unsafe water. Some of the groundwater is tainted with toxic elements like radium. The other bill deals with Florida. It would have expanded the area reserved for the Miccosukee Tribe and required the secretary of the interior to help safeguard communities there from flooding.KELLY: OK. Let me take these one by one. The Colorado one, first, and this clean water conduit. Why did President Trump veto it?KURTZLEBEN: Well, his stated reason is that the bill would force federal taxpayers to foot the bill for a local water project that, as initially envisioned, would have been paid for by the local communities. He added in a statement that he's committed to ending, quote, \"the massive cost of taxpayer handouts.\" But it's important to get a sense of the scope here. Federal funding has paid for a large chunk of this project, but as our colleagues at Colorado Public Radio have pointed out, this particular bill would cost the federal government less than $500,000, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate, which, in terms of federal spending, is absolutely tiny.KELLY: May I ask about the language you just used? You just told us the president's stated reason for vetoing this. Is there a reason to think there are other motives in play?KURTZLEBEN: Well, Colorado Republican Representative Lauren Boebert has raised this possibility. In a statement, she said, quote, \"I sincerely hope this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation.\" She clashed with the president this year by pushing for the release of the Epstein files, but Trump has not explicitly linked that to his veto.But in addition, Trump, earlier this year, threatened what he called harsh measures if a woman named Tina Peters was not released from a Colorado prison. Peters was a county clerk in Mesa County, Colorado, and she is serving a nine-year sentence for helping someone get access to voting equipment after the 2020 election. So the whole case is tied to conspiracy theories about election fraud. Earlier this month, Trump said he was pardoning Peters, but presidential pardons apply to federal crimes. Peters was convicted at the state level, so she remains in prison. Now, again, Trump has not explicitly linked Peters to this veto, but this morning, he posted on social media that he wants Peters freed, so we know she's on his mind.KELLY: OK. Go to the other one, the Florida veto. What are the reasons, stated or otherwise, for that veto?KURTZLEBEN: Well, Trump was straightforward in saying this veto was in part about politics. He said in a statement that the Miccosukee Tribe, quote, \"has actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies.\" Now, that seems to refer to the tribe earlier this year joining a lawsuit against an immigration detention center the Trump administration created in Florida, the one the president calls Alligator Alcatraz. The tribe considers the land it's built on sacred.KELLY: To circle back to something I said at the outset, that both these bills, Florida and Colorado, they passed with the support of the president's GOP colleagues in Congress, right?KURTZLEBEN: Yes. In fact, they both passed the House and Senate without those person-by-person roll call votes. The bills just had so much support. They were able to pass via voice votes or unanimous consent. So now the question is whether Congress can or wants to override Trump's vetoes.KELLY: That's NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. Thank you, Danielle.KURTZLEBEN: Thank you.KELLY: And Happy New Year.KURTZLEBEN: You too.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      President Trump confirmed a recent U.S. strike on a Venezuelan dock he claims was used by drug smugglers, prompting questions about the size and scope of the U.S. mission.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  President Trump's critics say the American strike on a facility in Venezuela is drawing the U.S. even closer into a more dangerous conflict.A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  Trump gave a few new details this week of the attack against a dock in Venezuela, where drugs are allegedly being loaded on boats.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: There was a major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs. They load the boats up with drugs, so we hit all the boats, and now we hit the area. It's a implementation area. That's where they implement.MARTÍNEZ: In a few moments, we'll speak with former CIA and FBI official Phil Mudd about this first known operation inside Venezuela. First, though, let's get the facts on this escalating campaign against the government of Nicolas Maduro.MARTIN: NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez is with us now from Palm Beach, where President Trump is spending the winter holidays. Good morning, Franco.FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: Good morning, Michel.MARTIN: So just give us the big picture here. What is the significance of these latest attacks?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, the president has been warning for weeks that he was prepared to launch land strikes, and he first mentioned this port strike a week ago on a radio show. While he hasn't been clear about how the strikes were conducted, a U.S. official confirmed to NPR's Tom Bowman that the CIA struck the dock. Now, until now, the U.S. has focused on strikes on boats it claims are trafficking drugs and some oil tankers. But both of those operations have been taking place in international waters. So this is a really big deal to strike on land. It's an escalation, but also creates more risks of killing innocent Venezuelans who have nothing to do with any of that stuff.MARTIN: Also, the lack of congressional input, let alone oversight, as this campaign has escalated is something that has drawn attention, especially some members of Congress, as one might imagine. Wouldn't it be considered sort of customary and appropriate to at least brief Congress ahead of a strike like this?ORDOÑEZ: Right. I mean, typically, when presidents have done this in the past, the so-called Gang of Eight would be briefed either before or very soon after. Those are the top senators and House leaders for both parties. You know, it's just another example, though, of how Trump has sought to build his own power while diminishing Congress' power. I was speaking with John Feeley, who formerly served as ambassador of Panama, and he says Congress seems to be very slowly inching towards more oversight.JOHN FEELEY: One of the things that really surprises me is how the Congress has sort of had two attempts to get a War Powers Resolution. They've narrowly failed, but they keep coming back to it. And it's almost sort of like a chicken and an egg.ORDOÑEZ: Now he sees growing frustration among members of Congress, and he points to the congressional hearings about the recent double-tap boat strikes in international waters off the coast of Venezuela that killed survivors of one initial strike.MARTIN: You know, one of the things that stands out for me is that if the president did not mention the strike last week, we might not have heard of this. And the reason I point that out is that it's so much different than these public displays of the boat strikes where the administration issued, you know, video - not as much as some members of Congress and, certainly, members of the public want, but they did make a point of issuing video about it. So what do you make of that?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah, I mean, the MO really has been to seek as much credit on the strikes. Ambassador Feeley also told me that Trump is trying to send a message to Maduro that the U.S. can get to him anywhere and anytime.FEELEY: They want to get as much public credit for them. They want to build momentum to provoke regime collapse. They want Nicolas Maduro to sleep poorly at night.MARTIN: So what are you watching for next, Franco?ORDOÑEZ: You know, that's hard to say. Trump said he spoke to Maduro fairly recently, but that he didn't seem to think it had much of an impact. You know, surely, I'll be watching for further escalation, perhaps another land strike. But also, Congress is coming back soon, so we'll see if they have any questions or concerns about these latest moves and the latest escalation.MARTIN: That is NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez. Franco, thank you.ORDOÑEZ: Thank you, Michel.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

He went viral in late December for a video purportedly uncovering $110 million in alleged fraud by federally funded day care centers in Minnesota.\n                \n                    Adam Gray/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Adam Gray/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The Trump administration is freezing child care funding to the state of Minnesota in response to a viral video that purports to expose extensive fraud by federally funded day care centers.   Nick Shirley, a 23-year-old self-described \"independent YouTube journalist,\" posted the 42-minute video on X and YouTube the day after Christmas.   In it, he and an older man — identified only as \"David\" — visit various seemingly empty day care centers, bombarding Somali employees with questions and accusing them of not providing services to any children despite receiving public funds. The pair claim to have exposed over $110 million in fraud.   \n   Allegations of social services fraud in Minnesota have been the subject of federal investigations and mainstream media coverage for years.   In one high-profile example, more than 90 individuals have been charged since 2022 in the ongoing case of a Minnesota nonprofit that prosecutors say misappropriated some $250 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds intended to feed children in need, calling it \"the largest Covid-19 fraud scheme in the country.\"   And a federal prosecutor said earlier this month that half or more of the roughly $18 billion in federal funds that supported 14 Minnesota-run programs since 2018 may have been stolen.   However, Shirley's specific allegations have not been verified, with some challenging them in recent days. The manager of one Minnesota day care center has since said Shirley visited outside of its regular hours, while a CNN camera crew interviewing Shirley outside a different center filmed caregivers dropping off their kids in the background (he dismissed them as \"showing face\").   \n   \"How do I know that [the allegations are] true?\" Shirley responded when asked. \"Well, we showed you guys what was happening, and then you guys can go ahead and make your own analysis.\"   The lack of evidence hasn't stopped a number of prominent conservatives — including Elon Musk and key members of the Trump administration — from amplifying and acting on Shirley's claims. As of Wednesday, Shirley's video has over 131 million views on X and 2.5 million on YouTube.   Vice President Vance reposted Shirley's video the day after it went live, writing, \"This dude has done far more useful journalism than any of the winners of the 2024 [Pulitzer] prizes.\" (Those prizes went to journalists who covered a range of topics, from billionaires' influence over the Supreme Court to catastrophic flooding in California and missing Black girls and women in Chicago.)   \n   FBI Director Kash Patel also responded, writing on X that \"even before the public conversation escalated online, the FBI had surged personnel and investigative resources to Minnesota to dismantle large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programs.\"   \n   Shirley, suddenly in the national spotlight, has expressed concerns about his safety and is asking supporters to donate to his security, including by selling $50 sweatshirts on his website. And he's continued to criticize Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz and the mainstream media for their perceived inaction on the issue.   \"Mainstream media is more mad at me then they are at the FACT that billions of YOUR dollars are being used for fraudulent business,\" Shirley tweeted Wednesday. \"I am not an enemy of the people, they are. I'm with you, they are against you.\"   Shirley started out as a vlogger    Shirley has been making shock-value YouTube videos for years, starting with pranks before wading into political exposés.   The Utah native vlogged consistently throughout high school, amassing some 7,000 followers before graduating in 2020, according to a profile that year from local NBC affiliate KSL-TV.   \"Some people might not know who Nick Shirley is yet, but one day, they will,\" it reads.   One of his earliest stunts was flying to New York City at age 16 without telling his parents. They escalated from there: sneaking into influencer Jake Paul's wedding, tricking TikTokkers into auditioning for a fake Justin Bieber music video, riding a bike over a ramp lit on fire. He also filmed himself in the crowd outside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.   \n   Then came a hiatus: Shirley announced in December 2021 that he would be taking a two-year break from YouTube to serve on a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Santiago, Chile.   He returned to the platform in 2023 with a video interviewing undocumented immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona. From that point on, his work took on a decidedly political bent, with man-on-the-street style interviews focused on topics including illegal immigration, the 2024 election, President Trump's deployment of federal troops to blue cities and the ensuing protests against them.   \n   His two most-viewed videos are from this period, filmed from the El Salvadoran mega-prison housing deportees alleged to be gang members and another in Rio de Janeiro, titled \"I Infiltrated Rio Brazil's Most Dangerous Gang.\"   The description of his YouTube Channel — which has 1.29 million subscribers as of Wednesday — reads: \"Here to entertain and bring the truth to all.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Shirley speaks during a roundtable discussion at the White House in October attended by the president, administration officials and conservative influencers.\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   An \"independent journalist\" with an agenda   Shirley's rise to prominence hit a new milestone in October, when he was invited to participate in a White House roundtable about the \"antifa\" movement — the far-left ideology opposed to fascism, which Trump has designated a domestic terrorist organization.   \n   At the event, Shirley introduced himself as a \"100% independent YouTube journalist\" and said that while he's traveled to 15 countries for that work, \"the most dangerous place I've been has been here in the United States\" because of anti-Trump protests.   \"I'm attacked every time I do my job,\" he said, without citing specifics. \"When I leave my house to go to work, I'm violently assaulted. I've been bear sprayed and beaten down. I've been almost killed.\"   \n   According to recent research from the Harvard Kennedy School, the thousands of local protests during Trump's second term have yielded an \"extremely low number of injuries, property damage or arrests.\"   Shirley directly accused the mainstream media — particularly broadcasters — of undercovering and downplaying the violence of those protests. Trump responded by asking him to name the worst offenders, to which Shirley replied: \"I'm not talking about Fox … Newsmax or any outlet that resembles them.\"   Shirley is part of a broader group of right-leaning journalists and political commentators who do not work for any particular outlet. The White House has embraced what it calls \"new media,\" giving them unprecedented levels of access at the same time as it places restrictions on established journalistic outlets.   \n   University of Minnesota media law professor Jane Kirtley told member station MPR News that individuals do not necessarily need a formal affiliation to do fine journalism. But she says many of today's news influencers prioritize fearmongering over fact-checking, something she says she observes in Shirley's reporting.   \"They have a narrative, and they do everything they can to advance that narrative, but they seem to spend little to no time looking for the other side of the story, and that's what good investigative journalism has to do,\" she added.\n",

Many experts credit Biden-era public health policies with saving tens of thousands of lives. But with new laws, executive orders, budget cuts, and military redeployments, Trump pivoted the nation from those strategies to a militarized drug war.     \"From day one of the Trump administration we declared an all-out war on the dealers, smugglers, traffickers and cartels,\" Trump said in July, during a signing ceremony for the Halt Fentanyl Act.      \n   Trump has launched U.S. Naval strikes against alleged drug boats; designated drug cartels as terrorist organizations; classified fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction; and deployed National Guard troops in American cities and along the U.S.-Mexico border.   Meanwhile, his administration threw into question support for even basic federally funded addiction treatment programs, at one point temporarily freezing $140 million in federal grants as front-line care providers scrambled to maintain services.   Scrapping the public health approach    Trump's rapid realignment of U.S. drug policy stems in part from his assertion that Biden's effort to reduce fentanyl deaths was a wholesale failure.  Speaking this month, Trump made the false claim that \"three hundred million people died last year from drugs.\"     Fentanyl deaths did surge in the first two years of the Biden administration, during the COVID pandemic.  But fatal overdoses declined sharply in 2023 and 2024, as the Biden team raced to expand access to opioid-treatment medications, including buprenorphine and naloxone.     The Biden administration also boosted federal spending by tens of billions of dollars on addiction treatment, while embracing a \"harm reduction\" approach, providing Medicaid health insurance, housing and other services to people even if they weren't yet able or willing to stop using street drugs.     \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                In 2023, then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken and President Joe Biden spoke during a meeting about countering the flow of fentanyl into the United States. The session followed meetings with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, where Biden announced that he and Xi reached an understanding about reducing the flow of fentanyl precursor chemicals from China to the U.S.\n                \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   According to provisional data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fatal overdoses in the U.S. plunged nearly 27 percent during Biden's last year in office.    \n   \"We've made gains.  There are more people now being treated for substance use disorders and opioid use disorders,\" said Richard Frank, a drug policy researcher at the Brookings Institution. \"That is largely due to the Medicaid (insurance) expansion.\"   But after returning to the White House, the Trump administration, working with GOP leaders in Congress, moved swiftly to strip roughly $1 trillion from Medicaid funding, including cuts to programs that support addiction care.  In a July executive order, Trump also attacked harm reduction efforts, claiming without evidence that they \"only facilitate illegal drug use.\"   The shift alarms many researchers, physicians, and drug policy analysts, who fear a resurgence of drug deaths.     \"The biggest risk really of increasing overdose deaths is the Medicaid cutbacks,\" said Regina LaBelle, who briefly served as acting director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy under Biden and now teaches drug policy at Georgetown University.  \"It's not just about defunding harm reduction. They're also defunding prevention, treatment and recovery programs.\"   Fentanyl, a \"weapon of mass destruction\"   There's also growing evidence that Biden-era law enforcement and diplomatic efforts managed to disrupt the flow of fentanyl into the U.S., in part by convincing China to help reduce the sale of industrial \"precursor\" chemicals used to make street fentanyl.    \"The important (Biden team) success was the cooperation with China that built up during 2024,\" said Vanda Felbab-Brown, who studies drug cartels and street drug trafficking at the Brookings Institution.  \"This included law enforcement cooperation and intelligence exchange and cooperation on anti-money laundering efforts.\"   Over the last 12 months, however, Trump and his team discounted the Biden team's efforts.  Speaking in July, Trump suggested the deadly fentanyl crisis was \"allowed to happen by people either that didn't care or were stupid people.\" He has also suggested that carnage from overdoses was so great it justified a militarized response.   \n   \"Two to three hundred thousand people die every year, that we know of, so we're formally classifying fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction,\" Trump said in December, citing a statistic contradicted by federal data.   Research by the CDC, the U.S Drug Enforcement Administration, and other top U.S. drug researchers shows that drug deaths peaked in 2023 at roughly 115,000 deaths in a single 12-month period.  The latest provisional CDC data shows roughly 76,500 fatal overdoses in the 12-month period ending in April 2025.    Indeed, many of Trump's new drug policy initiatives are based on claims that drug policy researchers describe as wildly inflated or wholly inaccurate.  One of his first major fentanyl-related actions was an executive order signed in February imposing steep tariffs on Canadian products, because of what Trump described as Canada's \"central role\" in fentanyl smuggling.    \n   But data from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration shows Canada plays almost no role in the U.S. fentanyl crisis.  In 2024, roughly 43 pounds of fentanyl was seized at America's northern border. That compares with roughly 21,100 pounds seized at the southern border.   Top administration officials have also made exaggerated claims about progress made to reduce drug deaths during Trump's first year back in office.     During a cabinet meeting, Attorney General Pam Bondi said aggressive anti-drug policies had already saved 258 million American lives. In a separate post on social media, Bondi estimated the lives saved at a much lower figure, claiming roughly 119 million lives saved. Researchers who study the potential harm of fentanyl and other street drugs told NPR both claims are greatly inflated.   \n            Today is Fentanyl Awareness day. In President Trump’s first 100 days we’ve seized over 22 million fentanyl laced pills, saving over 119 Million lives. We are fighting relentlessly for the families of loved ones lost, for those whose lives are at risk, and for the soul of our… pic.twitter.com/nQLnN0nipn— Attorney General Pamela Bondi (@AGPamBondi) April 29, 2025\n   \n   Will blowing up boats stop fentanyl deaths in the U.S.?    Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, meanwhile, has said Trump's military strikes near Venezuela are already having a deterrent effect on drug cartels.    \"There aren't many people getting in boats right now running drugs, which is the whole point.  We want to stop the poisoning of the American people,\" Hegseth said, during an appearance hosted by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation.   The Trump administration has declined to offer evidence that boats targeted by the Navy are operated by cartel-linked smugglers.  Researchers who study drug traffickers, including Felbab-Brown at Brookings, say even if some boats are carrying street drugs, they almost certainly aren't carrying fentanyl, the drug that accounts for most U.S. overdose deaths.      \n   The latest U.S. National Drug Threat Assessment, published by the DEA in July 2025, says drug gangs in Mexico, not Venezuela, \"remain the dominant threats\" trafficking fentanyl into American communities.   Drug gangs, motivated by the lure of huge profits, have also developed flexible underground supply routes, which may be largely unaffected by military strikes that kill low-level gang members.     Critics of the Trump administration's approach told NPR the deterrent effect of a militarized U.S. drug war will also be hampered by Trump's decision over the last year to pardon or free a growing number of drug \"kingpin\" figures.    Since returning to office, Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht, who was serving a life sentence after creating Silk Road, an internet site used to traffic fentanyl and other street drugs; pardoned Larry Hoover, former leader of the Chicago-based Gangster Disciples; and pardoned the former president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernandez, convicted on drug and weapons charges after governing his country as \"a narco-state,\" according to a statement from the U.S. Justice Department.   \n   \"There's a lot of mixed messages and mixed signals [from the White House] which creates sort of chaos and uncertainty,\" said Jeffrey Singer, a drug policy analyst at the Cato Institute, in an interview with NPR in May. \"On the one hand you're threatening even tougher penalties on people who deal in drugs, while on the other hand you're releasing drug dealers from prisons.\"\n",

How are higher prices changing the way you live? Fill out this form to share your story with NPR.      What's the item?   Furniture   How has the price changed since before the pandemic?   The price of bedroom furniture rose 11% since February 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The price of living room, kitchen and dining room furniture rose 25%.   \n   Loading...\n   Why has the price gone up?    Like all industries, furniture makers and sellers are dealing with higher expenses: utilities, insurance, wages. Big cost spikes came during the pandemic, when shoppers raced to buy desks for home offices and patio sets, and shipping costs soared.   But if you ask furniture industry insiders, the first thing they'll reply is that the price of furniture has actually grown slower than overall inflation, which has risen nearly 26% since February 2020.    Then, the experts will note that prices are down from their peak in 2022. And then — like David Koehler did — they'll deliver the popular adage:   \"You could buy a $399 sofa in 1984, and you could still buy a $399 sofa today,\" says Koehler, who runs the Delaware chain Johnny Janosik Furniture.   Of course, not everyone wants a $399 sofa, but the fact that it still exists makes furniture different from other big-ticket items, like cars or appliances.   Overseas competition has kept prices lower    Setting aside high-end woodwork and heirloom craftsmanship, sellers of mass market furniture feel intense pressure to keep prices down.   \"The barriers to entry are very, very low, and the furniture business is incredibly fragmented,\" says Bill McLoughlin, editor in chief of Furniture Today, a trade publication.   \n   Besides, furniture sellers compete not just with second-hand goods, but with any expensive plans you may have, say, for a trip or home repairs.   \n   And the race for cheapest prices has moved a lot of the industry abroad.   \"Manufacturing follows low-cost labor. That has been true for 60 years,\" says McLoughlin. \"Because labor is such a large component of the cost of a product.\"   American wages tend to be a lot higher than those overseas, on top of the bigger costs of U.S. environmental standards. So even at domestic furniture-making hubs in Mississippi or North Carolina, many components — fabrics, handles and electronics, like the power button for your recliner — still ship from abroad, mainly China.   Enter: tariffs    During his first term, President Trump's tariffs made it pricier to ship furniture from China, so a lot of manufacturing moved out — though not to America, but to Vietnam.   This year, Trump raised tariffs on imports from almost all countries. And he's set new double-digit tariffs specifically for kitchen cabinets, vanities and upholstered furniture.   The furniture giant Ashley Furniture in June raised the price of the majority of its products as a result of tariffs. The Home Furnishings Association, an industry trade group, has warned of cumulative cost increases for both retailers and shoppers.   What are people doing about it?   As importing furniture becomes pricier, American-made furniture may start looking more attractive in comparison. But seller Koehler worries about how shoppers will react.   \"The consumer, when we get feedback, they say, 'We would love to buy American,'\" he says. \"But when they vote with their dollars and see, this item is $500 and that item is $1,200, they say, 'I think I can only afford the $500.' So they end up buying an imported item anyway, just because there is such a difference in price.\"   \n   Many shoppers find themselves in the same spot as Erin Cummins in Connecticut: watching their spending rise on other, more critical costs, such as health insurance, or car insurance, or groceries.   \"Every time we're having company over, I look at that furniture and I'm going, 'I really need to replace that,'\" says Cummins, whose threadbare couches have been well-loved by three dogs and three children. \"I have priced it out a bit, but every time I do, I get sticker shock and walk away.\"   \n   Cummins says at this point, the cost of new furniture displeases her more than the state of what she already owns, and her couches — still standing, even if covered by a blanket — feel more stable than her budget.\n",

The government had been planning to fund only partial payments this month.   \n\n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  The Trump administration is appealing a court order requiring it to restore full SNAP food benefits by today.LEILA FADEL, HOST:  The government had previously said it would only restore partial benefits in response to an earlier decision. A federal judge in Rhode Island issued the new order yesterday, saying the government failed to consider the harm to individuals who rely on those benefits.MARTÍNEZ: NPR's Tovia Smith is following this. So, Tovia, that Rhode Island judge - that's the same one who last week forced the Trump administration to use emergency funding to keep SNAP going. So what's he saying now?TOVIA SMITH, BYLINE: Well, he's laying into the Trump administration again, accusing it of withholding and delaying SNAP benefits for, quote, \"political reasons.\" U.S. District Judge John McConnell Jr. called it astounding that the Trump administration didn't consider the harm it was causing to the millions of Americans who depend on this food assistance. As he put it in his order, this court is not naive to the administration's true motives. McConnell cited a post the president put up on social media this week declaring that SNAP benefits will only resume when, quote, \"the radical-left Democrats open up government.\" And the judge said that was proof of Trump's intent to defy the original court order to keep SNAP going and a big part of why he ordered the government to fully fund SNAP by today. And it was just about an hour later that the Trump administration appealed the court order. Attorneys offered no arguments just yet, just saying they're appealing.MARTÍNEZ: I know the administration has said that it doesn't have the money to fully fund SNAP during the government shutdown. So did the judge address where the money will come from now?SMITH: Yes. Remember last week, he said the government had to use an emergency fund to keep SNAP going, though that was only enough to pay partial benefits. This time, he said the administration must also cover the rest by tapping into a much bigger source of money from customs revenues, which the government said it was saving just in case it was needed for things like child nutrition programs. But yesterday, the judge wasn't having it. He said it defies belief that the administration would prioritize a hypothetical need over the, quote, \"very real and imminent (ph) risk of children being deprived of their food assistance today.\"MARTÍNEZ: Now, what are you hearing from the administration and from the groups that brought the lawsuit to get the SNAP money reinstated?SMITH: So a spokesperson for the Agriculture Department, which administers SNAP, blamed Democrats for the lapse in benefits, accusing them of using the shutdown as leverage for their political agenda. And on the other side, the cities and nonprofits that brought the case to court were celebrating the judge's order, calling it a major victory until the government appealed. As one leader of an antihunger group put it, the thrill didn't last long. And the fear is now that it could still be a while before this gets resolved.MARTÍNEZ: So what about today's deadline to restore funding? It sounds like not a lot of time to do a lot of stuff.SMITH: Yes. And just to note, the deadline today is for the government to get the money to states, which is just step one. So even if they manage that, it's hard to imagine the money could get all the way to individuals so quickly. Remember, the administration had said reducing benefits is complicated and could take weeks or months. So now it's unclear if any processing that was done now needs to be undone, and the government may seek to stay the judge's order while the appeal plays out. So meantime, millions of people are still left trying to scrape by with whatever they can afford and whatever they can get at food pantries, for example, which are already straining to keep up with demand.MARTÍNEZ: NPR's Tovia Smith.

Today's top stories   Beginning today, the Federal Aviation Administration will reduce air traffic by 10% at many of the busiest airports. This move is intended to help keep the nation's airspace safe as the agency deals with a shortage of air traffic controllers and the government shutdown. Airlines have started canceling flights in order to comply with the FAA's orders.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                People take photos as a plane lands at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on Nov. 6, 2025, in Los Angeles, California. The FAA will be reducing flights by 10% in 40 major airports around the country, including LAX, beginning tomorrow amid air traffic control staffing shortages due to the federal government shutdown.\n                \n                    Mario Tama/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mario Tama/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 The shutdown is taking a toll on air traffic controllers, who are required to work without pay. NPR's Joel Rose tells Up First that there is some speculation that the reduction in air traffic is mostly a PR or political move related to ending the shutdown. The air traffic control system was functioning fairly well during the shutdown until this past weekend, when staffing shortages occurred at dozens of facilities simultaneously. Travelers have expressed concern over what could happen if their flights are canceled due to the FAA's change.   The Trump administration is appealing a court decision ordering it to restore full funding for SNAP benefits by today. The government previously stated it would restore partial benefits in response to an earlier decision. In a new decision made yesterday, U.S. District Judge John McConnell Jr. in Rhode Island ruled that the government failed to consider the harm to individuals who rely on those benefits.    \n   🎧 The emergency fund to keep SNAP going was only enough to make partial benefit payments, resulting in McConnell saying the administration would need to tap into money from customs revenue. The deadline the judge set is for the government to distribute the money to states, but even if it manages that, NPR's Tovia Smith says it is hard to imagine funds could reach individuals that fast. The administration previously stated that reducing benefits is a complicated process that could take weeks to months, and it is unclear whether that process now needs to be undone.   President Trump's allies are raising concerns that he is spending too much time focused on the rest of the world and not enough on domestic issues. The president has been nurturing international relations, from currently hosting Prime Minister Viktor Orbán of Hungary at the White House to a dinner last night with leaders from Central Asia. Earlier, he also threatened strikes against Nigeria. These actions occurred during the same week that the government shutdown became the longest in history.    🎧 The election results have also pointed to Trump possibly losing his edge on the economy. The president's approval ratings are also low, NPR's Franco Ordoñez says. Among Trump's allies, Vice President JD Vance stated that Republicans need to focus on what is happening on the home front while commenting on the Democratic victories at the ballot box. The White House informed Ordoñez that there will be more of an economic focus on the U.S., pointing to yesterday's announcement of lower prices on obesity drugs.   \n   Deep dive   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Alexis Blake inside her car at her apartment's parking garage on August, 8th, 2025.

After examining data from Quadrant Information Services, startling differences in auto insurance rates were found between drivers with poor credit and those with excellent credit, often resulting in thousands of dollars in annual premiums.   🚗 Insurance companies and industry groups defended the use of credit history to help set premiums. They say it is a powerful indicator of whether a driver will have an insured loss.🚗 Consumer advocates point out that credit scores are consistently lower for lower-income Americans and people of color.🚗 Will Guzzardi, a Democratic lawmaker representing mostly Latino Chicagoans in the Illinois state legislature, has been working on car insurance fairness for about two years.

That support is deeply rooted in their evangelical faith, he said. But recently, Lahmeyer has noticed the conversation around Israel is changing quite a bit — particularly online.   \n   \"Some very influential leaders, all of whom I like — Tucker Carlson, Candace Owens, Marjorie Taylor Greene — have taken a very controversial stance in regards to the nation of Israel,\" he said.   Last week, Carlson hosted a prominent white nationalist named Nick Fuentes on his show. Although Carlson disagreed with Fuentes on his most antisemitic statements, such as American Jews are more faithful to Israel than they are to the United States, he did broadly align with Fuentes on his views about the country itself.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                White nationalist Nick Fuentes recently appeared on Tucker Carlson's podcast where he promoted antisemitic ideas. While Carlson disagreed on many topics, he said that America's support for Israel needed to be questioned: \"We get nothing out of it, I completely agree with you there,\" Carlson told Fuentes.\n                \n                    Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n    \n\n   \n   \"I've always thought it's great to criticize and question our relationship with Israel because it's insane and it hurts us. We get nothing out of it, I completely agree with you there,\" Carlson said.   Opposition to Israel on the right isn't new, but younger conservatives appear to be rapidly moving away from supporting the close U.S. relationship with the country. Among several polls, one from the Pew Research Center out earlier this year showed that conservatives under 50 were increasingly skeptical of Israel. Over the past three years, the group's negative views of the country jumped from 35% to 50%.   Loading...\n   The stakes for Israel are enormous. If skepticism starts spreading from conservative influencers to elected officials, it could threaten billions in military and foreign aid that Israel receives each year from the U.S.    For more than a decade, the majority of its political support in America has come from Christian conservatives, said Daniel Hummel, a historian at the University of Wisconsin, Madison who's studied Christian support for Israel. Today, with many on the left angry over the war in Gaza, their backing is more important than ever.   \"They're the last bastion of organized, large-scale national support for Israel,\" he said.   Biblical roots   Christian support for Israel is rooted in the Bible itself. Many evangelical Christians believe that the promises God made to the Jewish people in the Old Testament still hold, Lahmeyer said.   \"God's made a covenant with the Jewish people and he's not going to break that covenant,\" he said.   Evangelicals see support of the modern state of Israel as a way of honoring that divine will. \"If God says, 'This land belongs to you eternally,' then it belongs to you eternally — because God's the creator, he's the owner,\" Lahmeyer said.   \n   Many also believe the return of the Jewish people to Israel is a prerequisite for the second coming of Christ, he added.   From a modern standpoint, Hummel says, Christian support for the state of Israel has been growing in fits and starts since the nation was founded in 1948. The famous evangelical pastor Billy Graham visited Israel in the 1960s. By the 1980s and 1990s many large Christian groups, like the Moral Majority and the Christian Coalition, were supporting Israel.   \n   Evangelical support for Israel grew vastly in the years following the 9/11 terror attacks, Hummel said. Particularly in 2006, support for the country took off with the formation of a group known as Christians United For Israel (CUFI). The group became a single-issue lobby that claimed support from millions of American evangelicals, Hummel said. CUFI has been a staunch advocate for Israel and some of its most expansionist policies — such as settlements in the West Bank. (CUFI did not respond to NPR's request for an interview for this story.)   Because of their biblical beliefs about Israel, Hummel said, evangelical backers, known as Christian Zionists, have become central to American support. The backing of Christian Zionists kept growing, even as traditional supporters on the American left grew increasingly skeptical of Israel's policies in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                New housing projects are seen in the West Bank Israeli settlement of Givat Ze'ev,  June 18, 2023. Evangelical Christians have supported the expansion of Israeli settlements.\n                \n                    Ohad Zwigenberg/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Ohad Zwigenberg/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Today Christian Zionists \"are really valuable to Israel,\" he said. \"They tend to say, 'We think Israel knows its interests best… and we just want to support what they decide.'\"   Cracks over Gaza   But Israel's war in Gaza has challenged that view. \"Over the last two years, there has been this kind of gnawing away of support of Israel among evangelical Christians,\" Lahmeyer said.   The polls support that observation, said Shibley Telhami, the Anwar Sadat Professor for Peace and Development at the University of Maryland, who tracks public opinion about Israel. He says that since the war in Gaza, support has plummeted among young conservatives.   \n   Telhami's own work shows that today, only 32% of evangelicals aged 18-34 sympathize with Israel over the Palestinians — that's more than 30 points lower than the older generation. Support more broadly from Republicans in the same age range is only 24%.   Loading...\n   Telhami believes that shift in sentiment has emboldened longtime opponents to Israel on the right.   In addition to Tucker Carlson, prominent Republican influencers like Candace Owens and Stephen Bannon have publicly criticized Israel recently.   Many of these personalities never supported Israel, and they sense that now is the moment to speak up, said Curt Mills, editor of the American Conservative Magazine, which opposes Israeli policies and was founded by Pat Buchanan – a Christian conservative, former presidential hopeful and political commentator.   \n   \"Tucker and Bannon are political operators and in a lot of ways true believers, but they are also very effective businessmen and they would not be doing these programs if nobody gave a hoot,\" he said. \"There's an audience for this, people are frustrated, people are angry and they have reason to be.\"   In addition to anger over the way Israel has conducted its war in Gaza, Mills says many conservatives want America to avoid becoming entangled in new wars, particularly in the Middle East. And they worry Trump is allowing Israel to drive military decisions. That anxiety grew after America bombed Iranian nuclear sites earlier this year.   \"They are using Donald Trump's presidency like a rented car. The Israelis, the Israeli lobby, the Netanyahu Government, the neoconservatives in his ranks,\" he said.   Resurgent antisemitism   A desire for American isolationism and outrage over how Israel has conducted the war have driven some to speak up. But other influencers are using the war as an opportunity to peddle antisemitic conspiracies.   One example came last month, when podcaster Candace Owens discussed a meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a group of U.S. social media influencers:   \n   \"Two years ago, the mere idea that you might share a perspective that Jews are controlling the media, that would be considered antisemitic. You would be called a Jew hater. Fast forward to 2025, and Bibi Netanyahu is now hosting an on-camera meeting,\" she said.   The idea that \"Jews control the media\" is a long-held antisemitic trope. Owens has made other antisemitic remarks in the past, though she has repeatedly said that she does not hate Jewish people.   White nationalist Nick Fuentes used his appearance on Carlson's show to promote numerous antisemitic ideas: including that he believed Jews naturally dislike Europeans and that Jewish people prevent America from unifying around a common vision for itself.   \"The main challenge to that, a big challenge to [unifying the country] is organized Jewry in America,\" he told Carlson.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee (Center) tours the fifth-century Church of St George in the Palestinian Christian village of Taybeh, northeast of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, on July 19, 2025. Huckabee and others in the Trump Administration continue to be highly supportive of Israel.\n                \n                    JAAFAR ASHTIYEH/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        JAAFAR ASHTIYEH/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Hummel points out that much of this antisemitism is entangled in a theological divide over Israel. Many conservative opponents to Israel are Catholic or non-evangelical Protestants, he said. Those individuals do not necessarily share the view that the Jewish people still share a sacred covenant with God. And some, like Fuentes, are resurfacing centuries-old Christian conspiracy theories about the Jewish people.   Telhami says that it remains to be seen what all this actually means for the relationship between America and Israel. The Trump administration continues to be broadly supportive, and the U.S. ambassador to Israel is Mike Huckabee — a devout evangelical Christian.   \"The question of course is whether the shift in public opinion in-and-of-itself would lead to a shift in policy. And that's not a straightforward line,\" Telhami said.   But he added, it is clear that on the American right, support for Israel is no longer the given it once was.\n",

    "body": "\n      After Tuesday's election results and low approval numbers for Republicans, allies are raising concerns that President Trump is too focused on foreign policy.   \n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  President Trump is hosting Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary at the White House. Last night, he had dinner with Central Asian leaders and expanded the Abraham Accords. Earlier, he threatened strikes against Nigeria.LEILA FADEL, HOST:  This on the same week that the government shutdown became the longest ever, and election results suggest Trump's edge on the economy is waning. It's raising concerns among some of Trump's allies that he's spending too much time focused on the rest of the world and not enough at home.MARTÍNEZ: NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez joins us now. So what's this meeting with Orban about?FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: Yeah. I mean, the meeting is expected to be about the war in Ukraine and pressing Hungary to stop buying Russian oil as a means to pressure Moscow to end the war. Though the concern is not about Orban specifically, but all the time and effort put on foreign policy. I mean, A, it's not just one week. In the past month, Trump's helped broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. He continues to threaten Venezuela. He's trekked across Asia, struck a deal with China and even started to plan a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. It's just a tremendous amount of foreign policy work.MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. And then the timing, too, because right now many Americans are struggling with the cost of living. I mean, some of Trump allies feel like he really needs to be talking more about the economy instead.ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, and it's not just about the election results, either, but also Trump's low approval ratings. Stephen Bannon told Politico that Trump shouldn't spend so much time on the Middle East and Ukraine and needs to pivot to the economy. Vivek Ramaswamy, a candidate for Ohio governor, said Republicans can't mess around.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)VIVEK RAMASWAMY: Our side needs to focus on affordability. Make the American dream affordable. Bring down costs - electric costs, grocery costs, health care costs, and housing costs - and lay out how we're going to do it.ORDOÑEZ: And JD Vance, the vice president, while downplaying the Democrats' victories, also said Republicans need to, quote, \"focus on the home front.\"MARTÍNEZ: So people close to the president are asking for a pivot. Will he?ORDOÑEZ: I mean, he's talking a lot about the economy now. But he's largely blaming allies in Congress - Republicans - for not touting his work.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The affordability is much better with the Republicans. The only problem is the Republicans don't talk about it, and Republicans should start talking about it and use their heads.ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. And the White House told me that there will be more of a focus on the home front and cited yesterday's announcement on lowering drug prices. But they push back on the idea that his work overseas isn't in U.S. interests, saying new trade deals, for example, brings money home, and killing drug traffickers keeps Americans safer.MARTÍNEZ: Do you think, Franco, that all of this might be an issue for the midterms? They're coming up in less than a year.ORDOÑEZ: It probably will. I mean, I was talking with Jon McHenry, a Republican pollster, who said the economy is always going to be the most important issue for voters.JON MCHENRY: People expect you to do well on foreign policy, but they expect you to do well on foreign policy while you're also laser-focused on domestic issues. You know, the foreign policy is a kind of a nice-to-have, and the domestic policy is a must-have.MARTÍNEZ: Franco, are Republicans nervous?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, McHenry also pointed to an NBC poll that shows two-thirds of Americans feel Trump has fallen short on the economy, which were similar numbers that former President Barack Obama had in 2010. And that year, Obama's party lost 63 House seats in the midterm elections.MARTÍNEZ: All right. That's NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez. Thanks a lot.ORDOÑEZ: Thank you, A.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Leila Fadel asks Republican strategist Brendan Buck about the Democratic election sweep and what it reveals about voter attitudes on the economy under President Trump.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  For more on Trump's messaging on the economy, we're joined by Republican strategist Brendan Buck. He's a partner at the consulting firm Seven Letter. Before that, he served as press secretary to House Speaker John Boehner and later advised House Speaker Paul Ryan. And we'll note he's working now on a coalition that's trying to get Affordable Care Act tax credits extended. Good morning and welcome to the program.BRENDAN BUCK: Hi, Leila.FADEL: So I want to start with what we just heard. There are voters sending a message this week that President Trump is not delivering on promises of affordability.BUCK: It's hard to argue otherwise. As the pollster just said, yeah, the economy is always No. 1. I think what's interesting about this is Donald Trump has had bad numbers for quite a while, and we just haven't had any event that really forced anyone to confront that. And I think that's what happened here. In some ways, our politics are really complicated. In some ways they're pretty simple. Our voters tend to swing back and forth.When they have an incumbent who they don't think is getting the job done, they're going to send a message to them at the polls. I think that's what happened Tuesday. And it is absolutely a wake-up call, it should be, for Republicans and certainly the president, who seems to want to distance himself from it. But this is very squarely, I think, on Donald Trump. And his numbers were reflected in what happened this week.FADEL: Let me ask you about that 'cause we heard the president there say it's a messaging problem. So is it a messaging problem? Or is it about what is being done or not being done?BUCK: Well, I think it can be both. I mean, ironically, he's starting to sound a little bit like Joe Biden, which is, don't believe your own finances. Believe me when I tell you everything is fine. And that's a really hard sell. And he's not the first president to try to do that. But if you're not actually lowering people's prices, or at least holding them down, eventually that's going to catch up to you. You can only tell people something so long before their own reality disputes it.Now, there are potentially ways to address this substantively. And we just had a Supreme Court hearing this week. Maybe that can be an off-ramp. If these tariffs that he's been putting in place get struck down, maybe he can back away from that and do something to tangibly lower prices, because I think ultimately what the economy is doing is going to be much more important than what he says about it.FADEL: Let me ask, though - you know, we heard from the administration that, you know, it's being overblown, that stuff is being taken - there's too much being taken from Tuesday's vote. Do you agree with that?BUCK: Well, I would say that there's still a long time until the election, but I think that there are really clear warning signs. And look, you have to tend to your politics a little more than I think the administration and Republicans broadly have been doing. Look, if you have an election in Virginia and you've just fired a bunch of federal workers, that's going to show up. And if you cancel an important tunnel project in New Jersey and you have an election there, that's going to show up. If you've made gains with Hispanic voters, but then you run an administration that's rounding people up in communities and terrorizing communities, that's going to show up. And to date, they've acted pretty cavalier with some of their policies and the political impact of them. So hopefully this could be a bit of a reset where they're thinking a little more strategically about what they're doing substantively.FADEL: So if you were advising, what would you say to do in this moment, given what happened on Tuesday?BUCK: Well, it's certainly right to focus on the economy rhetorically, but I think you also need to focus on it substantively. I mean, you mentioned that I'm working on these ACA tax credits. I mean, that is a huge issue. Next year, either the - people's health care premiums are going to go up a little bit, or they're going to go up a lot. And that's a decision that Congress is going to have to face. I think that's one tangible thing that they can do. Again, the tariffs are something very tangible they can do.But some of it is just sort of getting out of the bubble. I mean, too often, Republicans are only worried about whether their sort of conservative base is comfortable with what they're doing. And I think what we found on Tuesday is there's a whole world out there outside of your conservative base. And if you are not focused on those bread-and-butter issues, they're going to punish you. So it really requires you to think about those sort of middle-class, down the middle, independent voters who really still, even as polarized as we are, determine most outcomes.FADEL: So are you saying they should sit down with the Democrats, figure out health care and get the government open?BUCK: Well, that would be a good start, for sure. I mean, the government shutdown is not serving anyone's interests at this point. I don't think it's working for Democrats. I don't think it's working for Republicans. And it really does this - make everybody sour on Washington. And when you're the party in power, it doesn't do you very good to have everybody kind of just disgusted with what's going on. You're going to be the ones punished. And that's not a new dynamic. The party in power almost always has a bad first midterm election.And so Republicans are working against history. They're working against now the economy, which - the Democrats have sort of taken that issue away from them. So they've got a lot of work to do. And hopefully, you know, as a Republican, we can figure that out and focus a little more on the things that people care about.FADEL: That's Republican strategist Brendan Buck. Thank you so much for your time and your insights.BUCK: Of course. Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the first woman ever elected Speaker of the House, announced Thursday that after 38 years in Congress, she will not seek another term.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  Democratic representative Nancy Pelosi, the first woman ever elected speaker of the House, announced today that she will not seek another term. Pelosi spent 38 years representing her San Francisco constituents in Washington. KQED senior politics correspondent Scott Shafer looks back at her historic legacy.SCOTT SHAFER, BYLINE: As Representative Nancy Pelosi prepares to exit the political stage at age 85, she leaves behind a long list of accomplishments, including passage of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Pelosi was first elected in 1987 to fill a seat left vacant by the death of Representative Sala Burton. Her first campaign was no cakewalk. Some of her opponents painted her as privileged and out of touch, including city supervisor Carol Ruth Silver at a televised debate held at KQED.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CAROL RUTH SILVER: How can she relate to people like me - a single parent, working mother?SHAFER: But Pelosi held her ground.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NANCY PELOSI: My attitude is, they'll take the low road and I'll take the high road, and I'll get to Congress before them.SHAFER: And she did, quickly showing her political chops. Years later, her reputation as a tough-as-nails street fighter was well established, as she acknowledged in 2018.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PELOSI: As I always say to the candidates, you have to know how to take a punch and throw a punch.SHAFER: Pelosi arrived in Washington as the AIDS epidemic was ravaging her district. She pushed for more federal funding at a time when the Reagan administration was ignoring it. Ernest Hopkins with the San Francisco AIDS Foundation said Pelosi's impact was felt far outside her own district.ERNEST HOPKINS: She understood that we could not end the HIV epidemic without addressing the epidemic in Black and Latino communities, and so she was all in.SHAFER: But Pelosi's rise to power within the Democratic Party was not easy.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PELOSI: And when I did run for high office and leadership, some of the men said, who said she could run (laughter)? Well, that just lit my fire, really.SHAFER: In 2006, Democrats reclaimed a majority in the House for the first time in 12 years. They elected Pelosi to be the next speaker. Pelosi was a partisan warrior, but Republicans used her as a foil, a liberal Democrat from San Francisco, tying her to other Democrats running in more conservative parts of the country.There were times when she worked across the aisle. During the last year of George W. Bush's presidency, when the economy was cratering from the subprime mortgage crisis, she rounded up enough Democratic votes to save financial institutions, which critics described as a Wall Street bailout. Even former Republican speaker John Boehner praised her at the unveiling of Pelosi's official portrait in 2022.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN BOEHNER: And the fact of the matter is, no other speaker of the House in the modern era, Republican or Democrat, has wielded the gavel with such authority or with such consistent results.SHAFER: Pelosi's superpower was cultivating relationships and understanding how to win enough votes to pass legislation. She was also a thorn in the side of President Trump. In a meeting in the Oval Office during Trump's first term, Pelosi said the blame belonged squarely on the president if there were a government shutdown.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PELOSI: You should not have a Trump shutdown. Are you having a (ph)...PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: A what? Did you say Trump?PELOSI: A Trump shutdown.SHAFER: A photo of her emerging from that meeting with the president wearing a vibrant red coat and sunglasses became an iconic image. Democrats retook the House in 2019, and Pelosi was elected speaker a second time, guiding two impeachments of Trump, efforts that ultimately failed in the Senate. She became the face of the Democratic Party's resistance, dramatically ripping up a copy of Trump's State of the Union speech in 2020. She later gave her reason in an interview with KQED, saying it was, quote, \"full of lies.\" Pelosi made history as the first woman and the first Californian to become speaker. But as Governor Gavin Newsom notes, it's what she did with that power that mattered.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GAVIN NEWSOM: You may never get something like this back. It will take 40, 50 years for someone to build the kind of credibility that she's built and the influence and the capacity to deliver.SHAFER: Several candidates are already vying to replace her. Whoever wins will be hard-pressed to match Pelosi's ability to wield power.For NPR News, I'm Scott Shafer in San Francisco.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Democrats won every election in the 2025 off-year contests, setting them up for high expectations going into the 2026 midterms. Democrats and Republicans talk about what it could mean going forward.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Democrats outperformed expectations in races across the country this week. And so NPR political correspondent Sarah McCammon has been asking Democrats and Republicans what this all means for next year's midterms. And Sarah is with me now. Good morning, Sarah.SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Hi, Leila.FADEL: So let's start with Democrats. What are they telling you?MCCAMMON: Well, obviously, they are very pleased across the...FADEL: Right.MCCAMMON: ...Board. And they're framing their success this week as a repudiation of President Trump's policies, as well as an affirmation of their candidates' focus across the country on economic issues like affordability. That said, I am hearing some divisions within the party about who best represents the future of the party. You know, is it more moderate Democrats like Abigail Spanberger in Virginia or Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey? Or is it young progressives like Zohran Mamdani, who won the mayoral race in New York City?FADEL: Right. And Spanberger and Sherrill won the governors races. What are you hearing from Democrats about Mamdani specifically? Because he really won without the Democratic establishment behind him.MCCAMMON: Yeah. I mean, they recognize that Mamdani excited the party base and motivated New York voters both to register in big numbers and to vote, largely by talking about these affordability issues like housing. I also heard some skepticism about his broader appeal beyond New York. Debbie Cox Bultan with the center-left group NewDEAL noted that the two moderate Democrats we mentioned, Spanberger and Sherrill, outperformed Vice President Kamala Harris' performance from last year by large margins.DEBBIE COX BULTAN: That is not true for the mayor-elect in New York. And so I think when we think about how we're going to move forward and win across the country in places that are hard to win, we've got to look to people like Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill as the roadmap if we're going to be able to build broad coalitions to win in '26 and '28.MCCAMMON: It's probably worth mentioning Mamdani was in a three-way race in New York City.FADEL: Right.MCCAMMON: He is a democratic socialist and has been accused by some Jewish groups of antisemitism based on some of his views on Israel. For his part, Mamdani has repeatedly said he would fight antisemitism, and he drew support from about a third of Jewish voters. Some centrist Democrats worry, though, that attacks on Mamdani from Trump and other Republicans, some of whom have painted him as a communist and a terrorist because of his Muslim faith, will harm Democrats in other parts of the country.FADEL: But the attacks didn't work - right? - in New York. He got over a million votes. So what are the lessons from his win, if there are any?MCCAMMON: Well, both Republicans and Democrats I've talked to since the election think Mamdani absolutely will be a focus in the coming months. But Ezra Levin of the progressive group Indivisible told me he thinks the Democratic Party has to be big enough for many voices if they want to win.EZRA LEVIN: I think effective Democratic leadership would recognize we need a big tent. And if you're organizing with people in this moment who entirely agree with everything that you stand for, your tent's too small.MCCAMMON: And Levin says the party needs to be laser-focused right now on fighting authoritarianism and defeating Trump's agenda.FADEL: With how well the Democrats did on Tuesday, are Republicans recalibrating their strategy going forward?MCCAMMON: You know, both parties - at least based on these results, where things stand right now - say the economy will continue to be a huge focus across the board. One Republican strategist I spoke with, Zack Roday with Ascent Media, acknowledged that focusing on cultural and social issues like the transgender policy issue seemed to be less effective for Republicans this year compared to a year ago. And he says Republicans are in power in Washington, and they'll need to focus on issues that voters care about, like the cost of living.You know, on another note, Democrats also won a pretty resounding victory in California, allowing them to redraw their congressional maps. Another Republican strategist, Whit Ayres at North Star Opinion Research, told me some Republicans may look at this week's results, the big turnout from Democrats, and decide to be a little more cautious about this redistricting strategy, which President Trump, of course, has promoted. Ayres says in some districts where Republican control is more marginal, they could actually risk losing seats by doing this. So they could overplay their hand.FADEL: That's NPR political correspondent Sarah McCammon. Thank you, Sarah.MCCAMMON: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MATT JORGENSEN'S \"SPACE, PLANE AND LINE\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced that she will not run for reelection after 38 years in Congress. NPR's A Martínez speaks with author Molly Ball about Pelosi's legacy.   \n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  Nancy Pelosi will not run for reelection. In 2007, she claimed the title no woman had won before, speaker of the House. Here she is on C-SPAN.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NANCY PELOSI: And today I thank my colleagues. By electing me speaker, you have brought us closer to the ideal of equality that is America's heritage and America's hope.MARTÍNEZ: Over 38 years in Congress, Pelosi fought for civil rights and health care. She fought against guns and AIDs. California Governor Gavin Newsom told KQED's Political Breakdown last month that Pelosi's impact cannot be overstated.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)GAVIN NEWSOM: No one - period, full stop - has delivered more for San Francisco and the state of California than Nancy Pelosi, period.MARTÍNEZ: For more, we're joined now by journalist Molly Ball, who wrote the biography \"Pelosi.\" Molly, I mean, Pelosi's path to Congress was not necessarily a traditional one. Why was her first election to Congress such a notable change for her?MOLLY BALL: Well, she was already 47 years old. She had been a housewife and political volunteer for her entire life up to that point. So while she was active in Democratic politics, she wasn't someone who'd set out to run for office. It only came about because her friend who held that San Francisco political seat, Sala Burton, was dying of cancer. And in a scene so cinematic you sort of can't make it up, she extracted a deathbed promise from her friend Nancy Pelosi to run for the seat in Congress after she passed. So this was not something that Pelosi set out to do. It was something of a second career for her when she became an empty nester. But of course, she ended up being historically successful at it.MARTÍNEZ: But 47 years old. I think people forget that, right? Because people are elected so young nowadays that 47 back then was kind of an older age to start.BALL: Absolutely. I mean, she certainly was not part of any youthquake. But she brought to the job a lot of contacts, a lot of credentials. She had been a volunteer and political operative in California. She helped bring the 1984 Democratic Convention to San Francisco. She even ran for chair of the Democratic National Committee. So she was pretty well-known as a Democratic operative, but she didn't ever see herself actually being in the arena until fate made that a possibility.MARTÍNEZ: What was it like to be a congresswoman in the late '80s, like, when Nancy Pelosi entered Congress?BALL: I'm so glad you asked that because it's so easy to forget how different things were for women in politics just 40 years ago. There were only 25 other women members of the entire House and Senate, 535 members, at the time that Nancy Pelosi got there in 1987. There was no women's bathroom near the House floor. Women were not allowed to wear pants on the floor of the Senate.MARTÍNEZ: (Laughter).BALL: And many of the women who were there were the widows of congressmen who had died and whose wives had taken their place. So the idea that a woman could not only be a member of Congress but a leader in Congress was unthinkable. And indeed, no woman had become either the House whip or House party leader before Nancy Pelosi achieved those milestones in 2001 and 2003, before, of course, becoming the first woman speaker.MARTÍNEZ: Molly, what would you say are her biggest legislative achievements?BALL: She would always tell you the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is the thing that she is proudest of. And she moved heaven and Earth to get that legislation through the House under very difficult circumstances when Barack Obama was president. She was also Obama's partner on his other legislative achievements, the stimulus bill, Wall Street reform. She worked on issues such as allowing gays to serve openly in the military. When Biden was president, she helped him pass his massive social spending and climate spending and infrastructure bills. And even when George W. Bush was president, during his first speakership, she opposed him on most things. But she also worked with him to pass the financial bailout that they saw as rescuing the economy during the 2008 crash.MARTÍNEZ: Just about a few seconds left, Molly. I mean, why do you think she decided to make this, of all the terms, her last term?BALL: Well, she's 85 years old. It's not a question we usually ask of 85-year-olds when they decide to retire, why do it now?MARTÍNEZ: (Laughter) Yeah.BALL: But, you know, she was instrumental in convincing Joe Biden to exit the presidential race last year. She also saw the decline of her colleague in the California delegation, Dianne Feinstein. You have to imagine, although I haven't spoken to her about this, that those examples were on her mind and she wanted to leave gracefully, on her own terms, not seeming to be pushed out by anyone - having all of her faculties intact and being able to take a sort of victory lap and leave on a high note with the gratitude of a generation of Democrats.MARTÍNEZ: Molly Ball is a political journalist and the author of the biography \"Pelosi.\" Molly, thanks.BALL: Thank you for having me.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

It's the latest strike against boats the administration says were carrying drugs. More than 60 people have been killed in all of these attacks. The post came just hours after the Senate failed to pass a measure that would have stopped President Trump from waging war with Venezuela. The vote was 49-51 and was a test of how far Republicans will go to push back on Trump. NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales has more.CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: As President Trump directs an escalating conflict in and around Venezuela, concerns among lawmakers are growing too.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RAND PAUL: The executive branch does not have the authority to kill at will anyone, anywhere, at any time, for any reason.GRISALES: That's Kentucky Republican Rand Paul on the floor of the GOP-led Senate fighting for a War Powers Resolution to stop the escalation. Paul argues a current military tempo signals the Trump administration's interest in a regime change to oust Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. So Paul sponsored the resolution with Democrats, including Virginia Senator Tim Kaine.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TIM KAINE: You don't need a Ford-class carrier to interdict small drug boats.GRISALES: That's Kaine on the Senate floor on Thursday. Ultimately, Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski was the only other Republican to join Paul, though GOP members like Indiana Senator Todd Young warned they're troubled by aspects of the strikes. Trump supporters like South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham say, in modern history, Congress has typically not intervened when presidents initiated conflicts.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LINDSEY GRAHAM: The day that we terminate a military operation based on the idea that we haven't authorized it, then we become commander-in-chief.GRISALES: Graham said presidents have started dozens of conflicts while Congress has only declared five wars, and he says there's good reason for presidents to act.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GRAHAM: Five hundred thirty-five people have a hard time deciding when to go to lunch.GRISALES: But critics say this military buildup is different. Trump cabinet officials briefed a bipartisan group of congressional leaders this week. Even after the briefings, critics say they don't have the identities of those killed or evidence justifying the strikes, which many argue is illegal. Here's Paul.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PAUL: I would advise President Trump to remember the wise words of his inaugural address, we will measure our success by the wars we never get into.GRISALES: The issue will not disappear after the failed boat. Trump recently ordered the country's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, and its strike group to the waters off South America.Claudia Grisales, NPR News, the Capitol.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

He made the announcement on social media minutes before he met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday in South Korea. When he spoke to reporters later aboard Air Force One as he flew back to Washington, he offered little clarity.   The U.S. military already regularly tests its missiles that are capable of delivering a nuclear warhead, but it has not detonated the weapons since 1992 because of a test ban.   \n   But the president suggested that changes were necessary because other countries were testing weapons. It was unclear what he was referring to, but it evoked Cold War-era escalations.   \"Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,\" he said in a post on Truth Social. \"That process will begin immediately.\"   The White House did not immediately respond to questions seeking more details. Trump ignored a question from a reporter about his post as he sat face-to-face with Xi in Busan, a meeting that focused on trade issues between the two countries.   When he spoke to reporters later, Trump appeared to be conflating the testing of missiles that deliver a nuclear warhead with the testing of the warheads.   Other countries, he said, \"seem to all be nuclear testing\" but when it comes to the U.S., \"We have more nuclear weapons than anybody. We don't do testing.\"   \"I see them testing and I say, well, if they're going to test, I guess we have to test,\" Trump said as he continued speaking to reporters.   Trump was asked where the tests would occur and he said, \"It'll be announced. We have test sites.\"   \n   Pentagon officials didn't immediately respond to questions about the announcement from Trump on the nuclear missile tests.   Russian President Vladimir Putin this week announced that Russia tested a new atomic-powered and nuclear-capable underwater drone and a new nuclear-powered cruise missile. Putin did not announce any tests of Russia's nuclear weapons, however, which last occurred in 1990.   Trump did not specifically mention the Russian tests in his post, but alluded to the nuclear stockpiles controlled by both Xi and Putin, saying, \"Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.\"   Putin in 2023 signed a bill revoking Russia's ratification of a global nuclear test ban, which Moscow said was needed to put Russia on par with the U.S.   The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which was adopted in 1996 and bans all nuclear explosions anywhere in the world, was signed by President Bill Clinton but never ratified by the Senate.   Russia in 2023 said it would only resume tests of its nuclear weapons if Washington did it first.   Earlier this year, Trump signaled he wanted to push his Russian and Chinese counterparts in the other direction, saying he wanted to resume nuclear arms control talks with both countries.   A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson called on the U.S. to refrain from carrying out nuclear tests.   \"China hopes the U.S. will earnestly fulfill its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and honor its commitment to suspend nuclear testing,\" Guo Jiakun said at a briefing in Beijing.   Despite his announcement that sounded like an escalation, Trump told reporters that he would like to see a \"denuclearization and \"de-scalation.\"   \"We are actually talking to Russia about that,\" Trump said, though he did not elaborate.   Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association, quickly criticized the president's announcement and said Trump was \"misinformed and out of touch.\"   \n   Kimball, in social media posts, said the U.S. has no reason to resume nuclear explosive testing and it would take at least 36 months to resume testing at the former test site in Nevada, where the last detonations occurred underground.   \"By foolishly announcing his intention (to) resume nuclear testing, Trump will trigger strong public opposition in Nevada, from all U.S. allies, and it could trigger a chain reaction of nuclear testing by U.S. adversaries, and blow apart the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty,\" Kimball said in a post on X.   Japanese survivors of the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end World War II condemned Trump's announcement.   \"The act vehemently opposes all countries that are endeavoring to achieve a nuclear-free and peaceful world and absolutely cannot be tolerated,\" said Jiro Hamasumi, secretary general of Nihon Hidankyo, a survivors organization that won the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize.\n",

The seven member commission is made up of experts in architecture, art, urban and landscape design. Since its creation in 1910, the commission has reviewed plans for everything from Arlington National Cemetery to Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial.   As first reported by The Washington Post, the commissioners who were terminated are Bruce Redman Becker, Peter D. Cook, Lisa E. Delplace, William J. Lenihan, Justin Garrett Moore and vice chair Hazel Ruth Edwards. The chair position, now vacant, was held by Billie Tsien, one of the architects working on the Obama Presidential Center in Chicago. Lenihan confirmed in an email to NPR the six were terminated \"effective immediately.\"   \n   In an email to NPR, the White House said it is \"preparing to appoint a new slate of members to the commission that are more aligned with President Trump's America First Policies.\"   The commissioners would have advised President Trump on his anticipated White House ballroom and his plans for a monument similar to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, which he says will celebrate the 250th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence. In an email to NPR, architect Bruce Redman Becker, one of the commissioners who was fired, wrote that \"Neither project has been submitted for review yet.\"   President Trump has not yet announced who the new commissioners will be. During his first term, Justin Shubow, founder and president of the National Civic Art Society served as chair and White House ballroom architect James McCrery was one of its commissioners.   In 2021, President Biden fired four commissioners who'd been appointed by Trump in his first term, including Shubow. Like Trump, Shubow is a champion of traditional and classical architecture.   The White House has not yet responded to NPR's request for comment.\n",

But after the two leaders sat down for a meeting at a South Korean air base in Busan, it's unclear how secure any trade deal between the two is.   The leaders spoke for about an hour and 40 minutes Thursday, and left without giving remarks. Trump headed straight to Air Force One as planned, traveling back to Washington after nearly a week in the Indo-pacific region.    Just about an hour before the meeting, Trump posted on Truth Social that the U.S. would conduct testing on nuclear weapons \"on an equal basis\" with Russia and China, though it's not entirely clear what that would mean. The announcement could mark a reversal of decades of policy.    \n   The U.S. has not conducted a test of a nuclear weapon since 1992. Instead, it uses scientific experiments and computer simulations to make sure its bombs still work. The voluntary test moratorium has been in place since the end of the Cold War, as part of an effort to maintain nuclear stability. The U.S. is not prepared to conduct a nuclear test in the near term, and Russia and China haven't tested nuclear weapons in decades either — though both nations have been modernizing their arsenals in recent years.    They opened with optimism   Trump and Xi gave brief positive remarks ahead of their meeting.    \"President Xi is a great leader of a great country, and I think we're going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time,\" Trump said at the top of the meeting, calling Xi a friend.   It's the first time Trump and Xi have spoken in person in six years. Xi noted in his remarks, through an interpreter, that the two have spoken on the phone three times and exchanged several letters since Trump was reelected last year.   \n   Xi said to Trump it was \"normal\" that the U.S. and China have \"frictions\" in their relations from time to time but said amid challenges, \"You and I at the helm of China-U.S. relations should stay the right course.\"   \"China and the U.S. should be partners and friends. This is what history has taught us and what reality demands,\" Xi said.   Xi also said he appreciated Trump for his contributions in the ceasefire agreement in the Middle East, and said Trump cares \"a lot about world peace.\"   \n   He also mentioned Trump's recent trip to Malaysia for the ASEAN summit, where Trump presided over a signing of a peace deal between Cambodia and Thailand. Trump has been adamant that China played no role in procuring the ceasefire, but Xi said that \"China's been helping our own way\" to end the border dispute there.   What was on the table   The president confidently said for days he would reach a trade deal with Xi.   \"I think we're gonna have a deal, I think it will be a good deal for both, and that's really a great result,\" Trump told a lunch meeting of APEC business executives in the southern city of Gyeongju.   \"That's better than fighting and going through all sorts of problems,\" he added ahead of the Thursday meeting with Xi. \"No reason for it.\"   Trump said earlier this week that he could reduce tariffs on Chinese goods in exchange for a commitment from Beijing to curb exports of chemicals used to make fentanyl.   \"I expect to be lowering that because I believe that they're going to help us with the fentanyl situation,\" Trump told reporters en route to Gyeongju. \"They're going to be doing what they can do.\"   The U.S. currently imposes a 20% tariff on Chinese imports, in addition to other tariffs, because the U.S. government believes China has not done enough to restrict fentanyl precursor exports.   In response, Beijing imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. soybeans. U.S. and Chinese economic officials met over the weekend in Malaysia to build the framework of a trade deal that would include China resuming purchases of U.S. soybeans.   The deal would also include China delaying the imposition of export restrictions on rare earths, while the U.S. would hold off on raising tariffs by 100%.   Where the tension lies   At the same time, both Beijing and Washington have been trading accusations that the other side's economic coercion is wreaking havoc on the global economy.   \n   \"This is China versus the world,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said about China's rare earth export controls this month. \"They have pointed a bazooka at the supply chains and the industrial base of the entire free world, and we're not going to have it,\" he said.   \"The U.S. has raised tariffs so high that it's brought globalization to the verge of breakdown,\" said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Studies at Nanjing University in China.   He notes that besides tariffs, the U.S. has raised port fees this month on Chinese-owned or operated ships docking at U.S. ports. It has suggested controls on U.S. exports of software to China.   And it has proposed barring Chinese air carriers headed to and from the U.S. from flying through Russian airspace. China's airlines have a cost advantage, because Russia allows Chinese carriers to transit their airspace, but not U.S. ones.   \"You can make China accept your rise in tariffs. But you can't keep overwhelmingly pounding on China so hard,\" he said. \"China's retaliation is to show China and the world that the U.S. can't just keep us cornered,\" Zhu added.   NPR's Geoff Brumfiel contributed to this report. \n",

On the flight back to Washington, Trump told reporters traveling with him that he would rate the meeting with Xi \"a 12 out of 10.\"   \"It was an outstanding group of decisions I think that was made. A lot of decisions were made too, there wasn't too much left out there,\" Trump said.   \n   The decisions that were made included lowering tariffs on Chinese exports from 57% to 47% – which Trump said was because of Xi's commitment to decrease the flow of fentanyl.   \"I believe he's going to work very hard to stop the death that's coming in,\" Trump said.   China will also begin repurchasing soybeans from the U.S. The pause thus far has been detrimental to farmers.   Trump said China's decision from earlier this month to limit exports of rare earth minerals, which he called a \"roadblock,\" is now off the table for one year. As part of that agreement, the U.S. will also scale back some of its own export restrictions.   The White House has not yet released a full readout of the meeting or details on updates to the deal. Trump said he would visit China next April for another meeting with Xi, and Xi will visit the U.S. after that.   In response to the meeting, Beijing released its own statement, where Xi said China and the U.S. should not get \"caught in a vicious cycle of mutual retaliation.\"   The meeting took place in Busan before Trump left the region   Trump and Xi met at a South Korean military base in Busan right by the city's airport. The meeting began with a handshake before moving into a session with representatives from both countries.   \n   \"President Xi is a great leader of a great country, and I think we're going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time,\" Trump said at the top of the meeting, calling Xi a friend.

Not every topic was covered in the meeting   The two leaders discussed Russia's war in Ukraine, Trump said. China has been buying Russian oil but Trump said they didn't discuss that topic in depth.   Taiwan – an issue Trump has shied away from in recent days – also didn't come up, he said. China considers self-governing Taiwan a breakaway province and there have been signs from Trump that he might be willing to ease up support for the island.   \n   A deal on TikTok was also potentially a topic of discussion but Trump didn't mention it in his remarks to reporters after the meeting.   While flying on Air Force One back to Washington, Trump posted to his platform Truth Social that China also agreed to purchase American energy, and teased that the purchase would involve oil and gas from Alaska, though he didn't provide any further detail.   \"Chris Wright, Doug Burgum, and our respective Energy teams will be meeting to see if such an Energy Deal can be worked out,\" Trump said, referring to the secretary of energy and interior, respectively.\n",

See our full politics coverage, and follow NPR's Trump's Terms podcast or sign up for our Politics newsletter to stay up to date.   Who: Dr. Casey Means   Nominated for: Surgeon General   You might know her from: Casey Means is a wellness influencer, entrepreneur, and author. Last year, she published a bestselling book about diet and metabolic health Good Energy.   She coauthored the book with her older brother, Calley Means, who works for the Trump administration as a special government employee and is a close advisor to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.She did not complete her surgical residency and does not have an active medical license, which would be a major departure from past surgeon generals.She runs a company that promotes the use of continuous glucose monitors.She has described America as in \"spiritual crisis,\" questioned the childhood vaccine schedule and the use of birth control and has called out what she calls \"corruption\" at the FDA.   \n   What does this role do? Known as the nation's top doctor, the surgeon general leads the more than 6,000 members of the U.S. Public Health Service, which include physicians, nurses, and scientists working at various federal agencies.   The surgeon general serves in the Department of Health and Human Services and issues public advisories and reports to convey health information to the public.   What's expected at the hearing   It's been more than five months since Trump announced Casey Means would replace his initial choice, Fox News contributor Dr. Janette Nesheiwat.   She will be joining the senate hearing remotely, which is unusual. The Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee, which is holding the hearing, did not explain why she would be joining virtually. Her brother, Calley Means, shared in May that she was pregnant.   Senators will likely have tough questions for her about her qualifications and potential conflicts of interest. In financial filings released ahead of the hearing, Means committed to resigning from her continuous glucose monitor company if confirmed. She also disclosed financial ties to the supplement industry from which she promised to divest.   Means is 38 years old and a graduate of Stanford Medical School. She completed most of her residency training to be a head and neck surgeon, but quit before finishing.   \n   In the years since, she pivoted to what's known as functional medicine, a field that focuses on root causes of illness and often encompasses lifestyle change and alternative medicine approaches that are not always evidence-based.   She briefly had a functional medical practice in Oregon. But she did not become board certified and her Oregon medical license is currently listed as inactive.   Means grew her public profile on social media and through her book Good Energy. She did the rounds on big podcasts in the wellness space with her brother and coauthor Calley Means. Her message tends to echo Kennedy's and that of his allies in the Make American Healthy Again movement, especially in flagging the high rates of chronic illnesses in the U.S.   \"What we are dealing with here is so much more than a physical health crisis — this is a spiritual crisis,\" she said at a congressional roundtable led by Republicans last year.   She often talks about the U.S. food supply and environmental toxins and she criticizes the pharmaceutical industry. Kennedy has said she will be the greatest surgeon general ever.   Pushback on several fronts   There has been significant opposition against Means's confirmation from medical and public health experts. They point to her lack of leadership or clinical experience, something that surgeon generals traditionally have, and some of her views. For example, she has raised concerns about the safety of the childhood vaccine schedule and questioned hormonal birth control. She has also endorsed raw milk, as has Kennedy, who would be her boss.   \"The Senate's likely confirmation of Casey Means as Surgeon General, an individual who never completed medical training, would mark a disastrous precedent for the nation's top public health role,\" Dr. Jerome Adams wrote in a statement to NPR. Adams served as surgeon general in the first Trump administration.   \n   \"Numerous qualified candidates — fully trained, licensed physicians who champion prevention and wellness —could lead the 6,000-person [U.S. Public Health Service] with distinction,\" he added. \"Confirming Means reflects a capitulation to political pressures, not a desire to get the best person for the job.\"   Earlier this year, opposition to her nomination also emerged from some of Kennedy's MAHA supporters, partly out of concern that she wouldn't be critical enough of vaccines or carry forward other priorities of their movement.   Still, it seems unlikely that the Senate would have scheduled the hearing if the Trump White House weren't confident that Means could be confirmed. The withdrawal of previous health official nominations from this administration have all happened before a hearing took place.\n",

Musk has lofty ambitions for the new encyclopedia: His stated goal is to create \"an open source, comprehensive collection of all knowledge.\"   Critics and pundits are busy comparing the two sites and how they present a range of controversial topics. But we can also learn about some of their differences by asking a simple question: What do Wikipedia and Grokipedia say about each other?   \n   Searching for each other   A search for \"Wikipedia\" on Grokipedia yielded 6,047 results early Wednesday, a number that reflects both the work that's gone into Grokipedia and the challenge of competing with an encyclopedia that's been growing for nearly 25 years.   On Wikipedia, a search for \"Grokipedia\" returned 13 results.   Meanwhile, two days after its Monday launch, a search for \"Grokipedia\" on Grokipedia did not return a dedicated entry. Instead, the eight search results ranged from a general entry about online encyclopedias to seven entries primarily about Wikipedia.   Typing \"grokipedia\" into Grokipedia's URL to see if the new encyclopedia might have an entry that's not yet searchable returns a message: \"This page doesn't exist ... yet.\"   Bias and imitation   On its page about Wikipedia, Grokipedia says the site is renowned for its \"unprecedented scale, accessibility, and role in democratizing information.\" But Grokipedia also says Wikipedia is the subject of \"persistent criticisms regarding factual reliability, susceptibility to vandalism and hoaxes, and systemic ideological biases — particularly a left-leaning slant in coverage of political figures and topics.\"   \n   The lengthy article uses forms of the word \"bias\" dozens of times. It alleges that Wikipedia suffers from \"ideological skew\" to the left, and states that the site's preference for a neutral point of view drawn from reliable sources can instead reinforce narratives that \"align with institutional biases in academia and media.\"   On its page about Grokipedia, Wikipedia says that Musk \"positioned Grokipedia as an alternative to Wikipedia that would 'purge out the propaganda.'\" It also notes that Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger, who has become a critic of the long-running encyclopedia, welcomed Grokipedia's arrival.   \n   The Wikipedia article about Grokipedia highlights criticisms of the new site, such as media reports that Grokipedia's article about Elon Musk omits mention of the controversy over a gesture he made earlier this year \"which many viewed as resembling a Nazi salute.\" It also says critics allege Grokipedia promotes right-leaning views and relies too much on AI tools.   \n   Wikipedia also notes that Grokipedia seems to have pulled text from Wikipedia, stating, \"Some articles are nearly identical to their Wikipedia entries.\"   In some cases, Grokipedia duplicates Wikipedia content, as noted by media outlets and Wikipedia users. Grokipedia's page on \"buttocks,\" for instance, is virtually a copy of the Wikipedia page (albeit without images).   In that and similar cases, the articles acknowledge that their \"content was adapted from Wikipedia.\"   Musk said at the All-In Podcast conference in September that Grok was working to evaluate information from sources such as Wikipedia pages and then \"rewrite the page to … remove the falsehoods, correct the half-truths and add the missing context.\"   Like Wikipedia, Grokipedia users can see an article's edit history. But while Wikipedia users can directly edit a story, Grokipedia offers tools to ask questions and submit a correction.   \n   \"Wikipedia's knowledge is — and always will be — human,\" the Wikimedia Foundation said in a statement to NPR. Noting the site's ethos of open collaboration and consensus, it added, \"This human-created knowledge is what AI companies rely on to generate content; even Grokipedia needs Wikipedia to exist.\"   Nuts and bolts   Numbers rule the internet, and these two sites are fairly accurate about their rival's size, with some caveats.   Wikipedia, for instance, says that Grokipedia had \"about 900,000 AI-generated articles\" as of Oct. 28. That same day, Grokipedia's site said it had 885,279 articles available -- a figure published on its landing page. The Wikipedia entry for Grokipedia didn't reference that precise number, and it cited an article from the Indian financial news site Moneycontrol instead of Grokipedia's data -- perhaps to capture a historical record of a figure that will be updated. An editor later updated the citation to point to an Axios article.   \n   Grokipedia accurately states that as of October 2025, Wikipedia had more than 7 million articles in English, in the main entry about its older rival. But further down that page, the entry muddies the water a bit by stating that Wikipedia had \"over 6.8 million articles in English alone by October 2025.\"   According to Wikipedia's running count on the Size of Wikipedia page, the English site had more than 6.9 million articles as of January 2025.   Disclosure: NPR CEO Katherine Maher is the former CEO of the Wikimedia Foundation.\n",

So we'll see what happens.\"   Trump's job approval rating, as tracked by Gallup, is not in fact at a high point — though at 41% he isn't at his lowest point, either.   Saying \"we'll see what happens,\" is a standard Trump line that leaves his options open. Though, in this case, legal experts say there is no way around the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution.   \n   It states: \"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.\"   \n   \"There are many parts of the constitution that are unclear,\" said Rick Hassen, who specializes in election law at the University of California, Los Angeles. \"But the 22nd Amendment is quite clear: no more than two terms. And it was passed because there was a president who served more than two terms and the country thought that that was not good.\"   But that hasn't stopped Steve Bannon, an on-again off-again Trump ally and MAGA mastermind, from talking about a third Trump term as a certainty.   How Bannon stirred the pot   \"Well, he's going to get a third term,\" Bannon said in a recent interview with The Economist. \"Trump is going to be president in '28 and people just ought to get accommodated with that.\"   Asked about the Constitution, Bannon said, \"There's many different alternatives.\"   In an April interview with Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep, Bannon gave slightly more detail.   \"We're working on some things that are well inside the Constitution … and I think people will agree there will be very smart work arounds,\" Bannon said, before adding that talk of a third Trump term is \"exploding liberals heads, exploding progressive's heads that Trump's going to be with them forever.\"   \n   It would be easy to chalk this up as wishful thinking or even just trolling from a professional provocateur trying to ingratiate himself to Trump. But the president himself has kept it going, too.   Monday on Air Force One, when asked about Bannon's assertions about a third term, Trump said he would \"love to do it\" and again said it is \"very terrible\" to have such good numbers.   Asked if that meant he was \"not ruling it out,\" Trump said, \"You have to tell me.\"   \n   Though he also suggested that Republicans have a strong bench of potential 2028 candidates and said a ticket featuring Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio would be unbeatable. He did bat down one of the possible loopholes floating around — that he could run for vice president and then return to office after the elected president steps aside.   \"I think the people wouldn't like that,\" Trump said. \"It's too cute. It wouldn't be right.\"   But, just like Bannon, Trump leaves the option of somehow staying in office dangling out there.   What Congress has to say about that   Just outside the Oval Office, red campaign-style \"Trump 2028\" hats sit on a bookcase of merchandise the president shows off to visitors.   \n   Last month, when Democratic leaders visited the White House to talk about averting a government shutdown, the hats appeared on the resolute desk mid-meeting.    \"It was the strangest thing ever,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN afterward. \"I just looked at the hat, looked at JD Vance, who was seated to my left and said, 'Don't you got a problem with this?' And he said 'no comment' and that was the end of it.\"   That is, until the White House tweeted out photos of the meeting with the hats looming large.   As Trump talked repeatedly about a third term this week, members of Congress were asked to weigh in, too. House Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday he didn't see a path to a third Trump term because amending the Constitution takes a long time.   \"I think the president knows, and he and I have talked about the constrictions of the Constitution,\" said Johnson. \"As much as so many of the American people lament that. The Trump 2028 cap is one of the most popular that's ever been produced, and he has a good time with that, trolling the Democrats whose hair is on fire at that very prospect.\"   \n   In an interview with NPR's Here and Now on Wednesday, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin also said Trump was simply trolling.   \n   Brendan Nyhan, a government professor at Dartmouth College, says it doesn't really matter if at this moment the president is serious or not.   \"We are probably going to hear about it for the next three years, because he enjoys it,\" said Nyhan. \"It gets the kind of reaction he wants and it serves his political purpose.\"   Trump is both making liberal's heads explode — as Bannon put it — and trying to delay becoming a lame duck president, whose power wanes as the campaign to replace him heats up.   Nyhan said the fact that anyone is talking about it is a symptom of what he calls an \"authoritarian malaise\" in the country.   \"It's profoundly destabilizing to call into question something as blatant as the 22nd Amendment, which explicitly rules out what Trump is 'joking' about,\" said Nyhan, who leads Bright Line Watch, which monitors the status of American democracy. \"We've seen again and again him joking about things that he means to encourage or at least seems to give tacit approval to.\"   \n   In his second term, Trump has massively expanded his executive power, as Republicans in Congress largely either cheer or shrug.   \"Is it possible that he could try to suspend elections, suspend the Constitution, run for a third term,\" said Rick Hassen, who leads UCLA's Safeguarding Democracy Project.   \"All of these things are possible, but that means we are no longer the American democracy that we've had, and then the country's in real trouble. But if you're asking about a legal path to a third term, it's just not there.\"   Plus, he asked slyly, would Trump really want to run for a third term against former President Barack Obama? (Trump says he would.)   \n   NPR's Saige Miller contributed to this report.\n",

She said the pantry has seen increased need because of rising costs of goods over the last year. With SNAP benefits set to halt barring Congressional intervention, she expects to see \"a bunch of new people coming in.\"\n                \n                    Barbara Sprunt/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Barbara Sprunt/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Chris Jones and Mary Ann Edwards have been volunteering at the Llano Food Pantry in central Texas for several years. It's a tight-knit group, where food recipients gather early to chat outside, and community members contribute their own produce.   \"The ladies all come in and go, 'guess what I did with those plums I got last time?' We share recipes, we talk and it's like a big family,\" Edwards said.   Four years ago, the pantry was receiving 15-20 people each week. Now, they say, the number is about a hundred clients every week.   \"Right now — and we've been doing this for a while — we limit canned goods,\" said Jones. \"We didn't have to do that in the beginning because we didn't have that many people coming through.\"   \n   They said the past year has been tough for families, with rising food costs.   \"I think the telltale is that every time we're opening, we are getting new clients — maybe one, maybe two, maybe three,\" said Edwards. \"Just a steady increase. They come in, they're embarrassed — 'I never thought I would be in this position.' You know, a lot of people are in the same position you're in, and that's why we're here.\"   Their clientele is mainly young families, people with disabilities and the elderly. They said they don't see a lot of people who also receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Mary Ann Edwards (L) and Chris Jones (R) have been volunteering at the Llano food pantry in central Texas for years.

SNAP is a mandatory entitlement program that provides food aid to about 1 in 8 U.S. residents. It is the country's largest nutrition assistance program. Congressionally-approved appropriations provide the roughly $8 billion a month needed to fund the program. With the U.S. Senate repeatedly failing to get enough votes to fund the government and end the shutdown, nearly 42 million people are in danger of losing those benefits come Nov. 1.   Jones said they'll have to take it one week at a time.   \n   \"If we need to, we'll do a fundraiser,\" she said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Anthony Bryant, a volunteer with Feeding South Florida, prepares food items to give to government workers on October 28, 2025 in Dania Beach, Florida. As the government shutdown nears four weeks, Feeding America and its members have been launching food distribution sites for people affected by the government shutdown.\n                \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Joe Raedle/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   'Catastrophic need for food'   The Llano pantry is part of the Central Texas Food Bank, which has been ramping up distributions in the midst of the government shutdown, including for active duty military personnel and civilian federal employees like TSA agents.   \"We've been saying that although the government has shut down, the Central Texas Food Bank is open and that means we will do everything we can to step up and meet the demand for increased need of our services,\" said CEO Sari Vatske.   But Vatske cautioned that food banks alone cannot make up for what would be lost for residents if SNAP were to disappear.   \"The average household that we see receives about $350 per month, which roughly translates to about $44 million worth of SNAP benefits that will be gone from families,\" she told NPR. \"There is no way that we alone can make up for a $44 million food budget shortfall.\"   She said shutdowns aren't like other food crises.   \"When you see natural disasters, they tend to be isolated, whether it's an ice storm or a flood. But the thing with the government shutdown is that it's manmade and we are all experiencing it,\" Vatske said. \"So in a situation during a natural disaster where we could rely on our sister food banks for support, with this government shutdown, we are all experiencing the same need. So we implore the government to reopen and we are asking the community to step up now more than ever.\"   Vatske said seeing the increasing demand and knowing benefits might be taken away adds to the toll food bank volunteers and staffers face.   \"The thing that motivates food bankers is knowing that we are a beacon of light in an otherwise dark place,\" she said. \"We're really at a point that the helpers need help.\"   \n   Jason Riggs, the director of advocacy and public policy at Roadrunner Food Bank of New Mexico, began working at the food bank during the Great Recession.   \"The absolute worst part of working at a food bank is when you gotta tell people, 'that's all we got today. We're out.' And you know you can't send them anywhere because they're going to be out, too,\" he said. \"Now, don't get me wrong, it's far worse for the people waiting in that line. But, I worry about my co-workers.\"   If SNAP benefits are gone for November, Riggs said it will be a \"public health crisis.\" He compared it to the recession 17 years ago and the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.   \"This is a huge increase in need, but that's where comparisons end,\" he told NPR. \"Those two previous national crises, when that happened, there was a robust SNAP program, with all its flaws, doing what it is designed to do. And that's the difference with what's happening right now — there will not be SNAP. There will just be the same kind of catastrophic need for food.\"   New Mexico has about 21 percent of its population participate in SNAP, the highest rate in the country, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's statistics from earlier this year.   \"It's very difficult. It's not like we were holding back before,\" Riggs said. \"Then this crisis comes in and it's very daunting. SNAP can provide nine times the amount of meals as the entire nationwide food bank network. There's no business in the country, no corporation that could grow nine times its size or capacity in one year, let alone by Nov. 1.\"   With the impasse on Capitol Hill growing seemingly deeper the longer the shutdown continues, individual states are investigating what they can offer to help bridge the food assistance gap.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) speaks to reporters during a vote at the Capitol on October 27. Hawley introduced a bill that would provide appropriations for the Department of Agriculture to provide SNAP benefits during any lapse because of the shutdown.\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   Political fallout   Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican, has introduced a bill that would provide appropriations for the Department of Agriculture to provide SNAP benefits during any lapse because of the shutdown. That bill currently has ten GOP co-sponsors and one Democratic co-sponsor, Peter Welch of Vermont. There's no commitment from leadership to bring it up for a vote, yet.   \n   Even if the government acts before Nov. 1, it will likely take at least a few days to get SNAP benefits distributed to states, and then onto debit-like cards that recipients use to purchase food.   In the meantime, more than two dozen Democratic attorneys general and three Democratic governors are suing the Trump administration over the suspension of food benefits.   As the shutdown drags on, both parties seem convinced they will receive less of the public blame.   But Rich Thau, president of Engagious, a firm specializing in public policy message testing, said what he's hearing from the public is \"a pox on both your houses.\"   As part of his swing voter project, Thau talks monthly with voters in key swing states who swung from former President Joe Biden to President Trump. In a recent focus group in Pennsylvania, Thau said nine of the 13 participants blamed both parties equally for the shutdown.   \"When I turn the news on, I hear, 'the Republicans are blaming the Democrats. The Democrats are blaming the Republicans,'\" said Brenda S., 60, a participant from Philadelphia, PA whose last name was not provided in the focus group setting, as is common practice for these surveys. \"It's both of their faults. They don't care about us.\"   The SNAP cliff represents one of the biggest impacts of the shutdown, which has been marked by the White House attempting to stave off some of the traditional shutdown pain points, like paychecks for servicemembers.   If SNAP benefits are delayed for the month of November, Thau said he does not know which party is more able to build a compelling narrative about why lawmakers couldn't reach a deal and fund the government.   \"Who's going to sound more persuasive to someone when it comes to who's to blame for this?\" he told NPR. \"If you're a member of Congress, you don't want your constituents starving because you can't reopen the government. But by the same token, if you think that this is a winnable fight and you're in no rush to reopen the government because somehow you think your side is winning — and if both sides feel that way — the inertia will continue.\"   \n   He added: \"I imagine each side has some strategy that causes them to think the other side is going to blink first. But they're playing with fire.\"\n",

Today's top stories   Today, President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met and reached an agreement on several points in trade negotiations. Trump announced the U.S. would lower the 20% tariffs to 10% because China has committed to doing more to curb exports of ingredients for fentanyl. China will defer export controls on rare earths and resume buying U.S. soybeans. U.S. and Chinese economic officials ironed out the trade details in Malaysia last weekend.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping shake hands as they depart after a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on Oct. 30 in Busan, South Korea. Trump is meeting Xi for the first time since taking office for his second term, following months of growing tension between the two countries.\n                \n                    Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Xi and Trump met on the sideline of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea. Trump said he didn't come to South Korea for APEC or Korean issues, but to meet with the Chinese leader. On social media, Trump posted that the U.S. would resume testing nuclear weapons \"on an equal basis\" with Russia and China. NPR's Anthony Kuhn clarifies to Up First that while Russia and China are upgrading and expanding their nuclear arsenals, neither country has tested atomic bombs since the 1990s. Kuhn adds that Xi has not responded to Trump's statement, but \"couldn't have liked it much.\" Kuhn says if Trump's announcement was to try to pressure China into a conversation about arms control, it could have the opposite effect and result in an arms race.   \n   More than 65,000 infants, toddlers and preschoolers could lose access to their local Head Start centers across the U.S. beginning Nov. 1 because of the government shutdown. The federal program provides childcare and early learning for low-income families.    🎧 Without federal dollars, 134 Head Start programs are rushing to find alternative funding, NPR's Cory Turner says. If the programs close, many working families may have to choose between going to work and taking care of their children. Corey Holcomb, who runs a Head Start program in Michigan, told Turner that her agency secured two more weeks of funding by pulling from other resources with the hopes that they will be reimbursed. They've also asked for deferments on some bills.   Trump's pick for Surgeon General, Casey Means, will have her confirmation hearing in front of a Senate committee today. The president announced that Means would replace his initial choice, a Fox News contributor, more than five months ago. Means is a wellness influencer and entrepreneur. Last year, she published the bestselling book Good Energy. Here's what to watch for during the hearing.    🎧 NPR's Will Stone says the hearing is somewhat unusual because it will be held virtually, and Means will join remotely. Stone says he expects that she will be grilled about her qualifications and potential conflicts of interest. Some medical and public health professionals have pushed back on Means' confirmation. They have highlighted her lack of qualifications, and note that she dropped out of her surgical residency and does not have an active medical license. Critics argue that Means doesn't possess the leadership or clinical experience typically expected from the surgeon general, who is regarded as the nation's top doctor.   \n   Deep dive   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Over the past year, many federal law enforcement agents conducting immigration arrests have been concealing their faces under masks and vehicles being used in what appear to be immigration-related arrests do not have license plates.\n                \n                    Getty Images, Tik tok, Eyes Up\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Getty Images, Tik tok, Eyes Up\n    \n\n   \n   In the past year, many federal law enforcement agents conducting immigration arrests have hidden their identities. They have not only concealed their faces but have also masked their vehicles. NPR discovered through a review of videos that the vehicles used by officers during immigration-related arrests sometimes lacked license plates or had plates that were swapped out from their originals. Immigration advocates say that as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement increases its presence across the U.S., untraceable vehicles may add to confusion over what tactics its officers can or should be using, and could prevent people from holding officers accountable for their actions.    🚨 ICE spokesperson Mike Alvarez informed NPR that federal regulations require government vehicles to display license plates on both the front and rear. However, this requirement can be waived if showing the plates would interfere with investigative, law enforcement, intelligence, or security operations.🚨 Some states prohibit swapping license plates on vehicles. However, photos taken by activists and videos shared on social media suggest that some federal agents are doing it anyway. Some activists have also spotted vehicles with a license plate on the front of a vehicle that doesn't match the one on the back.🚨 In Washington and Illinois, some videos shared on social media show federal agents making arrests in vehicles marked with Mexican objects or icons. When asked about this tactic, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said that the agency believes its employees are not camouflaging their identities.

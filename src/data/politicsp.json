And counterparts in Illinois, New York, Colorado and Minnesota filed a lawsuit yesterday against the Trump administration for cutting off that money - some $10 billion. And last night, a judge temporarily reinstated that money that the administration says it still wants to freeze while it looks for fraud. Mawa Iqbal from member station WBEZ has some of the reaction from Illinois.MAWA IQBAL, BYLINE: Illinois is no stranger to the Trump administration withholding federal dollars from funding for after-school programming to now social services for lower-income children and families. Democratic Governor JB Pritzker, who's never been shy about his disdain for the president, says this recent freeze, much like the others, is purely political.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JB PRITZKER: They picked five states to cut off funding for. All of them are run by Democratic governors that he doesn't like.IQBAL: The move by the administration comes in response to investigations of social service fraud in Minnesota. Illinois stands to lose funding that would go towards administering the Child Care Development Fund, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and the Social Services Block Grant. And while it's unclear when that money would stop coming in, especially now that the issue is in court, some advocates are already feeling the pressure.IRETA GASNER: There's such an unmet need to really fund early care and learning already on our best day.IQBAL: Ireta Grasner (ph) heads the state policy team at Start Early, an Illinois chapter of the federal Head Start program.GASNER: These kinds of pressures are very real because we have a long way to go to, you know, having more families who really can use these supports at this really critical stage of life.IQBAL: In a letter to Governor Pritzker about the funding cuts, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services says it's concerned about potential extensive and systemic fraud and that it has reason to believe that Illinois is providing aid, quote, \"intended for American citizens\" to those without legal status. HHS is demanding the, quote, \"complete universe\" of documents containing Illinoians' personal information, like Social Security numbers and home addresses. HHS did not respond to requests for comment on the story.KWAME RAOUL: The real motivation behind this action is to punish Democrat-led states.IQBAL: Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul says the claims are cruel and baseless and is why he and his fellow attorneys general are turning to the courts.RAOUL: If the president was serious about rooting out fraud, his administration would be investing more resources in partnering with states and supporting states' efforts to root out fraud and abuse.IQBAL: He says the move would affect more than 150,000 children in the state who rely on these programs for everything from nutrition to child care.RAOUL: The effects of this action are far-reaching and dangerous. For Illinois alone, the president's action threatens around $1 billion that Illinois families and service providers are counting on.IQBAL: Republican leaders in the state haven't come out publicly on either side of the issue, like with many actions the president has taken against the state. A judge has reinstated the funding for two weeks, but a longer court battle is sure to play out over the fate of these programs.For NPR News, I'm Mawa Iqbal in Springfield, Illinois.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

Officials also point, without evidence, to immigrants as the primary drivers of the fraud.   Late Friday a district judge in New York blocked the funding freeze for now.   Public policy experts say the structure of U.S. safety-net programs does create opportunity for scammers, and more could be done to tackle that. At the same time, there's concern that the Trump administration's mounting drumbeat of unfounded fraud allegations could undermine public trust in a system that millions of people rely on.   \n   The issue gained traction late last month after right-wing media influencer Nick Shirley alleged corruption at Somali American owned daycare centers in Minnesota. Even though his accusations were unsubstantiated they've fueled a political firestorm. They also focused renewed attention on a massive years-long benefits scandal in Minnesota that's already seen more than 60 people convicted and dozens of others charged.   Here's a look at some of the issues.   Accusations of benefit fraud are as old as the programs themselves   The first major American social welfare program was pensions for Civil War veterans, \"and that likewise was associated with a lot of accusations of fraud and mismanagement by the government,\" says public policy expert Don Moynihan at the University of Michigan.    He says longstanding tropes around welfare fraud persist today, along with actual fraud, but the Trump administration is politicizing the issue.   The extent of benefits fraud is not known since presumably not all criminal behavior is caught. But \"the bottom line is there are billions and billions of dollars that are lost by taxpayers to improper payments, including fraud, every year,\" says Matt Weidinger, who studies poverty at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and has worked on unemployment benefits policy.   Most fraud is by providers or outside scammers, not as much by recipients. Individuals who have been convicted of such fraud are overwhelmingly U.S. citizens. In fact, undocumented immigrant workers pay billions into Social Security every year, effectively subsidizing a program they will never collect from.   \n   Wrongdoing occurs despite required procedures to prevent it, along with investigations by inspectors general, state audits, and criminal prosecutions.   The structure of the U.S. safety net creates opportunities for fraud   It's common for states to administer programs with federal money, which Weidinger says undermines their incentive to be \"super vigilant.\"   \"This is the same reason why you don't wash rental cars, right? It really belongs to somebody else,\" he says.   He notes there are also more than 80 federal social service programs for low-income people, a sprawling network that is confusing for people who need help and \"too complicated to efficiently administer.\"   \n   A lot of benefits also flow through private contractors for services already performed. Moynihan says this reflects an American desire for smaller government, but comes with a trade-off.   \"Once you make that choice, then that also invites more opportunities for bad apples to engage in fraud,\" he says. \"Government then has to do more to monitor that behavior to try to prevent it.\"   Democrats say Trump aims to \"punish\" them, not actually address fraud    The Trump administration has specifically alleged \"extensive and systematic fraud\" in five Democratic-led states: California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York. Letters sent to each this week say there is \"reason to believe\" they are \"illicitly providing illegal aliens\" with benefits, although the administration has offered no evidence of any ongoing fraud.   \"For too long, Democrat-led states and Governors have been complicit in allowing massive amounts of fraud to occur under their watch,\" said Department of Health and Human Services spokesman Andrew Nixon in a statement to NPR. \"Under the Trump Administration, we are ensuring that federal taxpayer dollars are being used for legitimate purposes. We will ensure these states are following the law and protecting hard-earned taxpayer money.\"   \n   In all, the agency is seeking to withhold $10 billion in cash aid, childcare subsidies, and other social services for low-income families until states provide a large amount of data – going back years – on recipients, providers, and anti-fraud measures.   The five Democratic-led states have filed suit arguing the funding freeze is unlawful and violates congressional authority over spending. In a press conference Friday, New York Attorney General Letitia James called the move cruel and said it was about \"punishing Democratic states that oppose the President.\"   California Attorney General Rob Bonta compared it to the pause in SNAP food aid during the recent federal shutdown, saying it amounts to \"a political attack on the most vulnerable in our society.\"   \n   Fraud happens in every state, blue and red, says researcher Weidinger, because criminals \"will find weakness wherever it is.\"   One massive recent scandal over cash aid was in Mississippi. In December 2024 the Biden administration notified the state it must pay back $101 million in welfare money that was misspent. Last year the Trump administration rescinded that penalty letter, agreeing to the state's request for more time.\n",

The large-scale strikes, conducted by the U.S. alongside partner forces, occurred around 12:30 p.m. ET, according to U.S. Central Command. The strikes hit multiple Islamic State targets across Syria.   Saturday's strikes are part of a broader operation that is part of President Donald Trump's response to the deadly ISIS attack that killed Sgt. Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar, Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard, and Ayad Mansoor Sakat, the civilian interpreter, in Palmyra last month.   \n   \"Our message remains strong: if you harm our warfighters, we will find you and kill you anywhere in the world, no matter how hard you try to evade justice,\" U.S. Central Command said in a statement Saturday.   A day earlier, Syrian officials said their security forces had arrested the military leader of IS's operations in the Levant.   The U.S. military said Saturday's strikes were carried out alongside partner forces without specifying which forces had taken part.   The Trump administration is calling the response to the Palmyra attacks Operation Hawkeye Strike. Both Torres-Tovar and Howard were members of the Iowa National Guard.   It launched Dec. 19 with another large-scale strike that hit 70 targets across central Syria that had IS infrastructure and weapons.   The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces has for years been the U.S.'s main partner in the fight against IS in Syria, but since the ouster of former Syrian President Bashar Assad in December 2024, Washington has increasingly been coordinating with the central government in Damascus.   Syria recently joined the global coalition against IS.\n",

At least 1,000 events across the U.S. were planned for Saturday and Sunday, according to Indivisible, a progressive grassroots coalition of activists helping coordinate the movement it calls \"ICE Out For Good Weekend of Action.\"   Leah Greenberg, a co-executive director of Indivisible, said people are coming together to \"grieve, honor those we've lost, and demand accountability from a system that has operated with impunity for far too long.\"   \n   \"Renee Nicole Good was a wife, a mother of three, and a member of her community. She, and the dozens of other sons, daughters, friends, siblings, parents, and community members who have been killed by ICE, should be alive today,\" Greenberg said in a statement on Friday. \"ICE's violence is not a statistic, it has names, families, and futures attached to it, and we refuse to look away or stay silent.\"   Large crowds of demonstrators carried signs and shouted \"ICE out now!\" as protests continued across Minneapolis on Saturday. One of those protestors, Cameron Kritikos, told NPR that he is worried that the presence of more ICE agents in the city could lead to more violence or another death.   \"If more ICE officers are deployed to the streets, especially a place here where there's very clear public opposition to the terrorizing of our neighborhoods, I'm nervous that there's going to be more violence,\" the 31-year grocery store worker said. \"I'm nervous that there are going to be more clashes with law enforcement officials, and at the end of the day I think that's not what anyone wants.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Demonstrators in Minneapolis on Saturday.\n                \n                    Sergio Martínez-Beltrán/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Sergio Martínez-Beltrán/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   The night before, hundreds of city and state police officers responded to a \"noise protest\" in downtown Minneapolis. An estimated 1,000 people gathered Friday night, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara, and 29 people were arrested.   \n   People demonstrated outside of hotels where ICE agents were believed to be staying. They chanted, played drums and banged pots. O'Hara said that a group of people split from the main protest and began damaging hotel windows. One police officer was injured from a chunk of ice that was hurled at officers, he added.   Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey condemned the acts of violence but praised what he said was the \"vast majority\" of protesters who remained peaceful, during a morning news conference.   \n   \"To anyone who causes property damage or puts others in danger: you will be arrested. We are standing up to Donald Trump's chaos not with our own brand of chaos, but with care and unity,\" Frey wrote on social media.   Commenting on the protests, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told NPR in a statement, \"the First Amendment protects speech and peaceful assembly — not rioting, assault and destruction,\" adding, \"DHS is taking measures to uphold the rule of law and protect public safety and our officers.\"   \n   Good was fatally shot the day after DHS launched a large-scale immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota set to deploy 2,000 immigration officers to the state.   In Philadelphia, police estimated about 500 demonstrators \"were cooperative and peaceful\" at a march that began Saturday morning at City Hall, Philadelphia Police Department spokesperson Tanya Little told NPR in a statement. And no arrests were made.   In Portland, Ore., demonstrators rallied and lined the streets outside of a hospital on Saturday afternoon, where immigration enforcement agents bring detainees who are injured during an arrest, reported Oregon Public Broadcasting.   A man and woman were shot and injured by U.S. Border Patrol agents on Thursday in the city. DHS said the shooting happened during a targeted vehicle stop and identified the driver as Luis David Nino-Moncada, and the passenger as Yorlenys Betzabeth Zambrano-Contreras, both from Venezuela. As was the case in their assertion about Good's fatal shooting, Homeland Security officials claimed the federal agent acted in self-defense after Nino-Moncada and Zambrano-Contreras \"weaponized their vehicle.\"\n",

I'll be honest, it didn't take long for the fresh, excited energy I was trying to bring into 2026 to be quashed. (But maybe that's on me — I forgot to put \"attack a foreign country and seize its leader with only the murkiest of communications about what might come next\" on my \"out\" list this year.)   \n   But this week, I want to talk about two other stories that, when juxtaposed, paint a striking picture of how some people are grappling with life under the second Trump administration.   First, a kind of ridiculous one: the petitions to deport Nicki Minaj.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Nicki Minaj arrives at the MTV Video Music Awards on Sept. 12, 2023, at the Prudential Center in Newark, N.J. (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP, File)\n                \n                    Evan Agostini/Evan Agostini/Invision/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Evan Agostini/Evan Agostini/Invision/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Have you all heard about this? More than 120,000 people have signed petitions calling for the rapper cum right wing political activist to be deported to her home country of Trinidad. Minaj was brought to the U.S. by her parents as a young child, and has spoken in the past about not being a U.S. citizen. And in recent months, she's angered large portions of her fan base by praising Donald Trump and the broader MAGA movement, after being outspokenly against the first Trump administration's family separation policies. (There's a whole lot of other stuff people don't like about Minaj, which you can read about here.) One of the petitions asserts that deporting her \"would serve as a reminder that public figures need to be accountable for their words and the broader impact they have on diverse communities.\"   I read about all that a day before an ICE officer shot and killed a woman, Renee Nicole Good, in Minneapolis.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A makeshift memorial honoring the victim of a fatal shooting involving federal law enforcement agents is taped to a post near the site of the previous day's shooting, Thursday, Jan. 8, 2026, in Minneapolis, Minn. (AP Photo/Mike Householder)\n                \n                    Mike Householder/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mike Householder/AP\n    \n\n   \n   There are, predictably, diverging accounts of what led to the shooting. The federal government says that it was an act of self-defense against Good, who they allege was attempting to drive her car into ICE agents. State and local officials are, quite literally, calling bull****. The mayor of Minneapolis described the event as \"an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.\" He then, uh, politely requested that ICE \"get the f*** out of Minneapolis.\" There is likely to be weeks of fallout as the federal and local governments clash over the continued presence of ICE in Minnesota, and the repercussions of Wednesday's violence.   \n   So what do these stories have to do with each other? To me, they illustrate the contradictions that come up when people try to cherry pick applications of the law. The signers of the Nicki Minaj deportation petitions seem to be deeply offended by her embrace of the Trump administration. (\"If [Minaj] believes in supporting the agenda that all illegal immigrants should be deported no matter what they bring to this beautiful country then what is good for the goose is good for the gander. Good riddance homophobic Nicki,\" one petitioner commented.) But in calling for her deportation, they are tacitly accepting a key bit of MAGA logic — that a person's political ideology can and should be grounds for their removal.   If you accept that, then you may also have to accept that deporting people is something that requires a force of agents — agents whose job is to remove people from the country. Not just people who offend their fans.   Audre Lorde famously wrote that \"the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house. They may allow us temporarily to beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change.\" It may have felt fun for some people to feel like they were giving Nicki Minaj a taste of her own MAGA-flavored medicine by calling out her immigration status. But if those people are genuinely concerned about how Trump's policies are affecting everyday people, their rage should potentially be focused more at the underlying structures of the administration than at one of its minor mouthpieces.\n",

But the death toll in the protests has grown, while 2,600 others have been detained, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.   Meanwhile, Iran's parliament speaker warned the U.S. military and Israel would be \"legitimate targets\" if America strikes the Islamic Republic, as threatened by President Donald Trump. Qalibaf made the threat as lawmakers rushed the dais in the Iranian parliament, shouting: \"Death to America!\"   \n   Those abroad fear the information blackout will embolden hard-liners within Iran's security services to launch a bloody crackdown, despite warnings from Trump he's willing to strike the Islamic Republic to protect peaceful demonstrators.   \n   Trump offered support for the protesters, saying on social media that \"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!\" The New York Times and Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous U.S. officials, said on Saturday night that Trump had been given military options for a strike on Iran, but hadn't made a final decision.   The State Department separately warned: \"Do not play games with President Trump. When he says he'll do something, he means it.\"   Parliament rallies   Iranian state television broadcast the parliament session live. Qalibaf, a hard-liner who has run for the presidency in the past, gave a speech applauding police and Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, particularly its all-volunteer Basij, for having \"stood firm\" during the protests.   \"The people of Iran should know that we will deal with them in the most severe way and punish those who are arrested,\" Qalibaf said.   He went on to directly threaten Israel, \"the occupied territory\" as he referred to it, and the U.S. military, possibly with a preemptive strike.   \n   \"In the event of an attack on Iran, both the occupied territory and all American military centers, bases and ships in the region will be our legitimate targets,\" Qalibaf said. \"We do not consider ourselves limited to reacting after the action and will act based on any objective signs of a threat.\"   It remains unclear just how serious Iran is about launching a strike, particularly after seeing its air defenses destroyed during the 12-day war in June with Israel. Any decision to go to war would rest with Iran's 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.   The U.S. military has said in the Mideast it is \"postured with forces that span the full range of combat capability to defend our forces, our partners and allies and U.S. interests.\"   Protests in Tehran and Mashhad   Online videos sent out of Iran, likely using Starlink satellite transmitters, purportedly showed demonstrators gathering in northern Tehran's Punak neighborhood. There, it appeared authorities shut off streets, with protesters waving their lit mobile phones. Others banged metal while fireworks went off.   Other footage purportedly showed demonstrators peacefully marching down a street and others honking their car horns on the street.   In Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city, some 725 kilometers (450 miles) northeast of Tehran, footage purported to show protesters confronting security forces. Flaming debris and dumpsters could be seen in the street, blocking the road. Mashhad is home to the Imam Reza shrine, the holiest in Shiite Islam, making the protests there carry heavy significance for the country's theocracy.   Protests also appeared to happen in Kerman, 800 kilometers (500 miles) southeast of Tehran.   Iranian state television on Sunday morning took a page from demonstrators, having their correspondents appear on streets in several cities to show calm areas with a date stamp shown on screen. Tehran and Mashhad were not included. They also showed pro-government demonstrations in Qom and Qazvin.   \n   Khamenei has signaled a coming clampdown, despite U.S. warnings. Tehran escalated its threats Saturday, with Iran's attorney general, Mohammad Movahedi Azad, warning that anyone taking part in protests will be considered an \"enemy of God,\" a death-penalty charge. The statement carried by Iranian state television said even those who \"helped rioters\" would face the charge.   More demonstrations planned Sunday   Iran's theocracy cut off the nation from the internet and international telephone calls on Thursday, though it allowed some state-owned and semiofficial media to publish. Qatar's state-funded Al Jazeera news network reported live from Iran, but they appeared to be the only major foreign outlet able to work.   Iran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, who called for protests Thursday and Friday, asked in his latest message for demonstrators to take to the streets Saturday and Sunday. He urged protesters to carry Iran's old lion-and-sun flag and other national symbols used during the time of the shah to \"claim public spaces as your own.\"   Pahlavi's support of and from Israel has drawn criticism in the past — particularly after the 12-day war. Demonstrators have shouted in support of the shah in some protests, but it isn't clear whether that's support for Pahlavi himself or a desire to return to a time before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.   The demonstrations began Dec. 28 over the collapse of the Iranian rial currency, which trades at over 1.4 million to $1, as the country's economy is squeezed by international sanctions in part levied over its nuclear program. The protests intensified and grew into calls directly challenging Iran's theocracy.\n",

And this week, employees at the San Francisco Immigration Court got an email telling them their doors would soon be closing. NPR's immigration policy correspondent Ximena Bustillo joins us. Ximena, thanks so much for being with us.XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Hi, Scott.SIMON: What do we know about the situation in San Francisco?BUSTILLO: The court has shrunk to a quarter of its size over the past year. It now has five judges, counting the supervisor. This is one of the courts the Trump administration has most restructured in the last year. According to our account, 12 judges were fired from the San Francisco Court last year. Other judges retired or have resigned. Some of these judges who were fired were newer, in their two-year probationary period of federal government work, but several were tenured and had worked as immigration judges for years.Earlier this week, court personnel received a short email letting them know that the building's lease was not being renewed and will close by January 2027. The Justice Department told me that they have determined that this was cost-effective for them. The court has 120,000 immigration cases there as of September.SIMON: Which is a lot. What happens to those cases?BUSTILLO: The cases and any remaining employees are expected to be transferred to the Concord Immigration Court, about 30 miles away. But one thing here is that Concord opened just two years ago, and the point of that court was to help San Francisco. San Francisco was considered one of the busiest immigration courts in the country, hearing cases even as far out as Oregon and throughout Northern California.SIMON: Does this seem to help the Trump administration's goal of streamlining deportations?BUSTILLO: Last year, the Trump administration expanded the scope of who could be both detained and deported quickly. Immigration lawyers told me their clients are now facing this risk, when normally, they'd be protected from detention while their cases are pending. Having fewer courts doesn't necessarily mean people will be greenlit for faster deportations, but it might mean the backlogs grow, and more people are at risk while in legal limbo.SIMON: And this is hardly the only change we're seeing in immigration courts this year, right?BUSTILLO: Right. The other thing that we're seeing is a push to militarize the immigration court system and depicting it as a place of punishment. The DOJ's own hiring campaign calls these positions deportation judges, not immigration judges. And the DOJ is expected to bring on more military lawyers as temporary immigration judges this month. Immigrant advocates tell me that this at least gives the perception that the goal of these judges is to deport, as opposed to weighing a case on its merits and seeing if someone deserves relief from deportation.SIMON: And, Ximena, based on your reporting, what other changes might we expect?BUSTILLO: There's expected to be a new cohort of military lawyers beginning their training just this month to be used as temporary immigration judges, though it's unclear where exactly they will be working. But it seems that the Trump administration will continue their newer trend of firing judges who have immigration judge experience. The immigration courts say that they're expecting to bring on new classes of immigration judges at least every quarter, so there will be questions about who they're bringing on and how they're being trained.SIMON: NPR's immigration policy correspondent, Ximena Bustillo.

    "body": "\n      President Trump seems to have settled on a provocative playbook for his second go-around in the White House.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  The state of Minnesota is conducting its own investigation into Wednesday's fatal shooting by ICE Officer Jonathan Ross of motorist Renée Good. This after - the - this is after the FBI excluded Minnesota authorities from its investigation on Thursday. Vice President Vance said that federal agents have, quote, \"absolute immunity.\" Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty responded yesterday.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARY MORIARTY: I can't speak to why the Trump administration is doing what it's doing or says what it says. I can say that the ICE officer does not have complete immunity here.SIMON: We will hear from Minnesotans and track down developments in the case elsewhere on the program today. NPR's senior contributor Ron Elving joins us now. Ron, thanks so much for being with us.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.SIMON: From your vantage point and years of experience as an observer on the national political landscape, what stands out to you here?ELVING: Once again, we are confronted with facts that seem quite clear, at least from one's own perspective. But then we see these facts presented in an entirely different light by those with a distinctly different perspective, such as the president. So millions have seen the video of Renée Good trying to get away from Officer Jonathan Ross, but the president said Good ran the officer over. There is no tape that shows that, but there are angles that suggest she may have grazed him, and it is possible to imagine an officer under these circumstances, believing he's about to be struck. So it surely looks bad at the same time for the federal government to refuse to include Minnesota officials in the investigation. And there's a suggestion there that the state is untrustworthy or that the feds do not trust their own case unless they control the investigation themselves.SIMON: And there are calls in Congress, mainly from Democrats, to rein in ICE during the appropriations process. Given some other votes just recently that saw Republicans depart from the administration, are you seeing any daylight growing between congressional Republicans and President Trump?ELVING: Maybe a glimmer on these ICE raids. They are costly and they provoke confrontations and violence. We have seen more Republican resistance to Trump this month. So in Congress voted to extend the expiring subsidies for Obamacare. Some want a vote before Trump takes more military action, and many wanted to do more to honor the police who defended the Capitol on January 6. But by and large, the party is still with Trump on immigration.SIMON: Ron, of course, President Trump was quite blunt in his threats to Nicolás Maduro, yet the attack was still a surprise to really most everybody. President Trump has also been very plain about his threats to Iran and, for that matter, Greenland. Do - should we expect more surprises?ELVING: We should be shocked if there are not more surprises, Scott. This is part of the playbook now. Trump has said he regards being unpredictable as smart strategy. And we have Trump's chief of policy adviser, Stephen Miller, who was a lesser figure in the first term, but built his relationship with Trump after that. We now see him speaking for the president, not just on domestic policy, but on international issues and events as well. Most recently, that's meant threatening to take over Greenland and refusing to take military force off the table.SIMON: This week marks five years since the attempt to stop the ratification of the 2020 election. The House Judiciary Committee says that it wants former Special Counsel Jack Smith to testify as soon as this month. We should note there's already testimony that's publicly available by him, isn't it?ELVING: Yes. Smith testified to a House committee behind closed doors December 17, and the video was just released on New Year's Eve. And we can hear why the committee was wary of this tape. The voice you hear here is the prosecutor's.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JACK SMITH: President Trump was, by a large measure, the most culpable and most responsible person in this conspiracy. These crimes were committed for his benefit. The attack that happened at the Capitol as part of this case does not happen without him.ELVING: Listening to that, you know, I'm reminded, Scott, of the words of Senator Mitch McConnell, who was the Republican leader in the Senate, speaking on the floor of the Senate after the January 6 events. It was all very clear to him then, and Jack Smith makes it clear again.SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving. Thanks so much.ELVING: Thank you, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

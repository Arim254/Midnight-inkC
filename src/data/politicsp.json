    "body": "\n      Now that the Affordable Care Act subsidies have expired, NPR's Leila Fadel speaks with Democratic Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont about the future of the ACA.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, BYLINE: The enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies have expired. On the first day of 2026, that is a fact. But there's still a little hope for people relying on these health care tax credits since a retroactive extension could be passed this year. Joining us to talk about this is Senator Peter Welch, a Democrat representing Vermont. He has been pushing to extend these health care tax credits. Welcome to the program, Senator Welch.PETER WELCH: Thank you.FADEL: We've reported pretty consistently that insurance premiums are expected to increase significantly. What other consequences can Americans expect from these subsidies ending?WELCH: Well, the most significant is anybody - a small business, a farmer - whether they're in a Republican or a Democratic district, is going to get hammered. So a farmer in Vermont, their premium is going to go from 900 a month to $3,200 a month. So they're going to really face sticker shock. There's going to be a secondary impact because the hospitals, particularly in rural areas, are going to lose revenue because folks are going to show up to get care and not have any way to pay for it. So there'll be a ripple effect here, both immediate on the families who have to make a tough call - do they try to scrape together the money that they don't have? - and then on the institutions in our rural communities that are so important to us.FADEL: Now, Vermont seems to be one of the states that will see the highest premium increases. What are your constituents saying to you?WELCH: They're really terrified. I mean, the affordability issues that every American is facing - with rising utility bills, health care bills are a big part of it, groceries - this is really one where, in addition to the expense, it imposes an immense amount of insecurity. You know, a mother that I was talking to, with two kids, said she doesn't know what to do. She feels totally irresponsible not to have health care, but it's totally impossible for her to afford it. So I think this is really tough. And frankly, it's not whether you're politically oriented towards Trump or the Democrats. It's really everybody trying to take care of their families. So this is really a bipartisan catastrophe in the making.FADEL: Now, speaking of that, it was reported a few days ago that a bipartisan group of senators met by phone to discuss health care negotiations. Were you part of that call?WELCH: Yes, I was. And there's a determination on both sides of the aisle to do every single thing we can to avoid this catastrophe. And there's some practical things we could do to make that happen. You know, we could extend the credits for a couple of years. We could reform it. You could put an income cap. You could have a copay. You could have penalties on insurers who commit fraud, or insurance agents. And you actually could introduce some cost-saving reductions that have bipartisan support, and if we were successful in that, it actually could bring down health care premiums by about 11%. So there's common ground here to do something that's beneficial to all Americans, so we're determined to keep trying.FADEL: And are you specifically pushing for this path we mentioned for this to change to get an extension of these subsidies passed retroactively?WELCH: Well, we would. What we would do is extend the open enrollment period, and we'd have to give folks an opportunity to take a look and see, if we get the credits extended, does it make sense for them to be able to get back on health care? So it would be, in effect, retroactive, but this is something that could be done. It would require that President Trump play a major role in this because he has such influence over the Republican majority in the House and even in the Senate. But where I have some optimism is that there's a number of Republican and Democratic senators who are seeing what a disaster this will be for families that they represent. That's the common ground here, and it's a doable thing. And the one thing that's totally unacceptable is that people who have no control over how these premiums have increased - and these are the families, the small businesses, the farmers - they should not be the ones that pay the price here.FADEL: Now, do you think there is enough support from your colleagues who are willing to shift their position in upcoming negotiations and pass a retroactive extension for these subsidies?WELCH: I do - in the Senate. I can speak for the Senate. But it really will require that President Trump weigh in. And one of the things that President Trump has indicated, according to my Republican colleagues, is that he wants to have some room in there for what's called an HSA, a health savings account. And one of the topics of discussion is whether we could give the insured, the person, an option to opt into that if they wish to. But we need President Trump, and I think he's the one who can make this happen.FADEL: And what possible path is there to get President Trump to the table?WELCH: Well, my Republican colleagues can be speaking to him, and some of them are. So that's really going to be the burden they bear. And my colleagues on the Republican side that are really intent on trying to get an extension are doing their best to engage with the president. But he'll be critical.FADEL: Senator Peter Welch of Vermont, thank you for your time and Happy New Year.WELCH: Leila, same to you. Thank you, and Happy New Year to America.FADEL: Happy New Year. We also reached out to multiple Republican lawmakers, and those invitations remain open.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

But earlier this week, a bipartisan group of senators worked to strike a compromise that could resurrect the enhanced ACA premium tax credits — potentially blunting the blow of rising monthly payments for Obamacare enrollees.    \"There's a number of Republican and Democratic senators who are seeing what a disaster this will be for families that they represent,\" Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., said on Morning Edition Thursday. \"That's the common ground here, and it's a doable thing.\"    \n   Welch said he joined a bipartisan call Tuesday — first reported by Punchbowl News — in which a handful of senators charted out a possible health care compromise.    \"We could extend the credits for a couple of years, we could reform it,\" Welch said of the call. \"You could put an income cap, you could have a copay, you could have penalties on insurers who commit fraud. You actually could introduce some cost saving reductions that have bipartisan support.\"   But according to Welch, this legislation is only doable with President Trump's blessing.    \"It would require that President Trump play a major role in this, because he has such influence over the Republican majority in the House and even in the Senate,\" Welch said.    Last fall, Republicans and Democrats fought bitterly over the Obamacare subsidy extension, causing a political standoff that led to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. Meanwhile, Trump has remained relatively hands-off, withholding his support for any health care legislation.    Despite these obstacles, Welch said he believes the jump in prices that people across the country now face will break the logjam in Congress.    \"A farmer in Vermont, their premium is going to go from $900 a month to $3,200, a month,\" Welch said. \"So they're going to really face sticker shock. There's going to be a secondary impact, because the hospitals, particularly in rural areas, are going to lose revenue.\"    \n   But even if the Senate advanced a compromise bill on the ACA, the House would also have to get behind it. And the lower chamber has its own bipartisan effort on an ACA subsidy extension.    Just before the recess began in mid-December, four House Republicans joined Democrats in signing a discharge petition on a three-year extension of the ACA subsidies — forcing a floor vote on the bill when the House returns.   \n   Hours after bucking House Speaker Mike Johnson and joining Democrats, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., told Morning Edition back in December that he thinks this vote will get even more Republican support.   \"I don't like the clean extension without any income cap,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"But given the choice between a clean three-year extension and letting them expire, that's not a hard choice for me. And I suspect many of my other colleagues are going to view it the same way.\"    Fitzpatrick and Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., have held meetings with moderate senators on legislative paths to extend the ACA subsidies, a source familiar with the talks but not authorized to speak publicly tells NPR.     The Senate returns on Jan. 5 and the House comes back to Capitol Hill on Jan. 6. \n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Michel Martin asks Democratic strategist Joel Payne what New York City's new democratic socialist mayor may signify for the Democratic party. Is his energy what the party needs?   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  With, as we just said, Zohran Mamdani now officially mayor of New York City, we wanted to ask what his ascent might mean for the Democratic Party beyond the city of New York. We called Joel Payne for his thoughts on this. He's a Democratic strategist who's worked with leaders and activists from different wings of the party and across the country. Joel Payne, welcome. Thanks for joining us, and Happy New Year.JOEL PAYNE: Happy New Year to you as well.MARTIN: So Mamdani won the Democratic primary in an overwhelmingly Democratic city, so we shouldn't be surprised that he won. But his platform is one of the things that got a lot of national attention - you know, free child care, free city buses, a rent freeze for some housing. Does his agenda have an appeal outside of New York City?PAYNE: Yeah. Michel, it's a good question. His platform makes sense for New York City. Those are parochial issues that matter - affordability issues focused on housing, focused on child care that might look different around the country for Democrats who may want to build off of what Zohran Mamdani is doing. The things that are going to be replicable outside of New York City is going to be the way he goes about his job, so moving fast, getting rid of some of the barriers. The types of folks who might oppose his agenda at the state level or at the federal level - either getting those folks on board or removing those obstacles. And also, not getting pulled into fights that don't really matter to the charter of why he was elected, people trying to focus him on things like foreign policy issues that really have nothing to do with why he was elected. Those are the things that if you're a Democrat around the country, you're going to want to watch how Mamdani goes about his work to see if you can replicate that.MARTIN: So what is somebody like you going to be paying attention to? And by somebody like you, I mean somebody who thinks about how Democrats can not just win elections but accomplish their goals, their policy goals.PAYNE: Yeah. I think people are going to be tempted to kind of view this as just a giant experiment of, hey, can somebody with this profile who speaks about himself in this way with this type of political coalition - can he be successful at actually governing, right? He's successful at campaigning and at holding that coalition together, but can he be successful at governing? And I imagine that there are folks in the Democratic Party, particularly in the establishment wing of the party, who are reticent about Mamdani, who are going to be watching to see, does this work at scale? There are many of us who believe that the ideas that Mamdani's espousing are popular and are populist and are, you know, kind of ways to reimagine what that Democratic coalition can look like. But I think there are a lot of skeptical folks who are going to be looking to see whether he can continue to be successful now that he's governing and not just campaigning.MARTIN: But when you consider the ideas - and, you know, again, we're sort of gliding past the whole demographic piece and how that played a role in how he was treated and how his opponents, you know, tried to run against him. So just sort of gliding past that for a minute. But when you're considering the ideas Mamdani ran on, you have to assume he'll have to make compromises somewhere. So is the test for him which compromises he makes or how he explains them?PAYNE: Yeah, I think you're laying that out the right way. The real test for Mamdani I don't think is going to come necessarily from his political opposition on the right. I think it's going to come from the people who he has allegiance to on the left. Are they going to give him the space to make either the types of compromises or to do the type of prioritization that you have to do when you are trying to be the administrator of a city like New York and trying to deal with the local politics that are at play in a state like New York State?MARTIN: So, you know, like his colleague Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who's a member of Congress, obviously, and who will be at his big ceremony today. Republicans have already started using Mamdani as a foil, but has the president undermined that tactic in some way? Remember that very warm welcome he gave him in the Oval Office? How do you think that plays going forward?PAYNE: Yeah. President Trump kind of gave the game away. I mean, one, President Trump was obviously charmed and somewhat impressed with Mamdani and his rise and his individual meeting with Mamdani. I think, you know, you've even seen Elise Stefanik, who was going to be the New York mayor's - or rather governor's candidate for Republicans, had already laid out this entire attack around Mamdani and actually could not, you know, be successful with that because of a lot of the things that Trump did to undercut that argument. And I think a lot of Republicans who planned to spend 2026 talking about Zohran Mamdani are going to have to rethink that now that Trump has intervened the way he has.MARTIN: That's Democratic strategist Joel Payne. Joel, thank you so much for joining us, and Happy New Year again.PAYNE: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"NYC\")INTERPOL: (Singing) New York cares. Got to be some more change in my life.

Fallon/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Here at NPR, we like to ring in the new year by looking at new state laws taking effect on Jan. 1.   This year, states are enacting a slew of laws focused on wages, social media rules, restrictions on gender-affirming care, AI regulation and much more.   Here is a sampling of some of those changes, as reported by public media journalists across the country.   California rideshare drivers can unionize   Under a new law, California's 800,000 rideshare drivers have the right to unionize starting on Jan. 1. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom brokered the deal between organized labor and major rideshare companies, including Uber and Lyft.   \n   The rideshare giants supported the expansion of collective bargaining rights to their drivers in exchange for lawmakers agreeing to slash the companies' insurance costs for underinsured drivers.   After Massachusetts voters decided to do so in 2024, California became the second state to extend collective bargaining rights to rideshare drivers.   – Laura Fitzgerald, CapRadio   More paid time off in Colorado for parents of babies in the NICU   Colorado families whose babies spend time in the NICU will be able to take more paid leave this year. Colorado's paid family leave program already allows workers to take up to 12 weeks off from work to care for a new baby, or for a serious family health or personal issue, and receive most of their pay during that time.   Now, families whose babies require time in neonatal intensive care can apply for an additional 12 weeks of paid leave. Backers say this acknowledges the extra strain families are under when caring for preemies and other newborns with significant health problems.   Democratic State Sen. Jeff Bridges was one of the main sponsors and says he was inspired by his own personal experience. His newborn was in intensive care, which he says was \"terrifying and consuming.\"   Democrats passed the bill, mostly along party lines. Opponents say they worry about increased costs to businesses and workers who pay into the program.   \n   Illinois also has a new NICU law going into effect in June, but unlike Colorado, the time off is not required to be paid.   – Bente Birkeland, Colorado Public Radio   Social media time limits in Virginia    A new law in Virginia, which faces a legal challenge, is designed to limit social media use by those under 16 to one hour a day, unless a parent agrees to a longer period. NetChoice, a group representing social media services, claims the law violates the First Amendment. The law's author, Democratic State Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, argues it's a \"reasonable attempt to balance free speech with the safety and privacy of our children.\"   In legal filings, attorneys for NetChoice call the law the \"latest attempt in a long line of government efforts to restrict new forms of constitutionally protected expression based on concerns about their potential effects on minors.\" A preliminary injunction hearing is set for mid-January.   – Brad Kutner, WVTF   Eighteen states restrict SNAP money for candy, sodas    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Coca-Cola soft drinks are offered for sale at a grocery store on December 11, 2024 in Chicago. Changes to SNAP programs in 2026 in some states will prevent individuals from using benefits to buy soda or other sugary drinks or foods.\n                \n                    Scott Olson/Getty ImagesNorth America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Scott Olson/Getty ImagesNorth America\n    \n\n   \n   With permission from the Trump administration, 18 states will ban the purchase of candy, sodas, energy drinks or other items using federal dollars intended for low-income households.   The states, which include South Carolina, Florida, Hawaii, and Texas, received waivers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2025 that will allow them to restrict Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program dollars for items the states deem non-nutritious.   Citing adult and child obesity statistics, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said in December that the waiver will help create healthier outcomes and said the goal aligns with President Trump's push to restore SNAP to its \"true purpose – nutrition.\"   South Carolina will ban the purchase of candy, energy drinks, soft drinks, and other sweetened beverages using SNAP dollars.   Other states have narrower limits. Texas will prohibit SNAP funds for sweetened drinks and candy, and Virginia plans to bar SNAP dollars for certain \"sweetened beverages.\" All 18 states have a target implementation date of sometime this year.   \n   Among other things, critics of the waivers say they are skeptical the bans will improve people's health.   – Maayan Schechter, South Carolina Public Radio   Paid leave up to 20 weeks in Minnesota   Beginning this week, most Minnesota workers will have access to paid family and medical leave benefits. The state is launching a program that allows 12 weeks of paid family leave to care for a sick loved one or bond with a baby, as well as 12 weeks of medical leave to recover from illness or injury.    There's a cap of 20 weeks in a year if someone taps both. Those who take paid leave will receive partial pay and will have a guarantee that their position at work will be there when they return. Employers are also barred from retaliating against workers who take the paid time off.   The program is funded through a payroll tax split between employers and employees.   Some business groups tried to block the legislation, saying that if employees take significant time off, it could put more work on others.   Roughly three-quarters of Minnesota workers are expected to receive more paid leave benefits under the program than they had previously. Minnesota will be among 13 states to offer paid family and medical leave benefits.   – Dana Ferguson, Minnesota Public Radio   Illinois regulates AI, despite Trump's executive order   Starting this year, employers in Illinois are prohibited from using artificial intelligence in employment decisions – from making new hires to promoting or disciplining current employees – if the technology factors in demographic information, such as the person's race or ZIP code.   It's an amendment to the state's Human Rights Act and was passed by the legislature's Democratic supermajority. Democratic State Sen. Javier Cervantes sponsored the measure. As an artist, Cervantes says he has real concerns about how rapidly AI has progressed over the past few years.   \n   \"This is an unchecked technology,\" Cervantes says. \"We just have to get in front of it and do the best we can.\"   The new law comes on the heels of President Trump's executive order directing the U.S. Department of Justice to challenge states' AI laws deemed \"cumbersome.\" Cervantes says he's pretty certain the DOJ will take the state to court – as it has done in more than thirty suits so far – over the new law.   – Mawa Iqbal, WBEZ\n",

At the start of 2026, many people agree — and believe that he is now one of the powerful few keeping the public in the dark.    In the two weeks since the Justice Department failed to fully meet a legal deadline to release its expansive tranche of files on Jeffrey Epstein, old conspiracy theories about his life and death have subsided and new ones have taken shape. The late financier was a convicted sex offender and accused of sex trafficking minors while associating with top figures in politics, academia and other influential industries.   \n   Both supporters of the president and his opponents have criticized the rollout of documents, often heavily redacted and shared without any clear organization or context. Included in the roughly 40,000 pages of new information published in the last week are unvetted tips from the public — and a complaint made to the FBI more than a decade before Epstein was first criminally charged.    There could be well over a million files still unreleased, along with potentially terabytes-worth of data seized from Epstein's devices and estate, according to 2020 emails between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York included in the most recent batch of files.   On Wednesday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche wrote on social media that lawyers were working \"around the clock\" to review documents but did not specify the scope or scale of the remaining work.   \"It truly is an all-hands-on-deck approach and we're asking as many lawyers as possible to commit their time to review the documents that remain,\" Blanche said. \"Required redactions to protect victims take time but they will not stop these materials from being released. The Attorney General's and this Administration's goal is simple: transparency and protecting victims.\"   \n   A bipartisan group of lawmakers is threatening to take action against the Justice Department for failing to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act passed in November, but the law itself contains no penalties or enforcement mechanism.    Politically, the Epstein files saga caps off a rocky first year for an administration facing record-low favorability ratings and a president whose grasp on his base is appearing to slip. Trump spent most of 2025 downplaying the significance of the files, at times lashing out against Republicans who demanded the release of information about other potential perpetrators.   \n   Congress' demands to release the files are unusual   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Jeffrey Epstein abuse survivor Danielle Bensky and National Director of World Without Exploitation Lauren Hersh embrace after receiving word that the U.S. Senate unanimously approved passage of the House's Epstein Files Transparency Act on Capitol Hill on Nov. 18, 2025, in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Heather Diehl/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Heather Diehl/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The Epstein Files Transparency Act gave a deadline of Dec. 19 for the disclosure of \"all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in the possession of the Department of Justice, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and United States Attorneys' Offices.\"   Congress gave limited exemptions for redacting and withholding files, including identifying information, photos and videos of victims, child sexual abuse materials and images that depict death, physical abuse or injury.   The law also allows the attorney general to withhold or redact anything classified \"in the interest of national defense or foreign policy\" or details that would \"jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution, provided that such withholding is narrowly tailored and temporary.\"   It is highly unusual for federal law enforcement to release the entirety of its investigative file for a case, even one that has garnered heavy public interest — let alone be directed to do so by Congress.   The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, for example, is a 16-page law that set out a 25-year timeline for the release of records related to his assassination, and established a review board to identify relevant records with explicit guidelines and directions. Similarly, the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act of 1998 and Japanese Imperial Government Disclosure Act of 2000 set out a process for evaluating and releasing more than 8.5 million pages.   More recently, presidents have used executive orders to release files related to high-profile events. Former President Joe Biden signed an executive order in 2021 leading the FBI and DOJ to declassify and release roughly 4,000 files related to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Trump's January 2025 executive orders related to the assassinations of JFK, Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. led to the release of close to 400,000 pages.   The 2025 Epstein law is less detailed in its requests and does not provide any additional funding for the Justice Department to complete the process of reviewing and releasing the files.   \n   What we know about the files made public   The vast majority of the roughly 250,000 documents that are now available about Epstein are from public court dockets, Freedom of Information Act requests from state and federal agencies, and records turned over to the House Oversight Committee by Epstein's estate.   That includes communications between Epstein and a vast web of influential figures in politics, academia, business and more, even after he registered as a sex offender.   \n   Trump, who had a decades-long friendship with Epstein before a falling out in the early 2000s, is mentioned frequently in both old and new Epstein files by Epstein himself. Trump has not been credibly accused of wrongdoing in connection to Epstein's alleged crimes.   In one newly released email from 2020, a prosecutor whose name is redacted flags that \"Donald Trump traveled on Epstein's private jet many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware).\" At the same time, Epstein's own emails reveal a near-obsession with Trump's presidency and mock his time in office.   One email sent by federal agents after Epstein was arrested in 2019 for allegedly sex-trafficking minors mentioned 10 possible co-conspirators, including Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for sex-trafficking minors and other charges. Most of the other names on that list are redacted.   Some emails released in the files detail challenges that federal prosecutors faced obtaining, processing and organizing more than a million documents taken from Epstein's estates, as well as more than 60 devices and other evidence accumulated in the investigation into Epstein and Maxwell.   What we don't know about the remaining files   The Justice Department hasn't indicated how many files remain, how many will be released or whether any information it does release will be factually accurate.   Some of the investigative files released in the last two weeks include unverified fantastical claims about Trump, Epstein and others, including a fake video purporting to show Epstein's death by suicide in his federal prison cell. There was also a forged letter that appeared to be from Epstein to convicted sex offender Larry Nassar that alleged Trump shared a \"love of young, nubile girls.\"   \n   The Justice Department posted on social media last week that the Nassar letter was fake, citing inconsistencies with handwriting and other aspects of its construction.   \"This fake letter serves as a reminder that just because a document is released by the Department of Justice does not make the allegations or claims within the document factual,\" the DOJ X account stated.   Before the president's second term, Trump and top allies like now-FBI Director Kash Patel amplified conspiracy theories about Epstein and his death, which were embraced by their supporters.   Trump's about-face on releasing the files and the trickle of information have spawned new conspiracy theories by some Trump opponents who have seized on salacious and unverified claims released in the document dump. Others have shared previously published redacted court filings out of context to claim that the administration is doctoring files to benefit Trump.   There are also several types of files that lawmakers and victims of Epstein's abuse say exist and should be made public. California Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna said on NPR's All Things Considered last week that FBI witness interviews are among those he is looking for.    \"I know from survivors and survivors' lawyers that when they had these conversations with FBI agents, they specifically named other men who they were trafficked to or who showed up at the island or who covered up for this abuse,\" Khanna said. \"There were lawyers of the survivors present there. There are dozens of these interview memorandums. The DOJ has not released a single one.\"   What's next in the Epstein saga?   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Reps.

Lawmakers have been on recess for the holidays and return to Washington next week.   \n   Trump himself continues to fan the flames, including in a Dec. 26 Truth Social post where he appeared to suggest the Justice Department should focus on releasing names of Democrats mentioned in the files and move on.   \"When do they say NO MORE, and work on Election Fraud etc.,\" Trump wrote. \"The Dems are the ones who worked with Epstein, not the Republicans. Release all of their names, embarrass them, and get back to helping our Country! The Radical Left doesn't want people talking about TRUMP & REPUBLICAN SUCCESS, only a long ago dead Jeffrey Epstein - Just another Witch Hunt!!!\"   But the dump of files is expected to continue, as the tail of the political fallout grows longer heading into the 2026 midterm elections in November. Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is set to resign from the House Jan. 5 after Trump repeatedly attacked her over her lobbying to release the files, shrinking an already-tenuous majority for House Republicans.

In it, Roosevelt built on the Monroe Doctrine, which was formulated originally by President James Monroe to warn European powers away from interfering in the region.   Roosevelt, who himself fought against Spain in Cuba in 1898, expanded that doctrine to assert a U.S. right to act unilaterally as a regional policeman — using military force to reinforce diplomatic pressure to advance its interests.   \n   Following World War II, and especially since the Cuban Revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power in Havana, that focus shifted primarily to stopping what Washington said was the potential spread of communism in the region.   \"During the Cold War, intervention was mostly covert. In the 1980s, you begin to see more overt actions,\" says Eduardo Gamarra, a professor of politics and international relations at Florida International University.   U.S. policy in the region was one of strategic denial, Gamarra says. That meant deterring non-American actors in the region.   \"In the 1800s, that meant Europeans; in the 20th century, especially after World War II, it meant the Soviet Union,\" he says.   \n   This led to a shared post-World War II notion between the U.S. and many right-wing governments in Latin America that communism \"was not indigenous to the Americas,\" says Edward Murphy, a professor of history at Michigan State University. \"They justified this through the logic of the Monroe Doctrine, because this was a foreign ideology that needed to be extirpated from the Americas.\"   By the mid-1980s, the U.S. \"transitioned from the Cold War to the drug war\" in the region, according to Gamarra.   U.S. policy, underpinned by the Monroe Doctrine, has shaped the region in the decades since World War II, leading to overt and covert interventions that have often — but not always — resulted in bad outcomes and unintended consequences.   \n   Here are five examples:   The overthrow of Guatemala's government   By 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower was concerned about a Guatemalan land-reform program that nationalized property owned by the U.S.-based United Fruit Company (now Chiquita Brands International). The initiative was carried out under Guatemalan President Jacobo Árbenz, the nation's second democratically elected leader, whose term began in 1951. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles accused Árbenz of establishing what he described as a \"communist-type reign of terror.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Indigenous women beg in Guatemala in June 2004 in front of a propaganda mural that speaks against U.S. interventions in the region.\n                \n                    Orlando Sierra/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Orlando Sierra/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The U.S., Gamarra says, \"responded by undermining Árbenz and supporting a military coup.\"   The CIA launched a successful covert plan of psychological warfare designed to destabilize the Árbenz government while backing a coup to topple it. Coup leader Carlos Castillo Armas, who came to power after Árbenz, was the first in a series of brutal U.S.-backed authoritarians to rule Guatemala before civilian rule returned in the mid-1980s.   \n   The U.S. overthrow of Árbenz emboldened right-wing elements in the country to engage in a campaign of repression, Murphy says. \"What the overthrow of Árbenz really did was fortify illiberal forces in Guatemala.\"   Murphy says what happened in Guatemala became a model for other repressive right-wing governments in the region, such as Chile, to follow.   The Bay of Pigs invasion   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Fidel Castro's soldiers at Playa de Giron, Cuba, after thwarting the ill-fated U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961.\n                \n                    Graf/Getty Images/Hulton Archive\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Graf/Getty Images/Hulton Archive\n    \n\n   \n   Shortly after taking office in 1961, President John F. Kennedy approved a covert plan to overthrow Cuban leader Fidel Castro, who had grown increasingly aligned with the Soviet Union since seizing power two years earlier. The secret operation, originally developed under the Eisenhower administration, relied on a force of about 1,400 CIA-trained Cuban exiles who were expected to seize the Bay of Pigs on Cuba's southern coast and spark a popular uprising against Castro.   \n   Instead, the Bay of Pigs invasion ended in disaster. Castro ordered some 20,000 troops to the beach, forcing most of the U.S.-backed invasion force to surrender. More than 100 were killed. The incident became a major embarrassment for the United States.   The Bay of Pigs convinced Castro and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev that the United States would attempt another invasion of Cuba. Castro convinced Khrushchev he needed Soviet nuclear weapons in Cuba to deter further U.S. aggression, precipitating the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. The resulting confrontation over the missiles brought the U.S. and the Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear war before Kennedy and Khrushchev worked out a delicate compromise that averted a direct conflict between the two superpowers.   \n   It was an extreme Cold War confrontation that came close to a nuclear catastrophe, Gamarra says. The long-term consequences, he says, resulted in \"a misguided embargo that hasn't changed the regime and instead consolidated Cuba's relationship with the Soviet Union and now Russia.\"   The U.S. invasion of Grenada   By 1983, the southern Caribbean island of Grenada was undergoing a period of political instability after the 1979 overthrow of Prime Minister Eric Gairy by Maurice Bishop, a socialist leader aligned with Cuba and the Soviet Union.   \n   \"Cuba was making inroads across the Caribbean,\" Gamarra says.   President Ronald Reagan's White House was suspicious of Havana's involvement in the construction of a large international airport in Grenada, which had only gained independence from Britain in 1974.   In its first major combat deployment since the end of the Vietnam War, U.S. forces landed on Oct. 25, 1983, as part of Operation Urgent Fury. Reagan cited regional security concerns and the need to protect U.S. medical students attending the island's St. George's University School of Medicine as justification for intervention.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                U.S. soldiers arrest suspected Marxist activist in St. George's, the capital of the Grenada Island, on Oct. 30, 1983, three days after American forces invaded the island, ousting the Marxist government.\n                \n                    AFP/via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        AFP/via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Although U.S. forces encountered stronger resistance and more logistical difficulties than expected, military operations took only a few days. The U.S. helped install a provisional government and elections were held in 1984.   Since then, Grenada has experienced stable, democratic governance, with elections and peaceful transfers of power. Today, it is generally regarded as more politically stable than most of its Caribbean neighbors.   U.S. support for the Nicaraguan Contras   After decades of U.S. support for the oppressive and corrupt Somoza family that ruled Nicaragua, Anastasio Somoza was overthrown in 1979 during a popular uprising led by the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN). Daniel Ortega, a committed Marxist at the time and prominent FSLN leader, assumed control of the government.   President Reagan opposed the Sandinistas and in 1981 issued a covert directive for U.S. aid to support a group of anti-Sandinista insurgents known as the Contras.   In 1982, the U.S. Congress passed the Boland Amendment to block U.S. support for the Contras. Despite these restrictions, the Reagan administration secretly continued aiding the group through a scheme that illegally sold weapons to Iran and funneled the proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels. When the operation was exposed, it became one of the most significant scandals of Reagan's presidency: the Iran-Contra affair.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                U.S. Army Lt. Col. Oliver North, former aide to National Security Adviser John Poindexter, is sworn in on July 7, 1987, before the House and Senate Foreign Affairs Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., on arms sales to Iran and diversion of profits to Nicaraguan Contra rebels.\n                \n                    Chris Wilkins/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chris Wilkins/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"The Contra war was devastating — socially, economically, and politically,\" says Murphy.   \n   Despite efforts to topple him, Ortega remained in power and won a decisive electoral victory in 1984. He lost in 1990 to Violeta Chamorro, a wealthy, U.S.-educated newspaper owner who served as president until 1997.   \"In the end, it was … soft power that led to the Sandinistas' loss in the elections and the victory by Chamorro,\" Gamarra notes.   Subsequently, Ortega's political stance evolved away from Marxism, and he won elections in 2006, 2011, 2016 and 2021. Today Ortega is president of Nicaragua along with his wife, co-President Rosario Murillo.   Murphy says it's a different Ortega now — one that \"looks more like a Somoza government than a Sandinista government because it's a family dictatorship.\"   Ortega and Murillo, who Murphy calls \"the power behind the throne,\" have \"followed almost to the letter what Somoza was doing.\"   The U.S. invasion of Panama   Although brutal and corrupt, Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega was useful to the U.S. in the 1980s, due to the de facto leader's cooperation with the CIA in providing a base of operations for the Contras in Nicaragua.   But Noriega's drug trafficking, which included a relationship with notorious Colombian narcotrafficker Pablo Escobar, soon transformed him into a net liability for the U.S. By 1986, mounting evidence of his ties to drug cartels, extrajudicial killings and selling of U.S. secrets to Eastern European governments was an embarrassment. In 1988, federal grand juries in Miami and Tampa indicted Noriega on racketeering, drug smuggling and money laundering charges.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Panamian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, right, fakes a punch to a supporter on May 2, 1989, at the laying of the foundation of a group home in the neighborhood of Panama City where boxer Roberto Duran was born. Months later, Noriega would be driven from power by a U.S. invasion of Panama.\n                \n                    Manoocher Degahti/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Manoocher Degahti/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The following year, President George H.W. Bush took office. Bush was briefly CIA director in the 1970s, when Noriega was considered a valuable intelligence asset. But in 1989, Bush decided that Noriega needed to go. The administration backed a failed coup attempt in October. But two months later, Bush launched Operation Just Cause, an invasion by 20,000 U.S. troops that ultimately overthrew Noriega and took him into U.S. custody.   \n   Since Noriega's ouster, Panama has maintained a stable democracy with regular, peaceful elections and significant economic growth.   Gamarra says Panama is a rare example of a successful American intervention in the region. \"We went in there, we got rid of Manuel Noriega,\" he says.   \"We had a clear exit plan, which is not something the U.S. is very good at anywhere else,\" Gamarra says, referring to the emphasis on capturing Noriega in a quick and limited military operation. Today, he says, \"at least in terms of its economic system, [Panama] is still extraordinarily successful.\"   However, Murphy is less sanguine.   \"I don't think the invasion is responsible for anything positive that comes later,\" he says, \"other than the fact that Noriega was no longer in power.\"\n",

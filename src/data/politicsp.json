In a separate case, Trump issued a second pardon for a Jan. 6 defendant who had remained behind bars despite the sweeping grant of clemency for Capitol rioters because of a separate conviction for illegally possessing firearms.   It's the latest example of Trump's willingness to use his constitutional authority to help supporters who were scrutinized as part of the Biden administration's massive Jan. 6 investigation that led to charges against more than 1,500 defendants.   \n   Suzanne Ellen Kaye was released last year after serving an 18-month sentence in her threats case. After FBI contacted her in 2021 about a tip indicating she may have been at the Capitol on Jan. 6, she posted a video on social media citing her Second Amendment right to carry a gun and she threatened to shoot agents if they came to her house. In court papers, prosecutors said her words \"were part of the ubiquity of violent political rhetoric that causes serious harm to our communities.\"   An email seeking comment was sent to a lawyer for Kaye on Saturday. Kaye testified at trial that she didn't own any guns and didn't intend to threaten the FBI, according to court papers. She told authorities she was not at the Capitol on Jan. 6 and wasn't charged with any Capitol riot-related crimes.   A White House official said Kaye suffers from \"stress-induced seizures,\" and experienced one when the jury read its verdict. The White House said this is \"clearly a case of disfavored First Amendment political speech being prosecuted and an excessive sentence.\" The official requested anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss the case.   In a separate case, Trump pardoned Daniel Edwin Wilson of Louisville, Kentucky, who was under investigation for his role in the riot when authorities found six guns and roughly 4,800 rounds of ammunition in his home. Because of prior felony convictions, it was illegal for him to possess firearms.   \n   Wilson's case became part of a legal debate over whether Trump's sweeping pardons for Jan. 6 rioters in January applied to other crimes discovered during the sprawling federal dragnet that began after the attack on the Capitol. The Trump-appointed federal judge who oversaw Wilson's case criticized the Justice Department earlier this year for arguing that the president's Jan. 6 pardons applied to Wilson's gun offense.   Wilson, who had been scheduled to remain in prison until 2028, was released Friday evening following the pardon, his lawyer said on Saturday.   \"We are grateful that President Trump has recognized the injustice in my client's case and granted him this pardon,\" attorney George Pallas said in an email. \"Mr. Wilson can now reunite with his family and begin rebuilding his life.\"   The White House official said Saturday that \"because the search of Mr. Wilson's home was due to the events of January 6, and they should have never been there in the first place, President Trump is pardoning Mr. Wilson for the firearm issues.\"   \n   Wilson had been sentenced in 2024 to five years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiring to impede or injure police officers and illegally possessing firearms at his home.   Prosecutors had accused him of planning for the Jan. 6 riot for weeks and coming to Washington with the goal of stopping the peaceful transfer of power. Authorities said he communicated with members of the far-right Oath Keepers extremist group and adherents of the antigovernment Three Percenters movement as he marched to the Capitol.   Prosecutors cited messages they argued showed that Wilson's \"plans were for a broader American civil war.\" In one message on Nov. 9, 2020, he wrote: \"I'm willing to do whatever. Done made up my mind. I understand the tip of the spear will not be easy. I'm willing to sacrifice myself if necessary. Whether it means prison or death.\"   \n   Wilson said at his sentencing that he regretted entering the Capitol that day but \"got involved with good intentions.\"   The Justice Department had initially argued in February that Trump's pardons of the Jan. 6 rioters on his first day back in the White House didn't extend to Wilson's gun crime. The department later changed its position, saying it had received \"further clarity on the intent of the Presidential Pardon.\"   U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, criticized the department's evolving position and said it was \"extraordinary\" that prosecutors were seeking to argue that Trump's Jan. 6 pardons extended to illegal \"contraband\" found by investigators during searches related to the Jan. 6 cases.   Politico first reported Wilson's pardon on Saturday. Megerian reported from West Palm Beach, Fla.\n",

But Congress did not address the expiring health care subsidies that were the central issue in the fight. What comes next for a Congress that has become so dysfunctional? NPR congressional correspondent Deirdre Walsh joins us. Deirdre, thanks for being with us.DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Hey, Scott.SIMON: House came in and voted for one day after they'd been gone for more than 50, but Speaker Mike Johnson says they're coming back full force. What does that mean?WALSH: Well, the speaker says there are going to be long days and long nights ahead. The big thing they have to deal with is the rest of the spending bills to fund federal agencies. Since the bill the president signed this week was just a stopgap measure, Congress faces another deadline at the end of January to fund federal agencies, or we could be looking at another shutdown. So Congress hasn't shown an ability to pass many yearlong funding bills, so we could see another stopgap bill at the end of January.SIMON: Of course, Republicans promise to vote on health care by mid-December. What exactly are they going to vote on?WALSH: Well, it's worth noting that Senate Republicans promised this vote. There were some informal bipartisan talks in the Senate during the shutdown about how to deal with these Affordable Care Act tax credits that are expiring at the end of this year. One framework this Senate group is talking about would potentially extend these credits for one year and then phase in some reforms, maybe limit who's eligible for the tax credits, put in some provisions to crack down on waste, fraud and abuse. I talked to New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen earlier this week. She is a Democrat who's helping lead these negotiations. She wants a bipartisan bill the president will sign. She says she supports some of the changes that Republicans want in these tax credits.JEANNE SHAHEEN: For example, a cap on income and who can benefit from the premium tax credits. I mean, that's legitimate.SIMON: Deirdre, bipartisanship in the Senate is one thing, but the politics for House Republicans certainly are different. Is Speaker Johnson planning a vote on health care?WALSH: Well, he certainly faces pressure from some of his swing-district Republicans who want some kind of extension, maybe one year on these tax credits. But the vast majority of House conservatives campaigned to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, and they don't want to help extend any part of it. Speaker Johnson is blaming Democrats for the rising costs of health care. He says when they put this system into place, he claims that House Republicans has what he says, volumes of ideas on reducing costs, but we haven't seen any actual details. And based on what he said this week, he doesn't sound like this is something the House is going to move quickly on.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE JOHNSON: The Republicans would demand a lot of reforms before anything like that was ever possible. And we have to go through that deliberative process.SIMON: And, of course, the speaker has other things to deal with. Preeminently right now, a vote to force the release of documents in the Jeffrey Epstein case. How do we expect that to play out?WALSH: Right. This issue was forced on the speaker, and we expected a vote in the House in early December. But with increasing calls from Republicans to get these files out, the speaker decided to move that up, and there's going to be a vote this week. The politics on this are really bad for the speaker and the Republican Party and the White House. The party's divided, and this bill is even picking up more and more Republican votes each day, even as top Trump officials were pressuring Republican lawmakers to even block a bill from coming up in the House. The speaker argues the House Oversight Committee has already been investigating Epstein. And we should say that the documents the committee released are from the Epstein estate. The legislation on the floor this week is requiring the release of the Justice Department's files. We expect this bill to pass easily. The big question is how big of a vote will it get in the House, and is that going to put pressure on Senate Majority Leader John Thune to take up this issue?SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh.

Ron, thanks for being with us.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.SIMON: And how does the White House respond to the release of these Epstein emails and the coming vote in the House to release more?ELVING: In a word - aggressively. It has been a hallmark of Trump's career that when threatened, he strikes back. When accused, he accuses someone else. And in this case, at Trump's instigation, the attorney general has announced an investigation of several former officials and Democratic donors who Trump alleges have something to hide with regard to Jeffrey Epstein. Now, the obvious way to deal with a lot of this shadow boxing and innuendo would be to release all the Epstein files. That's what candidate Trump promised a year ago, but President Trump has resisted that and driven other leaders in the Republican Party to do the same.SIMON: So far, do you think his response has been effective even among supporters?ELVING: In a sense and in the short-term, yes. Suddenly, we're seeing pictures of the people Trump wants investigated appear on television and in other media. That reduces the amount of time those media are focusing on Trump and all those videos of him with Epstein. But down the road, it doesn't change the nature of Trump's own involvement with Epstein. And it doesn't stop the calls for transparency that come from voters, including more than a few of Trump's on supporters.Now,  even Marjorie Taylor Greene, the familiar firebrand from Georgia - she is a Republican representative in Congress and a fierce defender of the president. In multiple interviews, she has called Trump misguided in fighting the release of the Epstein files. And that, of course, has drawn Trump's ire. In a long post on Truth Social last night, the president called Marjorie Taylor Greene, quote, \"wacky,\" unquote, and said he was withdrawing his support of her.SIMON: Democrats were unable to get an extension of the health care subsidies in the spending bill that just passed. But they say their message, quote, is \"the fight continues.\" How's that being received?ELVING: It's not enough for the hardcore Democratic voters, and that includes the hardcore Democrats who serve in the House. Most of them rejected the deal that reopened the government. They wanted to hold on to the leverage they got by blocking the stopgap funding bill. That's why we had a shutdown. It may not be much, but it's all the Democrats have right now with both chambers of Congress and the White House in Republican hands.Ultimately, though, there were just enough Democrats in the Senate who thought the pain of the shutdown had gone too far, gotten too intense and fallen hardest on recipients or former recipients of food assistance programs. That's not to dismiss the other effects of the shutdown, but only to say that those effects pale in comparison to hungry families. It simply wasn't clear when the hunger of those families was going to change the political calculus for the White House, which is still seeking to block some of the food assistance payments.SIMON: And, Ron, what are you watching for in these next few weeks?ELVING: We should be watching public reaction to all of this. That includes a spike that's coming in the cost of health care for Obamacare users and for many people on Medicaid. Their pain may be real, but will it be felt and shared by enough of the voting public that it changes some minds in Washington? And we've already had one round of elections this month that sent some strong political signals, but there won't be any other elections before the next round of health care showdown votes in December and in January.But there will be polls. And we know the Obamacare subsidy extensions poll exceptionally well. People want them extended. And we know Trump's own personal approval rating, in an average of all recognized national polls, is lower than it's been before in his second term. There is a sense that he is nervous about voter sentiment. He announced a list of foods - including beef and coffee - would be exempt from tariffs after all. And that might slow down inflation people are seeing in the grocery stores, but it's unclear if it will actually lower any of those prices. And with the midterm elections now just a year away, that is a strong indicator of what we might expect.SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving. Always good to speak with you. Thanks so much for being with us.ELVING: Thank you, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

It was the longest shutdown in U.S. history at 43 days.   There are lots of questions about what this means, how we got here and where we go from here. Let's answer some:   Why did it start?   The Democratic base has been urging its leaders to show more fight. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer caught tremendous blowback in March for doing an about-face and going along with Republicans to keep the government open despite what the left saw as an odious spending bill.   When the latest funding fight came up, Schumer this time showed a united front with House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries. Arm in arm, they refused to go along with continuing to fund the government, and made the key issue extending health care subsidies, which, if not extended, would mean tens of millions of Americans would see their health care costs increased.   \n   How did it end?   It ended without the health care extensions Democrats were fighting for. Eight moderate senators crossed the aisle and indicated Sunday night that they had struck a deal with Senate Republicans to reopen the government.   The reason they didn't hold out longer, this group said, was because it was obvious President Trump and congressional Republicans weren't going to negotiate, and too many people were suffering. The Trump administration — correctly — gambled that enough Democrats would not be able to stomach the amount of pain the administration was willing to inflict on the 42 million recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and more than 3 million federal workers.   So what does the bill do?   The bill passed by Congress and signed by Trump funds the government until Jan. 30 with carveouts for SNAP, benefits targeted at women, infants and children, or WIC, the Department of Veterans Affairs and Congress. Those will all be funded until the end of September 2026.   It notably also tries to rectify the firings and loss of pay to federal workers, although it's a leverage point the Trump administration could use again if the government were to shut down again after Jan. 30.   There is also money for increased security for members of Congress, executive branch officials, judges and Supreme Court justices. Several Republican members were outspoken about this after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.   \n   If the government is only funded until Jan. 30, does that mean there could be another shutdown soon?   It's possible. It depends on a few things. What lessons do Democrats take out of the shutdown? Does the fire within the base subside some between now and then? And is there an actual vote on health care subsidies?   OK, so what about those health care subsidies?   It's not clear yet, but the lack of a negotiation on them likely means they will expire unless enough moderate Republicans, feeling pressure in their districts, cross over to strike a deal with Democrat — and Republican leadership, including and especially Trump, go along with it.   But that seems highly improbable — and tens of millions of people would see their premiums go up.   If that's the case, what was the point of the shutdown?   That's a question a lot of people, especially those left of center, are asking. They see what moderate Democrats did as caving to Republicans.   The reality is, though, the 8 moderate senators, who caucus with Democrats and took this deal, didn't want to see regular people feel more unnecessary pain — and they saw no hope for Republicans to compromise after what became the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.   Democrats did accomplish something in this shutdown, though. They elevated the issue of health care, and if Republicans block the extension of subsidies, then they will likely own increased health care costs in voters' minds.   What does this mean for federal workers and flight delays?   Government workers will get back to work, and recent mass layoffs are to be reversed. Furloughed workers were missing paychecks.   As far as airports, there are already signs of easing, but it will likely be several days or more until everything will get back to normal. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy noted that more air traffic controllers are heading back to work, but in the very short term, flight reductions at some major airports will continue.   \n   Were there any surprises?   Yes, there were a few. First, there's drama around a provision slipped in the bill that would allow senators to sue the Justice Department for $500,000 each, if they were subject to subpoenas or had their phone records accessed as a result of DOJ's Jan. 6 investigation.   House Republicans pledged to pass a resolution repealing that provision, but there's no guarantee of that or that the Senate will go along.   There was also a clash about hemp regulation between two Republican senators from the same state. The disagreement between Kentucky Sens. Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul got pretty heated.   The bill also shines a light on how hundreds of local projects are funded — from the purchasing of equipment for a college in the Virgin Islands, the establishing of a veterinary doctorate program in Maryland, urban forest conservation in Texas and asbestos abatement in Alaska to funding for local hospitals, rural community facilities, youth centers, fire stations, and so, so much more. It's earmarks — funding not voted on or allocated through the formal appropriations process but tacked on in spending bills — that pay for all of these things.   One day, there will be a vet that will say he or she got a degree from the University of Maryland, Eastern Shore — and it'll all be because of the funding deal to reopen the government.   Ah, democracy.   Is there a guarantee on a health care vote?   No. The moderate Senate Democrats, who crossed over to open the government, thought so, but House Speaker Mike Johnson said shortly after the deal was reached that he wouldn't commit to a vote.   Whether the vote happens or not, if health care subsidies are not extended, it will be because of Republicans — and that will mean they will own higher health care costs heading into an election year.   \n   What does this mean for the Epstein files?   The end of the shutdown meant the swearing in of Adelita Grijalva, a Democrat, who won a special election in Arizona replacing her late father.   That's key because she signed onto a discharge petition trying to compel the Justice Department to release the files associated with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and her support gave a majority to those who want to see them released. Johnson, who is close to Trump, has argued compelling the release is not necessary — though the president has made clear he does not want them released in full and his Justice Department has not taken public steps to do so.   Even if it passes, though, it will largely likely be symbolic. The Senate is unlikely to get the required 60 votes. Trump would, of course, like it to fail in the House. Colorado Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert, one of three Republicans who have also signed the discharge petition, met in the White House Situation Room, apparently about Epstein. Boebert did not remove her name even after the meeting.   The day the shutdown ended, more investigative materials were released from the House Oversight Committee, including a leak from committee Democrats pointing specifically to emails from Epstein's estate, showing Epstein implying that Trump knew about the girls.   Any day Trump is talking about Epstein is not a good day for the White House.   Who winds up with the political advantage out of the shutdown?   Democrats really upset their base — again. Progressives continue to feel like they get rolled by party leaders. At the end of the day, though, Democrats are likely the ones who got the most out of the shutdown and will have the advantage in the midterm elections.   Consider that Democrats are coming off huge wins across the country earlier this month in the off-year elections. The central issue in those elections was affordability. And through the shutdown, they elevated the issue of health care.   \n   The party and its candidates will likely be able to campaign on both of those issues next year, and with Republicans in charge, that will help Democrats — if they can mend fences with their base, that is.\n",

Marjorie Taylor Greene \"'Wacky' Marjorie\" and saying he would endorse a challenger against her in next year's midterms \"if the right person runs.\"   \n   The dismissal of Greene — once the epitome of \"Make America Great Again,\" sporting the signature red cap for President Joe Biden's 2024 State of the Union address and acting as a go-between for Trump and other Capitol Hill Republicans — appeared to be the final break in a dispute simmering for months, as Greene has seemingly moderated her political profile. The three-term U.S. House member has increasingly dissented from Republican leaders, attacking them during the just-ended federal government shutdown and saying they need a plan to help people who are losing subsidies to afford health insurance policies.   \n   Accusing the Georgia Republican of going \"Far Left,\" Trump wrote that all he had witnessed from Greene in recent months is \"COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!\" adding, of Greene's purported irritation that he doesn't return her phone calls, \"I can't take a ranting Lunatic's call every day.\"   In a response on X, Greene wrote Friday that Trump had \"attacked me and lied about me.\" She added a screenshot of a text she said she had sent the president earlier in the day about releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files, which she said \"is what sent him over the edge.\"   Greene called it \"astonishing really how hard he's fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level,\" referencing next week's U.S. House vote over releasing the Epstein files.   Writing that she had supported Trump \"with too much of my precious time, too much of my own money, and fought harder for him even when almost all other Republicans turned their back and denounced him,\" Greene added, \"I don't worship or serve Donald Trump.\"   Trump's post seemingly tied a bow of finality to fissures that widened following this month's off-cycle elections, in which voters in the New Jersey and Virginia governor races flocked to Democrats in large part over concerns about the cost of living.   \n   Last week, Greene told NBC News that \"watching the foreign leaders come to the White House through a revolving door is not helping Americans,\" saying that Trump needs to focus on high prices at home rather than his recent emphasis on foreign affairs. Trump responded by saying that Greene had \"lost her way.\"   Asked about Greene's comments earlier Friday as he flew from Washington to Florida, Trump reiterated that he felt \"something happened to her over the last month or two,\" saying that, if he hadn't gone to China to meet leader Xi Jinping, there would have been negative ramifications for jobs in Georgia and elsewhere because China would have kept its curbs on magnet exports.   \n   Saying that people have been calling him, wanting to challenge Greene, Trump added, \"She's lost a wonderful conservative reputation.\"   Greene's discontent dates back at least to May, when she announced she wouldn't run for the Senate against Democratic incumbent Jon Ossoff, while attacking GOP donors and consultants who feared she couldn't win. In June, she publicly sided with Tucker Carlson after Trump called the commentator \"kooky\" in a schism that emerged between MAGA and national security hardliners over possible U.S. efforts at regime change in Iran.   \n   That only intensified in July, when Greene said she wouldn't run for governor. Then, she attacked a political \"good ole boy\" system, alleging it was endangering Republican control of the state. Greene embarked on a charm offensive in recent weeks, with interviews and appearances in media aimed at people who aren't hardcore Trump supporters. Asked on comedian Tim Dillon's podcast if she wanted to run for president in 2028, Greene said in October, \"I hate politics so much\" and just wanted \"to fix problems\" — but didn't give a definitive answer.   That climaxed with an appearance on Bill Maher's HBO show \"Real Time,\" followed days later by a Nov. 4 appearance on ABC's \"The View.\" Some observers began pronouncing Greene as reasonable as she trashed Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana for not calling Republicans back to Washington and coming up with a health care plan.   \"I feel like I'm sitting next to a completely different Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" said \"The View\" co-host Sunny Hostin.   \"Maybe you should become a Democrat, Marjorie,\" said co-host Joy Behar.   \"I'm not a Democrat,\" Greene replied. \"I think both parties have failed.\"\n",

The administration over the summer demanded the University of California, Los Angeles pay $1.2 billion to restore frozen research funding and ensure eligibility for future funding after accusing the school of allowing antisemitism on campus. UCLA was the first public university to be targeted by the administration over allegations of civil rights violations.   \n   It has also frozen or paused federal funding over similar claims against private colleges, including Columbia University.   In her ruling, Lin said labor unions and other groups representing UC faculty, students and employees had provided \"overwhelming evidence\" that the Trump administration was \"engaged in a concerted campaign to purge 'woke,' 'left,' and 'socialist' viewpoints from our country's leading universities.\"   \"Agency officials, as well as the President and Vice President, have repeatedly and publicly announced a playbook of initiating civil rights investigations of preeminent universities to justify cutting off federal funding, with the goal of bringing universities to their knees and forcing them to change their ideological tune,\" Lin wrote.   She added, \"It is undisputed that this precise playbook is now being executed at the University of California.\"   At UC, which is facing a series of civil rights probes, she found the administration had engaged in \"coercive and retaliatory conduct in violation of the First Amendment and Tenth Amendment.\"   \n   Messages sent to the White House and the U.S. Department of Justice after hours Friday were not immediately returned. Lin's order will remain in effect indefinitely.   University of California President James B. Milliken has said the size of the UCLA fine would devastate the UC system, whose campuses are viewed as some of the top public colleges in the nation.   UC is in settlement talks with the administration and is not a party to the lawsuit before Lin, who was nominated to the bench by President Joe Biden, a Democrat. In a statement, the university system said it \"remains committed to protecting the mission, governance, and academic freedom of the University.\"   \n   The administration has demanded UCLA comply with its views on gender identity and establish a process to make sure foreign students are not admitted if they are likely to engage in anti-American, anti-Western or antisemitic \"disruptions or harassment,\" among other requirements outlined in a settlement proposal made public in October.   The administration has previously struck deals with Brown University for $50 million and Columbia University for $221 million.   Lin cited declarations by UC faculty and staff that the administration's moves were prompting them to stop teaching or researching topics they were \"afraid were too 'left' or 'woke.'\"   Her injunction also blocks the administration from \"conditioning the grant or continuance of federal funding on the UC's agreement to any measures that would violate the rights of Plaintiffs' members under the First Amendment.\"   \n   She cited efforts to force the UCs to screen international students based on \"'anti-Western\" or \"'anti-American'\" views, restrict research and teaching, or adopt specific definitions of \"male\" and \"female\" as examples of such measures.   President Donald Trump has decried elite colleges as overrun by liberalism and antisemitism.   His administration has launched investigations of dozens of universities, claiming they have failed to end the use of racial preferences in violation of civil rights law. The Republican administration says diversity, equity and inclusion efforts discriminate against white and Asian American students.\n",

Scott Applewhite/AP, Gregory Rec/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   AUGUSTA, Maine — This week's vote to end the federal government shutdown sharply divided Congress along partisan lines. Yet the bill to reopen the government was reliant upon Democratic lawmakers of both chambers who joined Republicans, exposing rifts within the Democratic Party.   That political divide was clearly evident in Maine's congressional delegation — and the public's reaction to how they voted.   \"Well, Angus really hurt us in Maine,\" said Donna Doucette who, like many folks in Maine, refers to Sen. Angus King by his first name. King — an independent who caucuses with Democrats — was among eight minority party senators who negotiated a deal with Republicans to reopen government.   \n   Doucette was one of about two dozen protesters holding signs along a busy street in Waterville on a recent cold and blustery November afternoon. The protesters, many of whom are part of the local Indivisible chapter, were opposed to the deal ending the government shutdown.   \"I've supported him from the beginning and I think he sold us out. Especially when I'm retired, still dealing with cancer — I don't need that now. Nor does my husband, who is even older than me,\" she said.   As part of the deal, Senate Republicans promised a future vote on extending subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.   But critics say they betrayed the Democratic cause by failing to secure an actual extension of the tax credits that roughly 20 million ACA users rely upon to lower their premiums. Without congressional action, the average premium is expected to more than double after December 31st.   Some protesters brought signs calling King a coward. Cindy Burke said he caved.   \"We held out for 40 days, I think, and I just feel that we got nothing from it,\" said Burke. \"And a promise to have a vote on the ACA, I don't believe that is going to happen. I don't trust the Republicans.\"   \n   A small delegation with a significant split    Maine's four-person congressional delegation is one of the smallest in the country. Yet their mixed votes on the bill to reopen the government reflect the national divide over the fraught issue.   Maine's Republican Sen. Susan Collins blamed the shutdown on Democrats and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. Yet as chairwoman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, Collins helped broker the compromise that funds the government through January 30 and fully funds some agencies through September 30.   \n   Maine Rep. Jared Golden, a Democrat, supported extending the ACA subsidies but blasted his party's shutdown strategy. He cast one of his party's six House votes to end the shutdown.   His fellow Maine Democrat, Congresswoman Chellie Pingree, views the compromise as a \"capitulation,\" particularly after the Democratic victories nationwide during the Nov. 4 election.   \"Many of us felt like there was a lot of momentum behind us,\" said Pingree. \"And the Republicans are feeling these concerns. They are losing court battles and they are getting the same calls that we are. We should move them to a decision, not the promise of a vote.\"   Angus King said in an interview with Maine Public Radio earlier this week that he's surprised by the ferocity of the backlash, although he understands the sentiment.   \"I understand because millions of people in this country are gravely worried and angry and frankly scared about the future of their country because of what Donald Trump is doing,\" King said. \"I'm with them. I've been to the 'No Kings' rallies here in Maine.\"   But King defended his decision, saying Republicans made clear they would not negotiate on the ACA until the government reopened. Government shutdowns rarely secure policy concessions for the minority party.   \n   Although he supports extending the subsidies, King said the shutdown harmed Americans — and empowered Trump. That's why King voted with Republicans more than a dozen times to avoid or end the shutdown.   \"And I get it: people want some place to stand up and they felt this was it,\" King said. \"But it's backfiring in a sense that it is hurting a lot of people without getting what we want.\"   Independents play a key role in upcoming elections   It's unclear how shutdown partisanship will impact next year's elections in Maine — a state where 30 percent of voters are independents. And Maine could play an outsized role in control of Congress after 2026.   \n   Golden isn't seeking reelection in a House district that Trump won twice, giving Republicans an opportunity to flip the seat. And the shutdown is already popping up in the heated Democratic primary to challenge Collins, one of the Senate's most vulnerable Republicans. Collins has not yet announced that she is running for reelection, although she is aggressively fundraising.   \"I want to reiterate my call for Leader Schumer to step down,\" said Democratic Senate candidate Graham Platner, a Marine Corps veteran and oysterman whose anti-establishment message has drawn huge crowds, despite recent controversy over past online comments and a tattoo widely recognized as a Nazi symbol. Platner has said he didn't realize the connection when he received the tattoo as a young infantryman and recently had it covered.   Platner denounced the shutdown deal, blaming Schumer — who opposed the deal but couldn't keep his party unified against it. But he also took a not-so-subtle jab at Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who was recruited by Schumer to run for the Senate.   \"The governor has Chuck Schumer's phone number. She should give him a call and have a chat about that.\"   For her part, Mills said this week that she strongly disagrees with the deal to end the shutdown.   \"I appreciate Senator King's efforts here, but it's not going to work,\" Mills said on MSNBC. \"The mere promise of taking it up, putting it on the calendar, talking about it in December . . . Maine people can't wait.\"   Back in Waterville, protest organizer Karen Heck said she's frustrated — with King, with her Democratic Party and with politicians, in general.   \"I just think that most people are tired of a government that doesn't work for them,\" Heck said. \"Whether that's a schism in the Democratic Party or not, I think that this old system, the old system is not working for us. And a lot of people are angry about that.\"   \n   Heck added that she thinks people will demand a change — possibly starting in next year's primaries.\n",

He grew up and became a doctor, and these days, he heads to a shooting range in Maryland each week for target practice with his Smith & Wesson .380.   Charles, who is Black, says he bought the handgun after the Trump administration did things that scared him, including arresting a foreign student who criticized her university's policy on Israel and handcuffing a U.S. senator who was forcibly removed from a Homeland Security news conference.   \n   \"What I'm talking about is protecting myself from a situation where there may be some kind of civil unrest,\" says Charles. Like most people who spoke with NPR for this story, he asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Charles, a doctor in Maryland, wasn't even allowed to have toy guns as a kid. Now, he says he's so concerned about his family's safety because of the Trump administration's actions and rhetoric, that he trains weekly at a shooting range.\n                \n                    KT Kanazawich\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        KT Kanazawich\n    \n\n   \n   Charles says he worries that some of President Trump's supporters may feel emboldened someday to target minorities like him and his family.   \"He could dispatch citizens or the government,\" Charles says. \"I'm not saying that's what's going to happen. What I'm saying is none of this is out of the question any longer.\"   Changing face of American gun ownership   For decades, the image of gun ownership in America was white, rural and Republican, but that's been changing, according to gun clubs, trainers, Second Amendment advocates and academic researchers.   They say more liberals, people of color and LGBTQ folks have been buying guns for years and particularly since Trump's reelection in 2024. This story was based on more than 30 interviews. David Phillips is on the training team of the Liberal Gun Club, which has chapters in more than 30 states and provides a haven for liberals to train and learn about guns. He says club membership has grown from 2,700 in November to 4,500 today. Requests for training, he says, have quintupled.   \n   \"The concern is about the supporters of the right-wing who feel that they have been given permission to run roughshod at least, if not commit outright violence against people they don't like,\" Phillips says.   Asked about these concerns, the White House dismissed NPR's reporting.   \"Instead of covering Americans exercising their Second Amendment Right and trying to disingenuously blame President Trump, NPR should highlight the dangerous language from elected Democrats that has driven leftists to commit actual violence against Republicans – including the recent assassination of Charlie Kirk,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement.   Jackson said stories like this one are why NPR no longer receives federal funding. \"That's something we can all celebrate,\" she added.   Trump has also blamed what he calls \"the radical left\" for demonizing him and his supporters and inspiring political violence.   But many liberals who spoke for this story say it's the other way around. They say the president dehumanizes others with his rhetoric. For instance, Trump has said undocumented immigrants are \"poisoning the blood of our country.\" The president has also called his political opponents, \"radical left thugs that live like vermin.\"   Despite White House claims to the contrary, there is ample anecdotal evidence that more people are buying guns because some of the administration's policies frighten them.   \"Never seen a surge like this before\"   \"As everyone knows, there has been a huge surge in fear and panic since the election,\" said Tom Nguyen, speaking on YouTube to his LA Progressive Shooters gun club just a few weeks after Trump's inauguration. Nguyen said the club's Pistol 101 classes were already booked out for nine months.   \"I've never seen a surge like this before,\" said Thomas Boyer, spokesperson for the San Francisco Chapter of the Pink Pistols, whose motto is: \"Armed gays don't get bashed.\"   \n   Even traditional Second Amendment groups say more liberals are seeking gun training.   \"It's definitely common knowledge at this point,\" said Taylor Rhodes, communications director for the National Association for Gun Rights.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Charles's daughter, Charley, practices with her father. The day after President Trump's election, a man drove onto her college campus and hurled racial slurs at Black students.\n                \n                    KT Kanazawich\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        KT Kanazawich\n    \n\n   \n   There's no way to measure just how many people are buying guns because the political environment scares them, but the phrase \"How do I buy a gun?\" spiked a number of times in the past year, according to Google Trends.   Those spikes happened around the time of Trump's 2024 election, his inauguration, the first immigration enforcement blitz in January and the day when Trump held a military parade in Washington, D.C.   This recent surge in liberals buying guns is the latest in a years-long trend. For instance, a University of Chicago study found that gun ownership by Democrats or Democrat-leaning people rose by 7 percentage points between 2010 and 2022.   David Yamane, a professor of sociology at Wake Forest University in North Carolina, says the events of 2020 and early 2021 – the pandemic, the murder of George Floyd and the Jan. 6 Capitol riot – were particular drivers.   \"We do know that in that year that new gun owners were disproportionately African American (and) disproportionately female,\" Yamane said.   Only for self-protection   Like the vast majority of gun owners, those who spoke to NPR said they would use the weapons only for self-protection and would not engage law enforcement.   \"All the language that we use is absolutely not about rallying together to arm and go assault anyone,\" says MJ, a member of a liberal, self-defense group in the Midwest who asked NPR not to use his full name because he feared retribution. \"If anyone even talks like that, I or someone else would probably boot them out of the group.\"   Bill Sack, director of legal operations with the Second Amendment Foundation, which challenges gun control legislation, says he's glad to see more liberals exercising their right to self-defense – but he isn't happy about why.   \n   \"Is it a good thing that people are scared?\" he says. \"No, of course not.\"   Every new gun owner who spoke to NPR said they thought it was highly unlikely they would have to defend themselves because of civil unrest. But they also said that if they ever had to, they'd regret not having a gun.   \"As a man, as a father, as a husband, how remiss and derelict would it be for me to not be prepared?\" says Charles, the Maryland doctor.\n",

Trump, who was friends with Epstein for years, didn't explain what supposed crimes he wanted the Justice Department to investigate. None of the men he mentioned in a social media post demanding the probe has been accused of sexual misconduct by any of Epstein's victims.   \n   Hours before Bondi's announcement, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he would ask her, the Justice Department and the FBI to investigate Epstein's \"involvement and relationship\" with Clinton and others, including former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and LinkedIn founder and Democratic donor Reid Hoffman.   Trump, calling the matter \"the Epstein Hoax, involving Democrats, not Republicans,\" said the investigation should also include financial giant JPMorgan Chase, which provided banking services to Epstein, and \"many other people and institutions.\"   \n   \"This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats,\" the Republican president wrote, referring to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of alleged Russian interference in Trump's 2016 election victory over Bill Clinton's wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.   Asked later Friday whether he should be ordering up such investigations, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One: \"I'm the chief law enforcement officer of the country. I'm allowed to do it.\"   In a July memo regarding the Epstein investigation, the FBI said, \"We did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\"   The president's demand for an investigation — and Bondi's quick acquiescence — is the latest example of the erosion of the Justice Department's traditional independence from the White House since Trump took office.   \n   It is also an extraordinary attempt at deflection. For decades, Trump himself has been scrutinized for his closeness to Epstein — though like the people he now wants investigated, he has not been accused of sexual misconduct by Epstein's victims.   None of Trump's proposed targets were accused of sex crimes   A JPMorgan Chase spokesperson, Patricia Wexler, said the company regretted associating with Epstein \"but did not help him commit his heinous acts.\"   \"The government had damning information about his crimes and failed to share it with us or other banks,\" she said. The company agreed previously to pay millions of dollars to Epstein's victims, who had sued arguing that the bank ignored red flags about criminal activity.   Clinton has acknowledged traveling on Epstein's private jet but has said through a spokesperson that he had no knowledge of the late financier's crimes. He also has never been accused of misconduct by Epstein's known victims.   Clinton's deputy chief of staff Angel Ureña posted on X Friday: \"These emails prove Bill Clinton did nothing and knew nothing. The rest is noise meant to distract from election losses, backfiring shutdowns, and who knows what else.\"   Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, but was spared a long jail term when the U.S. attorney in Florida agreed not to prosecute him over allegations that he had paid many other children for sexual acts. After serving about a year in jail and a work release program, Epstein resumed his business and social life until federal prosecutors in New York revived the case in 2019. Epstein killed himself while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.   \n   Summers and Hoffman had nothing to do with either case, but both were friendly with Epstein and exchanged emails with him. Those messages were among the documents released this week, along with other correspondence Epstein had with friends and business associates in the years before his death.   Nothing in the messages suggested any wrongdoing on the men's part, other than associating with someone who had been accused of sex crimes against children.   Summers, who served in Clinton's cabinet and is a former Harvard University president, previously said in a statement that he has \"great regrets in my life\" and that \"my association with Jeffrey Epstein was a major error of judgement.\"   \n   On social media Friday night, Hoffman called for Trump to release all the Epstein files, saying they will show that \"the calls for baseless investigations of me are nothing more than political persecution and slander.\" He added, \"I was never a client of Epstein's and never had any engagement with him other than fundraising for MIT.\" Hoffman bankrolled writer E. Jean Carroll's sexual abuse and defamation lawsuit against Trump.   After Epstein's sex trafficking arrest in 2019, Hoffman said he'd only had a few interactions with Epstein, all related to his fundraising for MIT's Media Lab. He nevertheless apologized, saying that \"by agreeing to participate in any fundraising activity where Epstein was present, I helped to repair his reputation and perpetuate injustice.\"   Bondi, in her post, praised Clayton as \"one of the most capable and trusted prosecutors in the country\" and said the Justice Department \"will pursue this with urgency and integrity to deliver answers to the American people.\"   Trump called Clayton \"a great man, a great attorney,\" though he said Bondi chose him for the job.   Clayton, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission during Trump's first term, took over in April as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York — the same office that indicted Epstein and won a sex trafficking conviction against Epstein's longtime confidante, Ghislaine Maxwell, in 2021.   Trump changes course on Epstein files   Trump suggested while campaigning last year that he'd seek to open up the government's case files on Epstein, but changed course in recent months, blaming Democrats and painting the matter as a \"hoax\" amid questions about what knowledge he may have had about Epstein's yearslong exploitation of underage girls.   On Wednesday, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released three Epstein email exchanges that referenced Trump, including one from 2019 in which Epstein said the president \"knew about the girls\" and asked Maxwell to stop.   \n   White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt accused Democrats of having \"selectively leaked emails\" to smear Trump.   Soon after, Republicans on the committee disclosed a far bigger trove of Epstein's email correspondence, including messages he sent to longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon and to Britain's former Prince Andrew, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. Andrew settled a lawsuit out of court with one of Epstein's victims, who said she had been paid to have sex with the prince.   The House is speeding toward a vote next week to force the Justice Department to release all files and communications related to Epstein.   \"I don't care about it, release or not,\" Trump said Friday. \"If you're going to do it, then you have to go into Epstein's friends,\" he added, naming Clinton and Hoffman.   Still, he said: \"This is a Democrat hoax. And a couple, a few Republicans have gone along with it because they're weak and ineffective.\"\n",

Not much of anything, according to some of the right-wing influencers who have long been clamoring for the government to release more information about Epstein and his crimes.   \n   \"To me, these are nothingburgers. If they're even real,\" pro-Trump podcaster Jon Herold said on his Badlands Media Rumble livestream on Wednesday. Herold gained an audience in the wake of the 2020 election after spreading QAnon-adjacent conspiracy theories.   His fellow Badlands Media personality, Brian Lupo, took a slightly different view on his own livestream this week. The emails didn't exactly say nothing, he claimed, but they show that Trump was informing on Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison term for helping Epstein sexually abuse underage girls. (Epstein died by suicide while in jail during the first Trump administration.)   \n   \"My take on this is Epstein and Maxwell are trying to figure out who's a mole or a rat or an informant in their circle of friends,\" Lupo said, referring to an email in which Epstein called Trump a \"dog that didn't bark.\" (The White House has denied that Trump was an informant.)   Epstein looms large for many conspiracy theorists, including QAnon believers. He's seen as a prime example of the satanic cabal of pedophiles they believe are entrenched among the world's most powerful people. QAnon adherents think Donald Trump is destined to defeat that cabal.   \n   Trump has acknowledged he and Epstein were once friendly but fell out decades ago. He's denied any knowledge of Epstein's trafficking of underage girls.   \n   While one of the newly released emails suggests Trump did know about Epstein's behavior, some right-wing media figures say the new disclosures prove Trump did nothing wrong.   \"They're claiming it's a hoax, they're claiming that the Democrats are cherry-picking the things that make Trump look the worst, and that these things prove that he didn't actually do anything wrong and that he's not a criminal and that he was actually gathering information for the FBI on Epstein,\" said Mike Rothschild, an independent journalist and author who has written extensively about conspiracy theories and QAnon.   \n   He said that is \"very different from the song they were singing for years before that, which is that if we just bring down the Epstein ring, all of the Democrats are going to go down with him.\"   Many prominent Democrats are shown communicating with Epstein in the newly released emails. Still, another common thread on the right is that the release is a distraction by Democrats.   \"They think that the Epstein thing is something that is going to distract you from their failures, although the Epstein thing, all it's really doing is exposing more Democrat failures,\" Vince Coglianese, a radio host and the editorial director of the Daily Caller, said on his Rumble livestream on Thursday.   \n   That echoes President Trump's Truth Social posts accusing Democrats of using Epstein to deflect from fallout over the government shutdown. On Friday, he called on the Justice Department to investigate Democrats mentioned in the emails. Attorney General Pam Bondi said she was appointing a federal prosecutor to lead a probe.   Meanwhile, some prominent influencers and conservative media outlets are essentially ignoring this week's release of documents.   \"They already know that their fans are on board 100% with whatever Trump does,\" Rothschild said. \"There's nothing for them here.\"   At the same time, the emails are fueling new speculation on both the right and the left as people race to interpret Epstein's often cryptic language.   To Rothschild, that is a fool's errand.   \"Jeffrey Epstein was, like, not the most trustworthy person…You're taking him at his word because you want to believe him when he says things that are either good about Trump or bad about Trump,\" he said. \"It's absolutely maddening circular discourse and it gets us absolutely nowhere.\"   NPR's Huo Jingnan contributed reporting to this story. \n",

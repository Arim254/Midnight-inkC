The Department of Homeland Security has faced criticism over law enforcement tactics targeting undocumented immigrants and the killing of two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis.\n                \n                    Samuel Corum/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Samuel Corum/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Top officials from three immigration government agencies are testifying before the House Committee on Homeland Security amid heightened calls for oversight of DHS and as lawmakers debate changes to the department ahead of a Friday funding deadline.   Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) acting Director Todd Lyons, Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Rodney Scott and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow are appearing before the panel on Tuesday and return to Capitol Hill on Thursday to testify before the Senate.   Watch the hearing, set for 10 a.m. ET Tuesday, live:   \n   The hearing follows requests from committee Chairman Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y., in the aftermath of the killing of 37-year-old Alex Pretti, who was shot multiple times by federal immigration officers.   \"Transparency and communication are needed to turn the temperature down,\" Garbarino said in a statement announcing the hearing.   The hearings will be a balancing act for Republicans. The congressional GOP majority broadly supports President Trump's immigration enforcement actions, despite several voicing concerns in the aftermath of two fatal shootings in Minneapolis.   But the Trump administration's immigration tactics have been scrutinized by the public. New polls show a majority of Americans say federal agents have \"gone too far\" in enforcing immigration laws.   DHS funding deadline approaches    The hearing is part of a broader focus on immigration this week. Lawmakers are considering potential changes to immigration enforcement operations at the behest of Democrats who refused to fund the agency without reforms.   Republicans sent Democrats an offer on a path forward on Monday, according to Democrats and a White House official. Details of that proposal were not publicly released and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.,  quickly dismissed the offer.   \n   \"Republicans shared an outline of a counterproposal, which included neither details nor legislative text,\" the two said in a statement. \"The initial GOP response is both incomplete and insufficient in terms of addressing the concerns Americans have about ICE's lawless conduct. Democrats await additional detail and text.\"   Last week,  Jeffries and Schumer sent a letter to their GOP counterparts, outlining their proposals.   Some, like requiring officers to wear body cameras, have bipartisan support.   DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has said the department is sending body cameras to every field officer in Minneapolis and that the body camera program would be expanded nationwide as funding allows. Democrats want this codified into law.   Other proposals face an uphill battle, including calls for officers to display identifying information on their uniforms, such as their last name, and to prohibit them from wearing face coverings.   Republicans have said banning face masks would make it easier for people to dox federal agents.   Jeffries said banning masks brings immigration enforcement officers in line with civil enforcement.   \"We want to make sure that ICE agents are conducting themselves like every other law enforcement agency in the country,\" Jeffries said on NPR's Morning Edition. \"Police officers don't wear masks. County sheriffs don't wear masks, and state troopers don't wear masks.\"   \n   Democrats are also calling for a prohibition on the use of funds to conduct immigration enforcement near medical and child care facilities, schools and churches. They want to see expanded training of agents and the removal of officers from the field in the event of an incident until an investigation is conducted. They also want to require agents to verify that a person is not a U.S. citizen before holding them in immigration detention.   Additionally, Democrats are calling for a mandate requiring immigration officers to only use warrants signed by a judge to make arrests. They say the current use of administrative warrants — written by DHS and not signed by a judge — could violate Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure.   Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., called Democrats' proposals \"a ridiculous Christmas list of demands\" and said they were \"not negotiating in good faith.\"   If lawmakers don't reach a deal this week, another stopgap bill to fund DHS in the short term would be needed. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters on Monday he hopes to begin work on a temporary funding bill on Tuesday, but said he is hopeful congressional Democrats and the White House will find common ground and forge ahead with a deal.    Unlike past shutdowns, only DHS is at risk of closing its doors. A lapse in funding would affect agencies like the Transportation Security Administration and Federal Emergency Management Agency — potentially affecting air travel and disaster response.   However, ICE would likely keep operating even if there is a shutdown. That's because DHS got more than $70 billion in separate funds from Congress over the summer as part of a broader spending increase on border and immigration enforcement.   Both the Senate and the House are expected to be on recess next week for Presidents Day. If the DHS funding issue is not resolved, the Senate may need to stay in Washington to address any lapse.   \n   NPR's Ximena Bustillo contributed to this report.\n",

The affidavit, written by FBI Special Agent Hugh Raymond Evans, led to a judge signing off on a search warrant of Fulton County's elections hub, just outside Atlanta. The FBI executed that search warrant on Jan. 28, seizing more than 650 boxes of ballots and other 2020 election materials.   The affidavit relies on misleading and already-disproven claims about the 2020 election. Fulton County's 2020 ballots were counted three separate times, with the results affirmed.   \n   \"This warrant application is part of an FBI criminal investigation into whether any of the improprieties were intentional acts that violated federal criminal laws,\" the affidavit reads. \"The FBI criminal investigation originated from a referral sent by Kurt Olsen, Presidentially appointed Director of Election Security and Integrity.\"   \n   Olsen played an integral role in Trump's failed efforts to overturn his narrow 2020 election defeat by challenging the results in Georgia and other swing states.   The White House did not respond to NPR's questions Tuesday about Olsen's role in the administration.   The FBI investigation, according to the affidavit, is focused on five \"deficiencies or defects\" with the election and the subsequent tabulation.   But those claims include allegations that have been investigated and unsubstantiated by state officials, including claims about missing scanned images of ballots, though state law at the time did not require counties to maintain them as records.   Republican Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state who resisted Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state, was critical of the probe. Raffensperger is now running for governor.    \"As Secretary of State, I've made Georgia the safest and most secure place to vote,\" he said in a statement. \"Instead of wasting time and tax dollars trying to change the past with baseless and repackaged claims, let's focus our efforts on building a safer, more affordable future for all hardworking Georgians.\"   \n   In a statement, David Becker, a former Justice Department official who's now executive director of the Center for Election Information & Research, called the affidavit \"much weaker than I suspected.\"   \"After more than five years, dozens of court cases, and over a year in total control of the federal government, this is all they've got?\" he said. \"If taken at its word, this entire affidavit at most alleges human error after a late night during a global pandemic, all of which had no impact on the outcome of the race.\"   The affidavit also does not mention any evidence or suspicion of foreign election interference, raising more questions about the presence of Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard at the site of the raid.   In a letter to Democratic lawmakers last week, after the search, Gabbard defended her role in investigating election security. She also confirmed that she \"facilitated a brief phone call for the President to thank the [Atlanta-area FBI] agents personally for their work.\" The call was first reported by The New York Times. Gabbard said Trump \"did not ask any questions, nor did he or I issue any directives.\"   Trump and his allies have continued to focus on the 2020 election and falsely claim he was victorious while also taking extraordinary steps to exert federal control over future voting, including suing states to try to obtain unredacted voter rolls and suggesting that Republicans \"nationalize\" elections.\n",

On Tuesday, 18 Democratic governors also announced they would boycott a traditional dinner at the White House.   \"If the reports are true that not all governors are invited to these events, which have historically been productive and bipartisan opportunities for collaboration, we will not be attending the White House dinner this year,\" the Democrats wrote. \"Democratic governors remain united and will never stop fighting to protect and make life better for people in our states.\"   \n   Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican who chairs the NGA, told fellow governors in a letter on Monday that the White House intended to limit invitations to the association's annual business meeting, scheduled for Feb. 20, to Republican governors only.   \"Because NGA's mission is to represent all 55 governors, the Association is no longer serving as the facilitator for that event, and it is no longer included in our official program,\" Stitt wrote in the letter, which was obtained by The Associated Press.   The governors' group, which is scheduled to meet from Feb. 19-21, is one of the few remaining venues where political leaders from both major parties gather to discuss the top issues facing their communities. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday that Trump has \"discretion to invite anyone he wants to the White House.\"   \"It's the people's house,\" she said. \"It's also the president's home, so he can invite whomever he wants to dinners and events here at the White House.\"   Representatives for Sitt and the NGA didn't comment on the letter. Brandon Tatum, the NGA's CEO, said in a statement last week that the White House meeting is an \"important tradition\" and said the organization was \"disappointed in the administration's decision to make it a partisan occasion this year.\"   \n   In his letter to other governors, Stitt encouraged the group to unite around common goals.   \"We cannot allow one divisive action to achieve its goal of dividing us,\" he wrote. \"The solution is not to respond in kind, but to rise above and to remain focused on our shared duty to the people we serve. America's governors have always been models of pragmatic leadership, and that example is most important when Washington grows distracted by politics.\"   Signs of partisan tensions emerged at the White House meeting last year, when Trump and Maine's Gov. Janet Mills traded barbs.   \n   Trump singled out the Democratic governor over his push to bar transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women's sports, threatening to withhold federal funding from the state if she did not comply. Mills responded, \"We'll see you in court.\"   Trump then predicted that Mills' political career would be over for opposing the order. She is now running for U.S. Senate.   The back-and-forth had a lasting impact on last year's conference and some Democratic governors did not renew their dues last year to the bipartisan group.\n",

Mikie Sherrill.   \"I congratulate Analilia Mejia on her hard won victory in the NJ-11 special primary. I look forward to supporting her in the April general election,\" Malinowski said in a statement.   The Associated Press has not yet made a call in the race. Last Thursday, Mejia led by a narrow margin as polls closed in the district. Some mail-in ballots remain to be counted.    \n   The Democratic nominee will face Randolph Township Mayor Joe Hathaway, the only Republican to run, in the special general election to replace Sherrill. Sherrill resigned from her seat shortly after winning the gubernatorial race last November.   The special primary contest is one of the first elections in the 2026 midterm cycle where Democrats hope to capitalize on voter dissatisfaction with President Trump's second-term agenda. After losing the White House and the Senate in 2024, the party earned numerous victories in special elections and saw a surge of support in the 2025 November general election, including Sherrill's landslide victory.   Malinowski's comeback bid was supported by New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim, who touted the two-term congressman's experience.   \n   \"Tom Malinowski knows the House of Representatives. He knows Congress. He knows New Jersey,\" Kim said in a video. \"He knows how to be able to stand up to Donald Trump, and that's what I need right now is someone there as a partner with me in the Capitol.\"   Malinowski represented a neighboring congressional seat from 2018-2022, but lost to Republican Rep. Thomas Kean Jr. after redistricting added more Republicans into his district.   Malinowski's prior experience in Congress was an important factor in the lead-up to this race, says Micah Rasmussen, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University.   \"With a short runway of a special election  — name recognition, money, experience — all can matter,\" he said.   \n   But Mejia, director of the New Jersey Working Families Alliance, was endorsed by several progressive groups and politicians including independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Locally, she received the endorsement of Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark, New Jersey's largest city.   \"In a moment of rising authoritarianism, of economic insecurity, of state-sanctioned violence, any old blue just won't do,\" Mejia said at the event with Sanders. \"If you send weak sauce to Congress, we will get weak sauce back.\"   \n   Mejia has also called for the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.   \"You can't reform that. It's not fixable,\" she said at a January event at William Paterson University. \"Get it out. Kick it over. It is done. Forget it.\"   Immigration enforcement became a dominant theme of discussion among candidates in the primary, heightened by the fatal shootings of Nicole Macklin Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minnesota.   The latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll finds 65% of Americans feel that ICE has \"gone too far\" in enforcing immigration laws, with a growing number of independents and Democrats sharing that sentiment.   For his part, Malinowski faced attacks from a super PAC aligned with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) over a 2019 vote for a bipartisan Department of Homeland Security funding bill. But he has been outspoken about the Trump administration's recent immigration tactics and a desire to \"defund ICE's brutality.\"   Earlier this month, Patrick Dorton, a spokesperson for the super PAC, United Democracy Project told The New York Times, \"Tom Malinowski is talking about conditioning aid to Israel,\" adding, \"That's not a pro-Israel position.\"   In the statement congratulating Mejia Tuesday, Malinowski decried the \"massive flood of dark money that AIPAC spent on dishonest ads during the last three weeks,\" adding that he supports Israel as a \"democratic and Jewish state.\"   In response to Malinowski's statement, AIPAC spokesperson Deryn Sousa said Tuesday that the organization \"will be very active this election cycle supporting Democrats and Republicans who strengthen the U.S.-Israel partnership and opposing those—of either party—who may seek to undermine it.\"\n",

Democrats, and some Republicans, on the House Homeland Security Committee on Tuesday took the opportunity to criticize the tactics used by officers on the ground and the strategy of top Trump administration officials to curb illegal migration.   The criticism came as congressional funding is set to expire on Friday for the Homeland Security Department — the department that houses Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection and Citizenship and Immigration Services.   \n   The hearing underscored how deeply divided Republicans and Democrats remain on top-level changes to immigration enforcement in the wake of the shootings. It suggested Congress is inching closer to another stopgap bill to fund the department in the absence of deeper agreement.   \n   Here are some other takeaways from the hearing:   1. Deaths of two U.S. citizens stay top of mind   Both Republicans and Democrats discussed the deaths of Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti, the 37-year-olds killed by DHS officers in two separate incidents.   Rep. Andrew Garbarino, N.Y., the Republican chairman of the committee, called the deaths, as well as increased violent rhetoric generally, \"unacceptable and preventable.\"   \"The safety of law enforcement and the communities they serve and protect must always come first. When officials or elected leaders rush to conclusions about law enforcement, or their fellow Americans, public trust suffers,\" Garbarino said in his opening remarks, calling for a \"complete\" investigation.   \"I cannot put myself in the shoes of law enforcement, nor can I imagine what the families of Ms. Good and Mr. Pretti are enduring today,\" he said.   \n   But ICE acting Director Todd Lyons — who hasn't been confirmed by the Senate yet — deflected questions regarding the deaths. He said he would \"not comment on any ongoing investigations.\"   He also sought to deflect criticism of President Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for labeling Pretti as a \"domestic terrorist,\" saying as elected or appointed officials, \"that's their right to their comments.\"   But Lyons, in response to Democrats' questions, did emphasize that U.S. citizens shouldn't be caught up in immigration enforcement.   \n   \"ICE officers and special agents are trained in the Immigration and Nationality Act, so anyone that is here legally or lawfully or a US citizen should not be concerned about being deported or detained,\" Lyons said. He later drew a distinction between someone being \"arrested\" – which he acknowledged could happen to a U.S. citizen — and being \"detained\" on a longer basis.   NPR witnessed multiple instances in Minnesota where immigration agents drove around Minneapolis and questioned people about their immigration status, with the state's attorney general saying U.S. citizens were detained.   The detention of U.S. citizens has also happened under prior administrations. A 2021 Government Accountability Office report found that over a five-year period, U.S. citizens had encounters with immigration officers that could lead to their arrest and even deportation.   2. Bipartisan questions about training and internal oversight   ICE and CBP officials broke down training and resources available to officers, in response to repeated questions about how officers are treating U.S. citizens and others.   Lyons said that officers undergo three months of training, which includes 47 days at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Academy in Georgia. Law enforcement officers and special agents who were certified in the past got to have a shorter training module, focused on just topics like the Immigration and Nationality Act.   \"They would have to go through the rigorous immigration training, which, unfortunately ... immigration law is just as confusing and long as [the] tax code,\" Lyons said.   \n   Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., asked Lyons how many ICE officers have been fired for their conduct. Lyons declined to comment on personnel matters.   But Lyons did denounce some of the language immigration officers were caught using on video. For example, in a video shared on social media after Pretti's death, an officer can be heard telling a woman: \"if you raise your voice, I will erase your voice.\"   When asked about the footage, Lyons said he hadn't seen it but said ICE \"does respect and adhere to the First Amendment\" and that the statement heard in the video \"doesn't represent the values of the men and women of ICE.\"   \n   3. Republicans share some concerns with Democrats   Republicans voiced concern about two issues that Democrats have frequently raised: roving patrols and the use of body cameras.   Under the second Trump administration, CBP, which houses the Border Patrol agency, has taken a leading role in enforcing federal immigration laws in the interior of the country, rather than strictly near the borders.   \n   In response to widespread criticism of the events in Minneapolis, Trump removed Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino from serving as the public face of the immigration presence there, replacing him with White House border czar Tom Homan. Trump later said in an interview that \"maybe we can use a little bit of a softer touch\" when it comes to immigration enforcement.   GOP Rep. Michael McCaul, Texas, said he believed \"roving patrols should be done at the border rather than in the major cities of the United States.\" He also applauded the leadership changes in Minneapolis as \"returning to the original mission of ICE.\"   Lawmakers from both parties have also pushed for greater use of body cameras to aid in oversight of agents' actions on the ground.   Lyons said that ICE had 3,000 cameras for 13,000 officers and Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Rodney Scott noted that only half of 20,000 CBP officers have body cameras.   \n   Lyons pledged to Rep. Tony Gonzalez, R-Texas, that body camera footage of enforcement in Minneapolis would be released to the public and that he welcomes all officers getting such cameras.   Scott, from Customs and Border Protection, also pleaded for Congress to fully fund the body camera program for his agency, too, noting that while there has been money for the physical devices, there have not been the personnel to fully implement the body camera program.   \"So fund the entire program so that we can be transparent and that we can make sure America knows what we're doing, because that trust is critically important,\" Scott urged lawmakers.   \n   Noem, the homeland security secretary, has said the department is sending body cameras to every field officer in Minneapolis and that the body camera program would be expanded nationwide as funding allows.   Democrats want this codified into law.   \n   4. Most requests were still partisan   The rhetoric and questions still seemed largely split along partisan lines. Republicans described the work done by ICE as \"remarkable,\" while Democrats called for the \"abolishment\" and \"dismanteling\" of the agency.   Other Democratic proposals continue to face an uphill battle for GOP support, including calls for officers to display identifying information such as their last names on their uniforms, and to prohibit them from wearing face coverings.   Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., asked Lyons whether he would commit to unmasking his officers. Lyons said no. And Republicans argued that banning face masks would make it easier for people to dox federal agents — a common refrain from the administration.   \n   5. ICE was in the spotlight, while CBP, USCIS — and the looming shutdown — took a backseat   Both Republicans and Democrats peppered Lyons with questions about his agency's operations. But lawmakers generally did not drill down into the changes at CBP and USCIS, despite those agencies' growing roles in immigration enforcement over the last year.   Questions for CBP's Scott still centered around border enforcement. That comes even as the Border Patrol has gone beyond its traditional jurisdiction of 100 miles from U.S. borders to conduct enforcement in cities like Minneapolis, and lead operations in Illinois, North Carolina and Louisiana.   \n   All three agencies hedged  in response to questions about whether their operations would be affected if DHS shuts down on Friday.  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow reminded lawmakers that his agency is funded primarily by the fees people pay when they submit various forms and applications, so his employees would still get paid.   And ICE and CBP both got a huge infusion of cash from Congress in Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill Act last summer — making ICE the highest-funded U.S. law enforcement agency.   \n   Lyons said the shutdown could affect the Department of Homeland Security's work related to transnational crime, but he did not note any impact to immigration operations. And Scott also didn't detail how the shutdown would affect personnel, just saying: \"I agree America becomes less safe.\"   Their responses suggest any lapse in funding could most affect non-immigration agencies inside the Department of Homeland Security, like the Transportation Security Administration and Federal Emergency Management Agency — potentially spelling trouble for U.S. air travel and disaster response.   —NPR's Barbara Sprunt contributed to this report.\n",

    "body": "\n      Members of a House committee will question top immigration officials as lawmakers discuss possible changes to immigration enforcement operations.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  The Department of Homeland Security runs out of funding on Friday. Congress is going through another last-minute drama over the budget as some lawmakers try to shape the actions of immigration agents.MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  This hour, a House committee is also hearing from immigration officials about how that enforcement is being conducted across the country. In a few minutes, we'll hear from one of the members of that committee, Democrat Dan Goldman of New York. But we're going to start with the latest of the negotiations.INSKEEP: NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt is here. Barbara, good morning.BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Steve.INSKEEP: How are the talks going?SPRUNT: Well, a bit stuck right now, which feels familiar, right?INSKEEP: Yeah.SPRUNT: Last week, top Democrats sent a list of proposals. Late last night, they said they received a response from Republicans. Neither side has described what was in that response. But Democrats said the outline of that counterproposal didn't include details or propose legislative text, so they dismissed it as incomplete, and they said they'll be waiting for details to come their way.INSKEEP: Not much more time to wait, it would seem.SPRUNT: That's right. With a Friday deadline, doesn't give them a bunch of time to delivery, and if they don't reach a deal, then they'd need another stopgap bill to fund the department. So last night, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he's going to start teeing up a short-term funding bill today just in case an agreement can't be brokered in time.INSKEEP: OK. Now, regular listeners to this program have heard discussion of the various demands the Democrats have. And there's real substance here in people's lives because it has to do with the way that immigration agents behave on the streets of places like Minneapolis and elsewhere. What on that list has begun to seem like it has bipartisan support?SPRUNT: Well, we know that there's general support from both parties on requiring officers to wear body cameras. In fact, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has already said that the department will send cameras to every field officer in Minneapolis and that that body camera program will be expanded nationwide as funding allows. Now, Democrats want to go a step further. They want to see that put into law. But other proposals remain much more of an uphill battle.INSKEEP: OK. Why don't you go through those?SPRUNT: Well, Democrats want officers to display identifying information like their last names, and they want to ban them from wearing face coverings. And this has seemed to be a nonstarter with a lot of Republicans, who say that banning face masks would make it easier for people to dox federal agents. But Democrats counter that that would actually bring immigration enforcement officers in line with civil enforcement, you know, pointing out that sheriffs and police officers, for example, don't wear masks.INSKEEP: I'm noticing that there's a kind of a theme of transparency here, demanding transparency. Democrats at least want the person on the street who works for the taxpayer to identify themselves to this person that they may be grabbing and taking down or doing any number of things to, demanding identity. And at the same time, officials from ICE and Customs and Border Protection are supposed to more or less identify themselves before Congress and face questions about what they're doing.SPRUNT: That's right, and this will be the bulk of the hearing today. There will be another one before the Senate on Thursday. And it's interesting because Congress is actively negotiating on how to change DHS. And at the same time, this committee gets to question firsthand the people who conduct these operations, which, as you said, have come under so much scrutiny. In fact, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee requested that these officials testify after federal immigration officers shot and killed Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.INSKEEP: So what'll you be watching for?SPRUNT: I'm curious how the congressional GOP majority will handle its questioning because they broadly support President Trump's immigration enforcement actions, but they're also contending with public polling that shows a majority of Americans say that enforcement has gone too far.INSKEEP: NPR's Barbara Sprunt.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., about oversight and reforms for the Department of Homeland Security as a funding deadline looms.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  For more on this, I'm joined by Congressman Dan Goldman. He is a Democrat from New York, and he serves on the House Homeland Security Committee. Good morning, Congressman. Thanks for joining us.DAN GOLDMAN: Good morning, Michel. Great to be with you.MARTIN: So let me start with today's hearing. You and your colleagues will hear testimony from senior leaders at ICE, Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. What's the goal for you for this hearing today?GOLDMAN: I want answers. I want to understand how they can justify essentially wreaking havoc and terror and killing American citizens all around the country in the name of immigration enforcement. The data is very clear that they are lawless. There's clearly use of excessive force and outside the bounds of the Constitution. But also the people they're going after are nowhere close to the worst of the worst. In fact, the vast majority of them have no criminal history whatsoever. And so we'll be looking for some understanding as to what the changes are that they intend to implement to respond to this outcry from the American people.MARTIN: Do you think that your - any of your Republican colleagues share these concerns?GOLDMAN: I do believe my Republican colleagues share these concerns. The question is, how willing are they to go public with them? It is notable, as Barbara said, that the - this hearing was called the day that Alex Pretti was killed. Saturday afternoon, the chairman issued a letter saying he wanted to hear from the ICE director and CBP director. And so there was clearly a response from Republicans, many of whom are up for reelection in November. And immigration has been something that they've leaned on in a misdirected way, but it is nonetheless now something that the public is outraged by their conduct. So I'll be interested to see how many of them actually go public in this hearing with criticisms.MARTIN: So Democrats laid out 10 demands last week that they want to see before agreeing to fund DHS. And we understand that there is some agreement on body cameras. That's one of the things that Barbara Sprunt talked about, but that Democrats want to see this codified into law. Republicans, at least the administration is saying that this is dependent on funding. They'll start in Minneapolis first and then kind of roll it out as funding becomes available. But what else? What other things do you see as a bottom line for you?GOLDMAN: Well, the body cameras need to be mandatory. It's not simply enough that you're supplying them, and it's quite odd to say that ICE does not have enough funding when it got $75 billion from the big ugly bill. But a lot of this is transparency because you have essentially masked secret police roaming the streets, demanding citizenship papers from people, killing people and having no consequences. So they're able to act with impunity because they're being protected by the Department of Justice. So, yes, first thing first, no masks. I was a federal prosecutor for 10 years. None of the criminal law enforcement agents who were actually going after bad guys wore masks. That's not the way we do things in America. You need to be transparent and you need to be accountable. That, for sure, is a nonstarter for us.Other things is just simply implementing what the law already is. I don't see why it should be a problem to get a judicial warrant to search a home. That's what the Fourth Amendment requires. And much of this is reining in the lawless violence. But for me, Kristi Noem needs to go, and that's going to be a baseline. And I'm also very concerned about the efforts by this administration to interfere in the upcoming election by usurping power and grabbing voting rolls, voting machines, etc.MARTIN: I don't know that that is part of the scope of this hearing or the individuals that you expect to hear from today would even have authority in this matter. But just to the question of face masks. I mean, Republicans have said publicly that that's a nonstarter for them. Have you heard anything privately that leads you to believe that there's negotiation on some of these other points?GOLDMAN: Other than that, there's no good rationale or basis for them to say it's a nonstarter. Judges have been doxed repeatedly. Republicans don't seem to care about that, and you won't be doxed if you're following the law and you're not outrageously violating the civil rights of Americans and immigrants. So it is - this is not something that they can win in the court of public opinion because I think, A, their statistics are completely inflated and made up. We haven't seen any evidence of additional doxing. But moreover, that's the point, is that you have to act within the law, not behind a mask.MARTIN: What I'm - I'm still trying to understand what convinces you that there may be a negotiation space on this point. And you keep referring to sort of the court of public opinion. We know from polling, for example, that Democrats are very disturbed by what they're seeing in the streets. Independents are very disturbed by what they're seeing in the streets. So we see Americans, overall, are very disturbed by what they're seeing on the streets, but it doesn't seem to be that Republicans, as a group of voters, don't seem to be as disturbed. They still seem overwhelmingly to support the government or the Trump administration's administration efforts. So I guess I'm wondering what leverage do you see that would encourage some of your Republican colleagues to see things your way?GOLDMAN: Well, if you really want to get down to brass tacks, they need independence to keep the House majority. That's just a fact because they'll have to win battleground districts, and right now they're losing those significantly. So they can't just rely on Republicans to hold the House. I mean, that's a cynical political view of it. The other view is just simply that it's posturing on their part because there is no basis why civil immigration enforcement officers should be able to conceal their face and identity when criminal law enforcement agents do not. And that's the way that our democracy works. This is not some sort of USSR, where you have mass secret police roaming the streets with impunity.MARTIN: You were a prosecutor, as you mentioned, for many years. Were you ever doxed? Did you ever feel threatened in the course of doing your job? Your identity was never secret.GOLDMAN: No, I was never doxed as a prosecutor, although I have received many death threats as a member of Congress. In fact, I prosecuted mob bosses and certainly have received more threats from Donald Trump and his supporters than I ever did from the mafia.MARTIN: Before we let you go, what do you say to those who believe a shutdown would be meaningless? Because, as you just pointed out, ICE received an enormous funding boost in the last bill, the $75 billion. A shutdown would affect other parts of DHS, like disaster response. What do you say to that?GOLDMAN: Right. Well, if TSA is shut down, the Coast Guard shut down, FEMA is shut down. Those are significant areas of the Department of Homeland Security that the Republicans will be shutting down because they want to continue this lawlessness.MARTIN: That's Democratic Congressman Dan Goldman of New York. Thanks for joining us. And I want to note we have open invitations to Republican leaders in Congress to join us on this program, and we will bring them to you when they agree to speak with us.(SOUNDBITE OF OLLIE MORRIS' \"STRIVE\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Michel Martin speaks to Democratic Rep. Suhas Subramanyam of Virginia about viewing the unredacted Epstein files that the Justice Department made available to members of Congress.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Several lawmakers also got access to unredacted versions of the Epstein files at Justice Department offices yesterday. This, after they criticized the heavy use of redactions in the publicly available version of the files. Democrat Suhas Subramanyam of Virginia got access to the unredacted files on a government computer, and he's on the line with us now. Good morning, Congressman.SUHAS SUBRAMANYAM: Good morning.MARTIN: First, let me ask about Ghislaine Maxwell's appearance before the House Oversight Committee on which you sit. I understand that she requested to - or her lawyers did - to reduce or perhaps vacate her 20-year sentence in exchange for her testimony. Her lawyer says she will clear both President Trump and former President Bill Clinton of any wrongdoing. What do you make of that?SUBRAMANYAM: Well, I think it's pretty clear this is part of a campaign by her to get clemency, and she's trying to essentially use this investigation that we're conducting as a means to doing that, as well as the idea of clearing a Democrat like Bill Clinton and a Republican like President Trump in the process. So she was trying to appeal to both parties, in my mind, and she's really just trying to get out of prison. And what I'd like to see, though, is this president make a clear commitment to not pardoning her because if she thinks there's a pardon that's on the horizon, then she's not going to talk to us or cooperate with our investigation.MARTIN: Well, she was already moved to a less restrictive environment after she was previously questioned by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. And I wonder if you feel that that has led to some belief or expectation that this is possible.SUBRAMANYAM: Oh, I think she's - exactly. She's been emboldened by this administration. She feels like she has leverage. She really should be back in that original prison. There's no reason why she should have been transferred in the first place. So I'm very, very disturbed by that. I know a lot of the victims are disturbed by that, and they're disturbed by the idea that she could potentially get that clemency that she's looking for.MARTIN: Is there anything else that the committee can do to get her to answer questions and presumably truthfully?SUBRAMANYAM: Well, it's tough because we're not law enforcement, right? And, you know, I don't think she should even be allowed to plead the Fifth because she's already a convicted criminal at this point. And her habeas petition, which is what she cited, is not enough to allow her to plead the Fifth. But because we have such little leverage and we're not law enforcement, it's hard to really force her to talk to us. And, you know, she has perjured herself many times and is a liar.MARTIN: Well, to that point, a last question about this. If she is a liar, as you say, what else is there to be learned from her testimony?SUBRAMANYAM: It's a good question. I like to think that, you know, perhaps she feels some guilt at some point and decides she's going to try to do the right thing by the victims. But even in that, you know, deposition room, she looked like she had very little remorse. She looked very defiant. And she simply didn't want to talk to us.MARTIN: So let's turn to the files that you examined. What stood out to you?SUBRAMANYAM: What stood out to me was how heavily redacted the files were in an unnecessary way. There are many instances where people who were not victims were redacted. And, you know, we're not necessarily talking about famous people in many instances, but we're talking about the idea that, you know, someone who regularly traffics women was redacted for some reason because they themselves were a woman. That happened many times in the files. And so I think the DOJ needs to go back and unredact a lot of these files. The reality is, they, I think, made the assumption that perhaps just because someone was a woman doesn't - means that they were also a victim. And that's simply not the case. Something else that kept coming up was, you know, entire pages, entire blocks of text were redacted when that wasn't necessary either. And so I think these redactions were not in accordance with the law or the spirit of the law, and certainly not the transparency the American people need.MARTIN: Do you have authority to make some of this information public yourself? And if so, how would you decide what should be made public?SUBRAMANYAM: Well, remember, as part of the Oversight Committee, we subpoenaed the administration for the release of the files to us so that, you know, we could do some of the work of redacting the files and not leave it to Department of Justice that we simply don't trust at this point, but they never complied with that subpoena. So I do believe that I have the ability and right to release, you know, some of the things that were unredacted. I've seen other members that have released, you know, at least hints of what was in redacted files. I think the question that we're all pondering is, you know, what is the right way to do that? You know, some of these names are folks that I simply don't know who they are. I wouldn't want to presume that they're not a victim, either, and I'd want to do some more research. So one of the things that is paramount for us is making sure that we take the time to not identify victims or...MARTIN: OK.SUBRAMANYAM: ...Hurt victims in any way.MARTIN: That is Congressman Suhas Subramanyam of Virginia. He is a Democrat. And thank you so much for joining us.SUBRAMANYAM: Thank you.MARTIN: And I do want to note that NPR has reached out to Republican leaders in Congress and the Department of Justice.

Today's top stories   The Department of Homeland Security's funding will run out on Friday after Democrats refused to approve the money without significant changes to immigration enforcement.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he will start prepping a short-term funding bill as a backup option. Democrats face an uphill battle with their demands for officers to display identifying information like their last name and a ban on face masks. Many Republicans view these requests as nonstarters. Sprunt says she is watching how GOP lawmakers question top immigration officials today. While they largely back President Trump's enforcement actions, Republicans have to navigate new polling that shows a majority of Americans believe those same tactics have gone too far.   The latest release of Epstein files threatens Britain's ruling government. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces calls for his resignation. He is not implicated in the Epstein files, but he appointed someone who is.    \n   🎧 The calls for Starmer's resignation are due to his decision to make Peter Mandelson the ambassador to Washington, NPR's Lauren Frayer says. Mandelson faces police investigation for allegedly passing sensitive U.K. government details to Jeffrey Epstein. Mandelson denies any wrongdoing. He resigned from his role last year after revelations that he maintained his friendship with Epstein following Epstein's sex crimes conviction. Police are also investigating former Prince Andrew, who also appears in the files, over whether he leaked sensitive information to Epstein when he was the U.K. trade envoy.   Today show host Savannah Guthrie released another video on Instagram yesterday pleading for the public's help in the search for her mom. She posted the video around the time a deadline outlined in a ransom message passed. Nancy Guthrie, 84, was last seen near her Arizona home on Jan. 31.    🎧 NPR's Bill Chappell says there is no sense that authorities are any closer to finding Nancy, even though multiple local and federal agencies are working on the case. Several media outlets have received ransom messages since Nancy was reported missing. At least one included details about the scene at her home. The FBI says it is taking the messages seriously, but it is not clear that they came from people who took Nancy.   \n   Immigration courts abruptly moved up hearings for dozens of asylum cases filed by Somali migrants over the weekend, according to four lawyers NPR interviewed. Lawyers in Minnesota, Illinois and Nebraska received notices that hearings set for 2028 and others that were not scheduled yet are now happening this month or next. The attorneys fear that the rapid scheduling may stifle due process for their clients. While more than 100 cases have been affected, the attorneys expect that number to climb much higher.

Republicans keep losing special elections and are retiring at a faster rate than Democrats. Voters say they prefer Democrats to control Congress. Democrats' hopes of taking over the House are growing by the day, while the Senate remains a longer shot. Republicans face an uphill battle, particularly to retain control of the House.    ➡️ An NPR poll showed 36% of respondents approved of Trump's handling of the economy, but a majority said tariffs hurt it. Americans name the economy as their top concern.➡️ So far, 51 members of the House have announced they are leaving their seats going into the 2026 election cycle: 30 Republicans and 21 Democrats.➡️ The president's popularity is an important indicator of electoral success in midterms.

And it's got us thinking about the power of the Fed chair, and where that power comes from.   On paper at least, the chair of the Fed doesn't seem like he or she should be that powerful. The Federal Reserve Act, which created America's central bank, established a bunch of limits on the authority of any one person to shape our economy.   The Fed chair, for example, only has one out of 12 votes on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the crucial decision-making body that sets interest rates. One of 12! It's hard enough for me and a small group of my friends to pick which movie to watch. I can't even imagine trying to convince a majority of eggheads — at least seven — on some fancy committee what the proper interest-rate policy should be to achieve the Fed's dual, sometimes-conflicting mandate of low, stable inflation and a strong labor market. That said, the Fed chair obviously does more than just try and herd cats on this important committee.   \n   And, so, we've been wondering, is the Fed chair actually that powerful? And, if so, why?   Princeton University economist Alan Blinder researches and teaches about the Fed (he's been a frequent guest on Planet Money). Blinder served as vice chair of the Fed back in the mid-1990s. That's the Fed's number 2, right behind the head honcho, who was then Alan Greenspan.   \"He was the boss,\" Blinder says of Greenspan. And yeah, he says, Fed chairs actually do have \"a great deal\" of power. \"Now, you wouldn't learn that by just reading the Federal Reserve Act.\"   To understand the scope of this \"great deal\" of power, we first need to make clear what \"the Fed chair\" job actually entails. The Fed chair is actually the chair of two different bodies — the Board of Governors and the FOMC. They're appointed by presidents and confirmed by the Senate to be the Chair of the Board of Governors for four-year terms. The board is made up of six other members who are also presidentially appointed and confirmed by the Senate (in staggered, 14-year terms to safeguard the institution's independence from any particular president).   The Board of Governors has a big professional staff and oversees a bunch of important financial stuff, from banking supervision and financial regulation to payment systems to economic research to the day-to-day operations of the Fed. That's one important area where the Fed chair exercises power.   \n   But Fed chairs are — by tradition, not law — also the chair of the FOMC, which, again, is arguably the most important policymaking organ of the Fed because they're the group that makes the crucial decisions about interest rates. It's where most of the exciting action is. Each year, typically at their first meeting in January, FOMC members vote on who will chair their important committee — and by long-standing tradition, they always select the Fed chair (they don't have to; more on this in a bit, because the fact that the president doesn't actually appoint the head of the FOMC could be relevant if there was ever a battle over Fed independence).   It's true, Blinder says, that the Fed chair \"only has one vote out of 12 on the FOMC and could in principle be outvoted.\" However, in practice, \"it has never happened in the history of the Federal Reserve.\"   Wow. That's worth repeating. On the crucial FOMC decisions about whether interest rates should go up or down, the Fed chair has never been outvoted!   Meanwhile, it's also extremely rare for the Fed chair to be outvoted on the Board of Governors.   David Wessel, a long-time economics journalist who now is director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution, pointed to what seems to be the last instance where the Fed chair was outvoted on the Board of Governors. That was under the chairmanship of Paul Volcker, all the way back in 1986 — the same year the band Europe released \"The Final Countdown\" and people apparently thought it was cool to wear neon spandex and leg warmers. In other words, a long time ago.   What explains the Fed chair's incredible track record?   Now, just because the Fed chair has always been in the majority at the FOMC and has almost always been in the majority at the Board of Governors doesn't mean that they're dictating to these bodies what they should do.   \n   That said, a recent working study by Cooper Howes, an economist at the Fed, and three other academic economists, analyzed FOMC meeting transcripts over a few decades. And they found that the final policy decision that the FOMC made about interest rates lined up virtually \"one-for-one with the Chair's preferred change.\" They conclude that \"while disagreement is pervasive among FOMC members, when it comes time to make a decision, the Committee largely follows the Chair's preferences.\" It confirms previous findings from other economists and political scientists, including Chappell, McGregor, and Vermilyea (2005).   Gary Richardson, an economist at UC Irvine who served as the first official historian of the Federal Reserve System, says this evidence may overstate how all-powerful Fed chairs actually are. He suggests that the Fed chair's incredible track record of triumphing in committee votes may be partly the result of a give and take between them and the other committee members. Fed chairs, he suggests, read the room in the weeks or months prior to official votes and — seeking a consensus — they reshape their own policy preferences in anticipation of what they know other committee members will want.   We were curious what people who served on the Board of Governors and FOMC had to say about this debate over the Fed chair's influence over votes.   Lael Brainard served as a member and then vice chair of the Board of Governors between 2014 and 2023, under the leadership of Fed chairs Janet Yellen and Jerome Powell. She says it's true that FOMC members can influence the Fed chair's policy preferences through their public speeches, conversations, and so on.   But, in her experience, when it came close to the FOMC meeting, the chair usually had clear preferences for what they wanted the Fed to do. They would call her and other members on the phone in the run-up to FOMC meetings to get a sense of what they were thinking and how they would likely vote on the chair's proposed actions. However, they didn't do this with \"a blank slate,\" she says. \"It was really about getting people on board with their preferences.\" In other words, they lobbied the FOMC to get what they wanted.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Lael Brainard takes the oath of office as vice chair of the Federal Reserve on May 23, 2022, in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Blinder had a similar story about Alan Greenspan. \"He had firm opinions most of the time,\" Blinder says. \"He let you know what those opinions were before you voted, so it wasn't like everyone's gonna vote and then, 'Oh, Greenspan had a different view.' No, he let everybody know. And so the choice you had when it came time to vote was whether you were gonna defy this deeply respected and exalted chairman or go along with him, even if you didn't quite agree with him.\"   \n   In short, all the sources we spoke to agreed that the Fed chair exercises a ton of power over both the FOMC and the Board of Governors, even though much of that power can't be found formally written down in the law.   So where does the Fed chair's power come from?   So why, if the Fed chair is only one of many votes in a crucial financial institution that shapes our economy, does he or she seem to have so much power over it? There are at least a few important reasons.   First, the Fed chair has power over the Fed's communications. Fed chairs are the ones who hold the important press conferences. They are the ones, who, by law, testify before Congress. They are the \"most visible figure at the Fed,\" Wessel says. Call it the economic bully pulpit.   Imagine a Fed chair going in front of microphones and cameras, and saying something like, \"Inflation is out of control, and there's nothing we can do about it.\" Markets would go bananas. People would be crying about their 401Ks. There would be pandemonium on Wall Street. Fed chairs speak for their institution, and that institution really matters for the economy. Their mouths have power — and the other board and committee members know it. That may be one reason why they tend to defer to the Chair.   Second, the Fed chair isn't just the chair. He or she is effectively the Fed's CEO, says Richardson. That is spelled out in the law: the Federal Reserve Act says the chair is the Fed's \"active executive officer.\" And just like any other CEO, the Fed chair has broad authority over day-to-day management — including significant influence over hiring, firing, and promotions among the Fed's staff. They are the staff's boss. And that authority can help Fed chairs shape which data, analyses, and reports other Fed authorities see when they vote on crucial matters.   \n   In the run up to FOMC meetings, Brainard says, committee members are given what's known as \"The Tealbook.\" Basically, it's a report, put together by the Fed's economists, that contains data, charts, and deep-dive analyses about the direction of the economy that are relevant for the votes FOMC members have to make.   Brainard says this report was always super high-quality. It's not like Fed chairs get staff to cook the books or anything like that. The data is real. \"But the data lends itself to different interpretations, particularly at turning points in the economy,\" she says. And the way the data is presented can sometimes matter. Through their sway over the staff, the chair can use the Tealbook and other staff reports to influence how members vote.   Being the Fed's chief executive also gives the Fed chair the power to make small decisions, like \"who gets parking, and who gets to park where,\" Richardson says, and big decisions, like who serves on which committees. In that recent study by Howes and colleagues, they hypothesize that FOMC dissenters are met with \"punishment\" by the chair that reduces their influence in the institution. In other words, the chair has some carrots and sticks that they may use to nudge members in directions they want.   Additionally, Fed chairs tend to serve much longer on the Board and FOMC than other members. While Governors can serve up to 14 years on the Board, most spend much less time than that. The longer tenure, Richardson says, may increase the chair's gravitas and institutional knowledge, and it may be another reason why Board and FOMC members defer to them.   Third — and importantly — the Fed chair sets meeting agendas, including proposed policy actions. \"The  Federal Open Market Committee meetings and the Board meetings are not just free-for-alls where anybody brings up anything they want,\" Blinder says. \"There's an agenda, and they stick to the agenda — and the agenda is set by the chair.\"   \n   One prominent example of why agenda control matters came after the 2008 financial crisis, when Ben Bernanke was Fed chair. Basically, the Fed cut interest rates all the way to zero — and then it couldn't push them any lower to stimulate the economy. The Fed's conventional weapon had lost its power. So Bernanke had to develop and put on the agenda an entirely new, unconventional weapon — \"Quantitative Easing\" (QE) — to try and get the economy growing again (QE was basically the Fed buying a boatload of mortgage-backed and other securities to try and push down longer-term interest rates).   Bernanke was uniquely qualified to lead this agenda, because he had spent years studying things like the Great Depression as well as Japan's more recent struggles with near-zero interest rates, which were instances where central banks found their traditional policy levers no longer worked.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke participates in a press briefing at the Federal Reserve building, on June 22, 2011, in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Wessel had a fun way of describing this. \" One way to think about it is Ben Bernanke was like the guy who was studying dinosaurs, and everybody said, 'Well, that's intellectually interesting, but who cares?' And then one day on the horizon, a Tyrannosaurus Rex shows up — and they were like, 'Well, thank God the guy in charge knows something about dinosaurs.'\"   This gave Bernanke extra gravitas. And, combined with his institutional authority and powers — he was able to put unconventional monetary policies on the agenda. While those policies proved to be controversial, he was able to convince strong majorities on both the Board of Governors and the FOMC to pursue them during a time of crisis. (Side Note: Trump nominee Kevin Warsh once served on the Fed Board and the FOMC. He voted for early rounds of QE, but later became an influential critic of the policy).   Finally, and relatedly, the Fed chair has shown an incredible power to build consensus within the decision-making bodies of the Fed. We alluded to this before when we shared the incredible fact that the Fed chair has never been outvoted on the FOMC and has rarely been outvoted at the Board of Governors.   \n   One big reason for this consensus, Blinder says, is a tradition of deferring to the chair. \"The belief on the Fed is that it's damaging to the institution to defy the chair.\"   Brainard agreed that there's an institutional norm on supporting the chair, especially in difficult moments for the economy. \"There is — for people like myself —  a desire to show some unity and support for the chair — even if you might have modest differences in terms of where you think that outcome should be,\" Brainard says.   Fed officials are public servants, and they know their actions and words can have huge effects on the economy. The Fed is most powerful and effective when it speaks with one voice. Speaking with one voice is a clear and powerful signal to markets, and officials like Brainard have deferred to the chair because they believe it helps \"shore up the strength and credibility of the institution.\"   For example, Brainard says, back in 2015, when she was fresh on the Board of Governors, she faced a difficult decision about whether to support raising interest rates. Fed Chair Janet Yellen had \"put in place a lot of communications and work to prepare to raise rates for the first time since the Great Financial Crisis,\" Brainard says. At the same time, markets were looking a tad bit shaky. \"So I thought it was the wrong moment to raise rates,\" she says. \"But because it was so significant that it was the first interest rate rise since the Great Financial Crisis, I thought it was very important to show solidarity and support of the chair, defer to her judgment and move forward with that.\"   Part of this tendency of members to defer to and support the chair depends on who is actually selected to serve in these positions. For example, President Trump appointed Stephen Miran last year, and since then Miran has defied the tradition of consensus and become a consistent dissenting vote against Chairman Jerome Powell, pushing the Fed to more forcefully cut interest rates.   \n   A new Fed chair   So, yeah, historically, the Fed chair has really mattered for the actions of America's central bank. But much of their authority boils down to a kind of soft power, which is a product of tradition, norms, and the social and political dynamics of serving in these bodies. In extreme circumstances — like, say, if a president tried to strip the Fed of independence and forced them to pursue inflationary policies — that could change.   \"The chairman depends on the loyalty and respect of the other people on the FOMC,\" Wessel says. \"And if we had a chairman who was really out to lunch, then I think we would learn the chair's power is limited  by his ability to command the respect of the committee.  So the challenge that every new Fed chair has coming in is that the institution is loyal to the chair. They give you the benefit of the doubt, but if it turns out that they think you're nuts or irresponsible, they can turn on the chair and make it impossible for him to get his way.\"   In other words, within the internal structure of the Fed lies a dormant power that could be awakened.   Over much of the past year, President Trump has been pressuring Jerome Powell to lower interest rates and many believe it's not a coincidence that there's now a federal criminal investigation of cost overruns in a major Fed building renovation project pursued under his tenure. Indeed, Jerome Powell released a statement and said, \"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.\" Trump has also sought to fire Biden appointee Lisa Cook from the Board of Governors. It's all been pretty unprecedented, and, within that context, the nuances of the Fed's structure have gotten more focus.   \n   For example, the fact that the Fed chair doesn't, by law, have to be the head of the FOMC was cited by some observers as a potential way for the Fed to safeguard their independence and fight President Trump's push to get them to lower interest rates. Many fear that handing the Fed's power to President Trump — or, really, any president — would ultimately result in worse inflation and be damaging to the economy (check out this Planet Money Spotify playlist of episodes about Fed independence).   Jason Ma, writing over at Fortune, stressed that Jerome Powell's term as Fed Governor ends in 2028, and, even if he was replaced as Fed chair by a Trump ally who wanted to push rates to the floor, it would be possible for Powell to continue serving as FOMC chair and command the necessary majority to fight that.   However, President Trump's recent nomination of Kevin Warsh seems to have tamped down on this talk.   \" This view of a possible civil war on the FOMC has been greatly diminished by the nomination of Kevin Warsh,\" Blinder says.   That's because Warsh previously served on the Fed's Board of Governors and FOMC, has a track record of caring a lot about runaway inflation, and he's well respected. Plus, Blinder says, he's personable and isn't the type of person who would bang on the table at FOMC meetings.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Kevin Warsh (to the left), then a Fed official, talks with then-EU Finance Minister Elena Salgado during the G-20 meetings in 2010.\n                \n                    Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   For many, Trump's selection of Warsh was surprising, considering the president has been urging a more dovish stance at the Fed for significantly lower interest rates — and Warsh has a reputation as an inflation hawk.   That said, nobody knows what sort of conversations Warsh has had with President Trump, whether he would have a stiff backbone in the face of presidential pressure, and what decisions Warsh will ultimately make if he gets approved by the Senate and takes the big job.   \n   One thing is for sure though: the job he does will significantly matter for all of us.\n",

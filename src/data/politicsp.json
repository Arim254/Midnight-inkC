A White House official not authorized to speak on the record confirmed the pardon was granted and the Federal Bureau of Prisons confirmed his release on Monday.   Hernández, who served two terms as the leader of the Central American nation, had been sentenced to 45 years for conspiring to import cocaine to the United States.   The pardon of such a high-profile convicted drug trafficker, however, has led to accusations of deceit and hypocrisy by the Trump administration as it comes while the president and his team continue to escalate his military campaign against drug trafficking out of Venezuela.   \n   Critics argue the pardon of Hernández undermines the administration's claims that they are focused on ending drug trafficking. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, called the decision \"shocking.\"   \"He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in U.S. courts, and less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narcotrafficking,\" Kaine said Sunday on CBS' 'Face the Nation.'   Hernández's time in office briefly overlapped with Trump's first term. In that time, Hernández fostered support from the Trump administration after joining a small group of nations and moved the Honduran embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.   Trump criticized Hernández's prosecution, telling reporters last week that people he respects told him Hernández was \"treated very harshly and unfairly.\"   One of those people is likely Roger Stone, his long time political adviser, who lobbied for Hernández release. Stone shared on his radio show that he delivered a four-page letter from Hernández claiming he was the victim of wrongful conviction and \"lawfare by the Biden-Harris administration.\"    \n   Trump teased the pardon in a social media post on last week: \"CONGRATULATIONS TO JUAN ORLANDO HERNANDEZ ON YOUR UPCOMING PARDON,\" he wrote…. \"MAKE HONDURAS GREAT AGAIN!\"   According to court documents, Hernández abused his position to facilitate importation of tons of cocaine into the United States. In exchange, he received millions of dollars in drug money from some of the largest and most violent drug-trafficking organizations in the hemisphere.   Judge P. Kevin Castel, who presided over the case, described Hernández as a \"two-faced politician hungry for power.\" Former Attorney General Merrick Garland stated that Hernández \"abused his presidency to operate the country as a narco-state where violent traffickers operated with near-total impunity.\"   Hernández has long maintained that he was innocent of the charges. He had been appealing his conviction while serving his sentence at the U.S. Penitentiary Hazelton in West Virginia.   It is far from the first time one of Trump's pardons has drawn scrutiny. He has pardoned a number of political and business allies since returning to office, prompting some accusations that Trump's operating a pay to play scheme.   They include MAGA loyalists, a cryptocurrency executive with ties to his family's crypto firm and dozens of allies who tried to overturn his 2020 election loss to former President Joe Biden.\n",

Hegseth's social media post from Sunday shows the turtle, clad in tactical gear, standing on a helicopter and aiming a rocket-propelled grenade at one of several boats in the water below. It's designed to look like an edition of the children's book, but titled Franklin Targets Narco Terrorists.   \n   \"For your Christmas wish list …\" Hegseth wrote in the caption, as he faces growing scrutiny over the legality of a set of strikes on a suspected drug boat in the Caribbean in early September.   \n   On Monday, Toronto-based publishing house Kids Can Press released a statement defending Franklin as a \"beloved Canadian icon who has inspired generations of children and stands for kindness, empathy and inclusivity.\"   \"We strongly condemn any denigrating, violent or unauthorized use of Franklin's name or image, which directly contradicts these values,\" it added.   Franklin, who usually wears a red neckerchief and baseball cap (not a ballistic helmet), has delighted kids since the debut of his book series in 1986 — with dozens of titles including Franklin Goes to School and Franklin Wants a Pet — and an animated TV series a decade later.   \n   It is not clear why Hegseth — who is a father and stepfather of seven children — chose the turtle of all characters, though Franklin book covers have inspired some popular parodies in the past.   When asked for comment, chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell told NPR over email: \"We doubt Franklin the Turtle wants to be inclusive of drug cartels… or laud the kindness and empathy of narco-terrorists.\"   A number of Democrats were quick to condemn the post, as well as the larger controversy behind it.   \n   Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, who has openly sparred with the Pentagon in recent weeks, told reporters that the meme is just one reason why the defense secretary should be fired, calling him \"not a serious person.\"   \n   \"He is in the national command authority for nuclear weapons and he's putting out … turtles with rocket-propelled grenades,\" Kelly said.   Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, speaking on the floor Monday, called Hegseth a \"national embarrassment\" and described the Franklin meme as a \"sick parody.\"   \"Tweeting memes in the middle of a potential armed conflict is something no serious military leader would ever even think of doing,\" Schumer added. \"The only thing this tweet accomplishes is to remind the whole world that Pete Hegseth is not up to the job.\"   Questions mount over September incident   Hegseth was already in the hot seat, facing bipartisan scrutiny and questions from Congress about what happened — and whether any war crimes were committed — on Sept. 2, when the U.S. carried out the first of over 20 strikes on alleged drug vessels.   U.S. officials have described their targets as \"narcoterrorists\" from Latin America, though they have not released information about who was on board those boats or evidence that they were ferrying drugs.   Trump administration officials originally described the first attack as a single strike on a Venezuelan vessel that killed 11 alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang. But in the ensuing weeks, as the U.S. has shared grainy videos of the growing number of strikes on vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific, more questions and revelations emerged about the one that started it.   \n   Last week, the Washington Post reported — and a source confirmed to NPR — that Hegseth gave a spoken directive to kill the surviving occupants of the boat with a second strike. Attacking \"wounded, sick or shipwrecked\" combatants violates the law of war, according to a Pentagon manual.   Hegseth denied those reports as \"fabricated, inflammatory and derogatory,\" saying U.S. operations in the Caribbean are \"lawful under both U.S. and international law … and approved by the best military and civilian lawyers, up and down the chain of command.\"   \n   But that didn't satisfy lawmakers, several of whom — on both sides of the aisle — raised concerns about a potential war crime. Over the weekend, both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees opened investigations into the incident.   Then, on Monday, the White House confirmed that there had been a second strike, but attributed the directive to another military leader.   \n   White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Hegseth had authorized Adm. Mitch Bradley — who led Joint Special Operations Command at the time — to conduct the strikes, adding that Bradley \"worked well within his authority and the law.\" Later that day, Hegseth tweeted in \"100% support\" of Bradley and his combat decisions.   But a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly has since disputed the White House's account, telling NPR's Tom Bowman that Hegseth issued the command for \"two strikes to kill\" and two additional strikes to \"sink the boat.\"   For his part, President Trump has defended Hegseth but distanced himself from the incident. When asked by reporters on Sunday night whether he would be okay with Hegseth having ordered a second strike, Trump said, \"He said he didn't do it, so I don't have to make that decision.\"   Adm. Bradley, who was promoted to commander of U.S. Special Operations Command a month after the incident, is scheduled to provide a classified briefing to lawmakers on Thursday.\n",

Historically, Tennessee's 7th Congressional District is a fairly conservative district that gave President Trump roughly 60% of the vote last November. Former Rep. Mark Green, who resigned in July, won by a similar margin.    But in more recent history, Democrats have overperformed their 2024 margins in special elections this year by an average of 13% and are coming off a string of high-profile victories in races up and down the ballot last month.   \n   That dynamic means the race between Republican former state Department of General Services Commissioner Matt Van Epps and Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn has captured national attention in the closing weeks of the campaign.    In final stretch, outside money floods race    According to the latest Federal Election Commission data, outside groups have spent more than $6.5 million on the race, including more than $1.6 million from the pro-Trump MAGA Inc. super PAC. Two-thirds of the total super PAC spending has come in the last two weeks of the race as early voting picked up in earnest.    Scant public polling of a typically lower-turnout special election coupled with a less reliable sense of who will make up the electorate has also added pressure on both parties to squeeze out every vote in what could be a tight race.    An Emerson College poll released last week found Van Epps slightly ahead of Behn but within the margin of error among voters surveyed. Surveys released in October from Democratic-aligned firms showed Van Epps with an 8-point advantage, roughly in line with the average Democratic special election overperformance this year.   \n   Campaigns focus on cost of living   The closing sprint of the race has seen a slew of surrogates make campaign stops and virtual appearances to support the candidates. Former Vice President Kamala Harris and Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin attended canvassing events for Behn last month, while former Vice President Al Gore and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez headlined a Zoom rally Monday evening.    House Speaker Mike Johnson held a get-out-the-vote rally Monday morning for Van Epps that featured Trump calling on speakerphone to proclaim that the \"whole world is watching Tennessee right now.\"    \n   Both parties are making affordability a top issue in the race, especially on the airways. Van Epps has embraced Trump's endorsement while also focusing his closing message on the economy.    In one ad, Van Epps decried \"career politicians\" and promised to \"bring down prices, create good paying jobs, and lower health care costs for working families.\"   Behn's closing ad promised that she would \"shake up Washington\" by \"making health care more affordable, bringing down the cost of living, and protect workers and small businesses from job-killing tariffs.\"   During a Monday evening telephone rally for Van Epps, Trump dismissed affordability as something Democrats mentioned to distract from what he said are his administration's numerous accomplishments.    \"They like to talk about affordability,\" Trump said in the Monday evening tele-rally for Van Epps. \"To them it's just a con job, it's just a word.\"\n",

The Supreme Court is weighing the future of President Trump's tariffs on nearly all imports. Justices seemed skeptical about the tariffs' legality during last month's oral arguments. Lower courts had previously found that Trump had improperly used emergency economic powers to set most of the new levies.   \n   Dozens of companies across industries have filed lawsuits to seek refunds in the event that the Supreme Court finds Trump's tariffs illegal. The list includes makeup giant Revlon, canned-foods maker Bumble Bee and Kawasaki, which makes motorcycles and more. Now Costco has joined the queue.   \"This is the first time we're seeing big companies take their heads out of the sand publicly,\" said Marc Busch, a trade law expert at Georgetown University. For the most part, small companies have been leading the legal action against tariffs, he said, adding, \"It's nice to finally see some heavyweights joining in the fray.\"   In its suit filed with the U.S. Court of International Trade, Costco did not specify how much it has already paid in tariffs. But the retail giant worries that even if the Supreme Court eventually unravels Trump's tariff regime, it may not be able to recoup all that money.    Costco executives in May had said that about a third of what it sells in the U.S. comes from abroad, predominantly nonfood items.   NPR's Scott Horsley contributed to this report.\n",

    "body": "\n      President Trump met with his advisors Monday to discuss next steps with Venezuela as lawmakers continue to raise concerns about the administration's military strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea.   \n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  President Trump and his advisers met yesterday evening to discuss next steps with Venezuela.LEILA FADEL, HOST:  The meeting comes amid growing tension between the two countries. For months, the Trump administration has conducted deadly strikes against what it claims are drug boats traveling from Venezuela to the U.S., and there's a military buildup off the coast of Venezuela. Coming up, we'll speak with Representative Adam Smith about questions he has over the legality of the attacks. Let's first get to the latest facts.MARTÍNEZ: NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben is here. So, Danielle, tell us about the meeting over Venezuela.DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Well, there's not much to tell right now. We do know the meeting had been set to be with Trump's national security team, so that would include people like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio. But Trump has said he spoke to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro last week, but Trump wouldn't say much more. All that said, it was likely not a friendly call. Trump has long railed against the authoritarian leader. And Maduro, for his part, thinks the U.S. is aiming for regime change in his country, and he's accused the U.S. of using this pretext of fighting drug traffickers to seize his country's oil reserves.MARTÍNEZ: Now, you mentioned Secretary Pete Hegseth in connection to that meeting about Venezuela. He's getting some heat for strikes on one of those boats. Take us through why.KURTZLEBEN: Sure. So on Friday, The Washington Post reported that on September 2, U.S. forces struck one of those boats, leaving survivors afterwards, and so Hegseth gave an order to kill those survivors. Now, NPR later confirmed that Hegseth had ordered both strikes. All of that matters because, as Congress members from both parties have said, that second strike may have constituted a war crime. Meanwhile, the Department of Defense in that Washington Post story said that, quote, \"this entire narrative is completely false.\"MARTÍNEZ: Now, what did we learn from the White House yesterday?KURTZLEBEN: Well, the administration then confirmed some parts of this story. At yesterday's press briefing, press secretary Karoline Leavitt acknowledged a second strike. But as for Hegseth ordering it, she didn't deny it but said Hegseth authorized U.S. Navy Admiral Frank M. Bradley to take these actions.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KAROLINE LEAVITT: Secretary Hegseth authorized Admiral Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes. Admiral Bradley worked well within his authority and the law, directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated.KURTZLEBEN: But our NPR colleague Tom Bowman has new reporting on this. Yesterday, a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly pushed back on the White House, saying Hegseth gave the command for two strikes to kill in addition to two strikes to sink the boat.MARTÍNEZ: OK. So we have all that. And just a few weeks ago, Democratic Congress members with military or intelligence backgrounds released a video telling service members to refuse illegal orders. Trump called that video seditious behavior punishable by death. Have they responded to the latest developments?KURTZLEBEN: Yes. Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly, a retired naval officer who was in that video, spoke about this yesterday. When a reporter asked him about the strikes, Kelly said, if the reporting is accurate, that second strike could have been illegal.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARK KELLY: I will say, though, you know, as somebody who has sunk two ships myself, folks in the military need to understand the law of the sea, the Geneva Conventions, what the law says.KURTZLEBEN: And leaders of the Senate and House Armed Services Committees have said they're going to be looking into these strikes, and Admiral Bradley is expected to give a classified briefing on Thursday. So we may know more about them in the weeks ahead.MARTÍNEZ: All right. That's NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. Thanks a lot.KURTZLEBEN: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Watters later testified under oath he never found such claims credible.\n                \n                    John Lamparski/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        John Lamparski/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   The allegations carry a familiar ring: Fox News aired outrageous lies that an election software company rigged votes in the 2020 presidential elections for Democratic nominee Joe Biden.   Behind the scenes, Fox News' controlling owners, executives and biggest stars didn't believe the wild claims from President Trump and his allies. Nonetheless, the voting tech company's officials received death threats. Its reputation and financial prospects were badly damaged.   These claims are contained in legal filings at the heart of a hearing that will take place in a Manhattan courtroom Tuesday afternoon over whether a multi-billion dollar defamation lawsuit against Fox News should be allowed to proceed to a full jury trial.   \n   The lawsuit is being brought by Smartmatic, a London-based voting technology firm that played a limited role in the 2020 race but was, nonetheless, accused on Fox shows of taking votes away from Trump and throwing them to Biden. Smartmatic is suing for $2.7 billion.   The reason these allegations are so familiar is that the company's claims closely echo those from a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems. Fox News stars and their on-air guests also blamed that company for Trump's loss, as they served up a stew of baseless conspiracy theories about the election.   \n   In both the Dominion and Smartmatic suits, Fox's top hosts and executives were revealed to have desperately sought to appease the network's pro-Trump viewers. Viewers peeled away from Fox in droves after it became the first major U.S network to project that Biden would prevail in the key state of Arizona on election night in 2020. Trump attacked Fox and encouraged his fans to tune into right-wing alternatives like Newsmax and OANN instead.   \n   In 2023, a Delaware judge found that Fox had defamed Dominion ahead of the trial. On the eve of the trial – and founder Rupert Murdoch's scheduled public testimony – Fox paid $787.5 million to resolve the case. The sum is considered to be a record in U.S. media litigation.   The network made no admission of error but released this statement: \"We acknowledge the Court's rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false.\"   Smartmatic sued Fox News in February 2021, before Dominion did, but the Dominion case moved briskly through Delaware's streamlined trial system. Smartmatic named several co-defendants, including such stars as the late Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo and Jeanine Pirro, along with Trump's legal advisers Rudolph Giuliani and Sidney Powell, who were frequent guests.   \n   In past remarks, Fox has pointed to what it says are clear distinctions between the two defamation cases: different jurisdictions, different judges, and different plaintiffs.   \"The evidence shows that Smartmatic's business and reputation were badly suffering long before any claims by President Trump's lawyers on Fox News and that Smartmatic grossly inflated its damage claims to generate headlines and chill free speech,\" Fox News said in a statement released through a spokesperson. \"We are eager and ready to continue defending our press freedoms.\"   \n   As in the Dominion case, Fox has argued its hosts were engaging in legitimate coverage of newsworthy claims by newsworthy figures — the president and his legal advisers — and those claims had not yet worked its way through various legal proceedings. Trump's campaign and his allies lost almost every legal and procedural challenge they filed to the election results.   In its court documents, Fox has also directed much of its legal energies to disputing Smartmatic's claims about the voting technology company's financial health, prospects and damages. And the network's legal filings have questioned the firm's stated origins and its actions abroad.   In October, federal prosecutors charged Smartmatic in a scheme to pay more than $1 million in bribes to a Philippine government official for contracts related to the 2016 national elections there. Company officials denied the allegations, contending the charges were \"targeted, political and unjust.\"   New York State Supreme Court Justice David B. Cohen rejected Fox's request to put a hold on the litigation until after those criminal charges were fully tried.   Evidence shows stars had doubts   Smartmatic was operating in just one jurisdiction in the U.S. during the 2020 elections: Los Angeles County, which was all but guaranteed to swing toward Biden in a heavily Democratic state. The company says it was on the brink of making big gains in the U.S. and abroad after the elections — only to have those business aspirations dashed by the way in which Fox stars amplified wild and unfounded claims from Trump allies.   Fox never retracted the claims. After Smartmatic threatened to sue, Fox aired an unusual segment featuring Eddie Perez, an outside voting technology and integrity expert. Perez was questioned by an off-camera producer. Perez shot down one allegation after another about Smartmatic. Fox broadcast it on the shows hosted by Bartiromo, Dobbs, and Pirro.   \n   Perez told NPR he did not consider the segment a correction, but he said he was glad to offer Fox viewers accurate information after it so frequently ran what he considered election disinformation.   Evidence submitted in court filings suggests that, inside Fox, few believed the wild claims made on the air. Senior Fox executives and even its stars made clear privately they knew that Trump had lost, according to testimony and exchanges presented in the public record. The filings also reflect the way in which Fox stars saw their interests aligning with the interests of the Republican Party under Trump, even when they did not always agree with what he was saying.   Host Jesse Watters texted Fox News comic host Greg Gutfeld, \"Think about how incredible our ratings would be if Fox went ALL in on STOP THE STEAL,\" according to legal filings. Watters later testified under oath he never found such claims credible.   In court documents, Pirro was revealed to have lobbied then-Republican National Committee Chairperson Ronna McDaniel weeks ahead of the election to purchase copies of her book in bulk, as the RNC had done for Fox's Sean Hannity.   \"I'm the Number 1 watched show on all news cable all weekend,\" Pirro texted, according to court records. \"I work so hard for the President and party.\" McDaniel demurred. (The exchange was first reported by The Guardian.)   Once Trump refused to accept the results of the election, Pirro — a former prosecutor — was among those who repeatedly amplified the false claims of fraud. She later testified that she did not think Trump was cheated of victory. Pirro is now the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia.   \"Fox executives and its personalities have consistently lied to their viewers,\" a spokesperson for Smartmatic said in a statement to NPR earlier this fall. \"They knew what they were saying was untrue when they were willingly destroying Smartmatic's reputation, though when under oath they admitted they knew better the whole time.\"   \n   Workplace survey reveals worries inside Fox   According to its court filings, Smartmatic's legal teams also unearthed a Fox News workplace survey from summer 2020 — as Trump ran for re-election — in which numerous staffers complained about the network's bias.   \"We need a recalibration of our standards of conduct for our on-air talent, as well as the truthfulness of our reporting,\" one Fox employee wrote. \"It often feels like our editorial view and specifically our on-air talent has changed to just working for the current administration and will say anything that will be flattering to them. It seems like there's a fear that we cannot anger the president or his most zealous supporters, and have abdicated all pretense of truthful reporting; often allowing guests to say lies unchallenged, or saying false information ourselves to the detriment of our reputation.\"   Other colleagues complained about cheerleading by Fox personalities and objected to multiple on-air stars \"covertly advising\" the president.   In court documents, Fox's attorneys called the remarks incomplete and said they represented a cherrypicked handful of negative remarks. Fox noted it was designated a \"Great Place to Work\" by the organization conducting the workplace survey.   The day after Smartmatic sued Fox, the Fox Business Network canceled Dobbs' show. Dobbs was never seen on Fox airwaves again. He died in July 2024.   Fox has a record of playing hardball but ultimately settling cases close to trial, as it did — albeit very late in the game — in the Dominion case. (The Murdochs did much the same before settling with Prince Harry and a prominent British politician in January in a case involving their U.K. newspapers.) The company, so far, is maintaining a similar public stance in this case, gambling that Smartmatic's own shortcomings will help forestall the need for a similar outcome.\n",

Several studies suggest that people in red states have more babies than those in blue states. And now a new report from a conservative-leaning group argues that that could have implications for politics and culture in the U.S. down the road. NPR political correspondent Sarah McCammon has been following this and joins us now. Hi there.SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Hey, Juana.SUMMERS: Hey there. So Sarah, just start by telling us, what is the connection between where people fall on the political spectrum and the number of kids they have?MCCAMMON: Yeah. So several studies in recent years have pointed to higher fertility rates in red states, and that's especially true since the COVID pandemic. Now a new report from the conservative-leaning Institute for Family Studies argues that young adults who identify as conservative are having more babies than their liberal counterparts. Brad Wilcox is a senior fellow at the institute and a co-author of the report.BRAD WILCOX: That has clear implications, you know, potentially for everything from kind of public schools to congressional districts to just sort of, again, kind of the trajectory of the country, politically and otherwise.MCCAMMON: And these authors looked at young adults ages 25 to 35 who self-identify as liberal or conservative. They found that young liberal women today are much less likely to have children than young conservative women, with a gap of more than 30 percentage points. And that's a big change since the 1980s, when there was a much smaller gap between liberal and conservative women.SUMMERS: How much could birth rates in red states or blue states predict the way people vote in the future?MCCAMMON: The theory is that children are likely to take after their parents, so this would mean more Republican voters in the future. But Melissa Deckman of the Public Religion Research Institute says that's not necessarily the case.MELISSA DECKMAN: It's very clear that states that have had more Trump votes are seeing an increase in child population. But remember, these children are not yet voters. And so if you're trying to speculate how they're going to vote in 10, 20 years, I think it's really difficult to conclude that this will advantage the Republican Party.MCCAMMON: Deckman says another huge variable is just President Trump himself because he's such a unique political figure and it's unclear what direction either party will go after he's no longer on the scene.SUMMERS: Do we know why young conservatives might be having more children than young liberals?MCCAMMON: You know, there's a lot of speculation about this. Republicans are more likely to be religious than Democrats, and there is a long-standing correlation between being more religious and having larger families. So that could be a reason. The authors of this new report argue that conservatives prioritize marriage and family in ways they say liberals may not. Leslie Root, a researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder, says the partisan divide is real, but she says the report leaves out a lot of women who choose to have their children later.LESLIE ROOT: And so I really think that looking at this small section of people 25 to 35 is playing into this narrative that there's this huge and growing disparity that's really, to my mind, not true.MCCAMMON: And by the end of their childbearing years, she says most women across the political spectrum do end up having kids. So this is a data point. It's an interesting and important one, but it's still an open question what the relationship between birth rates and political ideology will mean for U.S. politics in the long term.SUMMERS: NPR's Sarah McCammon, thanks so much.MCCAMMON: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

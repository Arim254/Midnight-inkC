It called for \"a sharp shift — in approach, focus, and tone.\" That translated to a blunt assessment that allies would take on more of the burden countering nations from Russia to North Korea.   \"For too long, the U.S. Government neglected — even rejected — putting Americans and their concrete interests first,\" read the opening sentence.   \n   It capped off a week of animosity between President Donald Trump's administration and traditional allies like Europe, with Trump threatening to impose tariffs on some European partners to press a bid to acquire Greenland before announcing a deal that lowered the temperature.   \n   As allies confront what some see as a hostile attitude from the U.S., they will almost certainly be unhappy to see that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's department will provide \"credible options to guarantee U.S. military and commercial access to key terrain,\" especially Greenland and the Panama Canal.   Following a tiff this week at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, the strategy at once urges cooperation with Canada and other neighbors while still issuing a stark warning.   \"We will engage in good faith with our neighbors, from Canada to our partners in Central and South America, but we will ensure that they respect and do their part to defend our shared interests,\" the document says. \"And where they do not, we will stand ready to take focused, decisive action that concretely advances U.S. interests.\"   Much like the White House's National Security Strategy that preceded it, the defense blueprint reinforces Trump's \"America First\" philosophy, which favors nonintervention overseas, questions decades of strategic relationships and prioritizes U.S. interests. The National Defense Strategy last was published in 2022 under then-President Joe Biden and focused on China as America's \"pacing challenge.\"   \n   Western Hemisphere   The strategy simultaneously courts help from partners in America's backyard, while warning them that the U.S. will \"actively and fearlessly defend America's interests throughout the Western Hemisphere.\"   It specifically points to access to the Panama Canal and Greenland. It comes just days after Trump said he reached a \"framework of a future deal\" on Arctic security with NATO leader Mark Rutte that would offer the U.S. \"total access\" to Greenland, a territory of NATO ally Denmark.   Danish officials, who spoke Thursday on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations, say formal negotiations have yet to begin.   Trump previously suggested that the U.S. should potentially consider retaking control of the Panama Canal and accused Panama of ceding influence to China. Asked this week if the U.S. reclaiming the canal was still on the table, Trump demurred.   \"I don't want to tell you that,\" the president responded. \"Sort of, I must say, sort of. That's sort of on the table.\"   The Pentagon also touted the operation that ousted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro earlier this month, saying \"all narco-terrorists should take note.\"   China and the greater Asia-Pacific region   The new policy document views China — which the Biden administration saw as a top adversary — as a settled force in the Indo-Pacific region that only needs to be deterred from dominating the U.S. or its allies.   The goal \"is not to dominate China; nor is it to strangle or humiliate them,\" the document says. It later adds, \"This does not require regime change or some other existential struggle.\"   \"President Trump seeks a stable peace, fair trade, and respectful relations with China,\" it says, which follows efforts to climb down from a trade war sparked by the administration's sky-high tariffs. It says it will \"open a wider range of military-to-military communications\" with China's army.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Donald Trump speaks at his Mar-a-Lago club, Saturday, Jan. 3, 2026, in Palm Beach, Fla., as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth listens.\n                \n                    Alex Brandon/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Brandon/AP\n    \n\n   \n   The strategy, meanwhile, makes no mention of or guarantee to Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its own and says it will take by force if necessary. The U.S. is obligated by its own laws to give military support to Taiwan.   \n   By contrast, the Biden administration's 2022 strategy said the U.S. would \"support Taiwan's asymmetric self-defense.\"   In another example of offloading regional security to allies, the document says, \"South Korea is capable of taking primary responsibility for deterring North Korea with critical but more limited U.S. support.\"   Europe   While saying that \"Russia will remain a persistent but manageable threat to NATO's eastern members for the foreseeable future,\" the defense strategy asserts that NATO allies are much more powerful and so are \"strongly positioned to take primary responsibility for Europe's conventional defense.\"   It says the Pentagon will play a key role in NATO \"even as we calibrate U.S. force posture and activities in the European theater\" to focus on priorities closer to home.   The U.S. already has confirmed that it will reduce its troop presence on NATO's borders with Ukraine, with allies expressing concern that the Trump administration might drastically cut their numbers and leave a security vacuum as European countries confront an increasingly aggressive Russia.\n",

He also appeared increasingly infirm in Davos.   \n\n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  Relatively balmy, cloudy with a high in the 40s today in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland. And talk of Greenland is where we begin with NPR senior contributor Ron Elving. Ron, thanks so much for being with us.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to chill out with you, Scott.SIMON: At the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, President Trump said he'd reached a framework for a deal on Greenland. What kind of deal seems to be at hand after weeks of threats of military action and tariffs and musing about buying Greenland?ELVING: We don't have all the details yet, and there's a good deal yet to be learned and assessed for significance. The U.S. looks to have more military presence beyond the Pituffik base - used to be called Thule. We have that in Greenland, and it's been part of the Distant Early Warning system for generations now. But we also expect to see more mining of strategic materials, such as the rare earths, essential to computers and other high-tech products. The deal would bolster the presence of NATO in general in the Arctic and restrict Russian and Chinese efforts to get mining rights for those rare earths in Greenland. Those two items speak to the fears expressed in a lot of President Trump's rhetoric when he was talking about seizing the territory by force.SIMON: Ron, I want to be careful about raising this, but I think it's important to ask you. President Trump rambled a lot in his remarks at Davos. He referred to Greenland as Iceland several times. He mocked the sacrifices, lives lost of U.S. allies and seemed not to know that, in fact, NATO had come to the defense of the United States after 9/11. President Biden had a shaky debate performance. There were calls from both parties for him to step down. Has President Trump's conduct made his mental health a genuine concern?ELVING: One big difference between this moment and the Biden debate is that Trump is not on the ballot in November the way Biden was. But hundreds of other Republicans are, as candidates for Congress and state offices. The Biden example is not lost on those campaigns. And they will be hearing questions. Trump will be 80 in June. People notice changes in his walk and his talk and changes on his face and his hands. Then they start noticing behavior, noticing when he loses his temper repeatedly over small things or when he says adverse polls in The New York Times are fake and fraudulent and should be treated as a criminal offense or when he goes on sending social media messages well into the wee hours.This kind of change in a president was not discussed publicly in the past. But in the wide-open ethos of 21st-century social media, Scott, nothing seems out of bounds. So we have to begin seeing mentions of the 25th Amendment, which was enacted 60 years ago to set a formal procedure in situations that might arise if the president were incapacitated. And it's only been used in temporary situations up to now, such as the president undergoing surgery.SIMON: Canada's Prime Minister Carney had strong words for the president in Davos. Brussels Thursday, President Macron of France urged his fellow EU leaders to implement economic anticoercion measures against the U.S., referred to as a trade bazooka. EU did not agree, but Germany also expressed interest. What does this tell us about the state of the U.S. among those nations usually considered its staunchest allies?ELVING: It says that no matter how politely people may smile and applaud in the audience, they do have ears and egos. World leaders, such as we saw at Davos, have national pride and personal pride, just as we do. And they don't appreciate being treated as junior partners or ungrateful children.SIMON: House Oversight Committee voted to hold Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton in contempt for refusing to comply with subpoenas in their investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. Lawyers for the Clintons say they have communicated voluntarily with the committee but that the subpoenas were a ploy to attempt to embarrass political rivals. Where does this go now?ELVING: Two senior advisers from Trump's first term went to jail rather than cooperate with Congress. I doubt anyone expects the Clinton case to go that route, but one unintended consequence could happen. It may keep the Epstein saga in the news at a time when it might have been losing some steam.SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving. Thanks so much. Take care.ELVING: Thank you, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

(AP Photo/Adam Gray)\n                \n                    Adam Gray/AP/FR172090 AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Adam Gray/AP/FR172090 AP\n    \n\n   \n   Congressional leaders are pushing back against the Trump administration's account of the killing of Alex Pretti, the 37-year-old U.S. citizen shot dead by federal officers during an immigration enforcement protest in Minneapolis Saturday.    Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., accused the administration of a \"cover up\" Sunday and said the federal government is ignoring a court order that allows state investigators to access evidence in Pretti's killing.    \"Our state investigators had to get a warrant to have access to the evidence of the shooting of Alex Pretti,\" Smith said. \"And even then, the federal agents refused to give them access to the evidence. So this looks very much like another cover up.\"   \n   Pretti's killing has prompted strong bipartisan condemnation, a forceful defense from the Trump administration and the prospect of another government shutdown, this one over funding for the Department of Homeland Security. ICE is part of DHS.    DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a reported statement Saturday that her department will lead the investigation into the killing. Meanwhile, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told CBS News Sunday that his department hasn't received any cooperation or information from the federal government.    Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., warned the Trump administration against any attempt to shut out local and state law enforcement from the investigation.    \"There must be a thorough and impartial investigation into yesterday's Minneapolis shooting,\" Tillis said in a post Sunday morning. \"Any administration official who rushes to judgment and tries to shut down an investigation before it begins are doing an incredible disservice to the nation and to President Trump's legacy.\"   Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., also called for a \"full joint federal and state investigation\" and said the \"credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake\" in a statement.     On Sunday, Trump administration officials continued to defend the federal agents who killed Pretti. The head of President Trump's immigration operation, Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino, told CNN that the federal agents are \"the victims\" and said Pretti \"perpetrated violence\" during an active immigration enforcement operation.   \n   \"That suspect injected himself into that law enforcement situation with a weapon,\" Bovino said.    The video evidence and eyewitness accounts that have surfaced so far refute that assertion. There has been no evidence that NPR has verified of Pretti brandishing his handgun at any time during the encounter with federal agents.   On Saturday, Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said if a U.S. citizen approaches law enforcement with a gun, federal officers \"will be legally justified in shooting you.\"    The powerful National Rifle Association and Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., criticized Essayli.    \"Carrying a firearm is not a death sentence, it's a Constitutionally protected God-given right, and if you don't understand this you have no business in law enforcement or government,\" Massie said on X.    Chair of the House Oversight Committee James Comer, R-Ky., suggested Sunday that Trump remove ICE from Minneapolis because local law enforcement aren't cooperating .    \"If the mayor and the governor are going to put our ICE officials in harm's way, and there's a chance of losing more innocent lives or whatever, then maybe go to another city and let the people of Minneapolis decide do we want to continue to have all of these illegals,\" Comer said on Fox News.    Congressional criticism of the White House from even a small number of House and Senate Republicans has been rare in Trump's second presidency. But it remains unclear what if anything the GOP-led Congress will do to force a local and federal investigation.   Meanwhile, Senate Democrats are poised to block government funding in response to the Minnesota killings by DHS officers.   Both the House and Senate have passed full-year funding for only some parts of the federal government — such as the Commerce, Justice, and Interior departments. But funding for some of the country's largest departments, like the Pentagon or DHS, have yet to pass the Senate.   \n   Last week, the House passed measure to fund these remaining departments. In the Senate, Republicans will need Democrats to pass the funding package — which requires at least 60 votes to advance.    \"When they're killing two constituents in my state, and they're taking 2-year-olds out of the arms of their moms, and they are taking an elder Hmong man out of his house and putting him out there in his underwear and then figuring out they have the wrong man,\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said on NBC News Sunday. \"No, I am not voting for this funding.\"   On Saturday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats would not vote to advance the spending package if it includes DHS funding.    Senate Democrats are set to hold a conference call Sunday evening to discuss their legislative strategy, according to two sources familiar with the plans but not authorized to share details publicly. If any changes are made to the spending package, the House would have to return to Capitol Hill and approve the Senate changes.    The funding deadline is Friday. \n",

Here is what to know.   The victim was an ICU nurse who loved the outdoors   Pretti, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident and an ICU nurse, has been identified by officials as the shooting victim.   The victim's father Michael Pretti told the Associated Press his son had participated in the protests because he \"cared about people deeply and he was very upset with what was happening in Minneapolis and throughout the United States with ICE, as millions of other people are upset.\"   \n   His mother, Susan Pretti, told the AP her son was passionate about the environment and \"took his dog everywhere he went.\"   Neighbors were also shocked by his death. Jeanne Wiener, who lived next door to Pretti, told MPR News that she would chat with him when he was walking his dog around their Lyndale neighborhood.   \"He was a calm person; he's a nurse,\" Wiener said Saturday. \"I'm mad. I'm angry. This was a good person. This is not a violent person.\"   Dr. Dimitri Drekonja, who worked at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center with Pretti, remembered him as an \"incredibly competent person\" who was good at his job.   \"There is no reason for a guy like that to be dead, let alone to be killed by the agents of a government that employed him,\" Drekonja also told MPR News, adding that Pretti was a sweet, kind man who loved the outdoors and mountain biking.   Pretti's parents said they were \"sickened\" by Trump administration officials suggesting their son was a \"domestic terrorist.\"   Federal officials defended Border Patrol Agents   Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem defended the officers' actions on Saturday and said they \"acted according to their training.\" Noem also accused Pretti of \"brandishing\" his weapon and that he \"attacked\" officers.   \n   \"This looks like a situation where an individual arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement,\" Noem told reporters during a press conference.   Officials said Pretti had a 9mm semiautomatic handgun with him.   Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol commander, said the officer who fired shots was \"highly trained\" and has worked as a Border Patrol agent for the last eight years. Bovino said the shooting remains under investigation.   Bystander videos don't support key details from government   Bystander videos posted on social media appear to contradict DHS' account of the shooting.   Footage appears to show Pretti being surrounded by multiple federal agents, with several restraining him and punching him while he is on the ground before he is shot. Multiple rounds of gunfire can be heard as Pretti lies on the ground.   So far, there has been no video showing that Pretti brandished or tried to use the firearm that federal officials said he had in his possession.   Minneapolis officials are questioning the DHS account   Pretti had no criminal record and his only known interaction with police involved traffic tickets, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara. He also was a lawful gun owner with a permit to legally carry a gun, O'Hara also said on Saturday.   Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said during a press conference he plans to seek a temporary restraining order from a judge on Monday that would grant \"immediate relief\" to stop the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.   Frey also said he sent a request to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for assistance from the National Guard to support \"the limited number of officers that we have in the Minneapolis Police Department.\"   Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar condemned the shooting and called for immigration officers to leave the state.   \"Our message is really clear and straightforward. We need ICE out of Minnesota,\" Klobuchar said during a press conference. \"They are not making us more safe, as the tragic, tragic killing this morning, as people saw it viscerally on that video shows us, they are making us less safe.\"   \n   Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called the shooting \"sickening\" and said the state \"has had it\" in a social media post on Saturday. Walz said he spoke with the White House about the shooting and said \"the President must end this operation.\"   Walz also said he was glad there was footage of the incident, saying: \"Thank God, thank God, we have video because, according to DHS, these seven heroic guys took an onslaught of a battalion against them or something. It's nonsense, people. It is nonsense, and it's lies.\"   This is the third ICE-related shooting in Minneapolis    It is the second killing involving federal immigration officers in Minneapolis this month after ICE officers shot Renee Macklin Good on Jan. 7 in her SUV as she drove away after partially blocking a Minneapolis street.    In another incident, Julio Cesar Sosa-Celia, a Venezuelan national, was shot in the leg by immigration officers during an altercation with those agents.   NPR's Cheryl W.

Many scholars of democracy say that these moves are unprecedented in U.S. history and that Trump has pushed the United States toward authoritarianism.    The president and his supporters counter that the Constitution provides for precisely the type of muscular presidency he is exercising and that voters gave him a mandate to enact far-reaching changes to government.   Trump remains popular with his base, but most Americans disapprove of his job performance. The president's critics hope that waning popularity — as well as this year's midterm elections — will provide a stronger check on Trump.   \n   So what has happened so far? From firing inspectors general, to sidelining Congress, to attacking the media to control information, Trump and his administration have moved at warp speed from the moment he was sworn in.   As Year 2 of his second term begins, we wanted to look at just some of the ways the president has expanded his authority beyond what his predecessors have done and how his administration has tested the constitutional foundations of the country.   CHECKS AND BALANCES   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Jackie Lay/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Aided by a pliant Republican-led Congress, Trump and his administration have numerous times stretched the power of the executive branch into areas of governance normally reserved for the legislative branch. His aides have pulled back funds appropriated by lawmakers, who constitutionally control federal purse strings. The president has implemented sweeping foreign tariffs, using existing sources of authority in new, expansive ways. And his administration has remade or demolished whole federal departments.   Other checks on a president's power, such as federal inspectors general and agency appointees who previously were insulated from White House influence, have also been sidelined.

He has intimidated major news outlets, defunded public media and made it increasingly difficult for journalists to report on his government, even threatening to jail reporters who won't identify government sources. The Trump administration has sought to erase parts of American history in the nation's museums, and the State Department was instructed to reject visa applications due to some applicants' alleged roles in \"censorship.\"    Loading... \n      RULE OF LAW   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Jackie Lay/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Trump has bulldozed through a norm separating the White House and the Department of Justice, openly using the DOJ to pursue an agenda of retribution by seeking investigations and prosecutions of his political foes. He has liberally used the pardon power to the benefit of allies, including those who were convicted of violent crimes during the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. Federal judges have accused the Trump administration of defying their orders and rebuked the administration for aggressive immigration tactics and attempts to consolidate Americans' sensitive data. And while Trump says he is overseeing a return of law and order, he frequently uses inciting language himself.

His name and face seem to be everywhere. He receives fawning foreign visitors bearing gifts for him in a newly gold-adorned Oval Office.   And Trump continues to flex his power by mixing policy with the business interests of his family and allies, casting aside any ethical concerns.    Loading... \n      PUBLIC HEALTH AND SCIENCE   The Trump administration has upended the institutions charged with protecting public health and conducting scientific research. Initiatives that once enjoyed bipartisan support and are the shared responsibility of the states and the federal government saw their funding slashed. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. led the overhaul of the children's vaccine schedule, sidelining expert advisers and slashing the number of recommended immunizations. There have been disruptions and turmoil for federally funded research, including at the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The administration abruptly halted USAID's global health work, which had saved millions of lives from scourges like AIDS, malaria and malnutrition over the course of six decades.

But among federal leaders, the questions appear only to be coming from Democrats. The lack of widespread inquiry over policies that may have factored into a high-profile death involving a federal agent has drawn comparisons to another episode, more than 30 years ago, that prompted sweeping changes.   \n   In August of 1992, in an incident often referred to as \"Ruby Ridge,\" armed federal officers were engaged in an 11-day standoff outside a cabin in northern Idaho. The agents were tasked with arresting Randall Weaver, a white separatist, over his failure to appear in court on charges that he illegally sold firearms to an undercover government agent. Ultimately, three people died: a deputy U.S. marshall, Weaver's 14-year-old son and Weaver's wife. Weaver had connections to the neo-Nazi Aryan Nations and held antisemitic, anti-government beliefs. Though many in policy-making and legislative positions may have found his views repellant, that did not distract from bipartisan concern that the federal enforcement operation may have overstepped constitutional bounds.   \"If you take the rules of engagement [at Ruby Ridge] on their face and in a vacuum, they are unconstitutional,\" then-Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick testified during an October, 1995 Senate subcommittee hearing about the incident. It was during those hearings that Gorelick announced to senators that the Department of Justice had, as a result, formulated its first \"uniform, written deadly force policy\" applicable to all of its law enforcement agencies.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                This Aug. 23, 1992, file photo shows Randy Weaver supporters at Ruby Ridge in northern Idaho. A 1992 standoff in the remote mountains of northern Idaho left a 14-year-old boy, his mother and a federal agent dead and sparked the expansion of radical right-wing groups across the country.\n                \n                    Jeff T. Green/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jeff T. Green/AP\n    \n\n   \n   \"The paramount value of human life\"   John Cox, a retired FBI agent, began his career at that agency two months after the DOJ's new use-of-force policy took effect.   \n   \"The use-of-force policy for the department started from the notion of the paramount value of human life, that we're holding that top of mind,\" Cox said.   Cox, who had previously been an assistant U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., before pivoting to the FBI, served as an agent there for seven years. He said through training scenarios, the agency taught them that deadly force may only be used when the subject of the force presents an imminent danger to the officer or another person. But Cox said the instruction went even further, to impress upon new recruits that they could only use deadly force when there was no safe alternative available to them.   \"It was stricter than the constitutional standard, so it actually restricted when you could use deadly force in accordance with the policy because you were elevating and honoring human life, and that's what you were trying to preserve,\" Cox said. \"So there were instances where maybe constitutionally you could use deadly force, but the policy said no.\"   Cox said during his career as an agent, he encountered situations where targets threatened him or others. In some of those cases, where firing a weapon would have created risk to himself or others nearby, Cox said his training supported the judgment that it was safer to let the target go. In at least two cases, he was able to arrest the target later that day, or the next day.   Cox said that had Jonathan Ross, the immigration enforcement agent who fired at Good, been an FBI agent, the department would look particularly at his position at the time of shooting.   \"Without knowing all the facts – and I don't know all the facts – if stepping out of the way was a reasonable alternative, then, under the policy that I was trained on, the department would have expected you to step out of the way,\" he said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent-in-charge Gene Glenn talks to reporters in Naples, Idaho on Aug. 30, 1992.\n                \n                    Gary Stewart/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Gary Stewart/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Looking at DHS use-of-force policy   In 2023, during President Joe Biden's term, the DHS updated its use-of-force policy. It emphasized the importance of \"no reasonably effective, safe, and feasible alternative\" in its framework, and \"respect for human life\" as first among its general principles. However, the policy was an administrative update, not codified by statute. Since President Trump took office, his administration has taken a starkly different posture.   \n   In the days following Good's death, White House adviser Stephen Miller addressed the issue during an appearance on Fox News. The Department of Homeland Security's X account reposted the clip.   \"To all ICE officers: you have federal immunity in the conduct of your duties,\" Miller said. \"Anybody who lays a hand on you or tries to stop you or tries to obstruct you is committing a felony.\"   Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., told NPR she believes this has created space for Congress to act. She and Rep. Seth Magaziner, D-R.I., have co-sponsored the DHS Use of Force Oversight Act to establish a baseline policy.   \"What my bill does, it actually codifies and mandates by Congress a legislative requirement that it doesn't matter if it's Trump's ICE, Biden's ICE, Democrats' ICE or whoever,\" Ramirez said. \"They now have to abide by the policy that is set, regardless of who's in the leadership or who is running DHS.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                In this Sept. 6, 1995, file photo, photographers capture the arrival on Capitol Hill in Washington of Randy Weaver, left, and his attorney Gerry Spence for a hearing of a Senate Judiciary subcommittee.\n                \n                    Dennis Cook/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Dennis Cook/AP\n    \n\n   \n   In 1995, when senators questioned Randy Weaver in a subcommittee hearing over the Ruby Ridge standoff, some asked pointed questions about his political beliefs, including whether he had swastikas in his home. Weaver had testified to having attended a handful of conferences on the compound of Aryan Nations, also in northern Idaho. He had also been photographed with his family wearing a T-shirt alluding to an antisemitic conspiracy theory.   Despite disagreement with Weaver's politics, however, legislators at that time appeared to agree that the policy and conduct of federal agents merited scrutiny. Ramirez said that she would like to see a similar discussion today.   \"This should not be a controversial bill to sign on to,\" Ramirez said. But she said that the administration's rapid characterization of Good's activities as \"domestic terrorism\" complicated further movement. \"It leaves very little room for a real dialogue of 'Let's talk about the policy.'\"   \n   So far, no Republicans have signed onto the bill.   \"But I am not very optimistic that enough of them will understand how critical this is,\" she said. \"With that said, I'm not going to lose hope.\"\n",

By the time President Trump's delayed helicopter landed in the Alpine snow, much of the damage — at least diplomatically — had already been done.   In the weeks leading up to the gathering, occasionally off-the-cuff remarks from Trump and White House staff about a possible U.S. military takeover of Greenland had culminated in renewed tariff threats against eight European nations.   \n   The unprecedented presidential rhetoric had left allies scrambling to interpret American intentions, while global financial markets responded nervously and diplomats questioned how durable long-standing U.S. commitments had become.   A candid speech from Canada   That unease was then voiced openly by several leaders in Davos. Canada's prime minister, Mark Carney, argued that the post-World War II economic and security architecture was breaking down in ways that left middle-sized countries, like Canada, newly exposed.   \"Let me be direct — we are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition,\" Carney told delegates in the forum's large congress hall. \"Great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons — tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited.\"   Carney warned that the rules-based international order that had helped manage great-power rivalry for decades \"is fading,\" and that countries like his could no longer assume the United States would reliably act as the system's stabilizing force.   French President Emmanuel Macron struck a similar note, framing the moment as one of historic political and security uncertainty. \"We are reaching a time of instability, of unbalances, both from the security and defense point of view and the economic point of view,\" he told the Davos audience of global policymakers and business executives.   \n   Macron linked those imbalances to a wider democratic retreat and a resurgence of geopolitical confrontation, what he called \"a shift towards a world without rules, where international law is trampled under foot, and where the only law that seems to matter is that of the strongest.\" It was a characterization that, two years ago, Macron would have intended for leaders like Presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin — but for many in the audience it seemed, this week, to target President Trump too.   \n   When the U.S. commander-in-chief appeared on that same stage a day later, he offered a sharply different interpretation, arguing that raw military and economic power — rather than verbal reassurance — was the key to maintaining security partnerships.   \"We want strong allies, not seriously weakened ones. We want Europe to be strong,\" Trump said, while invoking his own Scottish and German ancestry. \"Ultimately, these are matters of national security, and perhaps no current issue makes the situation more clear than what's currently going on with Greenland.\"   \n   In the same speech, Trump did appear to definitively rule out a U.S. invasion of Greenland, which is a semiautonomous territory of Denmark, a NATO ally. But he still continued to question Denmark's stewardship of the strategically important Arctic territory. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte moved quickly to defuse tensions in a meeting that followed, leaving Trump to declare on social media that a deal on Arctic security — with almost no public details — had been struck. Trump also said he had backed off the new tariffs he planned to impose on goods from European countries.   Denmark's political leadership later said Rutte did not speak on their behalf, only heightening the kind of diplomatic ambiguity that has dogged the U.S. administration's perception, particularly in Europe.   \n   Trump later announced on social media he was revoking an invitation for Canada to join his Board of Peace to work on stabilizing postwar Gaza and possibly other conflicts, an initiative Trump touted at Davos.   Zelenskyy calls on Europe to do more   Nonetheless, the entire episode had already deepened concerns within the NATO alliance about U.S. predictability and trust. For Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, such concerns underscored a frustration he has voiced repeatedly since Russia's full-scale invasion nearly four years ago.   \n   \"Europe loves to discuss the future, but avoids taking action today, action that defines what kind of future we will have,\" Zelenskyy said during his own keynote speech after he arrived in Switzerland Thursday. \"That is the problem.\"   For the Ukrainian leader, it's an issue not merely of strategy but credibility too, at a moment when U.S. political attention appears increasingly distracted and European governments remain occasionally leery about exercising hard power.   The week in Davos began with sharp market reactions and diplomatic shocks, and ended without clear resolution. What lingered instead was a question increasingly voiced by U.S. allies, both publicly and privately: whether the disruptions of recent days are temporary turbulence — or evidence of a more permanent shift in global leadership that they must now prepare to navigate largely on their own.\n",

But I realize that my path and my route is common to a lot of Americans.\"   \n   NPR attended three naturalization ceremonies across Washington, D.C. and northern Virginia in January and spoke with more than a dozen naturalized citizens and their families.   The ceremonies were largely celebratory experiences. But they took place against the backdrop of a year of unexpected hurdles and changes to the naturalization process in America.   Among those, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) paused the processing of existing immigration applications, including naturalizations, for immigrants from 39 countries who now have travel restrictions to come to the U.S.   \"One thing we're finding is that because the journey to citizenship is slower now than it has been in the past, that there are fewer people making it here today,\" said Barbara Zia. She attended the ceremony in D.C. to register the new citizens to vote on behalf of the League of Women Voters of the District of Columbia. She said usually 125 people are naturalized at that court each time, higher than the 104 at January's ceremony. The ceremony for February is already cancelled.   USCIS Spokesman Matthew Tragesser said the agency \"will not take shortcuts in the adjudications process,\" when asked about the lower number of people getting naturalized in D.C., and the cancellation of a ceremony next month.   \n   'The beginning of the chapter'   For some participating in naturalization ceremonies, the celebrations have been decades in the making; for others, the process began less than a year ago. Some wanted to cement their sense of belonging in America, others desired an added level of safety, or saw it as the next natural step in their lives.   \"People have access to better jobs, opportunities, home ownership, they can run for office if they so choose; so there's a lot of benefits,\" said Nicole Melaku, executive director of the National Partnership for New Americans, an immigrant advocacy group. \"For the larger community, it is an ultimate act of inclusion.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Top: Participants wait in line for the first naturalization ceremony of 2026 at the Albert V.

Data from fiscal year 2025 has not yet been published by USCIS. Preliminary data from the agency for the first six months of the year showed about 517,000 people applying for naturalization, in line with the prior year — but anecdotal evidence from Zia and others suggest that approved applications could be lower than they have been in the past.   At a morning ceremony in Alexandria, Va., 46 soon-to-be citizens waited in the standing-room-only courtroom, holding mini-American flags and pamphlets titled \"Congratulations on Becoming a U.S. Citizen.\"   \"The number of countries represented here today both reflects and further contributes to the rich diversity of the American people,\" said Judge John F. Anderson, who presided over the ceremony. \"As you remember your heritage, share it with your new citizens.\"   Immigrants getting their citizenship in the broader Washington, D.C., area hailed from across the globe, from El Salvador to Ukraine and India.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Ashley Lezama (right), of Honduras, stands with her husband, Nick Moreno, of Bolivia following her naturalization ceremony in Alexandria, Va.\n                \n                    Michael A.

McCoy for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"It's some mixture of emotions only because it seems like it's impossible,\" said Ashley Lezama Moreno, of Honduras. \"You know, finally able to cross that finish line. And it just feels amazing. New opportunities, the beginning of the chapter.\"   \n   An increasingly challenging process   The Trump administration has taken steps to make it more difficult to seek citizenship as the president seeks to limit legal migration to the United States.   Anderson, the judge in Alexandria, invited each new citizen to stand up and say their country of origin. A man in the first row of the courtroom stood up and said \"Brazil,\" another said \"Egypt.\" Two women stood in turn and said \"Guatemala,\" then \"Nepal.\" These are all countries on the new immigrant visa ban list announced earlier this month.   \n   Zaida Meza, of Guatemala, has lived in the United States for 21 years, and applied to naturalize a year-and-a-half ago. She saved up money for years to afford a lawyer to guide her through the process. Her citizenship would likely have stalled indefinitely if she hadn't been approved last year, before the new immigrant visa bans.   \"I love this country and I want to vote in the federal elections,\" Meza said. \"I've been working so hard trying to get my legal papers … I feel so blessed in America.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Zaida Meza, of Guatemala, applied to naturalize a year and a half ago after living in the U.S. for 21 years.\n                \n                    Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   USCIS unveiled a longer, tougher citizenship test in October. It has also moved forward with a rule that would allow officers to consider an immigrant's legal use of public benefits, such as food stamps and healthcare, as a reason to deny status.   In December, the Trump administration also halted processing green card and citizenship applications from nationals of 39 countries with travel restrictions to the U.S. In January, the list was expanded to halt processing immigrant visas indefinitely for 75 additional countries.   The Trump administration has also renewed focus on denaturalization, or revoking citizenship — a process scantly used in the past.   \n   \"For years, the Biden administration prioritized rubber-stamping naturalization applications with minimal vetting,\" said Tragesser, the USCIS spokesperson, adding that the agency plans \"rigorous screening and vetting processes across the country.\"   Ceremonies disrupted   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Cori Alonso-Yoder is the director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law.\n                \n                    Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   There's also been numerous disruptions to regularly scheduled ceremonies.   From October to mid-November, naturalization ceremonies across the country were cancelled due to the government shutdown. Numerous other ceremonies have been cancelled, often at the last minute and without explanation, leaving immigrants in limbo as they await the last step of their naturalization process.   Karim Hamouda, from Egypt, was naturalized in D.C. last week after he was originally scheduled for a ceremony in October. It was cancelled because of the government shutdown and rescheduled to Fairfax County, Va. His Fairfax ceremony also got cancelled; Hamouda says he wasn't given a reason.   \n   \"I'm lucky that I had my oath,\" Hamouda said after his ceremony in January.   \n   Cori Alonso-Yoder, director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law attended the naturalization ceremony in D.C. with one of her clients. The client was \"exceptionally nervous\" about being arrested even during her citizenship interview, bringing someone with them as support, she said.   \"There was a lot of anxiety to get to the place of actually becoming a naturalized citizen today,\" she said.   Still, she says, the ceremonies serve as evidence that thousands still want to become Americans and participate in the U.S. civic process.   \"At its core, citizenship is continuing to move forward and naturalization processes are continuing,\" Alonso-Yoder said. \"The people that we've seen today are truly committed and are taking the steps forward to make that happen.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                David Diemert, of Canada, applied to naturalize in March last year after living in the U.S. since 2001.\n                \n                    Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   David Diemert from Canada has lived in the U.S. since 2001, but applied to naturalize in March last year. He said that naturalizing allows him to leave behind much anxiety and uncertainty to truly build a future in the United States.   \"I got a little bit concerned about the current situation for people who were not citizens yet,\" Diemert said. \"[Naturalizing] is a measure of security, obviously. I want this country to live up to what its ideals are.\"\n",

It's the second fatal shooting in Minneapolis by immigration agents this month, and once again Trump administration officials immediately defended the action as self-defense while blaming the victim – in this case claiming he was a \"domestic terrorist\" intending to \"massacre\" officers.   \n   Multiple bystander videos and witness testimony contradict that. Pretti can be seen holding only a phone in his hand before at least six officers tackle him, pinning him face down on the ground and shooting him in the back, firing what sounds like ten shots. One eyewitness said in a court document that Pretti was not even facing agents when they grabbed him. \"It didn't look like he was trying to resist, just trying to help [a] woman up,\" they wrote.   \n   Pretti was a U.S. citizen with no known criminal record. DHS says he was armed, and the city's police chief confirmed he had a lawful permit to carry. There has been no evidence that NPR has verified of Pretti brandishing his handgun at any time during the encounter with federal agents. One video appears to show an officer take away his gun just before another shoots him.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The area where a federal agent killed a man in Minneapolis on Saturday is taped off.

The suspect put himself in that situation.\"   \"Once again DHS has come out with a predetermined narrative that contradicts everything we saw with our own eyes,\" said Minn. U.S. Representative Kelly Morrison, a Democrat. \"Two 37-year-old Minnesotans are now dead, a poet and a nurse, for what?\"   There are concerns over the integrity of the shooting investigation   Governor Tim Walz told reporters Saturday that the federal government cannot be trusted with this investigation.   \"We continue to hear, and we heard it from the vice president, that these folks can do whatever they want. They can have full immunity. And what I'm telling you is they will not. There will be justice to Minnesotans,\" he said.   The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said DHS has blocked its investigators from the scene. Earlier this month, the Trump administration also said it will not investigate the agent who shot and killed Renee Macklin Good as she was turning her car to drive away. Walz said the state is creating a log of evidence for possible future prosecution of immigration agents. In an extraordinary move the Minnesota Department of Corrections has also created a website to combat what it says are repeated false claims by DHS that it does not cooperate on federal immigration enforcement.   \n   In a rare break with Trump by a Republican, U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy called for a joint federal and state investigation. \"The events in Minneapolis are incredibly disturbing. The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake,\" he wrote in a post on X.\"   The Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus, a pro-Second Amendment group, also called for a \"full and transparent\" investigation.   \"Your children will ask you what side you were on\"   In Minneapolis Saturday night, on street corners all over the city, neighbors came outside in the subzero temperatures to mourn and try to process this latest killing of a bystander. Small groups gathered on snowbanks, holding candles, singing, and worriedly talking with neighbors.   \n   \"It can be you! It can be anyone walking past this street right now, and that's what's so sickening and so powerful that people are out here,\" said Tourmu Diggs, a Minneapolis resident who attended a large vigil in Whittier Park, a few blocks from where Alex Pretti was shot dead a few hours earlier.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                People gather during a vigil for 37-year-old Alex Pretti, who was fatally shot by a federal Border Patrol agent earlier in the day during an immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis on Saturday, Jan. 24, 2026.\n                \n                    Zaydee Sanchez for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Zaydee Sanchez for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Minneapolis residents and protesters march through the streets during a vigil for Alex Pretti, who was fatally shot by a federal agent during an immigration enforcement operation on Jan. 24, 2026.\n                \n                    Zaydee Sanchez\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Zaydee Sanchez\n    \n\n   \n   Many of the vigil attendees told NPR that they wanted peace, but fear that they may be running out of political, legal, and peaceful means to remove federal immigration agents from the city.   \"We just had one of the biggest protests ever yesterday, and here they are, killing another person,\" said Minneapolis resident Nick, referring to a massive demonstration in downtown Minneapolis on Friday. Like many NPR spoke with, he declined to give his full name out of fear of doxxing and retaliation from the federal government.   Amid mounting anger and more protests expected, Minnesota activated the National Guard to help overstretched local police maintain public safety. It says members will wear neon reflective vests to distinguish them from other agencies in similar uniforms.   Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey said the weeks-long surge of federal officers amounts to an invasion of the city. \"The masked militarized force and unidentified agents patrolling our streets, that is what erodes trust in both law enforcement and in democracy itself,\" he said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Thousands gather downtown in sub-zero temperatures as hundreds of Minnesota businesses close in a statewide \"ICE Out\" protest and strike against federal immigration enforcement and the expanded ICE operations in Minneapolis, Minnesota on Jan. 23, 2026.\n                \n                    Erin Trieb for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Erin Trieb for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   He urged residents to stay calm, but continue speaking out. \"Stand up for America. Recognize that your children will ask you what side you were on. Your grandchildren will ask you what you did to act to prevent this from happening again,\" Frey said.   A former Trump administration DHS general counsel actually called for the president's impeachment. \"I am enraged and embarrassed by DHS's lawlessness, fascism, and cruelty,\" John Mitnick wrote in a post on X.   Anger was already growing over federal agents' aggressive approach   The Trump administration has portrayed its mission in Minnesota as a crackdown on criminal, undocumented immigrants, and has sent a force of some 3,000 agents, five times larger than the Minneapolis police force. Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs for Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin has told NPR that the agency is \"delivering on the American people's mandate to deport illegal aliens.\"   \n   But residents say federal agents are sweeping up legal residents and even U.S. citizens in an arrest-first, ask questions later approach And policing and immigration experts say DHS agents are pushing the limits of their power, causing confusion for people who want to safely express their opposition.   Before the latest fatal shooting, NPR reporters on the ground in Minneapolis have witnessed federal agents pulling people off the streets and out of their cars or questioning people of color on their immigration status. Those arrested include a 5-year old now in detention with his father in Texas. Agents also dragged an older Hmong man into his front yard, wearing only his underwear in subzero cold, even though he's been a U.S. citizen for decades. The family told the Associated Press that agents barged into the home and arrested the man with guns drawn despite not having a warrant.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                ICE and federal agents face off with Minneapolis residents and protesters following the fatal shooting of a local resident earlier in the day near Nicollet Avenue and West 26th Street in south Minneapolis, Minnesota, Jan. 24, 2026.

The health care worker joined the crowd of protesters at the site of the latest shooting, standing feet from a row of local police in full face masks and riot gear.   \"They're trying to have the narrative be that the people are the aggressors,\" she told NPR. \"But we have seen on video and we've heard people testify to the fact that, no, they are being illegally detained and assaulted and sustaining injuries. And this is absolutely counter to everything our country stands for.   Asked about such concerns, Deputy Attorney General Blanche Sunday told CNN it's not fair to point to a few incidents out of thousands of arrests. \"Our agents are acting humanely,\" he said. \"Their jobs are very, very difficult.\"\n",

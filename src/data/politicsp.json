They recently picked up a second job with Instacart, to help cover their rising costs.    \n   Despite Posey's job as a case manager at a veterans' organization, and his wife's job in child care, they still can't make ends meet. For their Thanksgiving dinner, they got a turkey and some canned goods from a food pantry. They're scraping together the rest of their meal, but Posey said it's put a damper on their holiday spirit.    \n   \"It kind of takes away from the joy,\" he said. \"I don't feel it this year. To be honest, I'm just trying to stay above water.\"   Posey also has seen how much the veterans he works with are struggling. Many saw their federal SNAP food assistance disrupted this month during the government shutdown, and still haven't caught up. The strain is now beginning to show, he said.   \"We're starting to see a lot more people frustrated, a lot more people angry,\" he said. \"You're starting to see an uptick in violence, especially domestic violence, and a lot of substance use, because they're just overwhelmed.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Steve and India Posey say they're not quite feeling the joy of the holidays this year due to rising costs and increased stress they're feeling \"just trying to stay above water.\"\n                \n                    Tovia Smith/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Tovia Smith/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   In New York City, Queens resident Rosetta Savannah is facing her own challenges. She's one of those who saw their SNAP payments disrupted during the government shutdown and is still waiting for this month's benefits. So far, she's gotten just half of what she normally receives, and she's had extra medical bills.   \n   Her family's Thanksgiving dinner will also be lighter than usual.   \"We're doing mostly chicken, because chicken is cheaper,\" Savannah said. \"I usually bake cakes and pies but I'm not doing that this year.\"    \n   She's also relying on a local food pantry for a small ham and some sides, but she knows there's no guarantee anything will be left.   \"You have to get up super early to at least be maybe the 30th person on line, and then you just wait and see,\" she said.   Savannah is cutting down on gifts this year, too. Her three kids will only get one small present each, instead of the several she usually gives them.   There will also be fewer presents under the tree at Bonnie Green's home in Bethlehem, Penn.    \"I'm significantly cutting out gifts, there's just no way,\" she said. \"I can't afford it.\"   Green, a 60-year-old professional and homeowner, has always considered herself upper-middle class. She loves Black Friday shopping and had planned on buying several new outfits for her kids, and for her first granddaughter's first Christmas. Typically she would also make an elaborate and plentiful holiday feast.   \"I go big,\" she said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                This year, Bonnie Green is making use of one of her mother's favorite books, which offers ways to celebrate the holidays on a tight budget. Despite the deep cuts she was forced to make after her federal government job was eliminated, Green is determined to keep smiling and focus on the joy, \"even in the midst of austerity.\"\n                \n                    Jacob Schippell\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jacob Schippell\n    \n\n   \n   But earlier this year, her job with the National Science Foundation was one of the many eliminated by the Department of Government Efficiency, which President Trump created by executive order on his first day in office. She still has her job as a professor at East Stroudsburg University in Pennsylvania, but her total income is now half of what it was.   \"That's a lot of money that is no longer there,\" Green said. \"It's really tough.\"   That has forced big changes this year. Besides nixing gifts, she's not decorating as she usually does, and her holiday menu is far more modest. Her usual seafood chowder will be replaced by chicken soup. And forget the Beef Wellington and pecan pie, she said. Instead, she's \"leaning in\" to dishes she can make with much cheaper ingredients.    \n   The biggest blow: her sister won't be able to make it for Christmas. That's not only because of the higher airfare, but also because she's feeling the pinch and needs to work an extra shift.   \"I have friends who (say) the economy has never been better,\" Green said. \"I don't know what economy they're living in, but it's not mine.\"   Still Green adds, she feels fortunate compared to others, especially the many low-income students at her school.   She said the campus food pantry is doing nearly double its usual volume, and she's heard from students who say they're so financially strapped they may be forced to drop out of school just shy of getting their diploma, which would put their future earning potential at risk.   \n   Green, who has spent her career researching how to improve educational outcomes for disadvantaged students, set up a scholarship fund this fall to help students who are as close to graduating as they are to running out of money.    \"It would be a tragedy beyond words,\" she said. \"They will never be able to (have a seat) at the table without a bachelor's degree. They won't even be invited to the table, and they deserve to be there.\"   So far, the foundation has raised enough to keep one student in school through graduation. But there are dozens more who have been deemed eligible for the program. Green is doing what she can to help. Even as she's cut her holiday spending, she's increased her holiday giving to support the foundation.\n",

    "body": "\n      In Tennessee, a special election for a vacant congressional seat is expected to be more competitive in a district that has been strongly Republican for years.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  After Democrats won elections this month in New Jersey, Virginia and Pennsylvania, the party is now eyeing a race in Tennessee. The special congressional election is for a district that has been solidly Republican for decades, but is now more competitive. Early voting is already underway. So, Marianna Bacallao for member station WPLN in Nashville headed to the polls to check in with voters.MARIANNA BACALLAO, BYLINE: Overlooking U.S. Route 70 and the neighboring Dollar General, the city hall of Pegram, Tennessee, has opened its doors as an early voting site. It's one of many in the state's 7th congressional district, which is holding a special election that concludes on December 2. Here in Cheatham County, President Trump won with 72% of the vote last year.Trump endorsed the Republican congressional candidate Matt Van Epps. Some voters say they cast a ballot for the former state commissioner because...PAM: There's a lot of work to do because a lot of work didn't get done four years ago.MICHAEL: Making sure that President Trump has the support he needs to carry out his agenda.JEFF: I just like the moral values. I like to get away from the issues of transgenderism and homosexuality, and I like somebody that's backing the way Trump's got the country going.BACALLAO: That was Pam, Michael and Jeff. All three refused to give their last names because they wanted to keep their ballot choices private. But not everyone in Cheatham County is happy.BECKY: I don't know how you could say the price of groceries or anything are coming down unless you've not been to the grocery store. Everything's more expensive.BACALLAO: That's Becky, who also wanted to keep her last name private. She says she voted for Democratic congressional candidate Aftyn Behn because she's worried about her daughter who's just graduated college.BECKY: And she has no chance of being able to live on her own. Everything is expensive.BACALLAO: She's not alone. Affordability is top of mind for Nashville voters, along with...ABRAHAM GARCIA ORTEGA: Safety, money, jobs.JASMINE PATTERSON: Housing.ORTEGA: Inflation is outrageous, you know?BACALLAO: That was Abraham Garcia Ortega and Jasmine Patterson. They also cast their vote for Behn, a state lawmaker. She and Van Epps are vying for a seat left open by the retirement of Congressman Mark Green. While Green has held the seat since 2019, his surprise retirement could present an opportunity for Democrats.This month, the Cook Political Report, a non-partisan newsletter, changed the 7th Congressional district's rating from solidly Republican to likely Republican. The state's GOP chair, Scott Golden, says he's focused on turnout at a time when many voters may be traveling or hosting for the holidays.SCOTT GOLDEN: Anytime you have a special election bracketed by the Thanksgiving holiday, you can't afford to take a day off. You know, I think if there's concern, it's just that, you know, people aren't aware that they have the opportunity to vote right now.BACALLAO: Recent Democratic wins across the country may also help build momentum for their candidate, even in a district that's been a Republican stronghold for decades. Tennessee Democratic Party Chair Rachel Campbell says Behn's focus on affordability, like the cost of groceries, could give her an edge.RACHEL CAMPBELL: My belief is that we're winning because we're focused on the real issues that families are facing, not just in Tennessee, but all across the country.BACALLAO: A recent NPR/PBS News/Marist poll found that nationwide, nearly 6 in 10 respondents say Trump's top priority should be lowering prices - and no other issue comes close. Trump is unpopular nationwide with an approval rating of 39%. In Tennessee, though, his base is still strong.

On Monday, the Pentagon announced an investigation into Kelly, a retired U.S. Navy fighter pilot, for possible violations of military law for appearing in the video. The video was published as legal questions swirl around the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops to U.S. cities.   While the White House has since walked back the president's remarks calling the Senators' video \"seditious behavior, punishable by DEATH,\" Kelly told All Things Considered he thinks President Trump is \"declaring that loyalty to the Constitution is punishable by death.\"   \n   Listen to the full interview by clicking play on the blue box above.\n",

Pete Skandalakis, executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia, moved to end the prosecution against the remaining defendants after he assumed the case from Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who was disqualified by a court late last year.   \"The criminal conduct alleged in the Atlanta Judicial Circuit's prosecution was conceived in Washington, D.C., not the State of Georgia,\" Skandalakis wrote in his motion to dismiss. \"The federal government is the appropriate venue for this prosecution, not the State of Georgia.\"   \n   The prosecution was the last outstanding criminal case against Trump, after a pair of federal prosecutions — one focused on efforts to overturn the 2020 election and another related to the handling of classified documents — were dropped after Trump returned to the White House earlier this year.   Trump cheered the ruling on social media, writing that \"LAW and JUSTICE have prevailed in the Great State of Georgia, as the corrupt Fani Willis Witch Hunt against me, and other Great American Patriots, has been DISMISSED in its entirety.\"   \n   The Fulton County DA's office has not responded to a request for comment.   The historic indictment   In Georgia, a Fulton County grand jury indicted Trump and 18 others, including former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, in August 2023 in a sweeping racketeering case alleging a conspiracy to overturn Joe Biden's 2020 victory in Georgia.   The case was spurred in part by a January 2021 recorded phone call Trump made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in which he asked him to \"find\" 11,780 votes, one more than the margin of Trump's loss in Georgia.   The Georgia case also focused on an alleged scheme to submit a slate of Trump electors despite Biden's victory, to access sensitive voting machine data and an unsuccessful campaign to pressure state officials to interfere with the election result.   \n   After the grand jury indictment, Trump and his codefendants were booked at the Fulton County Jail — with Trump's mug shot becoming a lasting image of the case. Most defendants, including Trump, pleaded not guilty to the charges. Four accepted plea deals — and those remain binding.   The sprawling case was winding its way to trial when attorneys for one of Trump's codefendants filed a motion to dismiss the case premised on a stunning claim: The district attorney had been engaged in an improper personal relationship with a special prosecutor she hired for the case.   Willis acknowledged the relationship had existed, but asserted it had no bearing on the case.   Judge McAfee ultimately ruled that Willis could continue on if the special prosecutor, Nathan Wade, resigned. But a few months later, the Georgia Court of Appeals reversed that ruling, removing Willis and her office from the case. The Georgia Supreme Court later declined to hear an appeal, letting the removal stand.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis looks on during a hearing in the Georgia election interference case at the Fulton County Courthouse on March 1, 2024, in Atlanta.\n                \n                    Alex Slitz/Pool/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Slitz/Pool/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Skandalakis, a nonpartisan official who Georgia law charged with appointing a special prosecutor, announced in November that he would take the case himself after he was unable to recruit anyone else to assume the case.   \"It's important that someone makes a decision on this case,\" Skandalakis said in a September interview. \"It's important for the public, frankly for the nation, for the defendants, for all the interested parties.\"   That did not mean his decision would be to proceed with the prosecution. While the state charges were insulated in ways that the charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice were not, Trump's lawyers had argued that the case could not continue until he left office in 2029.   The decision now to drop the charges entirely means the case will not proceed even then.   \"This decision will not be universally popular\"   Skandalakis said in making the decision, he would meticulously review the indictment, the law and the case files, including 101 banker boxes of documents and an 8-terabyte hard drive containing the complete investigative file.   \n   Among the options Skandalakis could have considered included dropping the charges against Trump but continuing the case against some or all of his codefendants, or going back to a grand jury for a superseding or updated indictment. The statute of limitations for most felony charges in Georgia is four years and five years for racketeering charges.   Skandalakis stressed that it would be impractical to continue the prosecution. He did say that charges related to Ruby Freeman, a Georgia election worker who faced threats and harassment after being falsely accused of fraud, could continue — but should be brought in Cobb, not Fulton, County.   While cases against some Trump allies involved in efforts to overturn the election continue in other state courts, the Georgia decision brings to a close one of the most high-profile and wide-reaching prosecutions.   Georgia State University Law professor Anthony Michael Kreis disagrees with Skandalakis' finding that there was not a role for the state justice system in this case.   Kreis said states play a crucial part in accountability in election cases because unlike in federal cases, a president cannot pardon people for state charges.   He also said this decision could weaken deterrents, meaning it will be more up to individuals, like secretaries of state, to step in and stop attempts to interfere with election results, rather than the legal system.   And Kreis said a trial would have been a chance for the public to hear the evidence for themselves.   \"This was really an opportunity for justice and reconciliation and a kind of truth-telling that has been squandered,\" Kreis said.   In his motion, Skandalakis wrote: \"I recognize that, given the deep political divisions in our country, this decision will not be universally popular.\" He said his family received threats after he took over the case.   \"The role of a prosecutor is not to satisfy public opinion or achieve universal approval; such a goal is both unattainable and irrelevant to the proper exercise of prosecutorial discretion,\" he continued. \"My assessment of this case has been guided solely by the evidence, the law, and the principles of justice.\"\n",

That prosecutor is Lindsey Halligan, a 36-year-old former insurance attorney who served as one of President Trump's personal lawyers after his first term and joined his second administration as a White House aide.   Trump appointed Halligan as acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia in late September, the day after her predecessor, Erik Siebert, resigned under pressure from the president to bring charges against Comey and James.   \n   In his announcement, Trump called Halligan a \"tough, smart and loyal attorney\" who \"has the strength and determination to be absolutely OUTSTANDING in this new and very important role.\"   But Halligan's tenure has been mired in controversy, reaching new highs on Monday when U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie ruled in dual opinions that Halligan's appointment was unlawful.   The judge found that Halligan's appointment violated a federal statute that limits interim U.S. attorneys to 120 days in the role, because Siebert had been in that acting role since January. After 120 days without a Senate confirmation, only district courts — not the Attorney General — can fill a vacancy.   \n   Currie wrote that Halligan, whom she describes as \"a former White House aide with no prior prosecutorial experience,\" had \"no lawful authority to present the indictment\" against Comey or James. Because Halligan's was the only signature on those documents, they are rendered invalid.   \"All actions flowing from Ms. Halligan's defective appointment, including securing and signing Mr. Comey's indictment, were unlawful exercises of executive power and are hereby set aside,\" Currie wrote.   The ruling leaves the door open for the Justice Department to appeal, which White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it will. In an interview Monday on Fox News, she downplayed the decision as a \"technical ruling\" and defended Halligan's authority.   \n   \"We believe that the attorney in this case, Lindsey Halligan, is not only extremely qualified for this position but she was in fact legally appointed,\" Leavitt said.   Here's what to know about the prosecutor at the center of this latest political storm.   Halligan got her start in insurance law    Halligan grew up in Broomfield, Colo., a suburb about halfway between Denver and Boulder. She played softball and basketball and competed in several Miss Colorado USA pageants, earning third runner-up in 2009.   She studied politics and broadcast journalism at Regis University, the Jesuit school in Denver that Erika Kirk also attended. According to one professional biography, Halligan developed an interest in law while interning at the Denver City Attorney's Office in college.   She got her law degree from the University of Miami in 2013, interning at the Miami-Dade Public Defender's Office and the law school's Miami Innocence Clinic along the way. She began her legal career at the Florida firm Cole, Scott & Kissane, which specializes in insurance defense litigation.   \n   Halligan became a partner at the firm in 2018 and, the following year, won praise for defeating a $500,000 property damage claim involving a leaky roof (\"George and Lindsey presented evidence that the roof was old and just past its normal life expectancy,\" the firm said in a news release at the time).   Halligan told the Washington Post earlier this year that she first met Trump at a November 2021 event at his golf club in West Palm Beach — months after his first term ended, as he was under investigation by both the Justice Department and New York State.   \"I saw the same thing that I saw when I interned at the Innocence clinic: someone who was getting railroaded by the system,\" Halligan told the newspaper.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Lindsey Halligan, then part of Trump's personal legal team, leaves a court hearing in West Palm Beach, Florida, in September 2022.\n                \n                    Marco Bello/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Marco Bello/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Halligan went from personal lawyer to the president's assistant   Halligan joined Trump's personal legal team in 2022.   \n   \"As a Partner at the biggest Law Firm in Florida, Lindsey proved herself to be a tremendous trial lawyer, and later represented me (and WON!) in the disgraceful Democrat Documents Hoax, as well as MANY other major, high profile cases,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social in September.   Halligan and Trump have both said that she was at his Mar-a-Lago residence in August 2022 when the FBI raided the property as part of its investigation into his retention of classified documents. She helped defend him in that case, both in court and on TV.   A Trump-appointed federal judge ultimately dismissed it in July 2024, ruling the prosecutor had been unlawfully appointed, and the Justice Department dropped its appeal after Trump was reelected.   When Trump returned to the White House in January 2025, Halligan joined his administration with two titles: White House senior associate staff secretary and special assistant to the president.   Halligan remained visible, frequently appearing with him in the Oval Office and at the U.S. Open.   One of her most visible White House contributions was leading its controversial review of more than half a dozen Smithsonian Institution museums to \"ensure alignment\" with Trump's cultural directives. The Organization of American Historians has called the order, which was issued in August, an \"unacceptable instance of ongoing executive overreach.\"   Halligan has defended and taken credit for it, telling The Washington Post that when she moved to D.C. ahead of Trump's inauguration, some of the museum exhibits she visited struck her as \"weaponizing history.\"   \"And so I talked to the president about it,\" Halligan said, \"and suggested an executive order, and he gave me his blessing, and here we are.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Lindsey Halligan stands next to other White House aides including Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller and staff secretary Will Scharf as President Trump speaks with reporters in the Oval Office in February.\n                \n                    Alex Brandon/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Brandon/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Halligan is accused of missteps in the dropped cases   While the Comey and James cases were thrown out because of Halligan's lack of authority, their lawyers — as well as outside legal experts — accused Halligan of legal missteps in her effort to prosecute Trump's political enemies.   \n   Halligan's predecessor, Siebert, had resisted bringing charges against both officials because of insufficient evidence. At the time, his office had already opened an investigation into James over bank fraud allegations related to a 2020 mortgage application for a Virginia property. Siebert's resignation came hours after Trump told reporters that he wanted the prosecutor \"out.\"   \n   Trump announced Halligan's appointment the following day. That's also the day Trump posted — and later deleted — a message on social media appearing to pressure Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate his political rivals: Comey, James and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California.   Bondi's office issued an order authorizing Halligan for the interim U.S. attorney job less than 48 hours later, on Sept. 22. Halligan's office announced on Sept. 25 that a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Comey with making a false statement and obstruction over 2020 Senate testimony.   That announcement came five days before the statute of limitations would have expired in Comey's case — and on Halligan's fourth day on the job.   \"She started on a Monday — this was a Thursday — and tried to get this indictment in a case,\" former federal prosecutor Elie Honig told NPR's Morning Edition. \"I will tell you, if I went into a grand jury on my fourth day on the job and tried to indict a complicated, high-stakes case like this too, I'm sure I would've screwed up as well.\"   \n   In the weeks since, the grand jury process has been the subject of growing legal questions. Earlier this month, a magistrate judge took the unusual step of ordering the Justice Department to turn over all grand jury materials to Comey's defense team, citing a \"disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps.\"   Scrutiny further increased after a hearing last week, at which Halligan confirmed that the full grand jury never reviewed the final indictment against Comey — a shocking revelation that could be enough to get the case dismissed, though a prosecutor at the hearing downplayed it as a \"paperwork error.\"   \n   Halligan initially sought three counts against Comey, but the grand jury rejected one of them. Then Halligan or someone else created a new indictment with renumbered charges but didn't bring that back to the grand jury for a vote, a step that Honig said \"any semi-experienced prosecutor\" would know not to skip.   \"It would take 10 minutes,\" he added. \"Instead, she just brings it to the judge with two grand jurors with her, which is not enough. And now she's created this problem for herself out of a sheer lack of competence.\"   Days later, a judge threw the case out for an entirely different reason.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR traveled to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's Georgia district to hear what her constituents thought about their congresswoman's decision to resign next year after a falling out with President Trump.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene recently announced that she is stepping down from her seat mid-term. Her last day in office will be January 5. The decision came after a simmering feud between Representative Greene and President Trump over the Epstein files and other issues. Greene, of course, rose to national fame as a staunch backer of Trump and the MAGA movement. But in recent weeks, Trump revoked his endorsement of her. Greene said that she did not want her district to have to endure a, quote, \"hateful primary.\" Georgia Public Broadcasting's Sarah Kallis traveled to Greene's northwest Georgia district after she announced her resignation to see what her constituents had to say. Sarah, thanks for being on the line.SARAH KALLIS, BYLINE: Thank you for having me.DETROW: So I'm curious - what was the mood like in the district?KALLIS: Well, it's safe to say that people were shocked by her announcement. I noticed that people were very hesitant to talk to press. I actually went up to her district two days before she announced her resignation as well. And when I went up then, constituents were coming up to me. They wanted to give their opinion and their name. But this time when I went up, very few people wanted to talk, and even fewer wanted to give a name or any identifying information. Some of them said they were worried about family backlash, especially with the upcoming holiday.DETROW: Tell us about what the people who did talk to you said, though.KALLIS: Well, again, folks were definitely very surprised, and it's important to note here that she's very popular in her district. They voted overwhelmingly for both her and President Trump in 2024. Here is Floyd Farless from Rome, which is Greene's hometown, who said he voted for her last year.FLOYD FARLESS: I wish she had not done it at this situation. It does leave us without representation till somebody's appointed. She has been somewhat of a firebrand, but every area has got their own. And she would have been reelected, for sure, here. I don't think there'd be any question about it.KALLIS: And it's important to note here that Farless used the word appointed, but that seat will actually be vacant until a special election is called when voters will select a new representative, and they are sworn in.DETROW: Curious what else you heard from voters.KALLIS: Well, constituents represented a pretty wide range of opinions. You know, some said that they support her doing what she needs to do. They had some theories that she might be concerned about her personal safety. And then there were some others that echoed Farless' concerns, especially about the lack of representation in Congress in between that period where she resigns and the special election happens to replace her. And that likely would be sometime in February. And some constituents also cited some unfounded conspiracy theories about her resignation, which include some claims that the Democratic Party undermined her. And it's important to note here that Greene rose to prominence for pushing conspiracy theories like QAnon when she first ran in 2020.DETROW: So that's voters. What about local Republican Party leaders?KALLIS: So the GOP chair for Greene's district, Jackie Harling, said that she was shocked and saddened as well, which definitely seems to be the theme here, but she understands her decision ultimately.JACKIE HARLING: I do not blame her for making the choice to basically jump out of the torture chamber. When your family is threatened, it's a whole different ball of wax.KALLIS: Greene has said that she's received death threats throughout her time in Congress. And Harling says that she still fully supports President Trump, but she also told me that the rift between Trump and Greene has been pretty difficult for her.HARLING: I still support him. I am a big believer in showing grace and forgiveness.KALLIS: And now attention for Harling and the district GOP is turning to the special election that's going to happen early next year.DETROW: What else can you tell us about that campaign in its earliest days?KALLIS: Well, it's the most conservative district in Georgia, and there won't be a primary because of Georgia laws. So a crowded field is definitely possible in this race, with candidates on both sides of the aisle. And if no one gets that 50% of the vote, it's going to have to go to a runoff, which would leave the district without representation in Washington for even longer. And Congressman Greene said on social media that she's not going to endorse in this race. But Trump has been pretty active in endorsements in congressional races, so it's possible he'll endorse here.DETROW: That is Georgia Public Broadcasting's Sarah Kallis. Thank you so much.KALLIS: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

One of his aides is the subject of a new report from Bloomberg. Bloomberg published a transcript of a phone call in which the aide advises a Russian official about how Russia can handle the emotions of Donald Trump. NPR has not confirmed this transcript. And in a moment, we will hear Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia. We begin with the negotiations.MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez is here to talk about why Trump continues to push even after all these setbacks. Franco, good morning.FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: Good morning, Michel.MARTIN: So the original 28-point plan was widely criticized as a wish list by the Russians. Now the administration says it's updated. Where do things stand now?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. The Trump administration has been furiously negotiating with both sides, bouncing between a Russia-friendly version and a more Ukraine-friendly one. And Trump now says there are only a few remaining points of disagreement. He said last night he's dispatching his special envoy, Steve Witkoff - Witkoff is the Trump negotiator who is on that transcript - and maybe son-in-law Jared Kushner to Moscow to meet with President Putin. And then he's sending Army Secretary Dan Driscoll to meet with the Ukrainians.MARTIN: But, you know, Franco, we've been here before. Do we have a sense of whether this is really progress?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, talks are happening and ideas are being exchanged. That's something. I mean, it's more than what was happening a few weeks ago. But are they closer to reaching a deal? I mean, not necessarily. I mean, I was talking with Ivo Daalder, who was the ambassador to NATO in the Obama administration. And he says, basically, last week, you had Russia agreeing to one plan, and now you have Ukraine agreeing to a different plan.IVO DAALDER: The problem is Ukraine and Russia don't agree. So you can come up with any plan that the U.S. and Russia can agree on and any plan that the U.S. and Ukraine can agree on. That's not the same as having a plan that Ukraine and Russia can agree on. And that's their problem.MARTIN: Last week, President Trump seemed to set this take-it-or-leave-it deadline for Thanksgiving, but he did back off that over the weekend. What does that tell you about his motivations?ORDOÑEZ: Well, I mean, it's another example of how driven Trump is to just get to yes in any way possible. Richard Fontaine served in the George W. Bush White House and now runs the Center for a New American Security. And he told me that what matters to Ukraine and Russia doesn't so much matter to Trump.RICHARD FONTAINE: Trump clearly wants a deal. I don't know that the content of the deal matters all that much to him as long as it stops the fighting. That, therefore, gives a lot of leeway to those negotiating what the terms of that deal are. And, of course, for Ukraine and for the Russians and for the Europeans and for many people, the terms are all-important.ORDOÑEZ: Terms are very important, and that's why Russia wants more of the eastern Donbas region for strategic and economic benefits. And it's also why Ukraine wants clear security guarantees from Western partners like the U.S. to ensure that Russia never invades again.MARTIN: You know, people might remember that Trump talks a lot about the conflicts that he says he has ended. He did that yesterday during the Thanksgiving turkey pardons. How much of this is about his quest for the Nobel Peace Prize?ORDOÑEZ: Look, I mean, I think he genuinely cares about the loss of life. It's something he frequently mentions when talking about the war. But I don't think you can discount his desire for recognition. I mean, he talks about the Nobel Peace Prize a lot. His aides talk about it as well. And Daalder and Fontaine both told me that Trump is likely looking at his legacy. And as any president would, I mean, what better way to be seen as the ultimate dealmaker than solving this intractable war?MARTIN: That is White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez. Franco, thank you.ORDOÑEZ: Thank you, Michel.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Party identity is shifting under President Trump, and the process is affecting both parties.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  Democrats and Republicans promised different visions of the role of government. For decades, it seemed clear what each party stood for, but those lines are becoming less and less clear as President Trump continues to rewrite the rules in Washington. So we've asked senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith and congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt to help us make sense of how these parties are shifting. Welcome.TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hello.BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Hi, Juana.SUMMERS: So, I mean, for decades, it seemed incredibly clear what each party believed. It was big government versus small government, intervention versus isolation. But now it just feels like those lines are getting incredibly, incredibly blurrier. What is happening here?SPRUNT: Yeah. I mean, if you saw an R or a D next to someone's name, you could generally guess what that person's political philosophy was. You know, it was a pretty fair proxy. Democrats - government isn't a problem but a solution. Republicans favor small government, more socially conservative. But that has changed in a really big way in the Trump era. I talked to David Barker, a professor of government at American University. He says it's no longer entirely clear what exactly it means to be a conservative anymore.DAVID BARKER: People - I tend to associate the term with just being, like, really pro-Trump, but there are a lot of elements to the MAGA right that are largely or wholly inconsistent with what we used to think of as conservatism in the Reagan and Bush eras.KEITH: And in the second Trump term, these differences are even more stark. Republicans used to be all about free markets and free trade. Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs. In business, he picks winners and losers and has even pushed for the government to take a portion of certain companies. When it comes to foreign policy, Trump has had little use for long-standing alliances, but America First hasn't meant pure isolationism. Look at the strikes on the Iranian nuclear facilities or the buildup of U.S. military might near Venezuela happening now.SUMMERS: And all of this, of course, makes me think about Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who, of course, used to be one of Trump's closest allies, but she announced last week that she is going to step down in January. And that decision - all of this - it's about her disagreements with President Trump. How does she fit into all of this?KEITH: Well, it would be hard to find someone more MAGA than Congresswoman Greene. But in the past few months, she had begun to openly question whether Trump was living up to his campaign promises. So he turned on her, called her a traitor, promised to primary her, and she quit. Greene is an iconoclast. She says she never really fit in in Congress, but she's casting herself as a representative of common Americans, the very people who Trump's version of the Republican Party appealed to, the working-class voters who gave him a winning coalition.SPRUNT: Yeah. And, you know, Greene started to talk a lot about these issues that were important to the base - affordability, no foreign intervention and, of course, the Epstein files. She defended those as being core to MAGA. So this presents an interesting question, I think, about the movement itself. Is it about that core set of values, or is it about the man himself?SUMMERS: I mean, it makes sense that Trump's shifting vision is upending his Republican Party, but Democrats also seem to be struggling to define themselves right now. What are each of you seeing?SPRUNT: As Trump has remade the Republican Party in his image, you know, so have Democrats sort of centered their party on being anti-Trump, and a byproduct of that is that the party has less identity outside of just opposing Trump. For a lot of moderate and independent voters, and to be honest, some Democratic voters I talk to as well, just being anti-Trump isn't enough.KEITH: Trump is the main character in everyone's political lives right now, and that puts Democrats in a position of always responding to him.SUMMERS: The next political test, of course, is next fall in the midterm elections. How are Republicans and Democrats thinking about who their parties are going forward?SPRUNT: Well, the party is shaped by who runs and who wins, right? So I talked to the folks running recruitment efforts in the House on both sides of the aisle. Georgia Congressman Brian Jack is leading recruitment for Republicans, and I asked him, what does the party stand for?BRIAN JACK: Ultimately, I think, for many people, the Republican Party today has been completely overhauled by President Trump in a positive way because it's a party of blue-collar, working-class folks who want to see our country put first.SPRUNT: And this gets at another way that Trump has transformed the parties. I mean, Democrats have lost their lock on white, working-class voters.KEITH: It is remarkable just how significantly the party's electorates have changed in the past few decades. Bill Clinton, in the 1990s, was elected by a coalition that included a whole lot of working-class, white voters. Republicans were the party of the elites. And then Trump came along, and now it's almost completely reversed. Steve Teles is a political scientist at Johns Hopkins University.STEVE TELES: There's this tension between all the things people had previously committed to and the fact that now, like, all these things are shaken up in terms of who's in what coalition.KEITH: And he says there's a really big question of whether those voters will stay with Republicans once Trump is gone.SUMMERS: OK. So that was Republicans. Barbara, you mentioned that you talked to both parties about this. How did Democrats respond?SPRUNT: Well, I asked Colorado Congressman Jason Crow, who's leading recruitment for the Democratic side, what does he think the party stands for?JASON CROW: I'm not looking for government to solve my problems. I'm not looking for a handout. What I want is a level playing field. Working-class Americans - they all know it's rigged, right? So I'm a Democrat because this is the party that consistently tries to unrig that system.SPRUNT: Now, Juana, if you didn't know that that was a Democrat, what would those first few lines make you think of - you know, like, working-class, not looking for a government handout? I'm betting that, you know, you might say Republican.SUMMERS: I might. I mean, hearing Congressman Crow say that, it's a little surprising given the large and very vocal left wing of his party.SPRUNT: Yeah. And he's certainly a centrist Democrat. But the language around unrigging the system is also very much in line with the far-left of the party too. Unlike the Republican Party, navigating what conservatism means and what MAGA means from a policy level, the challenge for Democrats is different. It's about how to rebuild key parts of their party, like the working-class that we talked about.KEITH: And how they rebuild trust with voters. There are a lot of people who feel like the system just isn't working for them, and electoral success for Democrats and Republicans alike may well come down to who most persuasively can say, we hear you and here's a solution.SUMMERS: That's senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith and congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt. Thanks to both of you.KEITH: You're welcome.SPRUNT: Thank you, Juana.SUMMERS: And for a deeper dive on all of this, take a listen to today's NPR Politics Podcast.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

Trump dismissed any concerns as \"a standard thing.\"   \"Because he's got to sell this to Ukraine. He's got to sell Ukraine to Russia,\" Trump said, aboard Air Force One, on his way to Florida. \"That's what a dealmaker does.\"   The controversy has shined a new spotlight on Witkoff, the president's long-time friend and chief negotiator who has drawn criticism for his lack of experience and go-it-alone style.   \n   The recording is of an October call in the lead up to the release of the original 28-point plan to end the war in Ukraine that favored Russia.   Bloomberg reviewed audio of the call and published a transcript. NPR has not independently verified the transcript or call audio.   Trump said Tuesday night he hadn't heard the audio, but also did not have a problem with the characterization of the call.   \"You got to say, 'look, they want this. You've got to convince them with this. You know, that's a very standard form of negotiation,\" he said.   The criticism has been blunt: That Witkoff is not looking for a balanced deal, but carrying water for Russia — a U.S. adversary and the aggressor in a war versus Ukraine, a strategic partner and European ally.   But Trump doesn't seem too concerned. He's sending Witkoff back to Moscow to try to finalize details of the latest plan with Putin.   Trump and Witkoff have a long friendship   Witkoff and the president have been friends for almost 40 years. Trump calls Witkoff \"a special guy\" and \"my pal.\" Their friendship dates back to a chance encounter at a New York Deli at 3 a.m.   Trump had no cash on him. \"I ordered him a ham and swiss,\" Witkoff said, according to a report in Courthouse News about his testimony in Trump's defense during one of Trump's trials last year.   \n   Witkoff said in an interview with Tucker Carlson that he learned the real estate business from Trump.   \"I wanted to be him,\" Witkoff said. \"Everybody wanted to be him. He'd come to 101 Park Avenue, where I was a lawyer. He had this swashbuckling style. I used to see him come in and I used to say, 'God, I want to be him.'\"   Witkoff has described how Trump was there for him when one of his sons died from an opioid overdose in 2011.   \"I have seen his humanity in the quiet moments away from the spotlight in hospital rooms he didn't have to be in — where his presence brought real solace in a dark hour for my family,\" Witkoff said at the Republican National Convention.   During the campaign, Witkoff helped with fundraising. Trump also turned to Witkoff to handle sensitive matters like trying to repair ties with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and presidential primary challenger Nikki Haley.   \"His best friend, Steve Witkoff, came to our house in South Carolina, spoke to me and my husband, and basically wanted a truce between me and Donald Trump,\" Haley said on her podcast. She told Witkoff that Trump had her support.   Picking Witkoff for a role his son-in-law used to fill   Well before assigning him the Ukraine peace deal, Trump picked his old friend as his envoy to the Middle East.   It was the same position that Trump — in his first term — had given to another person whose loyalty was unquestioned: his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.   Kushner, who now runs an investment firm, had also come from the real estate world and handled many tough files for Trump, including Middle East peace, trade talks with Mexico and Canada, immigration reform and parts of the administration's response to the COVID pandemic.   In President Trump's first term, his son-in-law Jared Kushner held the role now filled by Steve Witkoff. Kushner and Witkoff appeared together on Feb. 20 at a Miami conference organized by the non-profit arm of Saudi Arabia's main sovereign wealth fund called the Future Investment Initiative (FII) Institute.   \n   A lot of experts scoffed at Kushner's lack of experience when he started his White House role, and some raised the same questions about Witkoff.   How Witkoff describes his approach to negotiations   The White House has described Witkoff as a trusted friend of the president who left behind a massive business enterprise to serve the country. He doesn't take a salary and pays for his own travel.   Witkoff is certainly no stranger to creating some Russia-related controversy.   Earlier this year, Witkoff raised eyebrows after appearing on Tucker Carlson's podcast and said Putin was \"not a bad guy.\"   In the same interview, Witkoff explained his approach to negotiations. \"There's no doubt I'm always trying to put myself in the shoes of the other person because a good deal has to work fair for everybody,\" he said.   Don Peebles, the real estate entrepreneur, told NPR this spring that he had seen that attitude firsthand during adversarial talks with Witkoff.   \"If I were going to summarize his approach is to find what the other person, other side, wants — and to try to give it to him,\" said Peebles, who fundraised for former President Barack Obama.   Peebles said he thinks Witkoff probably has more high stakes negotiating experience than most diplomats.   He remembers being forced to deal with Witkoff on a big real estate transaction in New York. Peebles considered walking away. He felt like he had a gun to his head, but never by Witkoff.   Witkoff defused the situation, promising not to be disruptive and explained how they would both be better off as partners, Peebles recalled.   \"He took a very adversarial situation from my perspective and not only got the deal done, but we've been friends ever since.\"   War in Ukraine is not the same as a real estate deal   But solving the war in Ukraine is incredibly complex.   \n   Even negotiating giants such as Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and James Baker would have a tough time convincing Putin to lay down his arms, according to Aaron David Miller, who has served as a negotiator and analyst for both Republican and Democratic administrations.   \"Deals are cut when there is urgency,\" said Miller, who is now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"And urgency is a function of two things: How much pain the parties are under and what are the prospects for gain right now.\"   Miller said that urgency requires a mediator who is prepared \"to use honey and vinegar,\" or incentives and disincentives to produce something that both Putin and Zelensky will be able to rationalize — as well as sell to their own people.   \"I just don't see Putin ready to make the kinds of concessions that would be required to anchor this thing and make it work,\" Miller said.\n",

He said the birds should be named Chuck and Nancy — after Democratic stalwarts Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi — but \"I would never pardon those people.\"   Trump claimed that last year's turkey pardons, issued by President Joe Biden, were invalid because he used an autopen. \"Where's Hunter?\" he said, suggesting that his predecessor's son could once again face legal jeopardy.   \n   And all of that was before Trump turned his attention to Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat who has resisted the White House's plans to deploy the National Guard in Chicago.   Trump said he had a joke prepared about Pritzker, but \"I refuse to talk about the fact that he's a fat slob. I don't mention it.\"   Scattered laughter rippled through the audience, which sat under cloudy skies and an intermittent drizzle on the Rose Garden patio.   Trump eventually got around to the business at hand, which was pardoning the turkeys Gobble and Waddle. Both were spared the dinner table, but only one got the spotlight.   \"Gobble, I just want to tell you this — very important — you are hereby unconditionally pardoned,\" Trump said. He reached over to run his hand over the feathers, saying, \"Who would want to harm this beautiful bird?\"   Waddle had previously been spotted in the White House briefing room.   \"Waddle, want to give us a gobble?\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt asked.   The turkey obliged.   \"Very on message!\" Leavitt said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Donald Trump pardons national Thanksgiving turkey Gobble during a ceremony in the Rose Garden of the White House, on Tuesday, in Washington.\n                \n                    Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Trump used part of his ceremonial remarks to insist that the price of Thanksgiving meals was dropping under his leadership, although his numbers are misleading. Some research indicates that holiday dinners could cost more this year, a reminder of persistent frustration with inflation.   \n   The president plans to fly south to his private Florida resort later Tuesday, a holiday interlude during what has been a turbulent and uncertain chapter of his second term.   Trump is struggling to advance a plan to end the Russian invasion of Ukraine after an earlier version faced swift criticism from European allies and even some Republicans. The U.S. military is also poised to target Venezuela with military strikes, part of an anti-drug operation that could ultimately destabilize the country's leadership.   In Washington, Trump faces the possibility of a splintering Republican coalition ahead of next year's midterm elections, which will determine control of Congress. Some members of his party already took the rare step of crossing the president by successfully pushing legislation to force the Justice Department to release more documents about the Jeffrey Epstein case.   \n   Trump faced a setback in court this week when a federal judge tossed cases against James Comey and Letitia James, two targets of the president's retribution campaign.   Comey, a former FBI director whom Trump fired during his first term, was charged with making a false statement and obstructing Congress. James, the New York attorney general who investigated the president between his two terms, was charged with mortgage fraud.   Both pleaded not guilty and said the prosecutions were politically motivated, pointing to Trump's public demands for the Justice Department to punish his enemies.   The judge said the interim U.S. attorney, a former member of Trump's personal legal team, who obtained the indictments was illegally appointed. However, the decision was made without prejudice, so the Justice Department could try again to charge Comey and James.   The White House plans to be open for holiday tours. However, despite the arrival of a Christmas tree via horse-drawn carriage on Monday, the presidential residence will be much different this year.   \n   Trump's decision to demolish the building's East Wing to make room for a new ballroom has turned part of the White House grounds into a construction site.\n",

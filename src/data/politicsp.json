    "body": "\n      What does President Trump's base think of his second-term agenda? How will they vote in November? We road-tripped through conservative counties in Maryland, New York and Pennsylvania to find out.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  President Trump is one year into his second term at a moment when many scholars and historians and a growing number of voters say Trump has wielded power in ways that are shaking the foundations of American democracy. We wanted to hear how some of Trump's core supporters view his performance so far, so we sent NPR's Brian Mann on a road trip through conservative counties in the eastern U.S.BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: It is a messy, gray, snowy winter morning, and I'm heading first on this trip to Elkton, Maryland, a little town that voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump. The goal today, through what really is Trump country, is to talk to people, to ask how they feel about how this is going.(SOUNDBITE OF DOOR OPENING)MANN: The town's Main Street is mostly empty, but I find Ann Marie Hamilton working in an office and arts nonprofit. She loves President Trump.ANN MARIE HAMILTON: I want to be proud of him, and I was the first time he was in office.MANN: Right away, I hear this deep, personal loyalty, but also uncertainty. For Hamilton, the big question in Trump's second term is affordability, grocery prices and her electric bill.HAMILTON: Prices are high enough that it stings like crazy. Like, you know, he ran his campaign, and we're all like, yay. And yay didn't happen yet.MANN: I ask if Hamilton sees any Democratic leaders offering better ideas, and she shakes her head. She tells me the Democratic brand is dead.HAMILTON: Yeah, broken. Nothing's resonating.AUTOMATED VOICE: Seven twenty-seven east.MANN: My next stop is Milford, a little town in Pike County, a place so conservative some locals call it Trump County, Pennsylvania. Like my other stops, Milford is mostly rural and overwhelmingly white. There's a nasty snowstorm, so the downtown is empty, but I find a little diner, where one of the waitresses, Tina Howell, tells me she thinks Trump is great, but she thinks he's focusing too much overseas.TINA HOWELL: He needs to start worrying about America first.MANN: What about the question of affordability? Have you started to feel any real improvement there?HOWELL: No. Nothing. I think it's getting tighter, actually, for people. Around here it is, in this town.MANN: So some real criticism. But Howell, too, says the Democratic Party isn't offering her choices. She can't name a single Democrat she likes or trusts. It's important to say my approach on this road trip isn't scientific. I'm spending time with random Trump voters in conservative towns. A poll released yesterday by YouGov and The Economist found 1 in 4 Republican voters think the country is on the wrong track under Trump. And I hear some of those doubts. But broadly, people tell me they're comfortable with Trump's use of federal power, including his controversial crackdown on immigrants.My final stop is Whitehall in Washington County, New York, where two-thirds of voters backed Trump in the last election. I meet Frank Juckett, a former Marine, outside the American Legion Hall. He says Trump is an improvement over the Democrats and Joe Biden.FRANK JUCKETT: Better than what we had.MANN: OK. So report card - what's your grade?JUCKETT: A B+.MANN: Pretty much so far, so good.JUCKETT: So far.MANN: While we talk, Juckett echoes many criticisms of Trump, saying he, too, wants the president focused on domestic issues and the economy, not things like Greenland and Venezuela. Juckett tells me he sees Trump as a bully. At one point, he compares Trump's style to that of Russian President Vladimir Putin.JUCKETT: If they're really good and crooked, things get done. And if they're not, they get stepped on.MANN: So the fact that he's kind of a rough character, that's a good thing.JUCKETT: Yes, I think so.MANN: So here's the takeaway. After this first year, many people in Trump's base talk about him critically. I hear skepticism, questions, even some harsh judgments of Trump's character. Several people tell me they want less chaos, less drama. But I also hear deep distrust of the Democrats, and every Trump voter I talked to while in these conservative rural counties say they're willing to give him more time to make their lives better.Brian Mann, NPR News in Whitehall, New York.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

    "body": "\n         Rahm Emanuel has been a fixture in Democratic Party politics for more than 30 years — serving as a member of Congress, President Obama's chief of staff, mayor of Chicago and ambassador to Japan.   He is now exploring a campaign for the presidency, an effort that seems designed to challenge some orthodoxies of that same party. He has argued that Democrats have the wrong focus on social issues, education and the economy. Appearing on a podcast with the conservative host Megyn Kelly, he answered a question about transgender people in a way she praised, and then he joked that he would need \"witness protection.\"   \n   Emanuel joined me for an extended NPR video interview in Washington, D.C., during which he expanded on his critique of Democrats, hammered the Trump administration and offered advice for the upcoming midterm elections that will decide control of Congress.   You can watch the full video interview above. Below are highlights:   He says the U.S. is throwing away global alliances   We spoke just after Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney delivered a much-noticed speech at the World Economic Forum, saying that the U.S.-led, rules-based world order was over, a \"fiction\" that other nations should abandon now that the U.S. itself no longer respects it. Carney was responding to President Trump, who had used a series of threats in a bid to take control of Greenland.   \"Carney's not wrong,\" Emanuel said. \"We just decided that it's a burden on us, and we're going to see the price for that. And that price will be more than the American people, in a host of issues–economic, political, strategic, defense-wise–than the American people are ready to bear alone.\"   He says the Trump administration betrays the idea of America held by Emanuel's family    He surely has told the story before, but Emanuel seemed genuinely moved while talking of photographs on his family's living room wall growing up. They showed 14 ancestors, \"28 eyes,\" many of whom perished in European pogroms or the Holocaust. \"We knew growing up that America was a very special place,\" he said.   \n   He said that idea of the country completely clashes with the spectacle of immigration agents flooding Minneapolis in recent weeks.   \"The idea that you have ICE agents chasing people, firing tear gas… The president attacking people on both religion, gender or faith… That is unimaginable,\" he said.   He says local governments should cooperate with ICE — in very limited cases   We had a lengthy exchange over whether local officials should collaborate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, even when they disagree with the mission. Tom Homan, President Trump's border czar, has said he wished Minneapolis would allow agents to arrest people without legal status who are held on unrelated offenses in local jails. Democratic officials have, in past administrations, asked for the same.   Emanuel said he would favor this for people in prison, \"one hundred percent,\" because people in prison have been convicted of crimes. He felt differently about jails, because \"I'm not sure what they're charged with.\"   He says both parties have failed students   Emanuel recently visited Mississippi, a conservative state that has dramatically improved student reading skills. He argued that success could be replicated elsewhere, if not for partisan politics.   \"Republicans have walked away from public education, abandoned it,\" he said. \"Democrats have abandoned accountability and standards.\"   He wants Democrats to spend more time on pocketbook issues   He argues Democrats spent too much time on social justice issues they couldn't win, such as transgender rights.   On Megyn Kelly's podcast, he was asked: \"Can a man become a woman?\" His answer was, \"No.\"   The remark seemed to go beyond debates about transgender children or trans athletes, rejecting the idea that transgender people exist at all.   Asked about this on NPR, Emanuel replied, \"That's not what I said.\" Here is the video of that exchange with him and Kelly.    In our interview, he explained what he wanted to convey – that the issue was a distraction. As mayor in 2016, he said, \"I passed an ordinance on bathroom access, but I never allowed it to distract me from high school graduation rates, reading scores and math scores.\"   \n   \"If I run and the issues on trans are the most important, I'm not your guy and I'm OK with that,\" he said.   He says there is one issue in the 2026 election   Emanuel urged Democrats to focus on Trump, who is unpopular, and the failure of other Republicans to restrain him in any way.   \"This is a referendum election. Keep it focused on the rubber stamp Republican Congress,\" Emanuel said. \"You have to win independents 2 to 1 to win the House. They are uncomfortable with Donald Trump and they're uncomfortable that nobody from the Roberts court, to the press and media, to the Republican Congress are putting a checkmate on him.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump speaks at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday. The president said he wouldn't use force to take control of Greenland. But his remarks were again highly critical of U.S. allies in Europe and elsewhere.\n                \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Evan Vucci/AP\n    \n\n   \n   President Trump has backed off his threat to take Greenland by force.   Yet Trump still delivered a fresh round of highly inflammatory remarks at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday that once again rattled U.S. allies and threatened to tear down the pillars of the world order constructed by Washington 80 years ago.   \"I don't have to use force. I don't want to use force. I won't use force,\" Trump said of Greenland in a lengthy speech to the world leaders and other prominent figures assembled for the annual event in Davos, Switzerland.    The president made clear he still wants the territory. Later, he took to social media and claimed there was a \"framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region.\"   \n   Greenland was the crisis of the day. Yet it also reflected how Trump's demands have created an increasingly hostile relationship with U.S. allies, leading to head-spinning changes to these long-standing partnerships.    U.S. allies have often tried to appease Trump to avoid open confrontation. However, his demand for territory belonging to Denmark, a close U.S. partner and a founding member of NATO, has crossed a line and prompted blunt responses from some.   Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech Tuesday at Davos went viral when he said the global order, built by the U.S. out of the ashes of World War II, is now tumbling down.    \"Today I will talk about a rupture in the world order, the end of a pleasant fiction and the beginning of a harsh reality, where geopolitics, where the large, main power, geopolitics, is submitted to no limits, no constraints,\" he said.   Carney didn't mention Trump by name, but the implication was clear.   In a sign of the times, the Canadian leader visited China last week, where he signed an economic agreement that calls for China to sell electric vehicles to Canada. The move comes as Trump's tariffs on Canada have caused trade tensions over the past year. To drive home that point, Carney said China was now a more reliable partner than the U.S.   \n   Trump undermines global networks   Prior to Trump, nearly all U.S. presidents since World War II have worked largely from the same playbook based on a global network of military alliances, an emphasis on free trade and calls for greater democracy.   \n   The U.S. and its allies have hugely benefited from this system, though as the world has changed, many of these institutions have not kept pace. Trump often describes them as burdens that inhibit his desire for swift, decisive action.   Trump has taken aim at military alliances such as NATO. He has tossed out long-standing trade arrangements in favor of punishing tariffs. He frequently dismisses political, diplomatic and cultural ties built up over decades.   \"The American-dominated liberal world order is over,\" Robert Kagan, of the Brookings Institution, wrote in a recent essay in The Atlantic.    \"This is not because the United States proved materially incapable of sustaining it. Rather, the American order is over because the United States has decided that it no longer wishes to play its historically unprecedented role of providing global security. The American might that upheld the world order of the past 80 years will now be used instead to destroy it,\" Kagan said.    Trump says his actions fall under the broad banner of \"America First.\" And in his first term, Trump consistently sought to keep U.S. forces out of foreign conflicts.    But in his second term, Trump has often turned to the military. In the past year, the U.S. has bombed four countries in the Middle East (Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen) and two in Africa (Nigeria and Somalia). Trump has threatened others, both friends and foes. And the U.S. recently ousted Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro.   An argument based on false statements    In his speech at Davos, and in many other remarks, Trump makes his case with statements that are demonstrably false.   \n   \"NATO has treated the U.S. very badly. We've never asked for anything. We've never got anything,\" Trump said on Wednesday.    After the al-Qaida terrorist attacks in 2001, NATO countries rushed to join the U.S. in the war in Afghanistan. This was the first and only time that NATO's Article 5 was triggered — the section saying an attack on one is an attack on all.   More than 1,000 troops from other NATO countries were killed in Afghanistan supporting the U.S.-led war. (The U.S. lost more than 2,400 troops in Afghanistan.)   Trump repeatedly portrays Europe as weak and in decline, unable to carry its weight on the global stage. But Europe and other allies still have ways to push back against the U.S. For starters, the U.S. has more than 700 military bases outside the U.S., with many in Europe.   Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who generally has good relations with Trump, recently criticized his approach to Greenland, which has included threats of tariffs against her country.     \"This strategy is wrong,\" she said. \"So what do you mean, that we must leave NATO? That we must close U.S. bases, we must sever trade relations, we must storm McDonald's?\"\n",

On Tuesday, NPR observed online focus groups with 14 voters from Pennsylvania who supported Joe Biden in 2020 and then swung to Trump in 2024. Seven of those voters identified themselves as Republicans, six identified as independents, and one identified as a Democrat.   The focus groups were part of the Swing Voter Project, conducted by the companies Engagious and Sago. NPR is a partner on the project.   \n   While focus groups don't provide a statistically significant sample like a poll does, they can provide insight into how some key voters view news events.   \n   In this case, eight voters said ICE is generally \"getting things about right,\" while six said it has \"gone too far.\" No one thought it has \"not gone far enough.\"   Rich Thau, president of Engagious and the moderator of the focus groups, said he observed \"a lot of frustration with ICE and how ICE has been performing around the United States\" with these Pennsylvania voters.   \"There was widespread awareness of what happened to Renee Good on Jan. 7,\" he said. \"You have a big division in these groups. It shows that there's an underlying frustration with how things are going and how things are being executed in the United States.\"   Divided blame for fatal ICE shooting in Minneapolis   Most voters had seen video of the shooting. Hassan C., a 39-year-old independent, said the agent who shot and killed Macklin Good was clearly to blame. (Participants agreed to be part of the focus groups on condition that they be identified by their first names and last initials only.)   \"From what I saw in the video, she was trying to drive away and the ICE agent moved out of the way,\" he said. \"He was no longer in harm's way. And when he started shooting her, he was no longer in the path of the vehicle.\"   \n   There were mixed opinions on who was more to blame for the incident, though. When asked, four voters blamed Macklin Good, five blamed the ICE agent, and another four said both were equally to blame.   Grace P., a 60-year-old Republican, was among the voters who felt both individuals were equally to blame. While she said that Macklin Good \"was putting herself in danger by even being there,\" she also felt the officer went too far.   \"These officers should be trained that you should never be shooting to kill,\" she said. \"There's something wrong with that scenario right there.\"   Kimberly K., a 46-year-old independent voter in Philadelphia, was one of the six voters who said ICE is generally \"getting things about right\" across the country. She said she has a \"soft spot\" for law enforcement officials because her husband worked in law enforcement for 33 years.   \"I know that's a job that not everybody can do,\" she said. \"So I just feel like a job needs to be done and they're doing it and there are other variables that make it very difficult.\"   Just two voters said Trump had any blame in the shooting, despite sending federal agents to Minnesota.   Voters want a clearer focus on the U.S. economy   A majority of the voters did, however, say that Trump needs to start focusing more on economic issues and less on foreign affairs.   In the last few weeks, the U.S. military seized Venezuela's leader and Trump has renewed his threats to acquire Greenland. When asked, all 14 voters said they were opposed to any use of force to acquire the territory. Trump on Wednesday backed off those threats and said a \"framework\" for a deal on Greenland had been reached with European leaders.   \n   \"There's a concern that he's trying to do too much on too many things and he's not singularly focused on the thing that matters to most of [voters], which is their pocketbooks,\" Thau said. \"Their frustration here is with the international activities — Greenland, Venezuela, Iran, Ukraine, Gaza, go down the list.\"   Matt A., a 31-year-old Republican, said Trump's lack of focus on economic issues has created more anxiety for him.   \"The everyday, middle-class working person sometimes gets forgotten in some of Trump's policies,\" he said.   \n   Jeremy F., a 39-year-old independent voter, said he \"definitely\" doesn't think that Trump \"cares about everyday people.\"   \"I mean, the way he lived his entire life well before he ever became president, he just only cared about money, prestige and himself,\" he said. \"It's all about him. It's him, you know? So, yeah, he's not worried about us.\"   Jeremy said Trump's focus on Venezuela and Greenland only frustrates him more because he said he voted for Trump in 2024 because \"it seemed that he was less of a war hawk.\"   \"He ran on that,\" he said. \"He ran very strongly opposing war and opposing military conflicts around the world. And now he's just going left and right and starting them.\"   Overall, eight of the 14 voters said they disapprove of Trump's job performance. But most of the group was also critical of Democrats, using words like \"weak\" and \"broken.\"\n",

Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee attacked Smith's move to collect phone records of lawmakers who had been in contact with Trump allies around the time of the Capitol riot in 2021. And they cast the historic investigations of Trump as politically motivated.   \"It was always about politics and to get President Trump, they were willing to do almost anything,\" said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, the panel's chairman.   \n   \"I am not a politician and I have no partisan loyalties,\" Smith responded. \"My office didn't spy on anyone.\"   Neither of Smith's cases reached a jury before Trump won the election and returned to the White House last year.   \n   In a videotaped deposition, Smith said the president had only himself to blame, for charges he tried to overturn the will of voters in 2020.   \"The evidence here made clear that President Trump was by a large measure the most culpable and most responsible person in this conspiracy,\" Smith said in the deposition, which congressional Republicans released on New Year's Eve. \"These crimes were committed for his benefit.\"   Smith said the violent attack at the U.S. Capitol, which injured 140 law enforcement officers, would not have happened, except for Trump. He said he could not understand the president's mass pardon of members of the Capitol mob on Trump's first day in office and predicted many of them would commit new crimes in the years ahead.   \n   \"No one should be above the law in our country, and the law required that he be held to account,\" Smith told lawmakers Thursday. \"So that is what I did.\"   He's been eager to defend the work of prosecutors and FBI agents who worked on the investigations of the president. Most of those people were fired after Trump returned to power.   Asked about regrets or mistakes, Smith said if anything, he would have expressed more appreciation for members of his team, who \"sacrificed\" so much during their government service.    \n   Trump suggests DOJ should probe Smith   During the hearing, Trump posted on Truth Social that Smith was being \"decimated\" by Republican questions.   \"Jack Smith is a deranged animal, who shouldn't be allowed to practice Law,\" Trump wrote. \"Hopefully the Attorney General is looking at what he's done, including some of the crooked and corrupt witnesses that he was attempting to use in his case against me.\"   Smith declined an opportunity to respond directly to the president's words from the witness table, but he said he fully expected the Trump Justice Department to find a way to punish him. The DOJ has already moved to bring criminal charges against two of the president's perceived foes.   \"I will not be intimidated,\" Smith said.   \n   Trump has promised at different times to launch a criminal investigation into Jack Smith or even throw him out of the country.   One area where Smith tread carefully is the investigation into classified documents the FBI found in a ballroom, a bathroom, and an office at Trump's Florida resort. A second volume of Smith's final report that concerns that episode has been blocked from release by Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee who oversaw the case, but media organizations and nonprofit groups have pushed to release it.   Trump's personal lawyer made a fresh plea this week to keep those findings secret. The president argues that Smith's report contains grand jury and privileged materials that would hurt Trump's constitutional and privacy rights if released.\n",

James Comer, R-Ky. (pictured right), and ranking member Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., confer during a hearing Wednesday on whether to hold former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in contempt of Congress.\n                \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Win McNamee/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The House Oversight Committee voted on Wednesday to hold former President Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in criminal contempt of Congress after the couple defied a congressional subpoena. The testimony demand was filed in connection with the panel's investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein case.   The panel's GOP members said they gave the Clintons plenty of chances to appear, but they refused to show for their scheduled, closed-door depositions last week. The Clintons have called the subpoenas legally invalid and said they have already shared with the committee what \"little information\" they know.    \n   House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., defended the effort, quoting Democrats who have said no one is above the law.   \"This Committee has acted in good faith. We've offered flexibility on scheduling,\" Comer argued ahead of the vote. \"The response we received was not cooperation, but defiance, marked by repeated delays, excuses and obstruction.\"   The move marks the GOP-led committee's first referral for contempt charges, underscoring the deep, partisan divide that has dominated the fight over the Epstein case. With the committee's approval, the issue will head next to the full House. If the House approves the referrals, they would move to the Justice Department for potential prosecution.   The committee voted 34-8 to hold the former president in contempt, with two members voting present. Nine Democrats joined with Republicans to advance the measure, highlighting internal tensions over what is more important: transparency in the Epstein case or defending two of their party's past standard bearers from a perceived partisan attack. Three Democrats voted to hold Hillary Clinton in contempt.    Democrats who opposed the contempt charges used Wednesday's hearing to argue that the vote amounted to little more than political score settling.   \"It's this subpoena only that Republicans and the chairman have been obsessed about putting all their energy behind,\" said California Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the panel.   \n   For example, former U.S. attorneys general Eric Holder, Loretta Lynch, Jeff Sessions and Merrick Garland also did not appear after receiving subpoenas — and none of them has been held in contempt. Comer said that was because they submitted written testimony and did not recall any information relevant to the investigation.   Garcia said the Clintons have turned over information to the committee, and offered alternatives to testify under a different format. Garcia urged Republicans to instead negotiate an interview with President Clinton, noting that he was willing to cooperate.   Democrats also argued that Republicans are not serious about the Epstein probe, noting that the Department of Justice has failed to fully cooperate with a legal mandate to release its tranche of files from investigations into the late sex offender.   \"We all agree, we all want to hear from former President Bill Clinton,\" said Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., said. \"But committee Republicans have failed to conduct a serious investigation.\"   Comer sought to push back throughout the hearing, saying Republicans are working to get to the bottom of the Epstein case. He noted that on Feb. 9, the panel will virtually interview Epstein's longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is being held at a federal prison in Texas after she was convicted for sex trafficking of a minor and conspiracy. Also, Attorney General Pam Bondi will appear in a public hearing before the House Judiciary Committee next month.   Contempt of Congress is a rare charge, though it has been used successfully in several high-profile cases. During the Biden administration, two close allies of President Trump, Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro, each served four months in prison after failing to cooperate with Democrats for their investigation into the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Scott Detrow speaks to Ashley Parker of The Atlantic about her essay recapping how President Trump's relentless boundary-pushing has exhausted his critics.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  Today, speaking in Europe, President Trump told an audience of global leaders that for now at least, he has decided the United States will not try to acquire Greenland by military force.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: 'Cause people thought I would use force. I don't have to use force. I don't want to use force. I won't use force.DETROW: The fact that I just read this sentence tells you a lot about the state of the Trump administration now a full year in. In international relations, tariffs, immigration enforcement, federal spending, federal prosecution, sending the military into cities and many more areas, Trump has repeatedly said and done things that were previously assumed to be unacceptable to voters. As Ashley Parker wrote in The Atlantic this week, the Trump administration has pushed the window of what is possible in American politics so far that his opposition just seems exhausted. Ashley, thank you for joining us again.ASHLEY PARKER: Thanks for having me.DETROW: I want to start with the title of your essay. The president has had this term for critics for years now that they suffer from Trump derangement syndrome. And you wrote that there's been so little meaningful resistance this term that we might think about Trump exhaustion syndrome instead. Can you tell me more about what you're thinking about with that?PARKER: Yeah, what I was really trying to explore with this piece one year into his second term was sort of the boiling frog theory of American politics. And I should say upfront that this theory is apocryphal. It's not actually true, but I think it works for our purposes.DETROW: Yes.PARKER: Which is - the way it goes is that if you drop a frog in boiling water, it will hop out. But if you put a frog in lukewarm water and slowly turn up the heat, it will not know to jump out because the changes will be so incremental and gradual, and it will boil to death.DETROW: I think you also gave a really good example when you talked about the boiling frog. You walk through the series of events leading up to the seizure of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela. Can you recap kind of how we got from point A to point B without any of the steps feeling overly dramatic?PARKER: Sure. So it really starts back when - in 2015 when Trump comes to national prominence as a politician in a campaign launch speech that demonizes immigrants broadly as, you know, criminals, rapists, not the best among us, people who are bringing drugs across the border. So he has been getting the country comfortable for a long time with the idea that undocumented immigrants are dangerous and they're a problem. But going to this term with Venezuela, he uses a fairly obscure wartime powers act, the Alien Enemies Act, to essentially declare that we are at war with Venezuela, specifically a Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua. And because we are at war with them, we're able to take certain wartime liberties to deport Venezuelans.DETROW: And a lot of opinion polls along the way showed that, by and large, a lot of these steps did have broad, if not a majority - you know, from time to time, a good chunk of Americans were on board with each of these steps.PARKER: Exactly. Now, there might be images they see of what this actually looks like that they kind of cringe at, but yeah, broadly, they support this. Then he begins a series of strikes on boats in the Caribbean and east Pacific oceans off the coast of Venezuela. And yes, a lot of these boats that are targeted, there are drugs on them. But it is not, as the president has claimed, you know, a huge mob or cartel boss headed to the United States. In some cases, these are small fishing boats, people who are petty criminals, bringing small amounts of cocaine, not to the United States but to neighboring islands like Trinidad. But again, I was talking to someone in the White House, and they said, look, if you ask the average American - should we blow up a boat with drugs on it headed to the United States? - they say, yes.DETROW: And that all sets the stage for the most recent seizure of another country's president...PARKER: Correct.DETROW: ...Who's brought to the United States and put on trial. And maybe, as Steve Bannon put it, a lot of people who read The Atlantic are upset about this. But maybe Americans are actually on board with a lot of this and the pushback to steps toward authoritarianism is a lot different than maybe what we thought it would be in high school social studies.PARKER: Yeah, that's exactly right. A slide towards authoritarianism, you know, when you talk to experts about this, including some of my colleagues, is - people sort of imagine it like the movie version, where there's, you know, men in jackboots marching in the streets and tanks rolling. And that's not really how it often starts. It's sort of a slow slide of getting people comfortable with things that they never thought they would be comfortable with.DETROW: I mean, what is your sense a year into the second term, reporting this story and many other stories? Do you have a sense of what you think Trump's end goals are? Is it, I want to tear down democratic norms, or is it something more straightforward of, I want to be a notable, famous president, or is it even more moment to moment and topic to topic than that? Like, how do you think about this?PARKER: I don't think he has a particular pointed desire to tear down democratic norms. What - essentially, he wants to do what he wants to do, unconstrained by laws and norms and the Constitution. And when he took office the first time, Congress could prevent that from happening. Sometimes a single senator, sometimes a single senator from his own party, could foil something he cared deeply about, and that things like the Geneva Conventions and NATO alliances could get in the way with what he wanted to do. And in many ways, these guardrails worked. And in his second term, he is just unconstrained and doing what he wants to do. And if it means shattering democratic norms, he's more than happy to bulldoze through them, but that's sort of an inadvertent symptom, not the end goal.DETROW: Yeah. Ashley Parker is a staff writer at The Atlantic. Thank you so much.PARKER: Yeah, thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the arrest of Nekima Levy Armstrong in a post on X. On Sunday, protesters entered the Cities Church in St. Paul, where a local official with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement serves as a pastor. Bondi later posted on X that a second person had been arrested, followed by a third arrested announced by FBI Director Kash Patel.   \n   The Justice Department quickly opened a civil rights investigation after the group interrupted services by chanting \"ICE out\" and \"Justice for Renee Good,\" referring to the 37-year-old mother of three who was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis earlier this month.   \"Listen loud and clear: WE DO NOT TOLERATE ATTACKS ON PLACES OF WORSHIP,\" the attorney general wrote on X.   Cities Church belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention and lists one of its pastors as David Easterwood, who leads the local ICE field office. Many Baptist churches have pastors who also work other jobs.   Attorneys representing the church hailed the arrests.   \"The U.S. Department of Justice acted decisively by arresting those who coordinated and carried out the terrible crime,\" said Doug Wardlow, director of litigation for True North Legal, which calls itself a public interest civil rights firm, in a statement.   Vance threatens the protesters with prison terms   Levy Armstrong, a civil rights attorney and prominent local activist, had called for the pastor affiliated with ICE to resign, saying his dual role poses a \"fundamental moral conflict.\"   \"You cannot lead a congregation while directing an agency whose actions have cost lives and inflicted fear in our communities,\" she said Tuesday. \"When officials protect armed agents, repeatedly refuse meaningful investigation into killings like Renée Good's, and signal they may pursue peaceful protesters and journalists, that is not justice — it is intimidation.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Vice President JD Vance speaks at an industrial shipping facility on the administration's economic agenda and impacts on the Midwest in Toledo, Ohio, on Thursday.\n                \n                    Jim Watson/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jim Watson/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Prominent leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention have come to the church's defense, arguing that compassion for migrant families affected by the crackdown cannot justify violating a sacred space during worship.   \n   Vance, speaking in Toledo ahead of his Minnesota visit, warned the church protesters: \"Those people are going to be sent to prison so long as we have the power to do so. We're going to do everything we can to enforce the law.\"   Arrests follow a DOJ civil rights investigation   A longtime activist in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, Levy Armstrong has helped lead local protests after the high-profile police-involved killings of Black Americans, including George Floyd, Philando Castile and Jamar Clark. She is a former president of the NAACP's Minneapolis branch.   Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted an image on X of Levy Armstrong with her arms behind her back next to a person wearing a badge. Noem said she faces a charge under a statute that bars threatening or intimidating someone exercising a right.   FBI Director Kash Patel posted on X that Chauntyll Louisa Allen, the second person Bondi said was arrested, is charged under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which prohibits physically obstructing or using the threat of force to intimidate or interfere with a person seeking reproductive health services or seeking to participate in a service at a house of worship. Patel said William Kelly has also been arrested.   It's unclear which attorneys would represent Allen and Kelly.   \n   Saint Paul Public Schools, where Allen is a member of the board of education, is aware of her arrest but will not comment on pending legal matters, according to district spokesperson Erica Wacker.   Allen and Levy Armstrong are part of a community of Black Minnesota activists who have protested the deaths of African Americans at the hands of police.   Kelly defended the protest during a news conference Tuesday, criticizing the church for its association with a pastor who works for ICE.   The Justice Department's swift investigation into the church protest stands in contrast to its decision not to open a civil rights investigation into the killing of Good. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said last week there was \"no basis\" for a civil rights investigation into her death.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Cities Church is seen in St. Paul, Minn., where activists shut down a service claiming the pastor was also working as an ICE agent, on Monday in St. Paul, Minn.\n                \n                    Angelina Katsanis/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Angelina Katsanis/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Administration officials have said the officer acted in self-defense and that the driver of the Honda was engaging in \"an act of domestic terrorism\" when she pulled toward him. But the decision not to have the department's Civil Rights Division investigate marked a sharp departure from past administrations, which have moved quickly to probe shootings of civilians by law enforcement officials.   \n   The Justice Department has separately opened an investigation into whether Minnesota officials impeded or obstructed federal immigration enforcement though their public statements. Prosecutors this week sent subpoenas to the offices of Gov. Tim Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her and officials in Ramsey and Hennepin counties, according to a person familiar with the matter.   Judge rejects charges against a journalist   A magistrate judge rejected federal prosecutors' bid to charge journalist Don Lemon related to the church protest, a person familiar with the matter said Thursday.   The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the ongoing investigation.   Lemon was among those on who entered the church. Lemon has said he is not affiliated with the protest organizers and was there chronicling as a journalist.   \"Once the protest started in the church we did an act of journalism which was report on it and talk to the people involved, including the pastor, members of the church and members of the organization,\" Lemon said in a video posted on social media. \"That's it. That's called journalism.\"   It wasn't immediately clear what the Justice Department would do after the judge's decision. Authorities could return to a magistrate judge to again seek a criminal complaint or an indictment against Lemon before a grand jury.   CNN, which fired Lemon in 2023, first reported the ruling.   VP visits Minnesota   Vance, a Republican, arrived amid tense interactions between federal immigration law enforcement authorities and residents. State and local elected officials have opposed the crackdown that has become a major focus of Department of Homeland Security sweeps.   His visit comes less than a month after Renee Good was killed. He has called Good's death a \"tragedy of her own making.\"   Vance said early Thursday that the \"far left\" has decided the U.S. shouldn't have a border.   \n   \"If you want to turn down the chaos in Minneapolis, stop fighting immigration enforcement and accept that we have to have a border in this country. It's not that hard,\" Vance said.   \n   A federal appeals court this week suspended a decision that barred immigration officers from using tear gas or pepper spray against peaceful protesters in Minnesota. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals froze the ruling that had barred retaliation, including detaining people who follow agents in cars.   After the court's stay, U.S. Border Patrol official Greg Bovino, who has commanded the administration's big-city immigration campaign, was seen on video repeatedly warning protesters on a snowy Minneapolis street \"Gas is coming!\" before tossing a canister that released green smoke into the crowd.   Bovino, speaking Thursday during a news conference, urged better cooperation from local and state officials in Minnesota, and blamed an \"influx of anarchists\" for the anti-ICE sentiment.   \"The current climate confronting law enforcement ... is not very favorable right now in Minneapolis,\" he said. The Associated Press left messages for the Minneapolis Police Department requesting its response to Bovino's comments.\n",

Her embattled status as an interim federal prosecutor led to the dismissal of controversial Justice Department cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.   \n   Trump named Halligan to the Virginia post on Sept. 21, 2025 — one day after Erik Siebert, the district's former acting U.S. attorney, resigned under pressure from Trump, including repeated calls for criminal charges against James, Comey and others Trump perceived as enemies.   Federal judges repeatedly stated that Halligan, who once worked as a personal attorney for Trump, had no valid basis to identify herself as the acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, ruling that her predecessor, Siebert, had already exhausted the 120-day period for an acting federal prosecutor.   \n   To legally occupy the job now, federal judges said, Halligan or any other potential prosecutor must be either Senate confirmed or appointed by a District Court.   Halligan and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi rejected the courts' interpretation in strong terms, saying in a court filing last week that U.S. District Judge David J. Novak was \"flat wrong\" and overstepping judicial powers.   \n   Novak's response, issued Tuesday, was equally forceful, stating that any attempt by the administration to fill the prosecutor post by appointment would violate U.S. law \"and the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\"   \"In short, this charade of Ms. Halligan masquerading as the United States Attorney for this District in direct defiance of binding court orders must come to an end,\" the judge wrote.   In a Tuesday post on X, Bondi said Halligan's 120-day appointment to the job had expired and blamed her departure from the prosecutor's office on Senate Democrats and \"multiple, unnecessary legal obstacles.\" She said Halligan, 36, \"will continue to serve her country in other ways.\"   After Trump announced her appointment, Halligan rapidly secured criminal indictments against both Comey and James — each of whom pleaded not guilty. The Justice Department charged Comey with making false statements and obstructing a congressional proceeding, in connection with his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee. James was charged with bank fraud and making a false statement.   \n   But Halligan's contested job status threw the work of the prosecutor's office into turmoil after U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie ruled that her appointment was unlawful. Because of Halligan's \"defective appointment\" and prominent role in prosecuting Comey and James, Currie ruled, the indictments were set aside.   \n   The Eastern District of Virginia is headquartered in Alexandria. As its U.S. Attorney's Office website notes, numerous influential jurists have held the top prosecutor's job there, including John Marshall, who went on to become chief justice of the Supreme Court.   As NPR reported in November, Halligan had previously drawn notice for her involvement in the Trump administration's review of more than half a dozen Smithsonian Institution museums, with the goal of aligning their cultural messages with the president.\n",

Today's top stories   President Trump plans to focus on affordability today in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. But his foreign policy — specifically, Trump's desire to acquire Greenland — and his threats of tariffs on eight European countries if he doesn't get his way are overshadowing the summit. When the president takes the stage, world leaders will be paying close attention to signs of where this confrontation with allies goes next.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                This photograph, taken on Jan. 20, 2026, shows the logo of the World Economic Forum in the Alpine resort of Davos.

She adds that, for his second term, Trump is pursuing a belligerent foreign policy that alienates allies and lacks domestic popularity. Kurtzleben says these actions, along with his aggressive tactics in Minnesota, are drawing attention away from the domestic economy, which Trump wants to focus on.   The Justice Department has issued grand jury subpoenas to multiple government officials in Minnesota, including Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. The agency is alleging that state officials conspired to impede law enforcement amid the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.    \n   🎧 Minnesota officials suggest the subpoenas do not faze them, says NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán. They say that these actions are an intimidation tactic by the administration that is weaponizing the DOJ. Officials say they pushed back against the administration's immigration crackdown because of what they say are the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency's illegal actions in their state. This includes ICE agents intimidating the people who follow them to alert neighbors to their presence. Day-to-day lives in Minnesota continue to be impacted as dozens of doctors in the state say patients are avoiding the medical care they may need because they fear ICE.   The U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments today regarding Trump's efforts to break with 112 years of law by firing Lisa Cook. Cook is a member of the Federal Reserve's governing board, appointed by former President Joe Biden.    🎧 The president's lawyers are expected to tell the Supreme Court that he is not looking for a free pass to fire Cook, but instead fired her for cause, says NPR's Nina Totenberg. The administration claims she committed mortgage fraud when she obtained loans on two different properties because she listed two homes as her primary residences, but at different times. Cook denies any wrongdoing. The Trump administration argues the court cannot review a president's decision to fire a Fed board member once he determines he has cause. This caveat would essentially grant him unrestricted power to purge the Fed and install personal picks, Totenberg says.   \n   Today's listen   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Boundaries, bodies, and better sex in 2026\n                \n                    Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   What does sexual safety look like these days?

One year in, gasoline prices are down about 20%, but electricity prices are going up. The Trump administration has also invested in nuclear power, which could help reduce costs in the long term. Take a look at how he has delivered on his goals:    ➡️ Presidents don't decide gas prices. The cost of crude oil is the biggest factor. A global oversupply of oil largely drove cheaper crude oil prices this past year.➡️ Electricity prices are increasing due to three primary reasons: an aging power grid, the cost of natural disasters and higher fuel costs, says Charles Hua, who runs the national energy consumer education nonprofit Powerlines.➡️ The administration has ended federal tax credits for large solar and wind projects, which provide more cost-competitive energy than natural gas, nuclear and coal projects.   3 things to know before you go   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A general view of the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 10, 2026.

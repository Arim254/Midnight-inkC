    "body": "\n      Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire reacts after both chambers of Congress moved to force the Justice Department to release its files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire is among the many Democrats who had been pressing for a vote so Epstein's victims could have, quote, \"answers, accountability and the truth.\" And she joins me now. Good morning, Senator.MAGGIE HASSAN: Good morning, Leila. Thanks for having me.FADEL: Thank you for being here. Does the passage of this bill satisfy your calls for greater transparency?HASSAN: Well, it's certainly a beginning, and it's long overdue. The president needs to sign this into law. But I think what's really important to be thinking about today is the pain that the survivors and victims have suffered at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. I hope that the president's signature will mean that there is a prompt release of the files, and that that can bring some accountability and some closure. I just finished the memoir of Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein and Maxwell's victims...FADEL: Yeah.HASSAN: ...And it is really clear that without their voices, without their strength and bravery, which required that they relive pain over and over and over again, this wouldn't have happened. It's also a really important example, I think, to all Americans, about the difference you can make when you speak up and are persistent in the cause of this kind of justice and accountability.FADEL: Do you have any concern that if this bill is signed into law, for some reason, the Justice Department won't release the files? We heard Republican Congressman Thomas Massie, who, as you know, has long backed the releasing of these files, say he's worried that President Trump's demand for a Justice Department investigation into Democrats with Epstein ties will be used to prevent the release of the documents.HASSAN: Well, I certainly understand that concern, but what I hope is that the Trump administration has received the message loudly and clearly that there was unanimous passage of this bill in Congress, that the people of the United States are united in wanting answers here, that this long history of treating Epstein and Maxwell as a special class of people needs to end. And I think, you know, I'm hopeful that they will understand that the pressure from the American people and particularly from survivors and victims of Epstein and Maxwell is not going to subside simply because he signs a bill. He's going to have to follow through. The Justice Department is going to have to follow through here.FADEL: The bill passed with unanimous consent, as you mentioned in the Senate. The lone holdout in the House was Louisiana Republican Clay Higgins, who said he voted no on principle. In his words, quote, \"it abandons 250 years of criminal justice procedure in America.\" And we also heard House Speaker Mike Johnson - who did vote for it - say he was upset that what passed the Senate didn't include changes that he'd wanted, things like victim and whistleblower name protections. How would you respond to those concerns?HASSAN: Well, first of all, the legislation provides for privacy protections for victims and survivors. But let's also just think this through for a minute. Two hundred and fifty years of criminal justice procedure and law has also shielded abusers of children and women and people who traffic them. And the victims and survivors, in this case, have been unbelievably brave. They're the ones who have been calling for the release of these files for transparency, and they understand how important it is for people to understand the horror, the physical pain, the psychological pain this and trauma that Epstein and Maxwell and people like them and people who participated in this trafficking and abuse caused. And, you know, this is a really important moment because women and girls are not invisible, and they should be listened to and have the same rights and be able to hold the powerful to account the same way everybody else can.FADEL: What do you say to the Republicans who voted for the release of these files, but also say Democrats are using this as a way to attack the president, versus go after - protect the victims or get justice for victims?HASSAN: Look, the victims and survivors are the people who are speaking up and wanting this transparency. This was a - of course, a campaign promise that President Trump made that he would release the files. It is, of course, one of many campaign promises that this president has broken. But what I think is really critical is for people to understand that Epstein and Maxwell had reached well beyond the United States. They attempted to intimidate these victims wherever they were around the world. In Virginia Giuffre's case, threatening her as she was living in Australia, trying to silence her. And I think it's really important for the truth to come out here. And again, for us to take a step forward to say, trafficking of girls and boys, sexual abuse of girls and boys and women and men is wrong. And we need to stand together as a country and address this horror.FADEL: Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire. Thank you for your time.HASSAN: Thank you.

The survey of 1,443 adults, conducted from Nov. 10-13, found:   Democrats holding their largest advantage, 14 points, since 2017 on the question of who respondents would vote for if the midterm elections were held today;President Trump's approval rating is just 39%, his lowest since right after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol;A combined 6-in-10 blame congressional Republicans or Trump for the government shutdown; and Nearly 6-in-10 say Trump's top priority should be lowering prices — and no other issue comes close.   \n   \"I don't think rent prices or food prices are at the forefront like they should be,\" said Nicole Stokes of Dallas, Texas, who participated in NPR's poll and voted for Trump last year. \"You know — the American people — it's our pockets that are getting ripped apart to fund things.\"   From the political parties and Congress to the Supreme Court and the media, other respondents said they had little to no confidence in these critical institutions.   \"I feel lost,\" said poll respondent Wayne Dowdy of Memphis, Tenn., who calls himself a \"lapsed Democrat.\" \"The parties don't speak to me anymore.\"   He said he often feels unseen by the Democratic Party, but, given the alternative, he plans to keep supporting Democratic candidates — for now.   The disillusionment extends to how people see those in the opposite political party. Big majorities of Democrats and Republicans said the other party is \"dishonest\" and \"closed-minded\" about politics.   All of it makes for a volatile political stew heading into the holidays, but with Republicans in charge of all the levers of power in Washington, Democrats have the clear advantage a year out from next year's midterm elections.   Loading...\n   Democrats in the driver's seat for control of Congress   Coming off huge wins up and down the ballot across the country in this year's off-year elections, Democrats lead Republicans, 55%-41%, when people were asked who they would vote for in their district if the election for Congress were held today.   It's the largest Democratic advantage on this question, known as the congressional ballot, in the Marist poll since November 2017. The parallel is striking, considering that was at the same point in Trump's first term as this poll now. Democrats wound up winning 40 House seats in 2018.   Loading...\n   What's more, independents chose Democrats by a 33-point margin on this question. It's all quite the reversal of fortune from a year ago when, just before the 2024 elections when President Trump won back the White House, the parties were tied on the congressional ballot.   Historically, Democrats have needed a sizable advantage on the congressional ballot to signal that they would do well in upcoming midterms.   Consider:   In the fall of 2022, with Democratic President Biden in the White House, Democrats' lead ranged from 0 to 4 points. They lost nine House seats;In 2018, during Trump's first term, Democrats' lead ranged between 6 and 12. They won 40 seats; In 2014, when Democrat Barack Obama was president, Republicans had a 5-point advantage. The GOP gained 13 seats.   All that said, with redistricting, the number of competitive seats has shrunk significantly, so major gains are less likely than they were in previous years. Trump has also encouraged conservatives in red states to try and create more Republican districts in rare mid-decade redistricting.   \n   Democrats have responded in kind, so the landscape for control of the House for next year remains uncertain at this point.   The Trump drag on the GOP   A big reason for Democrats' advantage is that Trump is unpopular. Not only is he at 39% approval, the lowest of this second term in the Marist poll, but he gets just a 24% rating with independents as well.   Overall, almost half of those surveyed — 48% — said they strongly disapprove of the job the president is doing. That's also the highest of this term and the highest since just after Jan. 6, 2021.   The president has seen low ratings for his handling of various policy areas, including the economy and foreign policy, and people think he's gone too far on immigration.   Trump has said on more than one occasion in this second term that while campaign advisers told him prices were the most important issue, he always felt it was really immigration. But respondents in the NPR survey are sending a clear message: they think the cost of living should be Trump's top priority.   Almost 6-in-10 — 57% — said lowering prices should be his top priority. Immigration is a distant second at 16%. Even a plurality of Republicans (40%) said lowering prices should be the priority compared to immigration (34%).   Loading...\n   Despite Trump's slide in approval ratings, he's holding up well with his base — 9-in-10 Republicans continue to say they approve of the job he's doing.   Stokes, the Trump voter from Dallas, said a year into his presidency, said she's pleased by his attempts to tackle illegal border crossings and restrict U.S. foreign aid, but she is concerned that the president hasn't made the economy a focus.   But her support of Trump doesn't translate to Republicans on Capitol Hill. Instead, she said, she has little confidence in the elected officials representing either political party.   \"They're not in tune with anyone on the ground,\" Stokes said. \"I don't really see anyone in [the House] or in the Senate that's really for the American people right now.\"   It's not just Trump. Democrats and others get low marks   Trump's approval is low and so is confidence in the office he holds — 61% said they have little to no confidence in the institution of the presidency.   \n   But the scores were even poorer for other key institutions. Worst among them was Congress — 80% said they had little to no confidence in it, followed by the media (75%), the Democratic Party (71%), the Republican Party (65%) and the Supreme Court (62%).   This is yet another poll that shows Democrats have a problem with their base. While 80% of Republicans have \"quite a lot\" or a \"great deal\" of confidence in the GOP, just 57% of Democrats said the same of their party.   Despite long supporting liberal candidates, Dowdy, the Democrat from Memphis, argues the party has become disconnected from everyday voters.   \"They don't interact with working people,\" he said, \"regardless of whether they work in an office or on a job site or building homes or working in a factory. They don't know how people like that live... They have no connection to the real people. And there's no attempt to try and reach that.\"   And yet, Democrats have a wide advantage on the congressional ballot, which, coupled with the electoral gains earlier this month, indicate that left-leaning voters may rally to Democrats' side when faced with having to choose between them and Republicans.   Democrats and Republicans see each other as \"dishonest\" and \"closed-minded\"   \nLoading...\nLoading...\n\n   It's no wonder political acrimony is as high as it is in the country; people have very little respect for where the other side is coming from.   The survey found that more than 8-in-10 Republicans and Democrats described people in the other political party as \"closed-minded\"; more than 7-in-10 Republicans and roughly two-thirds of Democrats also see the other as \"dishonest\" when talking about politics.   Independents have better views of Democrats than Republicans. They said Republicans were more dishonest and closed-minded than Democrats with a majority of independents (54%) saying Republicans were \"mostly dishonest\" compared to more than 6-in-10 saying Democrats were \"mostly honest\" when it came to politics.   Nearly 7-in-10 independents also described Republicans as mostly closed-minded, while a majority (53%) said Democrats were mostly open-minded.\n",

    "body": "\n      A measure to compel the Justice Department to release its files on Jeffrey Epstein is on its way to President Trump's desk after quickly advancing through both chambers of Congress Tuesday.   \n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  Both chambers of Congress have now moved to force the Justice Department to release its files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. We'll hear from one of the senators who voted for the bill, Democrat Maggie Hassan, right after we get up to date on the facts.LEILA FADEL, HOST:  President Trump has promised to sign the measure but told reporters that the intense focus on the files is a Democratic hoax.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein. I threw him out of my club many years ago 'cause I thought he was a sick pervert. But - and I guess I turned out to be right.MARTÍNEZ: NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas is following this story from Capitol Hill. So when we talk about releasing the Epstein files, Sam, I mean, which ones are we talking about?SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: So this legislation applies to unclassified documents, communications or investigation materials held by the Justice Department, the FBI and U.S. attorneys' offices related to federal investigations into Epstein in New York and Florida. Now, it's worth noting that the House Oversight Committee has already released other Epstein files, including thousands of pages of emails obtained from the Epstein estate. That batch of documents included Epstein telling a journalist that Trump, quote, \"knew about the girls,\" seemingly referring to people Epstein was trafficking. As we just heard, the president has said he broke ties with Epstein years ago and has denied any wrongdoing.MARTÍNEZ: Now, releasing the files has been a very divisive thing within the Republican Party. But, yeah, yesterday, legislation sailed through both chambers. So take us through what changed.GRINGLAS: For months, President Trump and Republican leaders in Congress tried to thwart a vote on these files. But Democrats and some Republicans, like Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, pressed ahead. Greene said Trump's refusal to release the files was a betrayal of his most ardent supporters.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE: For people that slept in their cars to go to rallies, have fought for truth and transparency, watching this actually turn into a fight has ripped MAGA apart.GRINGLAS: But once a bipartisan petition to force the issue got enough signatures, Trump reversed course. And that paved the way for Tuesday's vote in the House, which several survivors of Epstein's abuse actually watched from the gallery. Here's one of them, Jena-Lisa Jones, who spoke outside the Capitol before the votes.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JENA-LISA JONES: It is not about you, President Trump. I voted for you, but your behavior on this issue has been a national embarrassment.GRINGLAS: The House passed the legislation 427 to 1. And within a few hours, the Senate agreed to automatically advance the measure without a vote as soon as it arrives from the House, and that is expected sometime today.MARTÍNEZ: Four hundred twenty-seven to 1 sounds like unity, right?GRINGLAS: I mean, on paper, sure, but it's clear that many Democrats and Republicans are looking at this fight through different lenses. Just listen to House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer of Kentucky.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JAMES COMER: Democrats have chosen to manufacture yet another anti-Trump hoax instead of pursuing justice.GRINGLAS: And compare that to his Democratic counterpart on that committee, Robert Garcia of California.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ROBERT GARCIA: Trump has the power to release the files today. He does not even need a vote. What is Donald Trump hiding?MARTÍNEZ: So, Sam, the debate over the files - I think it's still a couple of steps to go before we get any resolution.GRINGLAS: The materials have to be made public within 30 days of Trump signing the bill. Depending on what comes out, that could fuel new conflicts. Trump, for example, has pledged to focus on Democrats whose names might come up.

Greg Abbott has appealed a ruling that blocked the state from using a voting map designed to give Republicans an advantage in next year's midterm elections.   \n\n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  A federal court in Texas dealt a blow to President Trump's effort to reshape the midterm elections in favor of Republicans. A three-judge panel on Tuesday blocked the redistricting that Texas Republicans passed this summer. They were aiming to improve the GOP's chances of winning five more seats in the U.S. House, where Republicans have just a narrow majority. We're going to talk more about this. We're joined by Houston Public Media's Andrew Schneider. So, Andrew, Republicans in Texas said they were drawing new maps to get a political advantage in next year's election. What did the court have to say about that?ANDREW SCHNEIDER, BYLINE: Well, the court didn't buy the Republicans' arguments that they were only engaging in partisan gerrymandering, which would have been legal. They call it racial gerrymandering. Judges noted that Governor Greg Abbott and state lawmakers didn't start the redistricting process until Abbott received a letter from the Trump administration framing Trump's request to redistrict, quote, \"as a demand to redistrict congressional seats based on their racial makeup.\" The judges said that the plaintiffs, which included several civil rights groups were likely to prove at trial that Texas had racially gerrymandered the 2025 map, which is illegal. So they issued an injunction against its use in the 2026 midterms. Texas Republican leaders have already appealed a ruling directly to the US Supreme Court, so we haven't heard the final word.MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. President Trump called for the redistricting there, and his Justice Department wrote that letter. It seemed to backfire, though.SCHNEIDER: Exactly. The judges said the DOJ got the case law on which it called for the districts to be redrawn completely wrong. District Judge Jeffrey V. Brown wrote the opinion yesterday. He was appointed by President Trump back in his first term. He zeroed in on the letter from the Justice Department that set the redistricting in motion, even how it was written. He said there were typos and legal mistakes in it. He said even attorneys employed by the Texas attorney general described the letter as legally unsound, baseless, erroneous, ham-fisted and a mess.MARTÍNEZ: And there's been a lot of reaction from both sides. Can you give us a sample of that?SCHNEIDER: Yeah. Democrats are saying they're elated. I talked to Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher, who represents a Houston district that was largely left intact by the redistricting, but she said the plan hurt voters in every district in Texas.LIZZIE FLETCHER: Every Texan should be supporting this decision to make sure that Texans, every single one of us, has the opportunity to have our voices heard and to cast a meaningful vote at the ballot box.SCHNEIDER: And on the other side, we've got Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who said any claim that the maps are discriminatory is absurd. He called the ruling erroneous and has gone to the Supreme Court.MARTÍNEZ: Now, California's redistricting response to Texas, that was Prop 50. That was passed by voters earlier this month. It faces its own legal battle, with its first court date set for December 3. But, Andrew, I mean, so far, it looks like Gavin Newsom, the governor of California will move forward with it.SCHNEIDER: Yeah. Usually, states redistrict at the start of the decade when a census comes in, but now because of Trump, there's a redistricting race across the country. California already responded to Texas by drawing maps designed to give Democrats help winning five seats there. Missouri and North Carolina have redistricted to Republicans. It's ongoing, and it could determine who runs the House in 2027, and Democrats can check the Trump agenda.MARTÍNEZ: All right. That's Houston Public Media's Andrew Schneider. Thanks a lot, Andrew.SCHNEIDER: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      After cutting ties with the Heritage Foundation, an antisemitism task force formed to address what they described as left-wing antisemitism has reformed independently and broadened its focus.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Conservatives are regrouping after a task force set up to fight antisemitism announced it was cutting ties with the influential conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation. The foundation's president is facing criticism for defending Tucker Carlson after he hosted far-right influencer, white nationalist and antisemite Nick Fuentes on his podcast. The antisemitism task force met publicly Tuesday for the first time since the split happened about two weeks ago. NPR political correspondent Sarah McCammon was there, and she joins me now in studio. Good morning.SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Good morning.FADEL: OK. So how did the antisemitism task force find itself separating from Heritage?MCCAMMON: Yeah. Just to step back a little bit, Tucker Carlson's interview with Nick Fuentes triggered a backlash from some prominent Republicans because Fuentes has this long history of extreme remarks. He's praised Hitler, proudly called himself a racist. It rose to another level after The Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts defended Carlson. As a result, the National Task Force to Combat Antisemitism announced it was cutting ties with Heritage.FADEL: OK. So now they're reformed independently. What's next?MCCAMMON: Well, they say the events of the past few weeks have broadened their focus as a group. And one of the task force co-chairs, Luke Moon, says they had been focused on what they describe as left-wing antisemitism.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LUKE MOON: The fight on the left is still happening. That is not done. That is a work that still has to go on. But we now have an emergent threat on the right.MCCAMMON: And so, Leila, now, the task force wants to push back forcefully against rhetoric from people like Fuentes.FADEL: Right. And he's an influential person. You were there. Who else was in the room?MCCAMMON: Well, there were a lot of conservative Christian groups and some conservative-leaning Jewish leaders, and several prominent evangelical leaders were present too. Plus, President Trump's ambassador to Israel, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, spoke to the group through a video message.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE HUCKABEE: So, in Genesis, when the scripture says, God will bless those who bless Israel and curse those who curse Israel, we don't argue with God about that.MCCAMMON: So Huckabee tried to make the case for Israel from the Bible and told the group that Christians should have respect for Judaism because their faith comes from it.FADEL: What was he trying to accomplish with this messaging to this room?MCCAMMON: Yeah. Evangelical Christians, for the most part, ground their support for Israel in their interpretation of the Bible, and they have historically been the group most likely to support the Jewish state, even more than Jewish Americans in some polls. But other broadly pro-Israel groups warned that invoking religion only heightens tensions around the conflict in the Middle East. Jeremy Ben-Ami is president of J Street, which describes itself as a liberal, pro-Israel Jewish group.JEREMY BEN-AMI: When any side, whether it is Muslims, Christians or Jews, begin to introduce the idea that God somehow gave only one people a piece of land, you make it a conflict that can't be resolved.MCCAMMON: But some of the Jewish leaders involved in this task force are willing to work with Christian groups who share their position on Israel.FADEL: Now, this is coming at a time when President Trump's supporters are divided on a number of issues. What does this debate over how to fight antisemitism mean for conservative activists going forward?MCCAMMON: Well, a Heritage spokesperson pointed to a past statement from their president, Kevin Roberts, that called for fighting antisemitism across the political spectrum. The task force co-chair Luke Moon told me that he would not rule out the possibility of the group returning to Heritage one day, but he says this is a good time right after the off-year elections and well before the midterms for the conservative movement to be having this conversation.FADEL: That's NPR national political correspondent Sarah McCammon.

Greg Abbott has quickly appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court a ruling that the redistricting passed by lawmakers at the urging of President Trump was based on racial gerrymandering.   \"Any claim that these maps are discriminatory is absurd and unsupported by the testimony offered during ten days of hearings,\" Abbott, a Republican, said in a statement. \"This ruling is clearly erroneous and undermines the authority the U.S. Constitution assigns to the Texas Legislature by imposing a different map by judicial edict.\"   A three-judge panel had earlier Tuesday placed a temporary block on the map that Republican lawmakers passed this summer and ordered the state to use the district maps from the last two elections.   \n   The map that was overruled had been drawn to give Republicans an advantage in flipping as many as five House seats held by Democrats.    \"To be sure, politics played a role in drawing the 2025 Map. But it was much more than just politics. Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map,\" wrote the majority from a three-judge panel.   The panel heard a trial on the case in October. The plaintiffs included several civil rights groups and individuals.   The ruling is a blow to Trump and the Republicans in a nationwide redistricting race that began in Texas this summer.   Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate, also said he would appeal the ruling on the \"Big Beautiful Map\" which he called \"entirely legal\" in a statement.   Democrats praised the court ruling. \"Race was always a driving factor and a driving factor to make it harder for minority Texans,\" said Texas Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher in an interview. \"This map was drawn to make it harder for them to have an impact in elections.\"   \n   The court's decision, in a 2-1 ruling, comes at a pivotal moment. Around the country, Trump is pressing Republican state lawmakers to reshape congressional voting maps to hold the party's slim majority in the House and support his agenda.   Using their heavy Republican majority in the legislature, Texas lawmakers passed a map in August designed to help their party grow its ranks in the 2026 elections for the U.S. House.   The process gained national attention when Democrats in the legislature fled the state for over two weeks to delay a vote and Republican leaders threatened to arrest them. Democrats argued the new map weakened the voting power of Latino and Black communities.   \n   The redistricting in Texas also prompted California Democrats to act. This month California voters passed an initiative allowing redistricting that could help Democrats win five seats in that state.   Was it partisan gerrymandering or racial gerrymandering?    Republicans in the Texas Legislature passed the map saying it was designed to improve their party's chances of winning five congressional seats. They noted that, unlike in some states, the law in Texas does not prohibit redistricting for partisan advantage and that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that federal courts could not intervene when it's done.   But partisan gerrymandering can often overlap with racial gerrymandering, which is illegal. Opponents of the map argued in court that it intentionally diminished the voting power of minority communities.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Texas state Sen. Sarah Eckhardt, a Democrat, right, questions Republican Sen. Phil King during debate in August over the Republican-backed district map that a federal court blocked and called a racial gerrymander on Tuesday.\n                \n                    Eric Gay/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Eric Gay/AP\n    \n\n   \n   The 160-page opinion was written by District Judge Jeffrey V. Brown, who was appointed by Trump during his first term as president. His ruling drew upon statements and contradictions in what Republican lawmakers said as the maps were passed.   A letter the Department of Justice wrote to encourage the redistricting ended up being grounds the court used to block the effort.   The judges noted that when Gov. Abbott originally called lawmakers into session to draw the map, he cited a letter from Justice Department officials criticizing districts that had majority nonwhite voting populations as \"racial gerrymanders.\" In other words, the letter implied the districts as they stood gave non-white voters an advantage and that had to be reversed.   Eventually, Texas Republicans said the map was not intended to correct for a racial tilt but for partisan gain.   That letter put lawmakers, who for years had denied their use of race when making maps, in \"a difficult spot,\" according to University of Texas at Austin political scientist Josh Blank, because they were \"ultimately saying opposite things.\"   Brown's ruling criticized the construction of the letter itself, which was sent by Harmeet Dhillon, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. \"It's challenging to unpack the DOJ Letter because it contains so many factual, legal, and typographical errors,\" Brown wrote.   \n   \"This decision is a rebuke of Donald Trump and to some degree a rebuke of lawmakers in Texas,\" said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political scientist with the University of Houston. \"They think the process was flawed and the Department of Justice was not credible in their legal arguments.\"   Rep. Gene Wu, Democratic leader in the Texas House, said Tuesday's ruling shows the courts still hold true to American principles.   \"The striking down of the maps is fundamentally a sign that the courts still believe in the core principles of this country: That one man, one vote idea is something that is absolute and must be kept up,\" Wu said.   Around the country, Republicans have more options for redistricting seats their way than Democrats do, in part because the GOP controls more state legislatures. Usually, states redistrict at the start of the decade after the national census.   At the behest of Trump, lawmakers in Missouri and North Carolina passed new maps that could help the GOP win a seat in each state. Ohio drew a map that analysts say gives Republicans a slight advantage in a few seats.   For Democrats, in addition to the five seats that could be gained in California, a court-ordered redistricting in Utah could help Democrats win a seat there. And Virginia Democrats have started a process that could yield two seats in that state.      Blaise Gainey covers state politics for The Texas Newsroom.

It was the marquee event of the annual Tradeswomen Build Nations conference. The women marched, sang and rang cowbells, proudly sporting their union t-shirts and carrying banners announcing their trades: plumbing, pipefitting, roofing, drywall finishing and many more.   Leading the parade in fluorescent vests and hardhats was a drumline made up of a dozen or so staff from the nonprofit Chicago Women in Trades.   \"This is amazing to see what it has grown into,\" says Lauren Sugerman, who worked as an elevator constructor in the 1980s before spending the bulk of her career at Chicago Women in Trades. \"To see the sisterhood that has been built is so empowering.\"   \n   But behind the celebration are grave concerns that the organization, which has been breaking down barriers for women in the construction industry since Ronald Reagan was president, could be brought down by President Trump.   As Trump wages a war against diversity, equity and inclusion or DEI, Chicago Women in Trades is fighting back in court, both for its own preservation and for the movement.   Trump's all-out effort to end DEI   Hours after Trump took office, he signed a pair of executive orders cracking down on what he said was widespread and illegal use of \"dangerous, demeaning, and immoral race- and sex-based preferences.\"   His orders called on government agencies to cease DEI-related work and directed government contractors and grantees to end their programs promoting it. Trump also rescinded a 1965 executive order, signed by former President Lyndon B. Johnson, that required federal contractors and subcontractors to take proactive steps to ensure they weren't violating federal anti-discrimination laws.    Trump promised a renewed emphasis on merit, replacing what he called a \"pernicious identity-based spoils system.\"   \n   Here's why that's a problem for Chicago Women in Trades: The organization was founded in 1981 in response to Johnson's executive order and a subsequent Labor Department requirement — also now gone — that federal contractors make good faith efforts to get women onto construction sites. Its stated mission is to promote diversity, equity and inclusion, including by recruiting women and helping them qualify and compete for high-wage union construction jobs.    Some 70% of its participants are Black and Latina. As of January, roughly 40% of its annual budget came from U.S. Labor Department grants.   \n   What is illegal DEI? Lots of threats but no clarity   While the loss of federal grants would be devastating, perhaps even more damaging to Chicago Women in Trades is the certification provision tucked inside one of Trump's executive orders.   Going forward, federal contractors and grantees must certify that they are not operating programs \"promoting DEI that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws.\" Anyone found to have knowingly reported false information could face steep civil and criminal penalties, according to the executive order.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Chicago Women in Trades Executive Director Jayne Vellinga says the organization is in limbo as it fights Trump's anti-DEI executive orders in court.\n                \n                    Chicago Women in Trades\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chicago Women in Trades\n    \n\n   \n   \"There's a lot of threats out there but no clarity on what is illegal DEI,\" says Chicago Women in Trades Executive Director Jayne Vellinga. \"It is unclear how the industry or anyone is going to respond to it.\"   It's a conundrum that puts the nonprofit in a precarious position. Chicago Women in Trades works closely with labor unions and contractors to ensure the women they recruit and train can get into apprenticeship programs to grow their careers. Would unions and contractors now sever those relationships if forced to certify that they're not engaging in illegal DEI? Without those established systems, Vellinga fears hard-won gains for women could be lost.   \"We have an administration that is trying to turn back the clock on progress it has taken decades to achieve,\" says Vellinga.   In a statement to NPR, White House spokesman Kush Desai pushed back.   \"Instead of DEI boondoggles that accomplish nothing, the Trump administration is laying the groundwork for Americans of all backgrounds to help build our next Golden Age,\" Desai wrote, pointing to another executive order Trump signed that aims to boost the country's skilled trades workforce. Trump has pledged to support 1 million new registered apprenticeships per year and says a plan for doing so is forthcoming.   \n   Women-focused programs have changed lives   Talk to female construction workers around Chicago and you get a sense for how Chicago Women in Trades has long worked to achieve those same goals.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Second-year plumbing apprentices Charlie Willoughby, Juliet Silvestre and Kaitlyn Truty all came into the skilled trades through a pre-apprenticeship program run by Chicago Women in Trades.\n                \n                    Andrea Hsu/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrea Hsu/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Second-year plumbing apprentices Kaitlyn Truty, Charlie Willoughby and Juliet Silvestre credit the nonprofit with getting them into their careers.   \"I 100% believe so,\" says Truty.   All three women came through the organization's free, 10-week training program, where they got an introduction to the gamut of construction trades and learned basic skills such as tool handling and blueprint reading.   \n   \"We had to work out as well,\" says Willoughby, recalling the morning gym sessions. As part of an assessment to enter the plumbers union, they had to lift an 80-pound box onto a shelf over their heads. Chicago Women in Trades brought in plumbers to teach them how to do it.   \"It was so intimidating,\" says Truty. \"I couldn't do more than two pushups walking in, and I walked out … being able to do 50-plus pushups in one go, and I lifted that box.\"   The apprentices say having a community of women around them helped them believe that they were up to the task and prepared them for the challenges they would face as females in the industry. Even now, they say they are often the only woman on a job site.   \"The people in your family don't understand what you're going through, but another tradeswoman can relate to you,\" says Silvestre. \"They understand me.\"   The carpenters union ends \"Sisters in the Brotherhood\"   Already, one building trades union has taken steps to avoid running afoul of Trump's executive orders. Earlier this year, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, representing more than a half million workers in North America, disbanded its Sisters in the Brotherhood program.   For more than a quarter century, the program gave women carpenters a space to build networks and share ideas for how to overcome barriers. In a memo, Douglas McCarron, the union's general president, wrote that current policies targeting identity-based initiatives put the program at legal risk. It's been replaced with an engagement program, open to all members.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Retired union carpenter Kina McAfee listens to stories of other tradeswomen who, like her, entered the construction industry in the 1980s. McAfee says women-focused programs are critical to getting women established in the industry and keeping them on the job.\n                \n                    Chicago Women in Trades\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chicago Women in Trades\n    \n\n   \n   \"It's very ironic that you can have a 'Brotherhood of Carpenters' which references brothers, but you can't have – because of DEI – a 'Sisters in the Brotherhood,'\" says Kina McAfee, a retired union carpenter who is now on staff at Chicago Women in Trades. \"I don't understand it. And it will impact our ability to get women into the trades in the future.\"   \n   The union did not respond to NPR's questions about the change.   \n   Awaiting a major ruling   Already, Chicago Women in Trades' lawsuit challenging Trump's anti-DEI executive orders has brought the nonprofit some protection.   In April, U.S. District Judge Matthew Kennelly in the Northern District of Illinois preemptively blocked the termination of one of the nonprofit's federal grants.   Kennelly also blocked the certification provision in Trump's executive order for Labor Department contractors and grantees nationwide, after finding that Chicago Women in Trades was likely to prove it would suffer irreparable harm should the provision stand.   The Trump administration has appealed that part of Kennelly's decision to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. In court briefs, the administration has argued that the provision merely requires grantees to verify that they won't violate existing federal anti-discrimination laws.   The court is expected to hold a hearing on the matter, though a date has not been set.   As Vellinga awaits a ruling, she says it's hard to imagine what the future will look like.   \"We feel like we're in limbo,\" she says.   Particularly vexing to Vellinga is that Chicago Women in Trades is fighting this battle at a time when women still make up less than 5% of the skilled trades workforce nationwide.   \"You cannot look at the workforce of the construction trades and say, 'Oh, they've taken DEI too far,'\" she says with a rueful laugh. \"You look at the workforce of the construction trades and you see we have a long way to go.\"\n",

    "body": "\n    TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Today, we're going to talk about FBI director Kash Patel with Marc Fisher, who profiles Patel on the current issue of The New Yorker. It's titled \"Kash Patel's Acts Of Service.\" It's subtitled, \"The F.B.I. Director Isn't Just Enforcing The President's Agenda At The Bureau - He's Seeking Retribution For Its Past Investigations Of Donald Trump.\" Fisher also writes about other controversies surrounding Patel, ranging from whether he's even qualified for the job to his conflicts of interest and how he's transforming the FBI's mission as he focuses on cracking down on undocumented immigrants. Journalist Marc Fisher was a longtime writer and editor at The Washington Post and co-author of the book \"Trump Revealed\" before becoming a New Yorker contributor. We recorded our interview yesterday morning before both the House and the Senate approved the release of the Epstein files. Start with an excerpt of what Patel had to say about the Epstein files when he testified before the House Judiciary Committee last September. Here he is being questioned by California Democrat Eric Swalwell.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ERIC SWALWELL: You said you don't know the number of times Trump's name appears in the files, so it could at least be 1,000 times, is that right?KASH PATEL: The number is a total misleading factor.SWALWELL: But the number would at least be a thousand times.PATEL: We have not released anyone's...SWALWELL: But it would at least be a thousand times.PATEL: ...File that has not been credible. And we have...SWALWELL: Director, could it at least be a thousand times?PATEL: ...Released every piece of legally permissible information.SWALWELL: OK, so...PATEL: You can characterize the numbers however you want it.SWALWELL: Reclaiming my time, Director. It sounds like if you don't know the number, it could at least be a thousand times, which leads me...PATEL: It's not. It's not.SWALWELL: Is it at least 500 times?PATEL: No.SWALWELL: Is it at least a hundred times?PATEL: No.SWALWELL: Then what's the number?PATEL: I don't know the number, but it's not that.SWALWELL: Do you think it might be your job to know the number?PATEL: My job is to provide for the safety and security of this country. My job is not to engage in political innuendo...SWALWELL: And that includes protecting section...PATEL: ...So you can go out to the sticks and get your 20-second hit in your fundraising article.SWALWELL: So reclaiming my time, Director...PATEL: Keep going reclaiming your time because...SWALWELL: Director...PATEL: ...The people of California are being...SWALWELL: If Trump...PATEL: ...Underserved by your representations.SWALWELL: The president is not implicated. Why not release everything that involves Trump?PATEL: We have released everything the president and anyone else's side that is credible and lawfully be able to be released. Your fixation on this matter and baseless accusations that I'm hiding child pedophiles...SWALWELL: There's also Mr. Massie's...PATEL: ...Is disgusting.SWALWELL: ...Interests.PATEL: Anyone that says that needs to look at the stats alone and go back to the state of California, who's receiving the biggest surge in FBI resources...SWALWELL: So, Director...PATEL: ...Through my redeployment because the cities of Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco need it.SWALWELL: Reclaiming my time, Director. Remembering your oath to tell the truth, did you ever tell Donald Trump his name is in the files?PATEL: I have never spoken to President Trump about the Epstein files.SWALWELL: Did you ever tell the attorney general that Donald Trump's name is in the Epstein files?PATEL: The attorney general and I have had numerous discussions about the entirety of the Epstein files and the reviews conducted by our teams.SWALWELL: Did you tell the attorney general that Donald Trump's name is in the Epstein files?PATEL: And we have released where President Trump's name is in the attorney's file.SWALWELL: It's a simple question. Did you tell the attorney general that the president's name is in the Epstein files?PATEL: During many conversations that the attorney general and I have had on the matter of Epstein, we have reviewed painstakingly...SWALWELL: The question is simple.PATEL: ...Who can...SWALWELL: Did you tellPATEL: ...The...SWALWELL: ...the attorney general that Donald Trump's name is in the Epstein files? Yes or no?PATEL: Why don't you try spelling it out, if you're going to mock me.SWALWELL: Yes or no, Director?PATEL: Use the alphabet.SWALWELL: Yes or no?PATEL: No. A, B, C, D, E, F. Don't want to do it.SWALWELL: Director, it sounds like you don't want to tell us. Did you tell the attorney general that Donald Trump's name was in the Epstein files?PATEL: Why don't you try serving your...SWALWELL: Director, did you tell...PATEL: ...Constituency by focusing on reducing...SWALWELL: ...The attorney general Donald Trump...PATEL: ...Violent crime in this country and the number of pedophilesSWALWELL: Director...PATEL: ...That are illegally...SWALWELL: Reclaiming my time, Director.PATEL: ...Harbored in your sanctuary cities in California.SWALWELL: Director, reclaiming my time...PATEL: I'll work with you on that.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Regular order, Mr. Chairman.PATEL: Do you want to work with us on that?JIM JORDAN: Time belongs to the gentleman from California.SWALWELL: Did you tell the attorney general that Donald Trump's name is in the Epstein files?PATEL: The question has been asked and answered.SWALWELL: You have not answered it, and we will take your evasiveness as a consciousness of guilt.GROSS: Mark Fisher, welcome to FRESH AIR. Your profile of Kash Patel was very informative and very interesting. What was your reaction when you first heard Swalwell questioning Kash Patel?MARC FISHER: Well, this came amid a whole bunch of such confrontations between Patel and both House and Senate members, and it was pretty wild. It was one of the classic ways in which Kash Patel, very much like Donald Trump, values the show above almost all else. And this is one of the reasons Patel is one of Trump's favorites. One of the reasons Patel is in this job is his ability to commandeer the moment, to put on a big show, to present himself as aggrieved and to present himself as an advocate for all those Americans who feel aggrieved.GROSS: Have you ever heard an FBI director dodge questions in such a confrontational way?FISHER: No, we've never seen any FBI director like Kash Patel before. We've never seen someone who looks like Kash Patel. The previous FBI directors were all sort of clean-cut, conservatively dressed, very proper...GROSS: White men.FISHER: White men, all of them. And Kash Patel is not any of those things. So we haven't seen this kind of approach before. We haven't seen this kind of antagonism before. And we haven't seen this lack of experience before, lack of familiarity with what the FBI does. There is in Kash Patel's background every reason to see why Donald Trump wanted him in that job and every reason to understand why so many people within the Bureau believe he is ill-suited for the position and that he's doing significant and enduring damage to the bureau.GROSS: So Benny Johnson, who's a far-right commentator and podcaster, was interviewing Kash Patel, and he asked him why the FBI was protecting the world's foremost predators by refusing to release the names on the list. And Patel said, simple, because of who's on that list. That sounds contradictory to what we just heard.FISHER: Right. So that conversation with Benny Johnson took place a couple of years ago at a point when Kash Patel was on the outside and was agitating for the administration, then the Biden administration, to release this purported client list that Jeffrey Epstein is supposed to have kept. Now-FBI Director Patel has a very different set of facts that he would like people to believe, and that is that there is no client list, never was. And Patel, who had certainly entertained the idea that there was some conspiracy behind Epstein's death before Patel came to the FBI, now that he is the director, now that he's had the opportunity to read the files, he has concluded that this was absolutely a suicide, that there's no evidence to the contrary. There was no hanky-panky. Donald Trump's presence in the Epstein files is minimal and benign.And so this almost complete reversal on Patel's part is bizarrely accompanied now by Kash Patel saying, how can you not believe me? He gets indignant when people question him about this, including members of Congress. And so Patel says, I am the guy who was pushing for all this stuff to be released when I was out of office. Now that I'm in office and I tell you there's nothing to be released, you need to believe me. And he seems, at least he acts, as if he's astonished that people don't take his word for it.GROSS: So let's briefly run through some of the things that Kash Patel has been in the news for in the past couple of weeks. So this week, he was in the news for giving his girlfriend, country music singer Alexis Wilkins, a security detail. Tell us briefly why that's unusual.FISHER: Well, none of the previous FBI directors had executive protection for their spouses, not for their wives and not for any girlfriends. And so it's very unusual for a director to request that kind of protection for someone who's not the director and who's not even the director's spouse. So why is this in the news? Because there are a lot of people within the FBI who find these kinds of requests, these kinds of irregularities, not just unseemly, but a waste of resources. So whether it's providing protection for his girlfriend or providing the director with jet service on the Bureau's jet to take him to various forms of entertainment - hockey games, casino jaunts to Las Vegas, visits to that girlfriend in Nashville, all of this - it comes at great expense to the taxpayer and is seen by a lot of people in the Bureau as a waste of resources.GROSS: Patel, in response, says he's been paying back the government for these trips.FISHER: Yes. He pays the government back, or so he says, at the commercial rate - the rate that you and I would pay to fly to Nashville, which is dramatically less than it costs the Bureau to stand up their GV jet and whisk the director wherever he wants to go for that weekend's entertainment.GROSS: Last week, Patel exempted his deputy FBI director, Dan Bongino, and two other new senior FBI officials who were just recently hired from passing polygraph tests. And keeping in mind that Dan Bongino has access to the top government secrets as deputy FBI director, how unusual is it for the deputy FBI director to be exempted from a polygraph test, which I think everybody in the FBI has to pass?FISHER: Yeah. The FBI has used polygraph tests for decades as just kind of a routine check on basic security questions that everybody has to pass to have access to the kind of secure information that the FBI traffics in. So obviously, since that's the case for special agents across the country, it's equally the case for the people running the FBI, such as the deputy director, Dan Bongino.So why was Bongino given this exemption? That's gone unstated by the FBI. The assumption among many current and former agents is that he flunked a polygraph or had reason to flunk a polygraph and, therefore, was allowed to skip it. This is something that does not sit well with others in the FBI because they want to be able to trust the people around them, particularly the people above them, but their colleagues as well. And one thing that gives them that sense of trust is they know everybody's passed the same security hurdles. And when the No. 2 in the agency gets a bye on that, that causes a lot of unhappiness in the ranks.GROSS: And while we're on the subject of Dan Bongino, Patel had said that he'd appoint someone with FBI experience to be his deputy director. But Dan Bongino had no experience and no experience at the FBI at all, and of course, neither did Patel when Trump appointed him. Bongino had been a Secret Service agent, podcaster and Fox News commentator.FISHER: Yes. That's exactly right. Bongino was somebody who was known to the president as somebody who did very well on Fox News, who appeared frequently on Fox News. And in the president's mind, the people running the FBI ought to be folks who are well known to the public and who make the president's case very avidly, very effectively. And Bongino is seen as a tough guy. Trump loves tough guys. He loves guys who seem like stand-up, aggressive advocates for the MAGA movement, and Bongino very much fit that bill.So looks the part. That's the No. 1 qualification, frequently, in Trump's mind. And Bongino fit that part in a way that perhaps Kash Patel didn't. Patel was, in the president's mind, the ultimate loyalist, someone he could absolutely trust. So this was a team that you could see the president really envisioning as complementary. And so the fact that neither of these guys had any experience in the FBI didn't seem to matter much.GROSS: Well, let's take a short break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Marc Fisher. He recently left The Washington Post, where he was a longtime writer and editor. He's also the author of the book \"Trump Revealed.\" And now he's a contributor to The New Yorker and has profiled Kash Patel in his new article, \"Kash Patel's Acts Of Service.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF LOUIS SCLAVIS' \"FETE FORAINE\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Marc Fisher, who profiles FBI Director Kash Patel in a new article in The New Yorker titled \"Kash Patel's Acts Of Service.\" And the subtitle is, the FBI director isn't just enforcing the president's agenda at the Bureau - he's seeking retribution for its past investigations of Donald Trump.So there are questions about how Patel got the position as head of the FBI and whether he had the necessary experience and credentials. What position had he held compared to what FBI directors typically have?FISHER: FBI directors in the past have generally had long careers in criminal justice. There have been judges. There have been prosecutors, people who served as U.S. attorneys, running some of the largest U.S. attorneys' offices in the country, whether that be in New York or elsewhere. They are people who have come up through the system and have long histories of public service.And so Kash Patel has some of that. Kash Patel indeed has been a public servant his entire life. He's never worked for anyone but the government, except for some small businesses that he started on his own between the two Trump administrations. Patel, however, never had that kind of long-standing experience with the FBI directly, with - he did serve in the Justice Department in the first Trump administration. He was on the national security side of the Justice Department, and he worked on some counterterrorism cases. That's something that the FBI also does. But he didn't have the experience that his predecessors had in running an agency or in the sort of street crime that the G-men of the FBI have always been known for in the public imagination.So there were a lot of people within the Bureau who were very concerned that he would be coming in without the knowledge base, without the years of experience that would tell him how the FBI works, how its relationship with the Justice Department operates. So there was concern about his relative inexperience. Beyond that, I think there was a lot of concern that he was coming in as essentially a tool of Donald Trump - essentially someone who was going to be sort of forwarding the president's political agenda rather than sort of fighting for the men and women of the FBI.GROSS: The subtitle of your piece about Patel in The New Yorker is, \"The F.B.I. Director Isn't Just Enforcing The President's Agenda At The Bureau - He's Seeking Retribution For Its Past Investigations Of Donald Trump.\" So in his memoir, in Patel's memoir, he had his list of, quote, government gangsters. Eric Swalwell, who we heard questioning Patel, was on that list. Who has he been seeking retribution against, and what for?FISHER: Almost from the first day that Kash Patel took over the FBI, he has had as one of his top or perhaps his very top agenda item the calling-out and the investigation of people who the president sees as his enemies - people who the president sees as having investigated Trump himself, the folks who were involved in prosecuting Trump for his taking classified documents down to Mar-a-Lago in Florida when he left after his first administration, the people who prosecuted him on all of the various other things that he was convicted of, financial misdeeds and so on.So there's a long list of Trump enemies who Trump has talked about during his out years, the four years of the Biden administration. And Kash Patel came into office with that list and with his own list - what he calls his list of government gangsters. He wrote a whole book laying out who those people were, and it was accompanied by a list of at least 60 people who he saw as Trump's enemies and therefore as Patel's enemies. And so he has methodically gone through that list, already begun the process of coming up with evidence and seeking indictments of people like the former FBI director, James Comey, like other top officials of the FBI who were involved in the Russiagate investigation. All of these investigations that characterized Trump's first term - these are now the people who are - have targets on their backs.And as Patel has now told several people at the FBI, he sees it as his job to go after the people who the president wants prosecuted. The president has not forgotten. That's the line that Patel has used over and over again to explain why he's going after some of these people. It's ironic, of course, because Patel has staked his entire directorship on the idea that everyone who came before him had weaponized the FBI, weaponized the Justice Department for their own political purposes. And yet now he stands accused of exactly the same infraction - of going after people, using the power of the FBI to go after political opponents.GROSS: So not only did Patel have former FBI Director Jim Comey indicted. He fired an agent for refusing to stage a perp walk for Comey.FISHER: Yes. That's right. So Patel has fired, by various accounts, dozens of agents for various infractions, most of which he doesn't detail in any sort of way. But the reporting that I did, as well as other news organizations have done, has brought out the fact that Patel has fired agents for things such as having a gay pride flag at their desk or, as you mentioned, refusing to stage the classic perp walk in which the purported criminal is paraded before the cameras, in this case being the former FBI director himself, Jim Comey.So there is - in the minds of many FBI agents, there's this view of Kash Patel as someone who is vindictive on behalf of Trump and vindictive in ways that seem at least on the surface to be superficially just cruelty for cruelty's sake, compounded by the fact that Patel has told people within the Bureau that he would not fire many of these agents if it were solely up to him - that he's getting direction from the White House, direction from the Justice Department and that he is firing a number of these agents on the president's say-so or to please the president, rather than because Patel himself believes that the agent has done anything wrong.GROSS: Well, let's take another short break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Marc Fisher. And he profiles FBI Director Kash Patel in a new article in The New Yorker that's titled \"Kash Patel's Acts Of Service,\" subtitled, the FBI director isn't just enforcing the president's agenda at the Bureau - he's seeking retribution for its past investigations of Donald Trump. We'll be right back after a short break. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF JESSICA WILLIAMS' \"KID STUFF\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Marc Fisher, who has a new profile of FBI Director Kash Patel in The New Yorker, where Fisher is a contributor. He recently left The Washington Post, where he was a longtime writer and editor. He's also the author of the book \"Trump Revealed,\" a biography of the president.You write in your profile of Kash Patel that he has promoted several conspiracy theories. I want to play a clip, and this is something that you quote in your profile. This is an excerpt of him as a guest on Joe Rogan's podcast on June 6 of this year. And this is Kash Patel describing a conspiracy theory relating to China and fentanyl.(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE JOE ROGAN EXPERIENCE\")PATEL: You don't hear of fentanyl deaths in China. You don't hear of fentanyl deaths in India. You don't really hear of fentanyl deaths in England, Australia, New Zealand - our Five Eyes partners - and Canada. The Chinese, in my opinion, the CCP, have used it as a directed approach because we are their adversary. And they don't like us, and we don't like what they're doing when it comes to fentanyl. And their long-term game is this. How do I - in my opinion - kneecap the United States of America, our largest adversary? Well, why don't we go and take out generations of young men and women who might grow up to serve in the United States military or become a cop or become a teacher? And that's what they're doing when you wipe out tens of thousands of Americans a year. It's a long-term plan for them.JOE ROGAN: Whoa. That is such a dark, dark thing.PATEL: It is, but we got - we're on it.GROSS: So that was Kash Patel on Joe Rogan's podcast on June 6 of this year. I hadn't heard that one before. Had you?FISHER: No. That was a new one on me. But he's got a bunch of them, and he's got a whole book of them in his book \"Government Gangsters.\" There came a moment in that very same interview between Rogan and Patel where Rogan was almost teasing Patel about the fact that he's prone to these conspiracy theories and that he sees the government and the press and politicians as part of this cabal that is out to undermine Trump and undermine the MAGA movement. And Rogan kind of poked him and said, we love conspiracies, don't we? They're exciting. And Patel kind of laughed and said, yeah. They're our thing.GROSS: Do you see any connection between this China conspiracy theory and Trump's threats to attack Venezuela and sending warships close to there? Do you see a connection?FISHER: There's a certain constancy to the way in which Trump and Patel think, the way in which they tell stories about their administration's actions. They both are given to dramatic tellings of somewhat fanciful notions about what our enemies are up to and what is motivating them, and they both jump off from some actual facts. Fentanyl is obviously a scourge. It's obviously an enormous problem. It comes in from Mexico, but its component parts are frequently manufactured in China, so there's a legitimate issue there. It's a legitimate crime-fighting imperative for the FBI. That's the fact part.And then we get into the fanciful. As we hear Patel spin out his notion of why this might be happening, it's very reminiscent of the way Donald Trump frequently portrays issues not just in Venezuela, but around the world, where he sees or is told about some situation, presents the germ of the facts and then extrapolates from there, exaggerates and throws in numbers that can't quite be verified and so on. It all boils down to the show. Both Trump and Patel, very similar personalities in certain important ways, one of which is that they think of every day in their job as the next act in a long-running show that needs new juice to zap them into the headlines for that day.GROSS: What are some of the other conspiracy theories that Patel has promoted?FISHER: So Kash Patel, as he's admitted, is given to conspiratorial notions. He sees conspiracies in fact patterns. And obviously, you want any crime fighter to look for patterns in the facts that they are assembling, but in Kash Patel's case, it often goes a bit beyond the available facts. So, for example, Patel has believed for many years now that he is a target of a media conspiracy to portray him in a dark light and to make up things about him. And so he has sued a series of news organizations, claiming that they have defamed him. He sued The New York Times. He sued CNN. He sued Politico. In every case, he got a big splash in the news, and in every case, he ended up withdrawing the suit or seeing it thrown out by a judge.In the case of the January 6 assault on the Capitol, Kash Patel has for a couple of years been presenting the theory that the FBI itself had recruited operatives of one sort or another who were in the crowd on January 6, and who were perhaps encouraging the rioters to be more aggressive in their attack on the Capitol. He's never presented the slightest evidence for this, and yet he continues to present this idea. Even as director of the FBI, he has said that there may have been such people and they may have very much egged on the crowd on January 6, sort of portraying the January 6 attack almost as an inside job.GROSS: So since Trump was president on January 6 - I mean, he was about to leave the White House, but he was president then. If it was an inside job in the sense that the FBI sent people into militias to urge them to be more aggressive and even violent, why isn't that a Trump administration problem? The FBI director at this time was somebody appointed by President Trump.FISHER: Yes. This - it's absolutely right. The January 6 attack took place at the very tail end of the first Trump administration. So if, as Patel theorizes, the FBI in 2020 and the first days of 2021 was using its own confidential sources and placing those sources within the militia groups that were plotting the January 6 attack, it's perfectly reasonable to ask, does that mean that the first Trump administration was in some regard responsible for the attack? This is an aspect of this conspiracy theory that Kash Patel somehow never gets around to talking about. He sees the FBI as kind of a rogue operation. And it - so it fits in with his overall theory of this deep state that is the real governing factor in the United States, and this deep state doing its own thing, seeding these sources into the January 6 attack groups without perhaps the knowledge of Trump and the Trump administration.And, you know, the FBI did have some contacts who were, from time to time, inside some of the militia groups. So were they there for the purpose of encouraging those groups to take this more violent approach on January 6? No evidence has been presented along those lines, and yet it's been years now that he's been pushing this theory and saying that once he got inside, he would reveal the evidence. Well, nothing's been revealed.GROSS: After Trump was indicted in 2023 for secretly storing classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, Patel said, when you're president and you leave, you can take whatever you want. And when you take it, whether it's classified or not, it's now not.FISHER: I believe that the president said it first, but Kash Patel quickly adopted this idea that everything that was at Mar-a-Lago was there legally simply because the president had taken it there. This is completely contrary to the law. In 1978, Congress passed the Presidential Records Act. And that prohibits former presidents from taking any official records - whether they were classified or not - from taking them with them when they left office.Well, Trump brought a lot of those things down to Mar-a-Lago. And Patel has said several times, when he worked in the White House in the first Trump administration, that he watched the president declassify documents so that he could take them with him to Florida. So since Patel had said this in various public settings, he was then summoned to testify by prosecutors, to testify before a grand jury about, OK, what did you see? Which documents were they, and what did the president do when he was declassifying them? Well, he gets to the grand jury. And all of a sudden, Patel is taking the Fifth Amendment, saying that he's not going to answer any questions because he has this right against self-incrimination. So the prosecutor said, well, OK. We'll get you immunity. So they went and got him immunity from the court, and Patel appeared a second time. And this time, he answered their questions.So flash-forward, and he's at his Senate confirmation hearing for becoming FBI director. And the senators say, OK. Tell us about this grand jury testimony where you talked about why and how the president made these documents OK to take to Mar-a-Lago. And again, Kash Patel said, no, can't do that, not allowed, because it was against the law. And as several senators noted, that is just false. You own your own words and you are allowed to divulge that testimony, which he did not do.GROSS: I think we need to take another break here, so let me reintroduce you. If you're just joining us, my guest is Marc Fisher, who profiles Kash Patel in the current issue of The New Yorker. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF JULIAN LAGE GROUP & JULIAN LAGE'S \"IOWA TAKEN\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday morning with Marc Fisher, who profiles FBI Director Kash Patel in the current issue of The New Yorker, where Fisher is a contributor. The article is titled \"Kash Patel's Acts Of Service.\"Patel has fired a whole lot of FBI agents. I don't know the number. And he reassigned a lot of the remaining agents to work on catching people who are in the U.S. illegally. So what are some of the FBI missions that have been canceled or understaffed as a result of the firings and the reassignments, or units that have been completely shut down?FISHER: It's really a thoroughgoing change that he's brought to the FBI. The FBI has about 13,000 agents, and about a quarter of them have been assigned to work on going out and catching undocumented immigrants. This has not generally been a major focus for the FBI. Hundreds more of agents have been sent on these missions, along with the National Guard, to do basic sort of crime patrols in cities like Washington, D.C., and Chicago. This is part of this emphasis on combating violent crime that President Trump began some months back.So what's not being done? Well, for example, Patel disbanded the public corruption unit in the Washington Field Office. This is the group that investigates wrongdoing by public officials, including - this is the office that investigated Trump and various other Republicans for trying to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. I was given one example after another by various agents in the FBI of cases, for example, of someone working on Chinese counterterrorism efforts in the United States. One such agent was pulled off a case to essentially do street patrol in the District of Columbia, doing DWI arrests. So it's a wholesale rejiggering of what agents are doing. It's resulting in a lot of people retiring early, retiring as soon as they're able to, and quite a number, as you said, who've been fired.GROSS: Also, Patel has lowered the standards for getting hired into the FBI. New agents no longer need a college degree, and now new agents have to take a polygraph test that includes loyalty to the FBI director.FISHER: Yeah. This is something that Patel has denied, but we've heard this from several agents who said they've been asked about their loyalty to Director Patel and to his own personal agenda. This is one of a number of ways in which a lot of FBI agents feel like the standards for being an agent have been lowered. For example, Patel has shortened the length of the FBI academy from 18 weeks to eight weeks of training, and he's no longer requiring all new agents to have a college degree. Many agents in the FBI have advanced degrees. And many of them have done specialized work in languages and so on to prepare themselves for the kind of international investigations that the bureau does so well. So it's really disappointing to a lot of the people who've devoted their lives to the bureau to see what they see as a watering down of those standards.GROSS: Patel has managed to cash in financially on being director of the FBI. Can you describe some of the ways he's cashed in?FISHER: Well, during his time between administrations - so between his time at the National Security Council and his time as head of the FBI - he spent those out years on a number of efforts to make a lot of money, and he did make a lot of money. Some of it was selling stuff very much in a Trump kind of model. He set up a website to sell his K$h-branded clothes that he had made, K and then dollar sign and then H. It was kind of a logo. He raised money for some of the January 6 defendants. He promoted dietary supplements that he claimed would undo the damage from the COVID-19 virus. He wrote three children's books called \"Plot Against The King.\" The main character of those children's books was a guy named Kash the wizard, who was the hero, and he led a battle on behalf of King Donald to find the bad guys who were scheming to elect Hillary Queenton on not Election Day, but Choosing Day. And so he was highly involved in all of these efforts to make some money and push Trump's agenda. The No. 1 thing that made Patel richer during those years was the work that he did through a consulting group that he set up where his clients included the government of the country of Qatar. That's a relationship that continues to this day, even as he's the FBI director.GROSS: Patel also had a charity called the Kash Foundation, which promised to make grants to those who have the courage to stand up to government wrongdoing. What did you learn about how the money raised was used?FISHER: Well, the Kash Foundation raised $1.3 million one year, and they spent something like $700,000 in expenses, but they only gave away $200,000. So out of the $1.3 million in revenue, only $200,000 went out in grants, mostly in cash assistance to about 50 people who are not named. So the idea here was to help people who were supposedly standing up against the deep state, against the government, but only $200,000 went to those folks. More than that went to one of Patel's own friends, a business partner of his who runs an advertising firm that was hired to do some promotion of the charity's operations. So all told, we're talking about millions of dollars that Patel gained during those out years between administrations from his various business ventures and his representation of a Chinese company and the government of Qatar, all of these entities that did a lot of business with the United States government.GROSS: And I should mention the Chinese company that he worked with is the company that owns, among other things, SHEIN, that fast fashion retailer. It's really popular in the U.S. because the prices are so cheap.FISHER: Sure. And SHEIN's subsidiary, which Patel worked for, had a board that included investors who were accused of having ties to the Chinese military and the Chinese Communist Party. So there have been some real questions about the ethics of that organization. And yet, Patel, when he took over as FBI director, said that he saw no need to divest his holdings in the Chinese companies.GROSS: So has he promised to recuse himself from any legal issues pertaining to companies that he has worked with and gotten paid by?FISHER: To the contrary, in the case of his work for Qatar, Patel, after he took over the FBI, got a waiver from the U.S. government that allows him to continue to handle matters related to the government of Qatar. You know, the FBI deals with all sorts of terrorism issues around the world. And so if anything comes up regarding Qatar, he will be allowed to continue to do that work even though he took in some undisclosed amount for consulting services to Qatar in the years before he became FBI director. We don't know the amount of money, exactly, that he got from Qatar because he never registered as a foreign agent, which the advocacy group Public Citizens says was a violation of federal rules.GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Marc Fisher, who profiles Kash Patel in the current issue of The New Yorker. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday morning with Marc Fisher, who profiles FBI director Kash Patel in the current issue of The New Yorker, where Fisher is a contributor. The article is titled \"Kash Patel's Acts Of Service.This is kind of like a strange fact. I'm not quite sure how to interpret it. One of the things that Patel proposed was to bring mixed martial arts fighters to help FBI agents with their conditioning. And he proposed this to the head of the UFC, the Ultimate Fighting Championship. You know, related to that is that Trump wants to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the United States by having a mixed martial arts fight on the White House lawn. So what does that say about Patel and the MMA? Is he a fan, or is this just out of loyalty to Trump, who's planning to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States by having an MMA fight?FISHER: I'm willing to give Kash Patel the benefit of the doubt and believe that he's a genuine fan of UFC. He seems to really enjoy it when he goes to the bouts. He went with Mel Gibson to that Vegas fight. And so Kash Patel's true sports love is ice hockey. He plays ice hockey. He is a huge fan. He's used a government jet to fly to an Islanders game up in New York. So when it comes to the UFC, I think we have a happy coincidence where Trump's love for that sport and Patel's dovetail nicely. They both have a strong desire to appeal to a core part of the MAGA constituency, the hyper-masculine world of MMA. And so there is a political aspect to this. But in general, I think they both also just love that scene.GROSS: What do FBI agents think of the idea of bringing in mixed martial arts fighters to help with FBI agents' conditioning?FISHER: I can't quite capture for you just how humiliated and upset many FBI agents are by what they see as a belittling of their serious training, their serious academic background. This is an agency where a lot of the FBI agents, while you might see them in TV dramas as essentially street cops in suits, this is an agency where many of them are lawyers, many of them have advanced degrees. These are people deeply schooled in the technology necessary to combat cybercrime today. And so when they see that their own director is talking about making them have training sessions with MMA fighters, they see this as belittling and insulting. There are some ways in which many FBI agents like the fact that Patel has steered the agency back toward what they see as basic crime fighting. But the overwhelming sentiment, I think, is that he has more than shaken up the bureau. He has gutted it.GROSS: Do you have any insights into the relationship between Trump and Patel now? You've said basically that Patel was hired not because of his experience as much as for his loyalty to Trump. So now that he's been in that position a while, has it affected the relationship between him and Trump and Trump's trust in Patel?FISHER: I think what I've heard from people inside the bureau is that the president has been frustrated by some of Patel's missteps, such as his premature announcement that the Bureau had found and captured the assassin of Charlie Kirk, a move that Patel then had to reverse just minutes later. So there is a sense in the White House that Patel has made too many mistakes. On the other hand, the president clearly values Patel's loyalty, clearly values the energy with which Patel is putting the president's agenda into motion. So there's no indication that he's in trouble right now, but there are some real doubts about his overall capacity.GROSS: Marc Fisher, thank you so much for talking with us.FISHER: My pleasure.GROSS: Marc Fisher's profile of Kash Patel is titled \"Kash Patel's Acts Of Service.\" It's published in the current issue of The Atlantic.

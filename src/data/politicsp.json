The directive, sent in an internal memo on Tuesday, is focused on applicants for H-1B visas for highly skilled workers, which are frequently used by tech companies, among other sectors. The memo was first reported by Reuters; NPR also obtained a copy.   \n   \"If you uncover evidence an applicant was responsible for, or complicit in, censorship or attempted censorship of protected expression in the United States, you should pursue a finding that the applicant is ineligible\" for a visa, the memo says. It refers to a policy announced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio in May restricting visas from being issued to \"foreign officials and persons who are complicit in censoring Americans.\"   The Trump administration has been highly critical of tech companies' efforts to police what people are allowed to post on their platforms and of the broader field of trust and safety, the tech industry's term for teams that focus on preventing abuse, fraud, illegal content, and other harmful behavior online.   \n   President Trump was banned from multiple social media platforms in the aftermath of his supporters' attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. While those bans have since been lifted, the president and members of his administration frequently cite that experience as evidence for their claims that tech companies unfairly target conservatives — even as many tech leaders have eased their policies in the face of that backlash.   \n   Tuesday's memo calls out H-1B visa applicants in particular \"as many work in or have worked in the tech sector, including in social media or financial services companies involved in the suppression of protected expression.\"   It directs consular officers to \"thoroughly explore\" the work histories of applicants, both new and returning, by reviewing their resumes, LinkedIn profiles, and appearances in media articles for activities including combatting misinformation, disinformation or false narratives, fact-checking, content moderation, compliance, and trust and safety.   \n   \"I'm alarmed that trust and safety work is being conflated with 'censorship',\" said Alice Goguen Hunsberger, who has worked in trust and safety at tech companies including OpenAI and Grindr.   \"Trust and safety is a broad practice which includes critical and life-saving work to protect children and stop CSAM [child sexual abuse material], as well as preventing fraud, scams, and sextortion. T&S workers are focused on making the internet a safer and better place, not censoring just for the sake of it,\" she said. \"Bad actors that target Americans come from all over the world and it's so important to have people who understand different languages and cultures on trust and safety teams — having global workers at tech companies in [trust and safety] absolutely keeps Americans safer.\"   \n   In a statement, a State Department spokesperson who declined to give their name said the department does not comment on \"allegedly leaked documents,\" but added: \"the Administration has made clear that it defends Americans' freedom of expression against foreigners who wish to censor them. We do not support aliens coming to the United States to work as censors muzzling Americans.\"   The statement continued: \"In the past, the President himself was the victim of this kind of abuse when social media companies locked his accounts. He does not want other Americans to suffer this way. Allowing foreigners to lead this type of censorship would both insult and injure the American people.\"   First Amendment experts criticized the memo's guidance as itself a potential violation of free speech rights.   \"People who study misinformation and work on content-moderation teams aren't engaged in 'censorship'— they're engaged in activities that the First Amendment was designed to protect. This policy is incoherent and unconstitutional,\" said Carrie DeCell, senior staff attorney and legislative advisor at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, in a statement.   Even as the administration has targeted those it claims are engaged in censoring Americans, it has also tightened its own scrutiny of visa applicants' online speech.   On Wednesday, the State Department announced it would require H-1B visa applicants and their dependents to set their social media profiles to \"public\" so they can be reviewed by U.S. officials.

    "body": "\n      Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is under pressure this week as a Navy admiral faces tough questions from lawmakers about the legality of striking boats allegedly carrying drugs in the Caribbean.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Members of Congress have now seen the video of U.S. strikes on a boat in the Caribbean. In a few moments, we'll hear from one of those lawmakers, Democrat Jim Himes.MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  But first, let's get to what we know. Democrats said they were disturbed by the second hit on a boat allegedly carrying drugs that killed two men after the boat was disabled. Republicans said the strike was justified because those two people might otherwise have continued on to their destination.INSKEEP: That is one of two big stories focused on the Pentagon, and NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman is covering both. Tom, good morning.TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Hey, Steve.INSKEEP: OK. So let's get this other story out of the way first. Inspector general report is now public about Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sharing information about an attack on the Signal texting app. What did you learn by reading the report?BOWMAN: Well, it said that two to four hours before the airstrikes by American F-18 pilots, Secretary Hegseth - he was getting a classified briefing from General Eric Carillo about the upcoming attacks on Houthi rebels. A lot of detail about the number of planes, the targets, the timing. And while Hegseth was getting this, he was sharing it on a Signal chat with other officials and on another chat with his wife, his brother and his lawyer. None of those three had security clearances, and all of this was secret information, the report said.INSKEEP: And let's just disclose, as we do, that NPR's CEO, Katherine Maher, also chairs the board of the Signal Foundation, which has a subsidiary that makes this app. But what has been the reaction to the inspector general?BOWMAN: Well, Secretary Hegseth's spokesman said the IG report exonerates him. That is not true. Nothing in the 76 pages says anything close to that. It does say that the Pentagon should be aware of proper procedures on the handling of classified information. It only states facts, Steve, not what should happen next.INSKEEP: All right. So let's now talk about this second strike on the boat in the Caribbean. What are lawmakers saying, and what are you learning now that they have seen this video and also heard from the commander involved?BOWMAN: Well, Admiral Mitch Bradley, the top commander overseeing Central and South America, appeared behind closed doors to explain what happened. Lawmakers said he defended that second missile strike, saying basically, the survivors of the initial strike were still kind of being active, trying to reach their comrades by radio, trying to corral drugs on the boat that was nearly destroyed. So Bradley, again, ordered this second missile strike to kill them and then two more to sink the boat. Secretary Hegseth said he was only there for the first missile strike on the boat and didn't see the others. He had meetings, he said. Now lawmakers are asking, you know, did the second missile strike result in an illegal killing, a war crime? Because, Steve, the Pentagon's Law of War Manual lays out what is an illegal order that no service member has to obey, and the manual has this example. Get this. Quote, \"for example, orders to fire upon the shipwrecked would be clearly illegal.\"INSKEEP: Tom, granting the differing interpretations, it does seem that everyone came out of the closed-door video session saying this boat was severely damaged at the least and even capsized. Any doubt about that?BOWMAN: I don't think there is. Senator Tom Cotton said these guys, the two survivors, are trying to flip over this capsized boat. Congressman Adam Smith and others said, listen, they were just shirtless guys, and not much of this boat was above water. So that's why it's important, I think, for the public to see this video. It should be released.INSKEEP: NPR's Tom Bowman. Thanks so much.BOWMAN: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Think Hollywood on the Potomac.   Every year, an astonishing number of A-listers come to Washington, D.C., to pay tribute to the honorees with performances and speeches. Think Beyoncé performing for Tina Turner, Audrey Hepburn rhapsodizing about Cary Grant, Rob Reiner praising Norman Lear, Aretha Franklin singing for Carol King, Sidney Poitier honoring Harry Belafonte or James Taylor and John Williams playing for Yo-Yo Ma.   \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n                    YouTube\n                \n        \n   This year's Kennedy Center honorees are Sylvester Stallone, George Strait, the rock band KISS, Gloria Gaynor and English actor and singer Michael Crawford.   As in years past, Sunday night's gala will be turned into a broadcast special that will air on CBS and Paramount+ on Dec. 23.   But, after months of upheaval at the Kennedy Center, the 48th Honors will be different. In February, President Trump abruptly ousted the Kennedy Center president, Deborah Rutter, and board chair David Rubenstein. Staff who worked on the ceremony and broadcast have also recently resigned.   \n   Here's what else has changed.   The selection process   In the past, honorees were chosen in a months-long, bipartisan undertaking by members of the Kennedy Center board with input from the general public and past honorees. Ultimately recipients were selected by executive members of the board and a couple of other senior staff members, with consultation from past honorees such as Julie Andrews, Lionel Richie and John Williams.   This year, President Trump said he was \"about 98%\" involved in the selection process. He also broke with tradition by personally announcing the names at a press conference at the Kennedy Center last August. Previously, the announcement was made on the center's website and in press releases.   \n   The host   \n   Previous hosts of the Kennedy Center Honors have included Walter Cronkite, Stephen Colbert, Gloria Estefan and Queen Latifah. Trump will host this year, a first for a U.S. president. At the August press conference, Trump said he's hosting because he was asked (he didn't say by whom), and said he was told \"You'll get much higher ratings.\" He continued, \"I used to host The Apprentice finales and we did rather well with that. So I think we're going to do very well because we have some great honorees.\"   Neither Trump nor first lady Melania Trump attended Honors events during his first term.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Actor and singer Queen Latifah, Jill Biden and former President Joe Biden attend the 46th Kennedy Center Honors in 2023.\n                \n                    Kent Nishimura/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kent Nishimura/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   One of the time-honored perks of being chosen is getting to sit with the president and first lady in the Box Tier of the Kennedy Center Opera House. It's unclear how Trump's hosting duties will affect his presence in the box.   \n   The iconic rainbow medallion is no more    In the past, Kennedy Center Honorees were each presented with a vibrant, multicolored satin ribbon adorned with a gold plate inscribed with the honoree's name at a State Department dinner the evening before the gala. Past honorees including Quincy Jones and Rita Moreno would attend subsequent galas proudly wearing their own medallions.   For the first time since 1978, the medallions will not be made by the same family of artists, as first reported by The Washington Post. The new design is by Tiffany & Co. and features a blue ribbon instead of the rainbow one, with rainbow stripes on the medallion itself.    Who will show?   In keeping with tradition, the Kennedy Center is not revealing the names of the performers who will pay tribute to this year's honorees. The surprise on honorees' faces when they see who has come to pay their respects has made for some fun, poignant TV moments.   \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n                    YouTube\n                \n        \n   The upheaval at the Kennedy Center has led to questions about who will be there this year. Historically, even when artists have disagreed with past administrations, they've in large part showed up. Some make it a point to come every year.   \n   This year could be different. Former honoree Herbie Hancock, who has attended many past Honors and consulted during the selection process, will not attend. His spokesperson told NPR he will be on a tour of Asia. Bonnie Raitt, one of last year's honorees who has also been a tribute performer, will not attend either.   Over the decades, the Kennedy Center forged strong relationships with leading performing artists from around the world. At the press conference in August, Trump boasted that he and the center's new leadership \"ended the woke political programming.\" Words that might push some artists away.\n",

Lawmakers in both chambers were shown video of the boat strike behind closed doors in briefings with Navy Admiral Frank M. Bradley, the Special Operations commander who oversaw the operation. After those briefings, leading Democrats expressed shock at what they saw, with the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee calling it \"one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service.\"   \n   \"You have two individuals in clear distress, without any means of locomotion, with a destroyed vessel, who were killed by the United States,\" said Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn. \"Under the D.O.D. manual for abiding by the laws of armed conflict, the specific example given of an impermissible action is attacking a shipwreck,\" he said. \"Any American who sees the video that I saw will see the United States military attacking shipwrecked sailors.\"   Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., told reporters the video showed \"two survivors trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for the United States, back over so they could stay in the fight.\" Cotton, who sits on the Armed Services Committee, described multiple strikes taking place \"minutes apart,\" but said he did not see \"anything disturbing about it.\" He called the strikes \"entirely lawful.\"   The briefings appeared to offer new specifics on an attack that has raised questions from lawmakers and military experts over whether the strikes broke U.S. law or if they constituted a war crime under the administration's assertion that the U.S. is at war with narco traffickers.   \n   When asked about it during a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, President Trump said he didn't know about the second strike.   \"I didn't know anything about people,\" Trump added, referring to the survivors. \"I wasn't involved in it.\"   Hegseth said he did not make the call for any subsequent boat strikes after authorizing the initial strike, but defended sinking the boat and Bradley's decision-making.   \"I watched that first strike live,\" Hegseth said. \"As you can imagine, the Department of War, we got a lot of things to do. So I moved on to my next meeting.\"   \n   During Thursday's briefings, Bradley told lawmakers that he was under no order to kill everyone on board, according to both Cotton and Himes.    \n   But lawmakers are still demanding additional transparency from the White House. After meeting with Bradley, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Jack Reed of Rhode Island, said he still had \"serious questions about the legality of all the strikes\" in the Caribbean.    \"If we don't insist upon strict observation of the rules of war, we can't expect our opponents to do it, and as a result we're jeopardizing the lives of young men and women in our armed services,\" he said in an interview with All Things Considered.     Reed is among several Democrats who have called on the administration to release the full video of the strike. Trump told reporters on Wednesday that he would be willing to release video from the strike, but added that he wasn't aware what footage was captured. He went on to broadly justify the administration's campaign, arguing that by stopping the flow of drugs into the U.S., it benefits the American people.   \"Every boat we knock out, we save 25,000 American lives,\" Trump said.   Watchdog report on Signalgate released   The focus on the boat strike was one of two high-profile operations under focus on Thursday. As Bradley was on Capitol Hill, a Pentagon watchdog released a report finding that Hegseth violated agency policy by using the Signal messaging app to discuss U.S. airstrikes in Yemen earlier this year.   The investigation's findings were the culmination of a months-long probe led by Pentagon Inspector General Steven Stebbins, following a request from the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. It was started after a journalist for The Atlantic reported in March that he had been added to a Signal group chat where a handful of top officials discussed plans to strike Houthi rebels in Yemen.   \n   The 84-page report concludes that Hegseth's decision to share highly sensitive military plans on the commercially available encrypted messaging app, using his personal cell phone, could have jeopardized the safety of American servicemembers and the mission.   \n   \"The Secretary sent nonpublic DoD information identifying the quantity and strike times of manned U.S. aircraft over hostile territory over an unapproved, unsecure network approximately 2 to 4 hours before the execution of those strikes,\" according to the report.   \"Using a personal cell phone to conduct official business and send nonpublic DoD information through Signal risks potential compromise of sensitive DoD information, which could cause harm to DoD personnel and mission objectives,\" it added.   \n   Hegseth declined to be interviewed for Stebbins' investigation and instead provided only a written statement where he argued that the information he shared in the Signal chat did not require classification.   In a statement issued ahead of the report's public release, Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said the findings showed Hegseth did nothing wrong.   \"The Inspector General review is a TOTAL exoneration of Secretary Hegseth and proves what we knew all along — no classified information was shared. This matter is resolved, and the case is closed,\" Parnell said.      NPR disclosure: Katherine Maher, the CEO of NPR, chairs the board of the Signal Foundation.

Circuit Court of Appeals said in a 2-to-1 ruling that President Trump acted lawfully in firing two members of independent agencies, despite federal laws that hold they can only be fired for cause, because they wield significant executive power.   The ruling comes as the Supreme Court prepares to hear arguments in a similar case on Monday.   The case decided by the appeals court was brought by Cathy Harris, a Democratic member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, and Gwynne Wilcox, a Democratic member of the National Labor Relations Board. Trump fired both within weeks of taking office but did not cite any permissible reason, such as neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.   \n   The MSPB hears federal employees' appeals of personnel actions taken by the government. The NLRB hears appeals of cases involving unfair labor practices and oversees union elections, among other duties. Both have multiple members appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, who serve staggered terms.   \n   Initially, lower courts ordered the two officials reinstated, citing a 1935 Supreme Court decision known as Humphrey's Executor. In that unanimous decision, the court held that while the president has the power to remove purely executive officers for any reason, that unlimited power does not extend to agencies whose duties \"are neither political nor executive, but predominantly quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative.\"   The Trump administration appealed, and in May, the Supreme Court weighed in with an emergency order allowing the firings of Harris and Wilcox to stand pending a merits hearing in their combined case.   \"The stay reflects our judgment that the Government is likely to show that both the NLRB and MSPB exercise considerable executive power,\" the Supreme Court majority wrote in the unsigned order.   On Friday, the D.C. Circuit fulfilled that prediction. In the majority opinion, U.S. Circuit Court Judge Gregory Katsas, a Trump appointee, cited the substantive rulemaking powers of the MSPB and the NLRB, as well the agencies' broad powers to order things like reinstatement and back pay.   \n   Katsas declined to address whether the president can still fire officers at agencies that are \"purely adjudicatory\" in nature, nor did he wade into the thorny question of whether members of the Federal Reserve should remain insulated from the president's reach.   The dissent came from U.S. Circuit Court Judge Florence Pan, a Biden appointee. She argued that the MSPB and the NLRB do not in fact wield substantial executive power, and she warned of the consequences of granting the president control over such bodies.   \"We may soon be living in a world in which every hiring decision and action by any government agency will be influenced by politics, with little regard for subject-matter expertise, the public good, and merit-based decision-making,\" she wrote.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Michel Martins talks with Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., about what he learned in a briefing from the Navy admiral who ordered the second strike on a boat near Venezuela.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut is on the line with us now. He is the ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and he was among the lawmakers who heard from the Navy admiral who gave the order for that second strike on a boat that was allegedly involved in drug smuggling. Congressman Himes, welcome back to MORNING EDITION.JIM HIMES: Good morning.MARTIN: So there have been a lot of different narratives about what happened on that boat and to that boat. In as much detail as you can share, what did you see in that video that was shown to you yesterday?HIMES: Yeah. I saw something far more disturbing than other videos of lethal strikes that I have reviewed over the years. You know, Americans will be aware that from time to time, in a context like the taking out of Soleimani years ago, this was very, very different. When the U.S. takes lethal strikes, usually you're talking about somebody who is clearly an avowed enemy of the United States, usually a terrorist, or in the case I cited, an Iranian military commander. You know, there's often weapons around, and these individuals are active and operational. So you start with the context, which is that killing unindicted criminals - 'cause these people are criminals, not terrorists. Terrorism - terrorist has a distinct meaning. Killing them without due process, without an arrest, that context is problematic. But what's really problematic and what was really hard to watch yesterday, the notion that they were going to right their boat and continue on their mission is simply nonsensical, and anyone who sees that video would know that.Without getting into too much detail, I would tell you that what you see in that video is the United States, for a lengthy period of time - so this is not a fog of war thing - for a lengthy period of time, observing two men with no weapons, with no radio. They've just had a massive munition go off over their head in such a way that their boat has been a conflagration. I mean, I doubt that anything survived that fire. And they are clinging to a little piece of wood. Now, this was a big boat. This was - I mean, it's 40 feet long or so. Almost all of it is underwater. So the notion that they could right it after they've had a munition go off over their head is absurd, as is the notion that they could right it, get into it, make it functional and continue on their mission. So what I saw and what I think, you know, any American would see if they didn't know the political context was two probably soon to be dead, not because of a missile, but because of drowning, shipwrecked sailors. And the United States took the decision to kill them, which, as you point out, in the Pentagon manual is the very definition of a war crime.MARTIN: So let me play you what Republican Senator Tom Cotton said yesterday after he was briefed.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TOM COTTON: The first strike, the second strike and the third and the fourth strike on September 2 were entirely lawful and needful, and they were exactly what we'd expect our military commanders to do.MARTIN: You both attended the same briefing. How do you explain such a fundamentally different interpretation?HIMES: Well, you know, sadly, the opinion about the strike yesterday seems to break precisely on partisan lines. And again, I'm not interested in persuading people along partisan lines. I'm very interested in this video being released because, again, you know, this is a - the visual is two men who are about to go under the waves, observed for a lengthy period of time, shipwrecked sailors killed by the United States. Again, not in the fog of war, not because they pointed an AK-47 at an American service member, but just because there was this absurd notion that clinging to a piece of wood, they were still capable of hostilities, which is the legal question. So, look, I - you know, Rick Crawford, my counterpart in the Republican Party, said something similar. The decisions and the interpretations are falling along partisan lines. The American people need to see this. They need to see it.MARTIN: And what would happen when they do? How do you think that will change the conversation we're having?HIMES: Well, the reason that's important - you know, I've said from the beginning that killing people who we have traditionally arrested and interdicted is both stupid because if you kill them, you can't interview them to find out who their bosses are, what the transshipment points are, what the routes are. But, you know, these are criminals. They are not terrorists. Terrorists have a political and a strategic objective. Narcotraffickers, as hideous as they are, are simply trying to sell a product to Americans. And so there's a distinction there.MARTIN: OK.HIMES: And Americans need to actually see the visual...MARTIN: OK.HIMES: ...Of what it is that we're doing here.MARTIN: Before we let you go, as briefly as you can, The Washington Post reported that the defense secretary gave a verbal order to kill everybody on the boat. Did Admiral Bradley speak to that? What did he say?HIMES: He did. I asked him very explicitly whether that order had been issued, and he said absolutely not.MARTIN: Do you believe him?HIMES: Admiral Bradley is - anyone who's ever worked with Admiral Bradley knows that - says that he is a man of great integrity...MARTIN: OK.HIMES: ...With a storied history.MARTIN: OK.HIMES: So given that, I don't have any reason not to.MARTIN: That's Representative Jim Himes. He's the top Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Congressman, thank you so much.HIMES: Thank you.MARTIN: And I do want to mention, we've invited a number of Republican colleagues of the congressman to come on the program.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Juana Summers talks with Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, after his meeting with Adm. Frank Bradley about the military strike off the coast of Venezuela.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  Democrat Jack Reed, ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, launched the bipartisan Senate investigation into the strike off the coast of Venezuela. Admiral Frank Bradley, who leads U.S. Special Operations Command, recently briefed leadership behind closed doors. Senator Reed, welcome back to the program.JACK REED: Thank you very much.SUMMERS: Thanks for being here. So after a separate briefing today, Democratic Congressman Jim Himes called video that he saw of this episode \"deeply, deeply troubling.\" I'm quoting here. Did your committee also see that video?REED: We did see the video, and it was disturbing. As I said last night in a speech on the floor of the Senate, I believe the administration should release the entire video, what we saw, and also release numerous other reports so that there can be a factual discussion of what happened. Did it follow the law? Was it necessary and effective? All those questions have to be answered. And as I said last evening, the best way to start is to get the information to the public.SUMMERS: Understanding that this briefing was classified, is there anything else you can tell us about what you learned from Admiral Bradley?REED: Not really because, again, we asked a series of questions. We were, I think, all of us, including my two colleagues in the House, Mike Rogers and Adam Smith and my chairman Roger Wicker, were all deeply engaged in questioning. We probed as much as we could. And so much of it turns on legal opinions and legal judgments together with, you know, the facts of the situation on the ground. It was, I think, the beginning, I hope, of a fruitful discussion. I don't think we've reached a conclusion yet.SUMMERS: What questions do you still have after hearing from Admiral Bradley?REED: Well, the question I have is, to what extent the secretary of defense influenced the operation and that influence contributed to the outcome. Again, Secretary Hegseth was not shy about proclaiming, after the fact, publicly, that we had destroyed a vessel containing cocaine and killing all personnel aboard the vessel. That should be probed, I think, to determine whether that was to - overrode any other conditions or legal requirements.SUMMERS: Did you get a sense from Admiral Bradley's testimony whether Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth did give that kill-them-all order? Did that come up?REED: Well, again, that's a detail I think would be inappropriate because of the nature of the hearing.SUMMERS: I mean, I used to cover defense committees on Capitol Hill, and I know that the Armed Services committees, they have a long history of bipartisanship. But that said, your Republican colleagues are facing a lot of pressure from President Trump in general. And specifically, he has been supportive of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in these actions. How confident are you, Senator, that your committee will be able to investigate thoroughly and that its conclusions will be taken seriously?REED: Well, I must commend Senator Wicker. We both asked for the hearing. We both have asked for all the materials that are still not being provided. We've tried to be collaborative, and we had. And he's, as you point out, under more pressure than most people in terms of raising these questions. And I think Chairman Rogers in the House and Adam Smith are both very committed, and they see their obligation to the country and also to the men and women of the armed services. I mean, one of the problems we have here is, if we don't insist upon strict observation of the rules of law, we can't expect our opponents to do it. And as a result, we're jeopardizing...SUMMERS: Right.REED: ...The lives of young men and women in our armed services. And that has to be foremost in our deliberations.SUMMERS: You have now heard from the admiral. You yourself graduated from West Point. You served as an Army Ranger. Where do you stand, taking stock of all of this? Was this strike a legal military operation?REED: Well, I have serious questions about the legality of all the strikes. The president has created a whole term of art (ph), a terrorist denominator organization, et cetera, and that has no legislative standing. He is using the military in what has been a traditional law enforcement operation. The Coast Guard, which is a law enforcement agency, has conducted interdiction in the Caribbean for years and years and years. That's the proper way to do it. This is a departure from what has been traditionally seen as the best way to interdict narcotics coming into the United States. And so I have serious serious questions about the overall legal validity of the operation and also individual operations, individual strikes.SUMMERS: And Senator, I do want to ask you quickly, Secretary Hegseth has also been under scrutiny for sharing sensitive military operation over the free messaging app Signal. And I'll note that NPR CEO Katherine Maher chairs the Signal Foundation Board. The Pentagon's inspector general concluded that the secretary violated Pentagon policies. Some of your Republican colleagues acknowledged that sharing classified information on this app was a problem. Will you call for Hegseth to be dismissed?REED: Well, I opposed his nomination, so I think I was a little bit ahead of my...SUMMERS: And I understand that, but he was confirmed. So what should happen now?REED: Well, these are very serious charges. I don't think they're being treated by the administration as serious as they are. One of the conclusions in the report was that he jeopardized the life and safety of American pilots going into combat action. That's something that no secretary of defense should do. So I think he has made a series of miscues that confirm my original judgment that he lacks the temperament, the experience and the character to be secretary of defense.SUMMERS: Senator Jack Reed, Democrat from Rhode Island and ranking member on the Armed Services Committee, thanks for your time.REED: Thank you very much.SUMMERS: I'll note that in response to the IG report on the use of Signal, the White House has said no classified information was leaked and operational security was not compromised. And Secretary Hegseth has denied a Washington Post report that said he gave orders to kill everybody on the vessel that the U.S. bombed in the Caribbean in early September.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

If you're not caught up, here's a quick rundown. On September 2, the U.S. military attacked a boat in the Caribbean it claims was carrying drugs. A second strike was ordered, killing two people who survived the first one. The officer who oversaw that strike is briefing lawmakers on Capitol Hill today. Now, President Trump and his team have repeatedly dismissed accusations of war crimes. It is clear they're aware of some kind of potential fallout, and they are working to contain it. For more on that, we turn to NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez. Hey there, Franco.FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: Hey, Mary Louise.KELLY: Hey. So Admiral Frank Bradley - this is the admiral who led the operation. He's the guy who's on the Hill today getting asked all kinds of questions about this. How does he fit into the picture?ORDOÑEZ: Well, Bradley is the admiral who was named first by the press secretary in a carefully worded statement, by the way, and then by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth as the one who specifically ordered that second strike that killed the survivors. And now he is the one, as you noted, the one facing scrutiny from lawmakers, and he's basically delivering just the latest version of how these strikes happened. And look, put aside questions about whether this is legal and whether this can be legally called a war at all. The administration has been putting out all kinds of different kinds of explanations about the strikes that have really just led to more confusion and legal uncertainty.KELLY: Right. I mean, we do know President Trump says he wasn't involved, wasn't aware. Pete Hegseth has said he was not in the room. What do we make of all of these shifts?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, I think it goes to the heart of what I expect and we all expect members of Congress are really drilling down on today because it has caused so much confusion. Now, I spoke last night with Leon Panetta, the former chief of staff to Bill Clinton and defense secretary for Barack Obama. And he told me that, in operations like this, the buck stops with the president and the defense secretary. But it is clear, in this case, he says, that neither wants to take responsibility.LEON PANETTA: So what they're doing is basically trying to play Whac-A-Mole with the different theories in the hope that people will accept what I think is a distorted series of excuses that doesn't address just exactly what happened.ORDOÑEZ: And Panetta says that when he was defense secretary, that they would have exhaustive meetings ahead of an operation like this to plan for any kind of contingency, including what to do if there are survivors.KELLY: All right. And whether something like that happened in this case is among the many things we don't know. Let me ask you, Franco, about consequences - how likely it is for either Secretary Hegseth or Admiral Bradley. How likely are they to face any kind of punishment, consequences, as more details come out?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. Trump was asked about that yesterday, and he didn't directly answer. But I think it does go back to the carefully written statement that the press secretary read earlier this week at a briefing that was kind of tacked on at the last minute, by the way. It was very choreographed. And I was speaking with Tevi Troy, who's a presidential historian and former White House aide to George W. Bush. He sees a clear effort to protect the president and the presidency.TEVI TROY: When a press secretary who usually speaks off the cuff reads a very carefully written statement, it usually suggests that the lawyers were involved.ORDOÑEZ: Now, Troy says Trump is likely to continue to support his Cabinet secretary until he doesn't. And he's not going to protect Hegseth - Trump, that is - if it is a detriment to himself.KELLY: NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez, thank you.ORDOÑEZ: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

The decision released Thursday boosts the GOP's chances of preserving its slim majority in the House of Representatives amid an unprecedented gerrymandering fight launched by President Trump, who has been pushing Texas and other GOP-led states to redraw their congressional districts to benefit Republicans.   The high court's unsigned order follows Texas' emergency request for the justices to pause a three-judge panel's ruling blocking the state's recently redrawn map.   \n   After holding a nine-day hearing in October, that panel found challengers of the new map are likely to prove in a trial that the map violates the Constitution by discriminating against voters based on race.   \n   In its majority opinion — authored by a Trump nominee — the panel cited a letter from the Department of Justice and multiple public statements by key Republican state lawmakers that suggested their map-drawer manipulated the racial demographics of voting districts to eliminate existing districts where Black and Latino voters together make up the majority. For the next year's midterms, the panel ordered Texas to keep using the congressional districts the state's GOP-controlled legislature drew in 2021.   But in Texas' filing to the Supreme Court, the state claimed the lawmakers were not motivated by race and were focused instead on drawing new districts that are more likely to elect Republicans.   What the Supreme Court said    In its Thursday decision to side with Texas, the Supreme Court said the panel \"failed to honor the presumption of legislative good faith by construing ambiguous direct and circumstantial evidence against the legislature.\"   The high court also found that, given the release of the panel's ruling in the middle of Texas' candidate filing period, the lower court had \"improperly inserted itself into an active primary campaign, causing much confusion and upsetting the delicate federal-state balance in elections.\"   \n   In a dissenting opinion, however, Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan criticized the court's majority for reversing the panel's decision after a \"perusal, over a holiday weekend, of a cold paper record.\"   The high court's decision \"ensures that many Texas citizens, for no good reason, will be placed in electoral districts because of their race,\" wrote Kagan, who was joined by the court's two other liberals, Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson. \"And that result, as this Court has pronounced year in and year out, is a violation of the Constitution.\"   \n   In November, after the panel blocked the new map, Justice Samuel Alito allowed Texas to temporarily reinstate it while the Supreme Court reviewed the state's emergency request.   Texas state Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, cheered the Supreme Court's ruling on Thursday, saying in a statement that the GOP-drawn map \"reflects the political climate of our state and is a massive win for Texas and every conservative who is tired of watching the left try to upend the political system with bogus lawsuits.\"   Democrats criticized the high court. In a statement, U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in a statement that the \"people of Texas don't want this map, but it was put in place at the behest of national Republicans who are desperate to cling to their majority in the House of Representatives by decimating minority voting opportunity.\"   Texas kicked off a redistricting fight   The mid-decade redistricting plan Texas Republicans passed in August sparked a counter response by Democratic leaders in California, where voters in a special election in November approved a new congressional map that could help Democrats gain five additional House seats. A court hearing for a legal challenge to that map is set for Dec. 15.   \n   The rest of the redistricting landscape remains unsettled as well. Lawsuits are challenging new gerrymanders in places like Missouri, where there is also a contested referendum effort. And other states, including Florida, Indiana and Virginia, may also pursue new districts prior to the midterms.   Last week, a federal court ruled to allow North Carolina's midterm election to be held under a recently redrawn map that could give Republicans an additional seat.   Another wave of congressional redistricting may be coming soon depending on what — and when — the Supreme Court decides in a voting rights case about Louisiana's congressional map. After the court held a rare rehearing for that case in October, some states are watching for a potential earlier-than-usual ruling that may allow Republican-led states to draw more GOP-friendly districts in time for the 2026 midterms.   \n   Edited by Benjamin Swasey\n",

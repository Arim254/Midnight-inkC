    "body": "\n      NPR's Scott Simon talks to Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., about the U.S. strikes on Iran.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  The U.S. has launched strikes on Iran's nuclear capabilities and its leadership in what President Trump calls, quote, \"massive and ongoing\" attack. Tehran is retaliating with missiles aimed at Israel, which joined the U.S. in the attacks and at U.S. bases in the region. Is this war? If so, will Congress have anything to say about that? We're joined now by Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia. Senator, thanks so much for being with us.TIM KAINE: Absolutely, Scott.SIMON: How much notice did you receive as a member of Congress about these strikes?KAINE: Zero. The evidence suggests that the secretary of state called the speaker of the House, and that was it. We did not receive notice. I'm a member of both the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committee, and no one from the administration has reached out.SIMON: Could you see where that would be a security concern?KAINE: No, especially since the Constitution says we're not supposed to be at war without a vote of Congress. The White House knew that I had a war powers resolution scheduled for vote by the Senate early next week. I assume they wanted to try to rush the initiation of an illegal war before Congress had a chance to vote on it.SIMON: A person briefed on the matter says that Israel's assessment is that the Iranian supreme leader was, quote, \"hit.\" Do you have any knowledge of that?KAINE: No, I don't. I do know that Israel decided that its - one of its roles in this was a concerted effort to carry out assassinations against major leaders. The U.S. has been down that path before to disastrous results. And my first reaction when I heard the news early this morning was, has the United States learned nothing from 25 years of unproductive wars in the Middle East? Have we paid no attention to the fact that it essentially cost us lives and treasure to no avail? And why would we put our sons and daughters back into risk for no legitimate reason?SIMON: You're calling for Congress to return to formally vote on war powers. Your resolution would block the use of U.S. forces in hostilities against Iran. Forgive me for being colloquial, but hasn't that horse already left the barn?KAINE: Well, the War Powers Resolution, which was passed by Congress in the early 1970s, allows Congress to direct the withdrawal of U.S. forces from hostilities. And it was designed to either be called up before the initiation of hostilities or after. It's a privileged motion, which means it's guaranteed a vote. It was scheduled to be voted on early next week, likely Tuesday or Wednesday. But given that the hostilities have started, I've called for Congress to return immediately to vote on the bipartisan resolution. I filed it together with Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul. There's a similar resolution in the House. This is important. Our lives are - the lives of our troops are at risk. We ought to come back to Washington right away and vote on this.SIMON: Of course, these attacks are coming after widespread popular demonstrations there against the government and a brutal crackdown, which took thousands of lives. Could this, in fact, be an opportune time for the U.S., for all kinds of interests to move against the regime in Tehran?KAINE: You can move against the regime with sanctions, and we have, but there's more we can do. There are other ways to move against the regime. But the question is, are those protests President Trump's desire to change a regime, to maybe seize oil assets, to counter a nuclear program, which he said was obliterated six months ago, are those worth risking the lives of our sons and daughters? I think you can be against the Iranian regime and all their misbehavior and impose tough consequences on them for that without risking the lives of American troops. Virginians feel that strongly, and we're one of the most pro-military states in the country. I know what my constituents are saying - enough with endless wars in the Middle East. I suspect voters in other parts of the country are saying the same thing - this is not worth risking the lives of American troops.SIMON: And do you believe that this is an operation that's headed for failure?KAINE: I don't know whether it's headed for failure, and I think it would be a long time to decide whether it's a failure or success. You know, we had initial success when we invaded Iraq, and yet now most look at that invasion as one of the most strategic blunders the United States has made since the war in Vietnam. We were greeted as, quote, \"liberators\" at the front. It ended up destabilizing the region, taking away a check against Iranian aggression, and allowing Iran to expand its power in the region. Who knows whether it's destined for success or failure, but this is nothing that we should commit Americans lives to.SIMON: Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia. Senator, thanks so much for being with us.KAINE: Absolutely.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The closed-door deposition ended after more than six hours of questioning from lawmakers who said he answered every question posed to him.   The deposition in the Clintons' hometown of Chappaqua, New York, marked the first time a former president has been compelled to testify to Congress. It came a day after Clinton's wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, sat with lawmakers for her own deposition.   \n   Bill Clinton has also not been accused of any wrongdoing, and Republican members of the House Oversight Committee did not immediately level any accusations against the Clintons as they departed Chappaqua. They planned to review the depositions but said their attention was mostly shifting to other individuals.   Lawmakers are grappling with what accountability in the United States looks like at a time when men around the world have been toppled from their high-powered posts for maintaining their connections with Epstein after he pleaded guilty in 2008 to state charges in Florida for soliciting prostitution from an underage girl.   \n   \"We have questions about anyone who spent time with Epstein post-conviction,\" said Republican Rep. James Comer, the chair of the House Oversight Committee. \"Once you knew Jeffrey Epstein was a sex offender, why did you continue a relationship?\"   Bill Clinton, in his opening statement, said that he had long stopped associating with Epstein by the time of his 2008 guilty plea. He also said it would be difficult to recall the specifics of events from more than 20 years ago, but expressed certainty that he had not witnessed signs of Epstein's abuse.   Republican Rep. John McGuire accused Bill Clinton of having \"selective memory\" during the questioning, but other GOP members departed acknowledging that he had handled the deposition with skill and candor. Comer called Bill Clinton \"charming\" during the questioning.   \n   \"Clinton was quite candid, perhaps more candid than his attorneys were comfortable,\" said Republican Rep. Nick Langworthy.   Republicans finally get a chance to question Bill Clinton   Republicans have wanted to question Bill Clinton about Epstein for years, especially as conspiracy theories arose following Epstein's 2019 suicide in a New York jail cell while he faced sex trafficking charges.   Those calls reached a fever pitch late last year when several photos of the former president surfaced in the Department of Justice's first release of case files on Epstein and Maxwell, a British socialite who was convicted of sex trafficking in December 2021 but maintains she's innocent. Bill Clinton was photographed on a plane seated alongside a woman, whose face is redacted, with his arm around her. Another photo showed Clinton and Maxwell in a pool with another person whose face was redacted.   Epstein also visited the White House several times during Clinton's presidency, and the pair later made several international trips together for their humanitarian work. Comer claimed the committee has collected evidence that Epstein visited the White House 17 times and that Bill Clinton flew on Epstein's airplane 27 times.   Democratic lawmakers said they also posed tough questions to Bill Clinton about his relationship with Epstein and Maxwell.   \"We are only here because he hid it from everyone so well for so long,\" Bill Clinton said in his opening statement. \"And by the time it came to light with his 2008 guilty plea, I had long stopped associating with him.\"   Bill Clinton also went after Comer for calling his wife before the committee, telling him that \"including her was simply not right.\"   Comer said the committee was working to quickly publish a transcript and video recording of both days of depositions.   Has a precedent been set?   Democrats, who have supported the push to get answers from Bill Clinton, are arguing that it sets a precedent that should also apply to President Donald Trump, a Republican who had his own relationship with Epstein.   \n   \"I think that President Trump needs to man up, get in front of this committee and answer the questions and stop calling this investigation a hoax,\" said Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the committee, on Friday.   Comer has pushed back on that idea, saying that Trump has answered questions on Epstein from the press. Republicans also said they have not come across any evidence that Trump did anything wrong in his relationship with Epstein.   Trump on Friday expressed remorse at Bill Clinton being forced to testify. \"I like Bill Clinton, and I don't like seeing him deposed,\" he told reporters as he departed the White House en route to Corpus Christi, Texas.   Democrats are also calling for the resignation of Trump's Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Lutnick was a longtime neighbor of Epstein in New York City but said on a podcast that he severed ties with Epstein following a 2005 tour of Epstein's home that disturbed Lutnick and his wife.   The public release of case files showed that Lutnick actually had two engagements with Epstein years later. He attended a 2011 event at Epstein's home, and in 2012 his family had lunch with Epstein on his private island.   \"He should be removed from office and, at a minimum, should come before the committee,\" Garcia said of Lutnick.   Republican Rep. Nancy Mace questioned Hillary Clinton about Lutnick's relationship to Epstein during the deposition on Thursday. On Friday morning, Mace joined in calling for the commerce secretary to come before the committee.   \"I believe we will have the votes to subpoena him,\" Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna said.\n",

    "body": "\n      Republicans and Democrats are embracing their own takes on populism to respond to shifting politics in the country.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Democrats and Republicans traded visions for America this week, both in the State of the Union address and on the campaign trail. Both parties are embracing the core message that America's institutions are failing. But who each party blames and who they say can fix it cannot be more different. This antiestablishment thinking, known as populism, is dominating politics in the country in this moment. NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro and NPR political reporter Elena Moore join us now to talk about why. Hey to both of you.DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hello.ELENA MOORE, BYLINE: Hey there.CHANG: Hey. OK. So let's just start with the pretty basic question here. Democrats and Republicans proposed very different ideological agendas. So how is it that both parties are embracing populism at this moment?MONTANARO: Well, Ailsa, I mean, anger is really at the center of American politics right now. I mean, people are pessimistic about the direction of the country. They have a negative outlook on the economy and their position in it. And they're down on the overall political system, like you mentioned.And populism is about pitchforks. You know, who they're aimed at, though, is pretty different. You know, for the right, it's about immigrants and liberal elites and blaming them for the economic problems of blue-collar workers and the, quote, \"forgotten man and woman,\" which, of course, Trump ran on in 2016 and, you know, he did that again in the State of the Union address this week, taking aim at Somali immigrants in Minnesota for fraud cases in the state, saying that, quote, \"Americans pay the price.\" For the left, it's really about corporations and billionaires and oligarchs, as they see it, with access to power and influence.CHANG: Yeah. Let's talk more about that, Elena. Explain more about how all of that translates to a message for Democrats.MOORE: Well, there's no singular populist message on the Democratic side, and part of that is because the party doesn't have a leader, and part of that is because the party is still trying to just figure out what their broader national message looks like after losing in 2024. But, you know, we do know that this is the party's focus right now. And we have seen different rising voices in the party champion economic populist messages and really tailor them to different communities in different ways. And I think one high-profile example is James Talarico. He's a Democrat running for Senate in Texas, and primary day for that race is next week, by the way. Here's how Talarico made his pitch to voters in a recent ad that ran during the Super Bowl.(SOUNDBITE OF AD)JAMES TALARICO: Billionaires don't just influence politicians - they own them. That's why I don't take corporate PAC money. It's why I fought to cap campaign contributions. In the Senate, I'll ban billionaires from making unlimited secret donations.MOORE: So Democrats are really trying to mainstreamify that type of populist message, and I mean, it doesn't get more mainstream than the Super Bowl.CHANG: I guess not. OK. Let's go back to Republicans. Domenico, what is the Republican version of this populist message?MONTANARO: You know, this all goes back to the Tea Party movement, which came in response to what it felt like was a liberal direction that they couldn't stomach, a feeling that taxes and spending were too high as major demographic change was happening and happened to be during the presidency of the first Black president. Some of that frankly had a degree of racism attached to it. You know, Trump tried to other former President Barack Obama, pushing the racist birther theory, the false idea that he wasn't born in the United States. All the while, the, quote-unquote, \"replacement theory,\" this idea that immigrants were going to change the values and the literal complexion of the country, something that started with white nationalists and white supremacists - that was taking hold within the Republican Party, and now there's the targeting of trans rights. And it's all related because the glue for the right-wing populism that we're seeing is culture and how their preferred culture is changing or being threatened.CHANG: Well, yeah, like, let me ask you, Elena, because former President Biden was elected on this vision of restoring America to the way politics has operated for decades. And you focus on young voters in your reporting. It feels like to me that young voters do not want to see things stay the same way they have been for decades, right?MOORE: Yeah. I mean, it's worth mentioning that by 2028, Gen Z and millennials are going to make up more than half of all eligible voters in this country, and young people are just increasingly distrustful of the political system. And there's reasons behind that. They've come of age during a time where government hasn't worked for them. Many struggle with student debt or feel like high prices bar them from things like buying a house or starting a family - these economic concerns that they feel Democrats promise to address and haven't. So when candidates are running on, like, an anti-status quo, affordability-focused message, I think it appeals to a lot of young people who feel, like, frankly, fed up with the politics of the past. And I think that's why you're seeing so many younger and just progressive candidates rejecting campaign dollars from corporations and special interest groups because I think they see it as part of that broader issue set.CHANG: But Domenico, I mean, we've talked often about how Democrats are not exactly unified on how to resolve issues in this country, even when they do agree on what the problems are. So how does this kind of message work for Democrats?MONTANARO: Yeah. It's a challenge for them. And one they're probably going to have to contend with more in 2028 because midterms are so much more about the party in power and a referendum on the president. But this is eventually going to be a real issue for Democrats to contend with. You know, the left often urgently demands results that aren't always easily achievable. And for a lot of Democratic operatives, this idea of not taking corporate money when the other side is happy to flood the system is like fighting with one hand tied behind their backs. You know, so all of this, you know, creates more antipathy, though, among the key voting groups within the Democratic Party, and it's why polls have shown the left down on the Democratic Party itself.CHANG: Well, how do they resolve challenges like that?MOORE: Well, we don't exactly know for sure how this is going to play out, but I think there just may not be one sole populist playbook for Democrats. There may be a shared broader message. I mean, take New York leaders like Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or Mayor Zohran Mamdani. These are people with roots in Democratic socialism, and they've become national figures talking about economic inequality and affordability. But then, you know, that same focus has had broad parallels throughout the party. I mean, look at Virginia governor Abigail Spanberger. She ran last year as more of a centrist, but, you know, she made economic concerns the key part of her platform.CHANG: That is NPR's Elena Moore and Domenico Montanaro. Thank you to both of you.MONTANARO: You're welcome.MOORE: Thanks, Ailsa.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Thom Tillis chose not to seek reelection following disagreements with President Trump.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Senator Thom Tillis is not running for reelection after several high-profile disagreements with President Trump. That leaves an open Senate seat in the purple state of North Carolina. Former two-term governor Roy Cooper is expected to coast to the Democratic nomination in Tuesday's primary elections. And on the Republican side, many primary voters are looking for who would best support the president in Washington. North Carolina Newsroom's Adam Wagner reports.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Whenever he's not working with the cases...THOMAS D EDWARDS: Uh-huh.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: ...He works as a fireman (ph).ADAM WAGNER, BYLINE: Thomas D. Edwards stops to hear everyone out as he heads in to cast his early vote. His polling place is at the Farm Credit Farmers Market in Wayne County, about an hour southeast of Raleigh. On his way out. Edwards does not say who he supports for the Senate, but he makes clear that Trump's backing factors into his thinking.EDWARDS: Remember, smart people do smart things. Stupid people do stupid things. And I don't look at Mr. Trump as being a stupid man.WAGNER: Many Republicans voting in this primary hold a similar view. They're looking for a candidate they know will support Trump, and Trump has made his choice clear. Last summer, he stepped into this race, endorsing then-Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley. In December, Whatley appeared with Trump in Rocky Mount.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MICHAEL WHATLEY: I am going to be a fighter every day for this great state. I am going to be a conservative champion for North Carolina, and I am going to be an ally to our great president.WAGNER: Along with Trump's endorsement, Whatley holds a major lead in fundraising in the campaign. Still, he has several primary challengers who are trying to make the case that they've shown they are actually more likely to back Trump. Those include Don Brown and Michele Morrow. Brown is a former U.S. Navy JAG officer who has defended people charged in connection with the January 6 riots, and Morrow is a former state superintendent candidate who has previously called for the execution of several prominent Democrats.Republican voters interviewed by the North Carolina Newsroom at some polling places during early voting showed a clear preference in the race. James Huffman braved frigid temperatures to vote in Alamance County this week, about an hour northwest of Raleigh. He voted for Whatley.JAMES HUFFMAN: I'm just looking for stability - conservative stability - and someone who is winnable.WAGNER: Michael Bitzer, the chair of Catawba College's political science department, says for Whatley's campaign, quote, \"winnable\" means showing allegiance to the president.MICHAEL BITZER: It starts with Trump and it ends with Trump. And I think the loyalty that a lot of Trump Republicans, MAGA Republicans, want from members of Congress to the president is where Whatley sees the clear indication of winning the primary.WAGNER: That alignment with Trump could give Whatley the boost he needs in the primary, but Trump's approval ratings have started to falter in North Carolina, and Bitzer warns that might work against Whatley in November. Meanwhile, Cooper's attention is already turning towards that general election.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ROY COOPER: I'm running for the U.S. Senate because I'm concerned about the cost that everyday families are feeling right now.WAGNER: North Carolina voters have sent Republicans to the U.S. Senate in every election since 2010. But Cooper is well known here. He's won six consecutive statewide elections. That means this Senate seat could be in play in November.

Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump's choice to be Secretary of Health and Human Services, appears before the Senate Finance Committee for his confirmation hearing, at the Capitol in Washington, Jan. 29, 2025\n                \n                    Ben curtis/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Ben curtis/AP\n    \n\n   \n   One of the world's leading medical journals has issued a scathing rebuke of Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to mark his first year leading the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.   The editorial — titled \"Robert F. Kennedy Jr: 1 year of failure\" — appears in the latest issue of the Lancet.   \n   A quote from the piece marks an otherwise blank front cover: \"The destruction that Kennedy has wrought in 1 year might take generations to repair, and there is little hope for US health and science while he remains at the helm.\"   The journal's editorial board catalogues many of the controversial actions taken under Kennedy's watch, including the dismissal of agency employees, \"revisions of guidelines and recommendations contradicting decades of established science,\" cuts to cutting-edge scientific research, the undermining of vaccine policy and promotion of \"junk science and fringe beliefs.\"   \n   The Lancet is one of the oldest peer-reviewed medical journals in circulation. It also boasts one of the highest impact factors, making it one of the most cited medical journals in the world.   An HHS spokesperson didn't immediately respond to NPR's request for comment on the new editorial. However, Secretary Kennedy has made no secret of his disdain for mainstream medical journals.   In a podcast appearance last year, Kennedy said government scientists were \"probably going to stop publishing\" in some of the most high-profile journals — including the Lancet — \"because they're all corrupt\" and beholden to the pharmaceutical industry.   He's even threatened legal action against journals.   Allies of Kennedy quickly came to his defense — among them National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya.   \n   \"Sec. Kennedy is fixing the mess they helped make,\" he wrote on X in response to the editorial.   Others, including critics of Kennedy, pointed out the Lancet is the same journal that once published the infamous — and discredited paper — by Andrew Wakefield claiming a link between vaccines and autism. More than a decade later, the journal retracted the paper.   The editorial comes just as the country has crossed a sobering milestone.   On Friday, the U.S. surpassed more than 1,000 measles cases in 2026 alone, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   \n   The escalating outbreaks across the country makes it likely the U.S. will soon lose its measles elimination status.   The Lancet editorial begins by citing Kennedy's pledge, when he took the job as secretary, to restore trust in public health and have \"honest engagement with everyone willing to work towards making the USA healthy again.\"   But Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins, says \"nobody should be surprised\" by the actions taken by Kennedy.   \n   \"You basically have the most prolific anti-vaccine advocate in the highest position of power in the federal government when it comes to health,\" he told NPR.\n",

Alvarez/FR596 AP\n    \n\n   \n   TEL AVIV, Israel — U.S. President Donald Trump said Friday he's \"not happy\" with the latest talks over Iran's nuclear program but indicated he would give negotiators more time to reach a deal to avert another war in the Middle East.   He spoke a day after U.S. envoys held another inconclusive round of indirect talks with Iran in Geneva. As American forces gather in the region, Trump has threatened military action if Iran does not agree to a far-reaching deal on its nuclear program, while Iran insists it has the right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes and denies seeking a nuclear weapon.   \n   \"I'm not happy with the fact that they're not willing to give us what we have to have. I'm not thrilled with that. We'll see what happens. We're talking later,\" Trump told reporters as he left the White House on Friday. \"We're not exactly happy with the way they're negotiating. They cannot have nuclear weapons.\"   Despite Trump's negative assessment, one of the mediators of the talks later Friday appeared to issue a public plea to let the negotiations continue. Oman's Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who has been mediating the talks, said on CBS's Face the Nation that he felt a deal was within reach if the process could play out.   \"If I was President Trump, my only advice is just to give those negotiators enough room, enough space to really close these remaining areas that we need to discuss and agree upon,\" he said.   Trump sounded more pessimistic, telling reporters as he visited Texas on Friday that Iranian negotiators \"don't want to quite go far enough. It's too bad.\"   He reiterated that he did not want to see Iran allowed to enrich any amount of uranium and said the oil-rich nation should not need to enrich uranium for an energy program.   \n   When asked by a reporter how close he was to deciding on whether to launch a military strike, he said, \"I'd rather not tell you.\"   Earlier in the day, he was asked at the White House about the risks of the U.S. getting involved in a drawn-out conflict if it strikes Iran.   \"I guess you could say there's always a risk,\" Trump replied. \"You know, when there's war, there's a risk of anything, both good and bad.\"   Rubio heads to Israel   U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio plans to make a quick trip to Israel early next week, the State Department said. The U.S. Embassy in Israel had earlier urged staff who want to leave to depart, joining other nations in encouraging people to leave the region and signaling that U.S. military action might be imminent.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                People gather at a lookout to look for the possible arrival of the US Navy's aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford in the Mediterranean Sea near the coast of Haifa, northern Israel, Friday, Feb. 27, 2026.\n                \n                    Leo Correa/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Leo Correa/AP\n    \n\n   \n   The announcement of Rubio's visit and Trump's latest remarks could indicate a longer timeline for any potential strike.   The State Department said Rubio would visit Israel on Monday and Tuesday to \"discuss a range of regional priorities, including Iran, Lebanon, and ongoing efforts to implement President Trump's 20-Point Peace Plan for Gaza.\" It offered no other details.   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long urged tougher U.S. action against Iran, and has warned that Israel will respond to any Iranian attack.   Before his trip, Rubio declared Iran to be a \"state sponsor of wrongful detention,\" and the State Department may invalidate U.S. passports for travel to Iran.   He said the move was due to the country's continued arrests and imprisonment of \"innocent Americans\" and citizens of other countries for use as political leverage. The move does not automatically carry any penalties, but Rubio said that if Iran doesn't stop, he could make it illegal to use a U.S. passport for travel to or from Iran. That restriction currently only applies to North Korea.   \n   A confidential report from the U.N. nuclear watchdog meanwhile confirmed that Iran has not offered inspectors access to sensitive nuclear sites since they were heavily bombed during the 12-day war launched by Israel last June. As a result, it said it could not confirm Iran's claims that it stopped uranium enrichment after the U.S. and Israeli strikes.   The report was circulated to member countries and seen by The Associated Press.   Those wishing to leave 'should do so TODAY'   The announcement of Rubio's visit came just hours after the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem implemented \"authorized departure\" status for nonessential personnel and family members, which means that eligible staffers can leave the country voluntarily at government expense.   In an email, U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee urged staff considering departure to do so quickly, advising them to focus on getting any flight out of Israel and to then make their way to Washington.   \"Those wishing to take AD should do so TODAY,\" Huckabee wrote, using an acronym for \"authorized departure.\"   \"While there may be outbound flights over the coming days, there may not be,\" he added. The email was recounted to the AP by someone involved with the U.S. mission who wasn't authorized to share details.   On a town-hall meeting Friday after the email was sent, Huckabee told staff that he was encouraging airlines to keep flying.   Vance meets with mediator   Iran and the United States on Thursday walked away from another round of nuclear negotiations in Geneva without a deal. Technical discussions are scheduled to take place in Vienna next week.   Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Thursday said \"what needs to happen has been clearly spelled out from our side,\" without offering specifics. Iran has long demanded relief from heavy international sanctions in return for taking steps to limit but not end its nuclear program.   \n   Before his interview on CBS News, al-Busaidi met Friday with U.S. Vice President JD Vance to discuss the negotiations.   \"I am grateful for their engagement and look forward to further and decisive progress in the coming days,\" al-Busaidi posted on X. \"Peace is within our reach.\"   In his interview after briefing Vance, al-Busaidi, said there had been significant breakthroughs in the talks, that Iran had expressed that it was willing to give up its enriched uranium, not accumulate more and allow for comprehensive outside inspections.   The White House, Vance's office and the Iranian mission to the U.N. did not immediately response to a request for comment.   Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, meanwhile met with Christopher Yeaw, a U.S. arms control official. Grossi posted on X that the two men had a \"timely exchange on current non-proliferation issues, including in Iran and other areas of common interest.\"   The U.N. chief urged Iran and the U.S. \"to focus on the diplomatic track.\"   \"We're seeing both positive messages coming out of the diplomatic tracks, which we're continuing to encourage,\" U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said, according to his spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric.   \"We're also seeing very worrying military movements throughout the region, which is extremely concerning as well.\"   Flights suspended as people are urged to leave   The U.S. has gathered a massive fleet of aircraft and warships in the Middle East, with one aircraft carrier already in place and another heading to the region. Iran says it will respond to any U.S. attack by targeting American forces in the region, potentially including those stationed in U.S. bases in allied Arab countries.   Airlines such as Netherlands-based KLM have already announced plans to suspend flights out of Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion International Airport, and other embassies have also made plans for authorized departures from Israel and neighboring countries.   \n   Britain's Foreign Office said that \"due to the security situation, U.K. staff have been temporarily withdrawn from Iran.\" It said the embassy was operating remotely.   In Israel, the U.K. said Friday it moved some diplomatic staff and their families from Tel Aviv to another, unspecified location in Israel \"as a precautionary measure.\" In an update to its travel advice, the Foreign Office advises against \"all but essential travel\" to Israel.   British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Thursday the U.K. was focused on \"supporting the political process\" between Washington and Tehran.   Germany's Foreign Ministry meanwhile advised urgently against travel to Israel.   Australia on Wednesday \"directed the departure of all dependents of Australian officials posted to Israel in response to the deteriorating security situation in the Middle East.\" China, India and several European countries with missions in Iran have advised citizens to avoid travel to the country.   China's Foreign Ministry also advised its citizens already in Iran to leave, according to a statement reported by Chinese state media.\n",

DURHAM, N.C. — Voters in North Carolina head to the polls Tuesday for one of this year's first statewide primaries.   Since President Trump's election in 2024, when Democratic primary voters have chosen the type of candidate they want to represent them in the second half of Trump's term, there have been a handful of upset victories.   \n   A similar contest is playing out between an incumbent and a challenger with more progressive views in North Carolina's fourth congressional district. Democratic voters in the Raleigh-Durham area district will choose between incumbent Rep. Valerie Foushee or Durham County Commissioner Nida Allam.   Foushee is seeking her third term, but Allam is backed by Vermont's independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and several other national groups who want to replace Foushee with a younger, more outspoken leader who's further to the left. Allam says Democrats need to take stronger positions opposing immigration enforcement and Israel's war in Gaza.   \n   The race has attracted spending from outside PACs and donors across the country seeking to shape the Democratic caucus in Congress. The March 3 primary comes weeks after a similar special election primary in New Jersey, where activist Analilia Mejia won an upset over former Rep. Tom Malinowski for an open seat.   \n   Both Mejia and Allam worked on Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaigns, and they have the support of the Sanders-aligned Justice Democrats group in their primaries. Sanders joined Allam recently at a rally in Durham.   \"Nida is a proven fighter with the courage to take on corporate power, to take on billionaires, to take on billionaire-funded Super PACs like crypto and AIPAC and all of these special interest groups who think they can buy American democracy,\" Sanders said at the event.   Like Mejia, Allam's campaign is benefitting from outside ad spending. But unlike Mejia, Allam is facing a two-term incumbent endorsed by dozens of Democratic elected officials, including Gov. Josh Stein.   An Allam victory could signal an even bigger shift in the Democratic primary electorate this year — a strong sign of discontent with the party's current leaders in Congress.   After attending the Sanders rally in Durham, Kyle Barber said Allam's campaign has gotten him energized about politics.   \n   \"It's been so long since I've been this excited to vote,\" he said. \"I have not been this excited to vote since 2020, and that was just because it was my first year I could vote. I am so tired of voting for the lesser of two evils.\"   But many Democrats don't have a problem with Foushee's record and are hesitant to switch leaders in Congress. \"I like Nida, personally,\" said Melissa McCullough. \"But Valerie Foushee has credibility amongst her peers, good committee assignments … and she brings home federal dollars. Now is not the time to send in someone who has to start from scratch.\"   \n   The fourth district tilts heavily to the left, so whoever wins the primary is virtually guaranteed a win in November.   Allam argues that Foushee has not been forceful enough in opposing the Trump administration's immigration enforcement actions in North Carolina, Minnesota and elsewhere. When ICE and Border Patrol agents came to the state in November, Allam was among the protesters who filmed and shouted at them.   Foushee says she's sponsored and supported legislation to hold ICE accountable for what she calls a \"profound abuse of power.\" Allam wants to abolish ICE entirely, while Foushee wants to defund the agency and push for major reforms to federal immigration enforcement.   Outside money seeks influence   Gaza is also a major issue in the race. Allam is North Carolina's first Muslim woman elected official, and she says Foushee has been too supportive of Israel. The congresswoman has taken trips to Israel funded by the bipartisan lobbying group AIPAC, and the pro-Israel group donated to her past campaigns. But last year Foushee said she won't be taking any of their contributions this time around.   Last August, Foushee co-sponsored the \"Block the Bombs Act\" that would ban the sale of offensive weapons to Israel.   \n   Meanwhile, a new PAC called \"American Priorities\" has put more than $500,000 into the race so far in support of Allam. American Priorities said in a news release that this is the first of a dozen or so primaries where it's getting involved, and one of its key issues is reducing military aid to Israel. Another Allam backer is Leaders We Deserve, a group led by gun control advocate David Hogg. It has spent more than $270,000 on pro-Allam advertising.   \n   The massive data centers needed to power AI have also become a controversy in the race, as it has across the country. Allam is calling for a national moratorium on building new ones. Foushee has said she thinks the decisions are best left to local leaders in communities where data centers are proposed.    A new group connected to the artificial intelligence company Anthropic is putting more than a million dollars behind Foushee. She co-chairs a committee on AI for House Democrats.   Endorsements could also play a role in the outcome. Dozens of North Carolina elected Democrats have lined up to endorse Foushee, including Gov. Josh Stein and former Gov. Roy Cooper, as well as the state's other Democrats in Congress and the leaders of the Democratic caucuses in the legislature.   Establishment figures like Cooper are likely looking ahead to the general election, when Republicans would likely try to tie Allam to Cooper's U.S. Senate campaign if she wins the primary.\n",

    "body": "\n      In an effort to stabilize child care in America, the Biden administration changed how child care subsidies are paid. The Trump administration says the change invited fraud and is preparing a reversal.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Across the country, many child care providers are barely staying afloat. As essential as they are, their industry operates on tiny profit margins. And now the Trump administration is rolling back policies aimed at providing stability. The rationale is the prevention of fraud. NPR's Andrea Hsu reports.ANDREA HSU, BYLINE: Michelle Wright runs two child care centers in Southwestern Illinois, just across the Mississippi River from St. Louis.MICHELLE WRIGHT: You OK?(SOUNDBITE OF COUGHING)HSU: This time of year, bad weather and illnesses can take a toll.WRIGHT: It's wintertime. It's Midwest.HSU: Attendance sometimes drops below 70%, which is a problem for Wright, and here's why. Ninety percent of the families she serves qualify for child care subsidies, which the state pays out based on attendance. So when a lot of kids are absent, she may not get paid what she was expecting. She has to scramble to figure out if she'll be able to pay her teachers.WRIGHT: That staff comes ready to work. Maybe spent gas, maybe took a Uber or a bus to get here. And then six kids are out, and I know the numbers are down. I have to send their staff home.HSU: It's a unique challenge for those like Wright, who want to serve low-income communities.WRIGHT: I chose the area because of the need.HSU: Things would be easier if she had opened her centers in more affluent areas. Families who pay for care themselves typically pay up front, and they're on the hook for the tuition, whether their children come in or not. Subsidy payments here in Illinois and many other states go out after the care has been provided and based on who shows up, allowing for some number of absences. Wright says, this is one reason there's not a lot of high-quality child care in low-income areas. It doesn't make business sense.WRIGHT: Most people won't take 90% subsidy.HSU: This issue came to a head during COVID, when many children were out for days. To keep day cares open, more states began paying based on who was enrolled, not who showed up. Turned out to be a game changer for many day cares, giving them predictability. Later, the Biden administration issued a rule mandating all states make this change and pay the subsidies upfront, like private-paying families do. Dozens of states got waivers, giving them more time to comply, but now the rule is getting scrapped altogether.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JIM O'NEILL: Hello, I'm HHS Deputy Secretary Jim O'Neill.HSU: This is a video posted by the Department of Health and Human Services in January. O'Neill, who has since left HHS, says requiring states to pay for care up front and based on enrollment created vulnerabilities.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)O'NEILL: Those policies weakened accountability and made fraud easier, not harder.HSU: This announcement came shortly after allegations of child care fraud erupted in Minnesota. Such fraud is rare, but it does happen. In the past, providers have been found guilty of claiming subsidies for children who weren't in their care. States have moved to safeguard their systems with more oversight, more unannounced visits by state inspectors. Still, child care advocates worry the Trump administration's focus on fraud could get in the way of progress.DENISE WIESE: Ready?UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Get it.WIESE: One, two, three.UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: [inaudible].HSU: At Lemay Child and Family Center in St. Louis County, Missouri, Denise Wiese, the center's executive director, has been looking forward to changes in how subsidies are paid. Last year, Missouri's Republican legislature approved making payments up front based on who's enrolled, not on who shows up. Beta testing has been underway, and...WIESE: We're hoping by mid-year, that will be throughout the state.HSU: But late last year, the state announced it needed more time to ensure the new system works correctly and to secure long-term funding because it will be more expensive. Whether the changes happen or not, Wiese is pushing for more investment, sustained investment in child care.WIESE: We have to take care of the children in our communities. They're the ones that are going to lead this country and lead the state 30 years from now.HSU: She says the country can't have a stable future without stable child care, Andrea Hsu, NPR News.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

Strikes have hit several Iranian cities in what President Trump calls major combat operations. This as more talks were planned over Iran's nuclear program next week in Vienna. NPR's Ron Elving joins us now. Ron, good to have you today.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.SIMON: Just a few days ago in his State of the Union address, President Trump said he would prefer diplomacy to military action. And we'd heard the last round of talks between the two countries may have been productive, more planned for Vienna next week. And yet today, the president's calling for the overthrow of the Iranian government. What's the figuring here?ELVING: Different rhetoric for different moments. Not surprising that Trump would tell Congress and 32 million TV viewers that he would prefer diplomacy. If he had told them what he was apparently planning, there would have been no other news from that speech. We did get a couple of indicators yesterday that perhaps the tone of the talks had improved. There was also a report that Iran's missile program was not so far along or as big a threat as once thought, and that program appears to be a major target of these strikes.SIMON: What kind of support does President Trump have for these strikes?ELVING: It's far from certain at this hour, but war with Iran was not high on the priority list for much of Trump's support base. He was elected promising more focus on matters closer to home. But there are always Iran hawks in Washington, people who think its behavior on the world stage - Iran's behavior - should not be tolerated - and also, people who see the regime's crimes against its own people, Iranians, as crying out for response. Recent street protests there have been met with extreme violence by the regime. Untold thousands have been killed, perhaps tens of thousands.SIMON: President Trump also brought up the 1979 U.S. hostage crisis when some Iranian revolutionaries took U.S. Embassy staff hostage for 444 days. For those who don't recall that history, that's an event that really shaped how almost every U.S. administration has viewed Iran, hasn't it?ELVING: Yes, indeed. And it made clear just how angry many Iranians had become with America, our relationship with their deposed dictator, the shah. This anger included Islamist fundamentalists, to be sure, but it was widespread in Iran. But speaking of those who don't recall, that's a clear majority of Americans. Scott, it happened almost 50 years ago, and the average age of an American today is 40. But of course, Trump remembers it well because he's soon to be 80.SIMON: And, Ron, how - politically, how pivotal might this moment be for the administration?ELVING: We will only know when we are looking back on it. Will it be successful? How will success be defined? Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu says the goal here is regime change. Will that be the goal for the U.S. as well? And what if it is not achieved?SIMON: And, Ron, for the moment, there seems to be no plans whatsoever for ground troops being committed to Iran. Is...ELVING: Yeah.SIMON: ...That your indication?ELVING: Yes. That is everything that we are hearing, both from the administration and from sources within the military. This is not to be another Iraq. That is repeated over and over, but almost nothing starts out to be a disaster. Usually, when we get into a situation overseas, it's with limited goals. And what happens after that determines just what those limits will actually be.SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving. Thanks so much for being with us today.ELVING: Thank you, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

The strikes, which began early Saturday, were launched without congressional authorization. Article 1 of the Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the power to declare war. Top Congressional Democrats and Republicans that make up a group known as the Gang of Eight — party leaders from both chambers, as well as the Intelligence committees' leadership — were notified by the White House shortly before the attack.   \n   Initial reaction to the overnight attack has not split cleanly on partisan lines, though most praise has come from Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.   \"Today, Iran is facing the severe consequences of its evil actions,\" Johnson wrote in a statement. \"President Trump and the Administration have made every effort to pursue peaceful and diplomatic solutions in response to the Iranian regime's sustained nuclear ambitions and development, terrorism, and the murder of Americans–and even their own people.\"   \n   Thune commended Trump for launching the strikes, saying Iran's nuclear ambitions, missile program and support for terror groups has posed \"a clear and unacceptable threat\" to U.S. interests in the region.   \"I am confident it will successfully carry out the very clearly stated goals of this operation,\" wrote Rep. Rick Crawford, R-Ark., the chair of the House Intelligence Committee. \"I would strongly advise the Iranian regime heed President Trump's warning.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A plume of smoke rises following a reported explosion in Tehran on Saturday after U.S. and Israel launched strikes on Iran.\n                \n                    Atta Kenare/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Atta Kenare/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Most Democrats and a handful of Republicans sharply criticized the operation.   \"The administration has not provided Congress and the American people with critical details about the scope and immediacy of the threat,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote in a statement. \"The administration must brief Congress, including an immediate all senators classified briefing and in public testimony, to answer these vital questions.\"   \n   \"By the president's own words, 'American heroes may be lost,\" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., wrote in a statement. \"That alone should have demanded the highest level of scrutiny, deliberation and accountability, yet the president moved forward without seeking congressional authorization.\"   \n   A spokesperson for Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he was notified last night before the strikes by Secretary of State Marco Rubio.   A U.S. official said Rubio outlined the situation on Tuesday in an hourlong briefing with the Gang of Eight.   Rubio called those eight members ahead of the strikes, connecting with seven of them. The Armed Services Committees were notified early this morning after the strikes began, according to the official.   \"Everything I have heard from the administration before and after these strikes on Iran confirms this is a war of choice with no strategic endgame,\" Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, wrote in a statement.   The push for a war powers vote    Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a frequent Trump critic who is deeply opposed to this kind of intervention, noted the strikes were \"acts of war unauthorized by Congress.\"   As Trump and top officials signaled the possibility of a military action against Iran, Massie and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., were already teeing up a vote in the House this week on a resolution to curb the president's ability to intervene without approval from Congress.   A similar bipartisan measure is also expected to come up for a vote in the Senate, sponsored by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Rep. Thomas Massie (left) and Rep. Ro Khanna, seen outside the Justice Department on Feb. 9, have been leading a push in the House for a war powers vote.\n                \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Kaine called on Congress to return immediately to vote on the resolutions, which are privileged, meaning they are guaranteed a vote.   \"The lives of our troops are at risk,\" Kaine told NPR's Weekend Edition on Saturday. \"We ought to come back to Washington right away to vote on this.\"   \n   More recently, the administration has been striking alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and in January, launched an operation in Venezuela to extradite its then-president, Nicolas Maduro.   A war powers resolution to pull back intervention in Venezuela earlier this year initially got enough Republican support to advance in the Senate, but enough ultimately changed their mind and the measure failed.   \n   Backers of these war powers resolutions say that even if they are not successful, it is important for accountability that members vote on the record. The votes can also influence the president and force the public to pay attention to the debate over separation of powers.   The planned votes on curbing military intervention in Iran were already going to be narrowly-decided, but the strikes could shift the calculus for some lawmakers now that action is not hypothetical.   And unlike in the case of Venezuela, where the administration was assuring lawmakers that action would be limited, Trump is warning that \"the lives of courageous American heroes may be lost, and we may have casualties. That often happens in war.\"   \n   The success of a war powers resolution is far from guaranteed.   In addition to robust Republican opposition to clipping Trump's authority, Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., is among the lawmakers backing the attack, writing in a statement that Trump \"has been willing to do what's right and necessary to produce real peace in the region.\"   Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., has said a resolution would: \"Restrict the flexibility needed to respond to real and evolving threats and risks, signaling weakness at a dangerous moment.\"   And in recent months, Congress has signaled a desire to reassert some authority in this space, only for the legislative branch to ultimately bend to the wishes of the executive.\n",

Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting Director Todd Lyons, Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Rodney Scott and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow are appearing before the panel. They also testified before the House Homeland Security Committee earlier this week.      Watch the hearing, set for 9 a.m. ET Thursday, live:   \n      Thursday's hearing was called for by the committee's chairman, Rand Paul, following the killing of 37-year-old Alex Pretti, who was shot multiple times by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis.   During a town hall this week, the Kentucky Republican previewed the hearing, noting that he wanted to focus on the use of force by federal agents.   \"I'm going to ask the head of ICE on Thursday, what is the appropriate use of force? Some of these are women being thrown to the ground where the woman probably is maybe saying something nasty, something bad, or protesting, but you shouldn't throw somebody to the ground for being obnoxious,\" he said, adding that he had concerns with the use of weapons. \"Something's got to be done better.\"   Last month, the Senate stripped funding for the Department of Homeland Security from a broader federal spending package. With the agency's baseline funding due to expire Friday at midnight, lawmakers are now considering potential changes to immigration enforcement at the behest of Democrats, who have refused to fund the agency without reforms.   \n   Several Democrats on the committee were quick to call for DHS's funding to be separated after two U.S. citizens, including Pretti, were killed in Minneapolis. They have laid out a list of demands that includes mandating the use of body cameras and judicial warrants, banning the use of masks and arrests in hospitals, schools and churches.   Republicans have shown scattered support for some proposals, such as body cameras. But the parties remain deeply divided around other potential reforms and negotiations have been faltering.   Democrats produced legislative text over the weekend encapsulating their key demands. The White House responded with a counteroffer that top Democrats have described as \"incomplete and insufficient.\"   Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has described the talks as making progress, though he has acknowledged that they are all but certain to not bear fruit before the Friday deadline, when funding runs out and members in both chambers are set to leave for a week-long recess.   But most Democrats, even a number of them who continued voting with Republicans last fall to end the government shutdown, say they will not support another short-term DHS funding measure even if it means a lapse in funding for the department.   \n   \"We are asking our colleagues and the White House to work with us,\" Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., told reporters on Tuesday. \"Unfortunately we're not seeing that.\"   If lawmakers don't reach a deal this week, another stopgap bill to fund DHS in the short term would be needed. A lapse in funding would affect agencies inside DHS, like the Transportation Security Administration and Federal Emergency Management Agency — potentially affecting air travel and disaster response.   During Tuesday's hearing, all three agency leaders hedged in response to questions about whether their operations would be affected if DHS shuts down on Friday. Edlow of USCIS reminded lawmakers that his agency is funded primarily by the fees people pay when they submit various forms and applications, so his employees would still get paid.   ICE and CBP both got a huge infusion of cash from Congress in Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill Act last summer — making ICE the highest-funded U.S. law enforcement agency. That funding could allow the agencies to continue working with pay as they did during the last shutdown in the fall.\n",

NPR observed two online focus groups on Tuesday night, with 14 voters from Arizona who supported Joe Biden in 2020 and then swung to Trump in 2024. Four voters identified themselves as Democrats, three as Republicans and seven as independents.   Twelve of the 14 participants said they felt Immigration and Customs Enforcement \"has gone too far\" in carrying out its operations. And nine participants said they know someone who has changed their daily life out of concern for a possible interaction with ICE. Some said ICE's presence in the border state had begun to directly affect them, as well.   \n   Reflecting on recent immigration enforcement in Minneapolis, where two U.S. citizens have been fatally shot by federal agents, various focus group participants described ICE actions as \"aggressive,\" \"out of control\" and said they worried the country was becoming a \"police state.\"   Rich Thau, who moderated the focus groups, said the economy remains a top concern for these swing voters, but immigration has become \"a more pressing and more urgent concern.\"   \"They want ICE to protect them, but they don't want ICE to be doing it the way they're doing it now,\" he said, \"which is way too present in their lives, way too present in their family and friends' lives.\"   The focus groups were part of the Swing Voter Project conducted by Thau's Engagious and market research firm Sago. NPR is a partner on the project.   \n   \"People shouldn't have to live like that\"   While focus groups don't provide statistically significant results like a poll does, the participants' reflections match survey data, as immigration has become a growing liability for Trump.   Esmerita S. — who identifies as a Democrat — said she was born and raised in the United States and is Hispanic. She said an ICE detention center was built close by, which has made her nervous to walk around. (Participants agreed to be part of the focus groups on condition that they be identified by their first names and last initials only.)   \n   \"I don't want to go to Starbucks just down the street from there because I'm like, 'What if they're there and I look like I'm Hispanic?' \" she said. \"That's scary. People shouldn't have to live like that.\"   Carolyn B. — also a Democrat — said ICE agents were recently in her neighborhood intimidating older residents.   \"They were going door to door knocking, asking the people — and I live in a 55, an older community — and they were trying to find Asian people so that they could deport them,\" she said. \"The show of force and power. And they don't follow any rules and they do whatever they want. It's just too much.\"   Stephanie O., an independent voter originally from Nigeria, said she's observed members of her community wrongfully detained, and it's made her worry about ending up in the same situation.   \"And so it's like you have to almost carry your passports just in case I look like someone who is here illegally,\" she said.   \n   While many of the focus group participants said overall they support Trump's efforts to decrease illegal immigration in the country, they have serious worries about how that work is being done.   \"It just escalates a situation where if [federal agents] came in in proper attire and acted properly, I think a lot of people are tired of the immigration problem and would be OK with it,\" said Nancy P., an independent voter. \"It's just the whole way they're doing it.\"   Support for ICE — but with reforms   The voters expressed support for a range of proposed immigration enforcement reforms currently before Congress. Many of these reforms are backed primarily by Democrats.   Requiring independent investigations after incidents take place and requiring that agents wear body cameras had unanimous support among focus group participants. Prohibiting the use of face coverings was among the least popular proposals.   \n   No one supported abolishing ICE altogether.   \n   \"You can't have a country without borders, and someone needs to enforce that,\" said Scott G., a self-described independent.   Thau said the lesson Republicans should draw from these conversations is that they need to \"rein in\" ICE. However, Democrats, he said, should be wary of embracing calls to eliminate the agency altogether — a stance the party has not embraced.   Economic anxiety, and other takeaways   Most voters said they have more anxiety about the economy now, as compared with a year ago. While several people mentioned Trump's tariffs as worsening the cost of living and layoffs across different sectors, others were reluctant to blame the president for the economy.   Most voters said they disapprove of Trump's job performance.   Democrats, though, weren't popular, with respondents using words like \"disjointed\" and \"disappointing\" to describe the party.\n",

    "body": "\n      Attorney General Pam Bondi testified on Capitol Hill Wednesday before House lawmakers in a frequently combative hearing.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Attorney General Pam Bondi testified on Capitol Hill today before members of the House. The hearing often turned combative as Democrats pressed Bondi on several issues, including the Jeffrey Epstein files and the Justice Department's targeting of President Trump's perceived enemies. NPR justice correspondent Ryan Lucas was watching the whole thing and joins us now. Hi, Ryan.RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Hi there.CHANG: OK, can we first talk about the tone of this hearing? What did you make of the tone?LUCAS: Well, look, I have watched a lot of congressional hearings. This one was really something else.CHANG: Yeah.LUCAS: It was almost like two different hearings rolled into one. And by that I mean, Bondi responded very differently, with a few exceptions, to questions from Republicans compared to how she responded to Democrats. With Republicans, she was friendly. She addressed the actual question. With Democrats, she was more often than not combative. She tried to change the subject, or she attacked the lawmaker directly. Democrats grew very frustrated at times. Here's one exchange between Bondi and the panel's top Democrat, Maryland's Jamie Raskin.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JAMIE RASKIN: You can let her filibuster all day long, but not on our watch, not on our time. No way. And I told you about that, Attorney General, before you started.PAM BONDI: You don't tell me anything, you washed up loser lawyer.RASKIN: Yeah, oh, I did tell you because we saw what you did in the Senate.BONDI: Not even a lawyer.CHANG: Wow.LUCAS: For the record, Raskin was a constitutional law professor. Georgia Democrat Hank Johnson described Bondi's testimony as a sort of Jekyll and Hyde act. He said she was nice to Republicans and then turned into Hyde on Democrats. Bondi did go after one Republican, though. That was Kentucky's Thomas Massie. And he's the Republican who helped spearhead the effort to get the Epstein files released.CHANG: Exactly. OK, so the Epstein files, one of the main topics during the hearing. Now, we know the Justice Department released more than 3.5 million records from investigations into Epstein. What more did lawmakers want to know from that document dump?LUCAS: Well, look, this has been a political weakness for the Trump administration, and so Democrats certainly were eager to focus on it today. Several times, Democrats, in fact, noted that there was a group of women in the hearing room who were victims of Epstein. At one point - several points, actually - they were even asked to stand up. But Democrats criticized the department for failing to produce all of the files by the deadline required by law.They also criticized the numerous problems that have been found with the redactions that the Justice Department made to the files. That includes redacting the names of Epstein's suspected coconspirators, and in some instances, not redacting the names or photos of victims. Here's how Raskin summed things up.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RASKIN: You acted with some mixture of staggering incompetence, cold indifference and jaded cruelty towards more than 1,000 victims raped, abused and trafficked. This performance screams cover-up.CHANG: And how did Bondi respond to questions about DOJ's handling of the files?LUCAS: Well, more often than not, she went on the attack. Here, for example, is how she responded to Thomas Massie when he pressed her about the redactions.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BONDI: This guy has Trump derangement syndrome. He needs to - you're a failed politician.LUCAS: That's a Republican who was asking those questions. On several other occasions, Bondi accused lawmakers of theatrics, or she tried to change the subject. At one point, though, she did try to defend the department's handling of the files. She said the department worked hard to do the proper redactions, and she said they've taken action to address problems with those potential problems when they were brought to the department's attention.CHANG: OK, switching gears a little bit to another topic that has been a big deal during Bondi's tenure as attorney general. And that is the Justice Department's targeting of Trump's political opponents. How did that come up in the hearing today?LUCAS: Right. Well, Bondi said that ending the purported weaponization of the department was a major accomplishment of hers. Republicans agreed. Democrats, unsurprisingly, did not. And they pointed to a long list of the president's perceived enemies who have been investigated or prosecuted by the Justice Department. That includes former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and six Democratic lawmakers, who were part of a video urging U.S. military members not to follow unlawful orders.Several of these cases have faced challenges. The prosecutions against Comey and James were tossed by a court. And a grand jury just yesterday refused to indict the Democratic lawmakers in connection with the unlawful orders video.CHANG: That is NPR's Ryan Lucas.

    "body": "\n      The secretary of Veterans Affairs testified before a house committee today for just the second time during the Trump administration, to explain a national plan to drastically streamline VA bureaucracy.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  The secretary of Veterans Affairs appeared before a House committee today to explain a national reorganization plan to streamline its bureaucracy. This is a significant issue, considering the VA is the second largest in the federal government, after the Pentagon, in terms of scale. Lawmakers had questions, and so did NPR's Quil Lawrence, who covers veterans and the VA and is on the line now. Hey, Quil.QUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE: Hello.DETROW: What is the goal of this reorganization?LAWRENCE: Well, the VA is the largest health care network in the U.S., and the stated goal is to make the VA more - sort of more uniform across the board and have fewer big bosses. They want to cut the regional bosses that divide up the country from 18 down to five. But there's a lack of trust here, and Democrats say a lack of transparency. They see VA pushing toward spending more money or - on paying for private care outside the VA system while neglecting these chronic medical staff shortages at VA. And it got heated, like when California Democrat Mark Takano asked if this was all just a push to gut the VA workforce. He and VA Secretary Doug Collins had this exchange.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DOUG COLLINS: When I came before this committee last year, we were discussing an overall reduction in force across the government as a whole. At that point, as I told you in this committee, that we were - that our target would have been 83,000.MARK TAKANO: So...COLLINS: We ended up with about 30 - you either want an answer, or you don't.TAKANO: Is that a yes or a no?COLLINS: You either want an answer - I don't know the answer (ph).TAKANO: It's a yes or no question.COLLINS: I don't give yes-noes, and you know that.LAWRENCE: So as you can hear, it got kind of spicy. But the baseline here is that the VA's proposing maybe the most significant reorganization in at least 30 years and being kind of tight-lipped about what exactly they're going to do.DETROW: When we talked to you about this in January, you mentioned the VA-mandated reports that had not been released, including about prevention of veterans' suicide. Has that report now been released?LAWRENCE: Yes. It was months late - came out last week. Essentially, there has been no change in the veterans' suicide rate, really. It's still around 17 per day, which is tragic. But the VA is doing a pretty good job compared with the civilian sort of improvement of prevention of suicide rate. But this report, it was just - the first volume was just six pages of text, and last year's report was 38 pages, with graphs and charts and much more accessible information. I mean, some of the things that were missing, for example, following a Trump administration policy of not really discussing diversity, is there was less info about what populations are at higher risk, like by race and age, gender, sexuality. Experts say that you want to know - if you want to try and prevent suicide, you need to know which groups are most at risk. And they need that information.DETROW: And another report that you've been trying to keep tabs on is one about homelessness among veterans. Any information about that?LAWRENCE: No, and that's actually officially put out by HUD, but the VA has a hand, and they usually have it by November. It's not out yet. And there's been a real lack of information around the Trump administration's signature effort on this - an executive order that they were going to create a 6,000-bed facility in West LA on the VA campus out there. Initially, that made veterans' advocates in LA very happy. They've got the most homeless vets in the country out there. But there really hasn't been much information at all since then - no funding requests. And vets' advocates are worried. They say when they're not consulted, things don't always work out so well.I've covered six VA secretaries over five administrations now, and I think I can say this is the least access to the press and to Congress and veterans' groups. Half of the hearing today was just Democratic Congress members asking on camera for details that they said they'd requested in writing sometime last year.DETROW: That is NPR's Quil Lawrence. Thank you so much.LAWRENCE: Thank you.DETROW: And if you or someone you know may be considering suicide or is in crisis, call or text 988 to reach out to the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. Press one if you're a veteran.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

It would also require a valid photo identification before voters can cast ballots, which some states already demand. It was approved on a mostly party-line vote, 218-213.   Republicans said the legislation is needed to prevent voter fraud, but Democrats warn it will disenfranchise millions of Americans by making it harder to vote. Federal law already requires that voters in national elections be U.S. citizens, but there's no requirement to provide documentary proof. Experts said voter fraud is extremely rare, and very few noncitizens ever slip through the cracks. Fewer than one in 10 Americans don't have paperwork proving they are citizens.   \n   \"Some of my colleagues will call this voter suppression or Jim Crow 2.0,\" said Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis., presenting the package at a committee hearing.   But he said \"those allegations are false,\" and he argued the bill is needed to enforce existing laws, particularly those that bar immigrants who are not citizens from voting. \"The current law is not strong enough,\" he said.   Election turmoil shadows the vote   The GOP's sudden push to change voting rules at the start of the midterm election season is raising red flags, particularly because President Donald Trump has suggested he wants to nationalize U.S. elections, which, under the Constitution, are designed to be run by individual states.   The Trump administration recently seized ballots in Georgia from the 2020 election, which the president insists he won despite his defeat to Democrat Joe Biden. The Department of Justice is demanding voter rolls from states, including Michigan, where a federal judge this week dismissed the department's lawsuit seeking the voter files. Secretaries of state have raised concerns that voters' personal data may be shared with Homeland Security to verify citizenship and could result in people being unlawfully purged from the rolls.   \"Let me be clear what this is about: It's about Republicans trying to rig the next election,\" said Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, during a hearing ahead of the floor vote. \"Republicans are pushing the Save America Act because they want fewer Americans to vote. It's that simple.\"   \n   The legislation is actually a do-over of a similar bill the House approved last year, which also sought to clamp down on fraudulent voting, particularly among noncitizens. It won the support of four House Democrats, but stalled in the Republican-led Senate. Only one Democrat, Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, voted for the revised bill.   This version toughens some of the requirements further, while creating a process for those whose names may have changed, particularly during marriage, to provide the paperwork necessary and further attest to their identity.   It also requires states to share their voter information with the Department of Homeland Security, as a way to verify the citizenship of the names on the voter rolls. That has drawn pushback from elections officials as potentially intrusive on people's privacy.   \n   Warnings from state election officials   The new rules in the bill would take effect immediately, if the bill is passed by both chambers of Congress and signed into law.   But with primary elections getting underway next month, critics said the sudden shift would be difficult for state election officials to implement and potentially confuse voters.   Voting experts have warned that more than 20 million U.S. citizens of voting age do not have proof of their citizenship readily available. Almost half of Americans do not have a U.S. passport.   \"Election Day is fast approaching,\" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. \"Imposing new federal requirements now, when states are deep into their preparations, would negatively impact election integrity by forcing election officials to scramble to adhere to new policies likely without the necessary resources.\"   The fight ahead in the Senate   In the Senate, where Republicans also have majority control, there does not appear to be enough support to push the bill past the chamber's filibuster rules, which largely require 60 votes to advance legislation.   \n   That frustration has led some Republicans, led by Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, to push for a process that would skip the 60-vote threshold in this case, and allow the bill to be debated through a so-called standing filibuster — a process that would open the door to potentially endless debate.   Lee made the case to GOP senators at a closed-door lunch this week, and some said afterward they are mulling the concept.   \"I think most people's minds are open,\" said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., \"My mind's certainly open.\"   But Murkowski of Alaska said she is flat out against the legislation.   \"Not only does the U.S. Constitution clearly provide states the authority to regulate the 'times, places, and manner' of holding federal elections, but one-size-fits-all mandates from Washington, D.C., seldom work in places like Alaska,\" she said.   Karen Brinson Bell of Advance Elections, a nonpartisan consulting firm, said the bill adds numerous requirements for state and local election officials with no additional funding.   \"Election officials have a simple request of Congress — that you help share their burdens not add to them,\" she said.\n",

The president has responded by declaring a new tariff, which he said today he would increase. We're joined now by NPR's Ron Elving. Ron, thanks for being with us.RON ELVING, BYLINE: It's good to be with you, Scott.SIMON: The Supreme Court's decision was 6 to 3. Three conservative justices joined court liberals. The president called the decision a disgrace to the nation. What's at the heart of their decision?ELVING: It's the Constitution which gives the power to tax to the Congress, and tariffs are a form of tax. Chief Justice John Roberts read his own decision aloud in the courtroom yesterday, and the first 10 minutes were all about this issue. The president's use of tariffs was decidedly outside the president's proper authority, the court ruled, even under the emergency legislation you mentioned. Trump responded by going off on the six Supreme Court justices who decided the case - three appointed by Democrats, three by Republican, including two Trump appointed himself - saying they had brought shame on the nation and were an embarrassment to their families - their families.Asked if these justices would still be welcome at the State of the Union speech at the Capitol this week, Trump said they were barely invite and he didn't care if they came or not. And just for the record, the State of the Union is not a presidential invitation event. He is, in fact, an invited guest of Congress.SIMON: Ron, how is the president using the court decision to announce a new 10% global tariff, which he just said this morning he would increase to 15%?ELVING: Well, while we have everyone's attention, using a different statute with a time limit, he's going to go from 10, which he announced yesterday to 15, which he announced this morning with a line in a post truth social. Now, that post has to be read several times to believe he wrote it. It sounds like a Saturday night parody of Trump. He calls the decision ridiculous, poorly written and extraordinarily anti-American. But it has long been a feature of the Trump style that when he suffers a setback, he spins it around and calls it a win, as he did live for the cameras yesterday. Here he is.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: While I am sure that they did not mean to do so, the Supreme Court's decision today made a president's ability to both regulate trade and impose tariffs more powerful and more crystal clear, rather than less.ELVING: Trump routinely says this kind of thing, knowing it will resonate within a certain media sphere and among a certain kind of followers. But if the court had given him a kind of boost like he just described, would he have called them a national disgrace and an embarrassment to their families?SIMON: Ron, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor arrested this week, under investigation for sharing confidential government documents with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. It's irresistible to note we haven't seen that kind of consequence for any of the officials or former officials involved with Epstein in the U.S.ELVING: No. But first, you just have to say, if you're looking for a case of someone who is a national disgrace and an embarrassment to his family, the former Prince Andrew fills the bill, although some people with far less involvement with Epstein have seen fit to resign their jobs outside the government or have apologized. One administration official with Epstein ties, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnik, was there yesterday at Trump's side at that news conference looking very secure. But consider how hard it would be for Trump to start holding his people responsible on Epstein ties after all these months of saying that the whole Epstein saga was nothing but a hoax.SIMON: Ron Elving, thanks so much for being with us. Look forward to speaking with you next week.ELVING: Thank you, Scott. Me, too.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      We look at what yesterday's Supreme Court decision on President Trump's tariffs means for his economic policies and campaign promises.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  President Trump is declaring even higher tariffs today after many he'd ordered were ruled unconstitutional yesterday by the U.S. Supreme Court. This morning, the president said he's raising his new global 10% tariff announced yesterday to 15%, the maximum allowed by law. NPR's White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben joins us. Danielle, thanks so much for being with us.DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Absolutely.SIMON: President Trump posted on social media about the tariff increase. What did he say?KURTZLEBEN: Well, like you said, after the ruling yesterday, he signed an executive order imposing 10% tariffs on the entire world. Well, today in a social media post, he said he's upping that to 15% after, quote, \"a thorough, detailed and complete review,\" unquote, of the court's decision. Now, the Supreme Court had invalidated tariffs that he justified using a law called IEEPA, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. For this new tariff he's announcing, it's a different law. So the unpredictability continues.SIMON: You were at the president's press briefing yesterday, after - shortly after the ruling. Safe to say he wasn't happy, was he?KURTZLEBEN: No, he was furious. And what he said was - I mean, after thanking and congratulating the justices who did side with him, the other justices, he just laid into them, accusing them of being disloyal to the Constitution.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's my opinion that the court has been swayed by foreign interests on a political movement that is far smaller than people would ever think. It's a small movement. I won by millions of votes. We won in a landslide.KURTZLEBEN: So the president is accusing Supreme Court justices of being under the sway of foreign influences. Now, that's first of all, wild. And furthermore, when a reporter asked if he had evidence, the president said, you're going to find out. So he didn't even say what he meant. So, yeah, all in all, he was furious because, look, tariffs have been at the center of his economic policy and also just the center of his second term. And this is a blow to that.SIMON: And how big a setback? Because tariffs are about more than just economics for the president in a way, aren't they?KURTZLEBEN: Right, yeah. It's a both/and thing. They're about economics, but they're also about a whole bunch of other things. I mean, Trump constantly talks about tariffs as a fix for all sorts of economic problems, like bringing in revenue, foreign investment. Now, his promises haven't all borne out, mind you. I mean, Trump has said that tariffs would shrink the trade deficit. The latest data shows that hasn't really happened. But he also seems to like them for bigger reasons because tariffs have given him so much power. Trump had claimed he had the ability to impose tariffs when he wanted at the levels he wanted. And as the head of an economic superpower, that gave him so much leverage over other countries. And he used that with trade deals, with pharmaceutical pricing, even with diplomacy. And now he doesn't necessarily have that power anymore.SIMON: He does have some tariff power - those 15% tariffs we mentioned. And he's hinted at more. What will he be able to do?KURTZLEBEN: Well, he'll be able to use other laws, or at least he'll try to. He's imposing these new tariffs under a law known as Section 122, which allows a president to impose tariffs for up to a hundred fifty days. After that, Congress has to vote on it. In addition, some of the tariffs he's already imposed will stick around. They're - these are called Section 232 tariffs. They're the tariffs on things like steel and aluminum and cars. But then he also has cited a few other laws he says he can use to impose tariffs. These are all known by these three-digit numbers - 201, 301, 338. But the upshot is they all give the president some tariffing power. But the difference between those laws and the IEEPA tariffs that the court ruled illegal is that these other laws have restrictions. Some of them require investigations first, which can take weeks or months, or they have time limitations or just limits on the size of the tariff. So yes, he has options, but those options could also be limited in several ways.SIMON: And, of course, polls tells us Americans are pretty pessimistic about the economy right now - concerned about the cost of living. How does that measure up with the president leaning so hard into using tariffs, which, after all, are a form of a tax?KURTZLEBEN: That's right, and that's the big conflict Trump has made for himself here. He's been promoting these tariffs, which, like you said, they're a tax - they raise prices for everybody. At the same time that he's been trying to make the case that he cares about the cost of living, and most voters just don't think the tariffs have helped. Many say the opposite. So if he continues to lean hard into tariffs, that will really affect what political appetite the country has for Republicans in the midterms. And some congressional Republicans, after all, have come out against Trump's tariffs. So that conflict could intensify. So this just makes it remarkable that he's sticking to this policy. He could have used this ruling as an exit ramp, but he hasn't.SIMON: Danielle Kurtzleben. Thanks so much.KURTZLEBEN: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The programs are designed to help speed registered travelers through security lines. Suspending them could cause headaches for fliers.   Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement that \"shutdowns have serious real world consequences.\" She also said that \"TSA and CBP are prioritizing the general traveling population at our airports and ports of entry and suspending courtesy and special privilege escorts.\"   The partial government shutdown began Feb. 14 after Democrats and the White House were unable to reach a deal on legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security. Democrats have been demanding changes to immigration operations that are core to President Donald Trump's deportation campaign.   \n   Democrats on the House Committee on Homeland Security criticized the decision about airport security.   They said on social media that the administration was \"kneecapping the programs that make travel smoother and secure\" and accused them of \"ruining your travel on purpose.\"\n",

The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted 12-6 to lift a block that a lower court first placed on the law in 2024. In the opinion released Friday, the court said it was too early to make a judgment call on the constitutionality of the law.   That's partly because it's not yet clear how prominently schools may display the religious text, if teachers will refer to the Ten Commandments during classes or if other texts like the Mayflower Compact or the Declaration of Independence will also be displayed, the majority opinion said.   \n   Without those sorts of details, the panel decided it did not have enough information to weigh any First Amendment issues that might arise from the law. In other words, there aren't enough facts available to \"permit judicial judgment rather than speculation,\" the majority wrote in the opinion.   In a concurring opinion, Circuit Judge James Ho, an appointee of Republican President Donald Trump, wrote that the law \"is not just constitutional — it affirms our nation's highest and most noble traditions.\"   The six judges who voted against the decision wrote a series of dissents, with some arguing that the law exposes children to government-endorsed religion in a place they are required to be, presenting a clear constitutional burden.   Circuit Judge James L. Dennis, an appointee of Democratic President Bill Clinton, wrote that the law \"is precisely the kind of establishment the Framers anticipated and sought to prevent.\"   The ruling is the result of the court's choice to rehear the case with all judges present after three of them ruled in June that the Louisiana law was unconstitutional. The reversal comes from one of the nation's most conservative appeals courts, and one that's known for propelling Republican policies to a similarly conservative U.S. Supreme Court.   \n   Republican Gov. Jeff Landry celebrated the ruling Friday, declaring, \"Common sense is making a comeback!\"   The ACLU of Louisiana, one of several groups representing plaintiffs, pledged to explore all legal pathways to continue fighting the law.   Arkansas has a similar law that has been challenged in federal court. And a Texas law took effect on Sept. 1, marking the widest reaching attempt in the nation to hang the Ten Commandments in public schools.   \n   Some Texas school districts were barred from posting them after federal judges issued injunctions in two cases challenging the law, but they have already gone up in many classrooms across the state as districts paid to have the posters printed themselves or accepted donations.   The laws are among pushes by Republicans, including Trump, to incorporate religion into public school classrooms. Critics say it violates the separation of church and state, while backers say the Ten Commandments are historical and part of the foundation of U.S. law.   Joseph Davis, an attorney representing Louisiana in the case, applauded the court for upholding America's \"time-honored tradition of recognizing faith in the public square.\"   Families from a variety of religious backgrounds, including Christianity, Judaism and Hinduism, have challenged the laws, as have clergy members and nonreligious families.   The Freedom From Religion Foundation, another group involved in the challenge, called the ruling \"extremely disappointing\" and said the law will force families \"into a game of constitutional whack-a-mole\" where they will have to separately challenge each school district's displays.   Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said after the ruling that she had sent schools several correct examples of the required poster.   In 1980, the Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law violated the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" The court found that the law had no secular purpose but served a plainly religious purpose.   \n   And in 2005, the Supreme Court held that such displays in a pair of Kentucky courthouses violated the Constitution. At the same time, the court upheld a Ten Commandments marker on the grounds of the Texas state Capitol in Austin.\n",

The announcement was made a day after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the president's sweeping use of emergency powers to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The 6-3 ruling is a major blow to Trump's economic policy agenda.   \n   Trump said his decision to raise taxes on imports to 15% is based on \"a thorough, detailed, and complete review of the ridiculous, poorly written, and extraordinarily anti-American decision on Tariffs issued yesterday.\"   Many countries were still reeling from Trump's announcement of new tariffs Friday night when he signed a proclamation to impose a temporary 10% hike on imports of goods from around the world. The tariffs would be limited to 150 days.   In the proclamation, Trump cites the Trade Act of 1974 as authorizing the tariffs. Trump made clear on Saturday he plans to continue centering tariffs in his economic policy, despite legal setbacks.   \"During the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs, which will continue our extraordinarily successful process of Making America Great Again,\" he said in the social media post.   The president's proclamation issued Friday said that certain goods from Canada and Mexico covered under a separate agreement with the U.S. would be exempt from the new tariffs. It also said the levies would not apply to certain agricultural products, including beef, tomatoes, and oranges.\n",

Fewer competitive seats means the overwhelming majority — more than 90% — of congressional races will pretty much be decided during primary elections, which see far fewer voters participate than general elections.   \"Right now, we only rate 18 out of 435 races as toss ups, which means that less than 5% of Americans will truly be deciding who's in control of the House,\" David Wasserman, senior elections analyst for the Cook Political Report, told NPR.   \n   This disparity in the voting power of Americans in congressional races has been a worsening problem for several election cycles.   Unite America Institute, which tracks what it refers to as the \"primary problem\" and advocates for election reforms, calculated that in 2024, just 7% voters elected 87% of U.S. House races.   Loading...\n   Voters have self-sorted themselves geographically, and technology in recent years has allowed lawmakers to more effectively carve up congressional districts that give one party an advantage over another.   Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, said the mid-decade redistricting prompted by Trump last year has further reduced the number of competitive seats. His organization says 32 states currently don't have a single competitive congressional race.   \"The primary problem is bad and getting worse,\" he told NPR. \"We are about to enter a midterm election season that will be the least competitive of our lifetimes, which means that we will have, no matter who wins in November, the least accountable Congress of our lifetime.\"   Last year, Trump asked Texas lawmakers to redraw the state's congressional map to create five more seats that could favor Republicans in 2026. Democratic leaders in California responded, putting forward a successful ballot measure to circumvent the state's independent redistricting commission and create five more favorable seats for Democrats.   \n   Lawmakers in other states, including North Carolina and Missouri, crafted new maps as well, and Florida and Virginia are among the states that may join them.   \n   But so far, Wasserman said the redrawing of congressional boundaries ahead of this year's elections hasn't led to any \"pronounced advantage\" for either Republicans or Democrats.   \"Instead, what it's done is it's eviscerated the competitive range of districts in which Americans have a real say over who controls Congress in November,\" he said.   Wasserman explained that even if one were to include races that Cook rates as \"leaning\" toward one party or another, that would only be 36 seats.   \"That's still less than 10% of the House,\" he said. \"By comparison, at this point in Trump's first term, we had 48 races that were competitive between the two parties.\"   Wasserman said new district lines in California and Texas are driving most of this.   \"Whereas we used to have a robust number of Republicans from California and Democrats from Texas and Florida, today blue states' delegations are becoming bluer, red states' delegations are becoming redder,\" he said. \"And there are fewer opportunities for bipartisan dialogue.\"   Primary voters tend to be more ideologically extreme than the general public   Troiano said there are some serious democratic issues raised by the fact that so few voters will have so much power to decide what party will control Congress.   For one, he says, primary voters are not representative of the broader American electorate. According to an analysis from his group, primary voters tend to be older, whiter, wealthier, more educated and more ideologically extreme than the general public.   \"And so when you look at an old, white, wealthy Congress that is ideologically polarizing, can't get anything done, they reflect exactly who sent them there,\" Troiano said.   There have been some efforts in recent years to open up primaries to independent voters — which is the fastest-growing part of the U.S. electorate. New Mexico, for instance, now allows non-affiliated and independent voters to participate in party primaries. However, Louisiana and West Virginia recently went the other way, restricting some primaries to just registered party members. Currently, 17 states have either completely closed or partially closed primaries.   \n   And in 2024, there were several ballot measures before voters in states like Arizona, Colorado, Nevada and Oregon that would have created nonpartisan primaries. But those statewide efforts failed across the board.   Unite America advocates for nonpartisan primaries or the inclusion of independent voters in party primaries for a slew of reasons, but one of their biggest arguments is that they allow more voters to take part in the most determinative elections.   And that's especially important, Troiano said, as more states whittle down the number of competitive seats.   \"So if you think dysfunction and division is bad right now in Washington,\" he said, \"it's going to get worse in the next congressional session because of the lack of competition in this year's elections.\"\n",

The nearly 700-mile flight last weekend — which transported a 5-megawatt microreactor without nuclear fuel — highlights the Trump administration's drive to promote nuclear energy to help meet skyrocketing demand for power from artificial intelligence and data centers, as well for use by the military.   \n   Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Undersecretary of Defense Michael Duffey, who traveled with the privately built reactor, hailed the Feb. 15 trip on a C-17 military aircraft as a breakthrough for U.S. efforts to fast-track commercial licensing for the microreactors, part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to reshape the country's energy landscape.   A new emphasis on nuclear energy   President Donald Trump supports nuclear power — a carbon-free source of electricity — as a reliable energy source, even as he has been broadly hostile to renewable energy and prioritizes coal and other fossil fuels to produce electricity.   Skeptics warn that nuclear energy poses risks and say microreactors may not be safe or feasible and have not proved they can meet demand for a reasonable price.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Energy Secretary Chris Wright speaks at a news conference at March Air Reserve Base, Calif., Sunday Feb. 15, 2026.\n                \n                    Matthew Daly/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Matthew Daly/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Wright brushed those concerns aside as he touted progress on Trump's push for a quick escalation of nuclear power. Trump signed a series of executive orders last year that allow Wright to approve some advanced reactor designs and projects, taking authority away from the independent safety agency that has regulated the U.S. nuclear industry for five decades.   \"Today is history. A multi-megawatt, next-generation nuclear power plant is loaded in the C-17 behind us,\" Wright said before the two-hour flight from March Air Reserve Base in California to Hill Air Force base in Utah.   \n   The minivan-sized reactor transported by the military is one of at least three that will reach \"criticality\" — when a nuclear reaction can sustain an ongoing series of reactions — by July 4, as Trump has promised, Wright said.   \"That's speed, that's innovation, that's the start of a nuclear renaissance,\" he said.   Microreactors would be for civilian and military use   Currently, there are 94 operable nuclear reactors in the U.S. that generate about 19% of the country's electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That's down from 104 reactors in 2013 and includes two new commercial reactors in Georgia that were the nation's first large reactors built from scratch in a generation.   \n   Recognizing delays inherent to deployment of new, full-scale reactors, the industry and government have focused in recent years on more efficient designs, including a small modular reactor proposed by the nation's largest public power company, the Tennessee Valley Authority.   Microreactors, designed to be portable, can take that a step further and \"accelerate the delivery of resilient power to where it's needed,\" Duffey said. Eventually, the mobile reactors could provide energy security on a military base without the civilian grid, he and other officials said.   The demonstration flight \"gets us closer to deploy nuclear power when and where it is needed to give our nation's warfighters the tools to win in battle,\" Duffey said.   The reactor transported to Utah will be able to generate up to 5 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 5,000 homes, said Isaiah Taylor, CEO of Valar Atomics, the California startup that produced the reactor. The company hopes to start selling power on a test basis next year and become fully commercial in 2028.   Some safety concerns haven't been addressed, experts say   Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the transport flight — which included a throng of reporters, photographers and TV news crews — was little more than \"a dog-and-pony show\" that merely demonstrated the Pentagon's ability to ship a piece of heavy equipment.   \n   The flight \"doesn't answer any questions about whether the project is feasible, economic, workable or safe — for the military and the public,\" Lyman said in an interview.   \n   The Trump administration \"hasn't made the safety case\" for how microreactors, once loaded with nuclear fuel, can be transported securely to data centers or military bases, Lyman said.   Officials also have not resolved how nuclear waste will be disposed, although Wright said the Energy Department is in talks with Utah and other states to host sites that could reprocess fuel or handle permanent disposal.   The microreactor flown to Utah will be sent to the Utah San Rafael Energy Lab for testing and evaluation, Wright said. Fuel will be provided by the Nevada National Security site, Taylor said.   \"The answer to energy is always more,\" Wright said. After four years of restrictions on more polluting forms of energy under the Biden administration, he said, \"now we're trying to set everything free. And nuclear will be flying soon.\"\n",

The plaintiffs, represented by Public Citizen Litigation Group, call the proposed plan a \"vanity project\" that would disrupt one of Washington's most symbolically charged sightlines between the Lincoln Memorial and Arlington House, a view designed to evoke national unity after the Civil War.   \n   Vietnam veterans Michael Lemmon, Shaun Byrnes and Jon Gundersen believe the structure would \"dishonor their military and foreign service\" by intruding on a solemn view they visit regularly, according to the complaint.   The arch could also \"pose a hazard to air travel at nearby Reagan National Airport,\" the plaintiffs argue. At 250 feet, the proposed arch would stand more than twice the height of the Lincoln Memorial and sit directly on the ceremonial axis that anchors the capital's monumental core.   The lawsuit names Trump, senior White House officials and the National Park Service (NPS) as defendants. It alleges the plan violates multiple federal laws, including the Commemorative Works Act, the National Environmental Policy Act and the National Historic Preservation Act.   NPR reached out to the White House and NPS for comment about the lawsuit but have not received a response.   \n   Administration officials have framed the proposal as part of a broader effort to commemorate the country's 250th anniversary with new monuments and public works projects highlighting American history and military service.   White House spokesman Davis Ingle said in a statement to The Washington Post the arch \"will enhance the visitor experience at Arlington National Cemetery for veterans, the families of the fallen, and all Americans alike, serving as a visual reminder of the noble sacrifices borne by so many American heroes throughout our 250-year history.\"   \n   Ingle also said Trump \"will continue to honor our veterans and give the greatest Nation on earth America the glory it deserves.\"   The plaintiffs also argue that approval has not been granted and that required environmental and historic preservation reviews have not been completed. Under the Commemorative Works Act, memorials built on federal land in Washington generally require authorization from Congress.   Legal opposition to the project follows a separate lawsuit by the National Trust for Historic Preservation over plans for a privately funded ballroom in place of the White House East Wing.\n",

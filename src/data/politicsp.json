The order also directs Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to study whether the department can withhold federal rural broadband funding from states with unfavorable AI laws.   \n   \"We have to be unified.,\" said Trump, \"China is unified because they have one vote, that's President Xi. He says do it, and that's the end of that.\"   Trump's AI advisor, venture capitalist David Sacks, said the administration will not push back on all state laws, \"Kid safety, we're going to protect. We're not pushing back on that, but we're going to push back on the most onerous examples of state regulations\"   The executive order is almost certain to be challenged in court and tech policy researchers say the Trump administration cannot restrict state regulation in this way without Congress passing a law. The order also directs Sacks to work with Congress to help draft legislation.   Trump's executive order drew criticism from some of his supporters, including organizations that are part of a bipartisan effort to pass laws protecting children from AI harms.   \"This is a huge lost opportunity by the Trump administration to lead the Republican Party into a broadly consultative process,\" said Michael Toscano, director of the Family First Technology Initiative at the Institute for Family Studies, a conservative think tank. \"It doesn't make sense for a populist movement to cut out the people on the most critical issue of our day. But nonetheless, that is what they are vigorously trying to do.\"   \n   \"Even if everything is overturned in the executive order, the chilling effect on states' willingness to protect their residents is going to be huge because they're all now going to fear getting attacked directly by the Trump administration,\" said Adam Billen, vice president of Encode, a nonprofit focused on child safety and threats posed by AI. \"That is the point of all of this - it is to create massive legal uncertainty and gray areas and give the companies the chance to do whatever they want.\"   Sacks can recommend some state laws, such as around child safety, to not be challenged if Congress does come up with a national policy for AI.   While Congress has stalled on passing AI regulation, dozens of states have passed laws related to AI, which include banning creating nonconsensual nude images using AI technology, mandating government agencies and businesses to disclose AI usage, requiring checks for algorithmic discrimination and protecting whistleblowers.   The Trump administration has pushed for less regulation of the AI industry, citing competitive pressure with China. But Trump has also recently allowed chipmaker Nvidia to sell its second-most advanced AI chips to China. Depending on the quantity, said Michael Sobolik, a senior fellow at Hudson Institute who studies U.S.-China competition, the export could end up \"diluting what is our most significant advantage in the AI race.\"   Trump and some of his allies have attempted multiple times this year to halt state-level AI regulation. Earlier this month, GOP lawmakers tried and failed to insert AI preemption into the annual defense spending bill. An earlier version of the executive order signed Thursday leaked last month, sparked a round of opposition from across the political spectrum. In July, the Senate dropped an AI moratorium from the reconciliation bill it was debating.   While Democrats broadly support more AI regulation, the issue has divided Republicans. A faction of the party, including the president, welcome the support of tech billionaires, though others continue to view them with distrust.   \n   Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, an industry ally, introduced the failed AI moratorium during the reconciliation bill debate and stood next to Trump at a signing ceremony for the order on Thursday. After the effort to slip a similar measure in the defense spending bill failed last week, Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri posted on X, \"This is a terrible provision and should remain OUT.\"   Many Republican governors are also opposed to the move. Earlier in the day, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox posted on X that he preferred an alternative executive order that did not include barring state laws. \"States must help protect children and families while America accelerates its leadership in AI,\" he wrote.   \"An executive order doesn't/can't preempt state legislative action,\" posted Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on X Monday in response to Trump's Truth Social post announcing the upcoming order, \"Congress could, theoretically, preempt states through legislation.\" DeSantis has recently proposed a series of AI-related measures.   John Bergmayer, the legal director of the nonprofit advocacy group Public Knowledge, agreed. \"They're trying to find a way to bypass Congress with these various theories in the executive order. Legally, I don't think they work very well.\"   In a post on X on Tuesday, Sacks suggested that the federal government can override state AI laws because it has the power to regulate interstate commerce.   Bergmayer disagreed, \"States are, in fact, allowed to regulate interstate commerce. They do it all the time. And the Supreme Court just recently said it was fine.\"   Bergmayer cited a 2023 Supreme Court decision where the court supported California's power to regulate its pork industry even though the regulations affected farmers in other states.

So far, House leaders have not scheduled a vote. The Senate has. Senators today consider two health policy plans each aimed at reducing health care costs for those who buy their insurance on HealthCare.gov. In a moment, we will speak with one of the senators who will be voting Democrat Jeanne Shaheen. First, we have the facts.MARTIN: NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin is here to explain. Good morning, Selena.SELENA SIMMONS-DUFFIN, BYLINE: Good morning, Michel.MARTIN: So, Selena, you met somebody who illustrates the dilemma here for the vast majority of the 24 million people who get their health insurance through the exchange. Tell me about her.SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Yeah. Her name is Ellen Allen (ph). She lives near Charleston, West Virginia, and I first talked to her over the summer. She's 64 years old. She was raiding her retirement savings to prepare for a huge increase in her premium. And when I reached her yesterday, she told me she'd enrolled in a plan.ELLEN ALLEN: The bronze plan without vision and dental, with a monthly premium of $1,967.50SIMMONS-DUFFIN: So her premium for 2026 is four times this year's premium, nearly $1,500 more every single month for a plan that covers less.MARTIN: So that's going to happen unless Congress steps in and changes the law. So what could that look like?SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Senate Democrats are expected to vote on a bill today that would extend the enhanced subsidies that were bringing costs down for three years. The bill would also extend open enrollment until May and do several other things, like allowing automatic renewals and renewing funding for people who help you sign up. Republicans don't like this plan. They say it's too expensive. It's driving health care costs up. And they point to reports of fraud to say the whole system is flawed.MARTIN: So it seems like the Republicans took a while to coalesce around an alternative, but they did. What's their idea?SIMMONS-DUFFIN: This bill would not address those rising premium costs directly. It would instead put taxpayer dollars into health savings accounts for some enrollees - a thousand dollars a year for people under age 50 and $1,500 for people between 50 and 64. That money could not go towards premiums, but it could go to other kinds of health expenses like copays or over-the-counter medications, and it would also prohibit abortion coverage in Obamacare and prevent Medicaid from covering gender affirming care for transgender people of any age. Democrats don't like this bill at all, and neither does Ellen Allen.ALLEN: A thousand or $1,500. I mean, I understand that's not a monthly contribution.SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Correct.ALLEN: Yeah. That's nothing. That is - that's insulting. I mean, how stupid do they think the American people are?MARTIN: OK. That plan does seem to fit with what President Trump has said he wants, though - sending money to people, but not the insurance companies.SIMMONS-DUFFIN: True. But Republicans would be putting way less taxpayer money into it, about $10 billion into health savings accounts, versus approximately 35 billion towards enhanced subsidies. So it's not just a different delivery system. It's also a big funding cut.MARTIN: What are you expecting to happen today?SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Well, there is a super small Republican majority in the Senate, and these bills would need 60 votes to pass. Neither side is likely to reach that threshold, which is not good for people who are navigating open enrollment right now and were hoping for some relief. Polling suggests these enhanced subsidies are quite popular across party lines. So Congress may keep working on this. I do not think that these votes today are going to be the end of the story.MARTIN: That is NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin. Selena, thank you.SIMMONS-DUFFIN: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

The defeat Thursday in the Indiana Senate, where 40 of the 50 members are Republicans, is the first time Trump's redistricting campaign has been voted down by members of his own party. Republicans in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina have answered his call for an unusual mid-decade redistricting scramble.   \"My opposition to mid-cycle gerrymandering is not in contrast to my conservative principles, my opposition is driven by them,\" Republican state Sen. Spencer Deery said during the debate. \"As long as I have breath, I will use my voice to resist a federal government that attempts to bully, direct and control this state or any state. Giving the federal government more power is not conservative.\"   \n   The move was also opposed by Indiana Democrats, who currently hold just two of the state's nine U.S. House seats and said it would dilute the voting power of minority communities.   Usually, states redistrict early in the decade after the decennial census count.   The vote came after weeks of political turmoil and some threats   Trump has urged Republican-led states to conduct an unusual, mid-decade redistricting effort aimed at helping Republicans hold onto their majority in the U.S. House in next year's midterm elections. California Democrats responded with their own redistricting effort but so far red states have gained a few-seat advantage over blue states.   \n   The Indiana vote came after weeks of turmoil and with opposition from some Republicans, who had said their constituents did not want to alter the current districts.   Outside of the chamber ahead of the vote, protesters could be heard chanting \"vote no\" and \"Hoosiers fight fair.\"   Indiana Gov. Mike Braun, a Republican, has supported Trump's call and both of them have threatened to support primary challenges against senators who don't support redistricting. Amid rising tensions over redistricting in the state, Braun and other Republican lawmakers said they and their families have been the subject of anonymous threats.   \n   As the Senate debated the bill to redistrict, Vice President Vance wrote on X that the Republican Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray had told the administration he wouldn't fight redistricting but was encouraging votes against it. \"That level of dishonesty cannot be rewarded,\" Vance wrote. Bray voted no.   Republicans who backed redistricting said it was for political gain to help keep the U.S. House in Republican control and noted that some Democratic-led states have redrawn their districts to favor Democrats in the past.   \"Only a handful of districts throughout the United States will determine who controls Congress. We may or may not do our part today to keep our nation in the hands of Republicans and do the right thing for our state,\" Republican state Sen. Mike Young told the chamber. \"Whether we choose to play the game or not play the game we will determine the fate of our state and country.\"      Ben Thorp is a reporter for WFYI.

    "body": "\n      The Senate failed to advance two separate partisan bills to address health care costs for people who buy plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplace.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  Insurance premiums for millions of Americans are set to spike at the end of this year when enhanced subsidies for the Affordable Care Act are set to expire. Today, the Senate voted on dueling plans to address health care costs, and both of those measures failed. NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas was tracking the votes today on Capitol Hill. Hi, Sam.SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: Hey, Scott.DETROW: Remind us how we got here.GRINGLAS: So Democrats have been pushing for months to get these enhanced subsidies extended. This fall, they withheld their votes on a funding bill to reopen the government as they pressed to preserve the subsidies. Republicans, though, they did not relent, and enough Senate Democrats ultimately agreed to end the shutdown in exchange for a vote on the subsidies, which is what happened today.DETROW: OK. So we mentioned two different proposals. What were they?GRINGLAS: Senate Democrats united behind a three-year clean extension of the subsidies. Democrats like Senator Jon Ossoff of Georgia warned about the consequences of letting them expire. He talked about one constituent with diabetes who had just had a major surgery and said she's going to have to cancel her insurance because of the exploding premium.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JON OSSOFF: And she cried again when she got that insurance quote because suddenly she feared that she might die. She might die.GRINGLAS: Now, some Republicans are also worried about the subsidies expiring, you know, at a moment when affordability is a key concern for a lot of voters. Four Republicans voted with Democrats on this bill - not enough to pass it, though. I spoke to one of those Republicans, Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri.JOSH HAWLEY: The politics - I just - I don't know. I'll leave that to others. But I do know that - the effect on people at home. And right now, people at home are saying we need our health care prices to be lower. They need help on everything. So I'm for doing everything that will help lower the cost of health care.GRINGLAS: So Hawley voted for the Democratic and the Republican plans.DETROW: Right. There was so much of a focus on the Democratic plan after the shutdown. Tell us about the Republican one that was also up today.GRINGLAS: So that plan would have put up to 1,500 bucks a year in health savings accounts for people on high-deductible ACA plans, making up to 700% of the federal poverty line. The money could be used for things like copays and medicine but not for premiums. Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana helped craft that plan, and he said it would give money directly to people, not the insurance companies.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BILL CASSIDY: If the average American family has less than a thousand dollars to spend, and our plan puts thousands in their account to pay for the health care they know they need, what is the objection to that?GRINGLAS: Now, Democrats argued that families may still not be able to afford the coverage in the first place. They also noted this bill would have penalized insurance companies for covering abortion and prevented Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program from covering gender-affirming care. So this vote also failed.DETROW: This is all the Senate. What's been going on in the House?GRINGLAS: House Speaker Mike Johnson has said there is a plan coming, but it has not surfaced yet. There are a couple of rank-and-file bipartisan proposals in the works that would extend the subsidies temporarily, along with some reforms. These bills could be brought to the floor by maneuvering around the leadership but would probably need unanimous Democratic support plus enough Republicans to really have a shot.DETROW: Congress has been debating and arguing the Affordable...GRINGLAS: Yeah.DETROW: ...Care Act for years now.GRINGLAS: Yeah.DETROW: How does this fight over extending these subsidies fit into all of that?GRINGLAS: The Affordable Care Act has been controversial from the jump. Republicans have tried over and over to repeal it but have struggled to come up with an alternative. Now, many acknowledge that the ACA is here to stay, even as they continue to criticize it as, you know, the Unaffordable Care Act, though polling, Scott, has shown that the ACA subsidies are incredibly popular with voters across party lines.DETROW: What happens next?GRINGLAS: There are some other plans by different Senate Republicans and some informal bipartisan Senate talks have been happening. Those members hope these failed partisan votes may reignite those efforts, but the chances - they still look pretty dim. And President Trump said this week he is not keen on doing health legislation at all. In the meantime, these enhanced subsidies are still set to expire, meaning health care could animate the upcoming midterms, and people are making decisions right now about whether they can keep their coverage next year.DETROW: Yeah. That is NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas. Thank you so much.GRINGLAS: Thanks, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio directed diplomats around the world to switch from Calibri to Times New Roman 14-point font in all official documents, starting on Wednesday, the State Department said in a statement to NPR. The difference between the two fonts comes down to a few finishing strokes.   \"Whether for internal memoranda, papers prepared for principals, or documents shared externally, consistent formatting strengthens credibility and supports a unified Department identity,\" the statement said.   \n   Times New Roman had been the State Department's official font for nearly two decades, from 2004 until 2023.   According to the Associated Press, Rubio said in a cable sent to U.S. embassies and consulates that the 2023 change, implemented by then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken, was part of misguided diversity, equity and inclusion policies.   Calibri is a sans serif font, meaning it doesn't have the decorative tops and tails at the ends of letters that serif fonts like Times New Roman do.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Times New Roman is a serif font, with decorative flourishes, while the sans-serif Calibri can be easier to read.\n                \n                    NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Those little flourishes can make the lettering harder to read, says Kristen Shinohara, who leads the Center for Accessibility and Inclusion Research at the Rochester Institute of Technology.   \"This impact can be more severe for people with learning or reading disabilities like dyslexia or for people with low vision,\" she told NPR's Morning Edition.   The Americans with Disabilities Act requires sans-serif fonts on physical signage and display screens because of their relative legibility. At the same time, serif fonts like Times New Roman remain the norm in print newspapers, books, legal documents and more.   \n   \"Times New Roman specifically, and serif fonts generally, are more formal and professional,\" the State Department statement said. It did not respond to NPR's questions about reduced accessibility.   Times New Roman was designed specifically for the British newspaper The Times in the 1920s and quickly became the favored typeface for many other publications. It was also the default font of Microsoft programs like Word beginning in the 1990s until it was replaced by Calibri — which was designed with screens in mind — in 2007.   \n   Microsoft replaced Calibri with a sans-serif font called Aptos in 2023. The company wrote in a blog post at the time that Aptos' designer, Steve Matteson, wanted the font to have \"the universal appeal of the late NPR newscaster Carl Kasell and the astute tone of The Late Show host Stephen Colbert.\"   Small lettering, bigger patterns   Rubio's memo describes the 2023 change to Calibri as \"another wasteful DEIA program\" and says it did not lead to a meaningful reduction in the department's accessibility-based document remediation cases, according to copies obtained by Reuters and The Associated Press.   The Trump administration has made no secret of its disdain for its predecessor's focus on diversity, equity and inclusion.   \n   Trump has issued numerous executive orders dismantling DEI initiatives in federal agencies, the foreign service, federal contracts and more. His administration put pressure on universities and public schools, threatening to withhold federal funding from those that have DEI programs, though a judge struck down some of those efforts in August. And growing anti-DEI backlash has also resulted in scores of private companies scaling back their own such initiatives.   During his tenure at the State Department, Rubio has already abolished offices and initiatives meant to foster inclusion and diversity, both in D.C. and abroad.   The State Department statement says the return to Times New Roman better aligns with Trump's \"One Voice for America's Foreign Relations\" directive from February, by underscoring its \"responsibility to present a unified, professional voice in all communications.\"   \n   It also fits into the Trump administration's broader fixation on aesthetics, from his gilded Oval Office redesign to his proposal of a classically-styled D.C. arch to mark the nation's 250th birthday to his August executive order mandating that new federal buildings prioritize classical and traditional architectural styles.   And well before the Trump administration started specifying federal agencies' fonts, it was restricting the words they could use.   The Health and Human Services Department removed entire webpages devoted to topics like LGBTQ health and HIV, while the Department of Energy instructed employees to avoid using terms including \"climate change\" and \"sustainable.\" Just this week, court filings emerged showing the administration's six-page list of words the federal Head Start programs cannot use, including \"disability,\" \"race\" and \"women.\"\n",

That's according to recently submitted court documents.   The list of words includes \"accessible,\" \"belong,\" \"Black,\" \"disability,\" \"female,\" \"minority,\" \"trauma,\" \"tribal\" and \"women.\"   \n   The list was submitted on Dec. 5, as part of an ongoing lawsuit filed by Head Start programs in a handful of states – including Pennsylvania, Washington, Wisconsin and Illinois – against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.   The lawsuit argues that the Trump administration's ban on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in federal programs conflicts with Head Start's statutory mandate. That mandate includes, among other things, providing \"linguistically and culturally appropriate\" services as well as early intervention services for children with disabilities.   \n   In response to NPR requests for comment or clarity on the list, HHS Press Secretary Emily G. Hilliard wrote, \"HHS does not comment on ongoing litigation.\"   Nationally, Head Start serves roughly 750,000 infants, toddlers and preschool-age children, providing childcare, early learning, free meals, health screenings and family support.   The list came to light through the lawsuit as part of a recent declaration from the executive director of a Wisconsin-based Head Start program that has been receiving federal funding for over 50 years. The program's director, identified in the document by a pseudonym, Mary Roe, explained that she submitted a regular funding renewal request to HHS on Sept. 30.   According to the declaration, Roe received two emails from HHS on Nov. 19. One briefly explained that her grant application was being returned and instructed her to \"please remove the following words from your application.\" The email contained a list of 19 words including \"Racism,\" \"Race\" and \"Racial.\"   Shortly after that, Roe said in her declaration, she received a second email, this one from her assigned program specialist at HHS, who wrote: \"I wanted to follow-up with you concerning your application. I sent it back asking for the removal of particular words and I wanted to provide you with the complete list of words to make sure are not in your applications.\"   \n   Included with that second email was a list of nearly 200 words and phrases titled: \"Words to limit or avoid in government documents.\"   Both emails were included in the suit, though the program specialist's name was redacted. It is unclear if or how many other Head Start programs have received similar guidance.   In her declaration, Mary Roe said the word ban has put her in an \"impossible situation\" because the federal Head Start Act contains many of the words programs are now being told to avoid.   \n   One contradiction Roe highlighted is Head Start's longstanding responsibility \"to create inclusive and accessible classrooms for children with disabilities,\" she stated. Yet she was advised by HHS to avoid the words \"disability,\" \"disabilities\" and \"inclusion\" in her funding application.   Roe also declared that she worries that removing such words might satisfy the current administration – but run afoul of existing law.   Disability-rights advocates condemned the list, pointing out that many Head Start programs also receive federal funding through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act specifically to identify and support young children with disabilities.   \"Banning the word 'disability' from Head Start is morally repugnant and a violation of federal law,\" says Jacqueline Rodriguez of the National Center for Learning Disabilities. \"No administration can claim to support children with disabilities while banning the very word that protects them.\"   Separate court documents related to this lawsuit also show that a Head Start program located on a Native American reservation was told to remove sections from its application that are necessary for the program to prioritize services for tribal members and their descendants – something allowed by federal law.   The word \"tribal\" is also on the list of words to limit or avoid on Head Start applications.   In a January executive action, the White House said \"illegal DEI and DEIA policies not only violate the text and spirit of our longstanding Federal civil-rights laws, they also undermine our national unity, as they deny, discredit, and undermine the traditional American values of hard work, excellence, and individual achievement in favor of an unlawful, corrosive, and pernicious identity-based spoils system.\"   In March, the Office of Head Start sent an email to all grant recipients explaining that it would no longer approve funding requests for any activities \"that promote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.\"   \n   See the full declaration below. The list of words \"to limit or avoid\" begins on page 31.   \n",

    "body": "\n      Democrats are feeling optimistic about their chances to retake the House of Representatives next year, but they also face challenges in their efforts to push back on President Trump.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  For a party out of power in Washington, D.C., Democrats are on a roll outside the Beltway. They're winning races, and President Trump's poll numbers are dropping - always good signs for the opposition party in a midterm election year. But there are still a lot of obstacles ahead for the out party. NPR's senior national political correspondent, Mara Liasson, has more.MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Democrats like Adam Jentleson are feeling pretty good. His party has won or overperformed in every election this year.ADAM JENTLESON: The takeaway is that the Americans do not like what Republicans and Donald Trump are offering. They're rejecting it wholesale.LIASSON: But there's a big caveat, says Jentleson - the president of a new think tank called the Searchlight Institute, which he says is devoted to coming up with new ideas for Democrats.JENTLESON: The challenge for Democrats is that Americans still aren't super enthusiastic about what Democrats are offering. Even these polls that show Trump's numbers plummeting across a range of issues show that voters still trust Republicans more than Democrats on major issues like the economy, crime and immigration.LIASSON: Democrats like Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, thinks the party has a way to address that trust deficit. This year, all the Democratic candidates were singing from the same page, whether they were democratic socialists, like Zohran Mamdani in New York City, or moderate centrists, like Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey.NEERA TANDEN: If you look at their ads, their social media, all of those candidates had a relentless focus on how it's really hard for Americans to make ends meet, that costs are outstripping wages. And that through line is really forming a consensus now that Democrats can compete and win with a relentless focus on cost of living - or as the president likes to say, the affordability.LIASSON: It's unusual for the normally fractious Democrats to agree on much. But this year, in addition to a unified, across-the-board focus on affordability, Democrats also seem to be forming a rare consensus on culture war issues - immigration, crime, transgender rights.TANDEN: People get that we're in an existential threat and there just aren't these kinds of litmus tests.LIASSON: Liberal litmus tests like defunding the police or decriminalizing illegal border crossings or the infamous litmus test over transgender rights that came back to haunt Kamala Harris in an attack ad that blanketed airwaves in the weeks before the election. In an effort to gain a liberal group's endorsement, Harris agreed to support taxpayer-funded transgender surgery for prison inmates. Rahm Emanuel, former White House chief of staff, congressman and mayor of Chicago, says Democrats have learned a lesson.RAHM EMANUEL: Don't focus on the bathroom access or locker rooms. Focus on classroom excellence. I happen to think defunding the police was dumb, but I have a proactive public safety argument, not a legal brief that you're 22% safer this year than last year.LIASSON: Democrats have also struggled with the question of how much to make their message about Donald Trump. A focus on Trump hasn't worked for them in the past. Emanuel, Jentleson and Tanden think the answer this cycle is to convince voters that the economy is connected to Trump's self-dealing, and Democrats are willing to fight back.EMANUEL: Corruption is going to be the big issue. And Donald Trump has proven - both him, his kids - they are literally making billions while you are left with the bill to pay.JENTLESON: Donald Trump came into office promising to bring prices down, and prices are continuing to go up. And meanwhile, he is building himself a giant ballroom funded with money from his billionaire buddies.TANDEN: The most important thing, I think, for most Democrats today is who is going to have some accountability for the Trump administration.LIASSON: If that sounds like a chorus, it is. It's the message voters will be hearing nonstop from Democratic candidates all over the country next year. So Democrats think they have a winning message, but they also have to figure out how to win red states and rural districts without which they can't hope to take the House or Senate back next year. And Democrats' problems get even more existential over the long term. After the 2030 census, more than 15 electoral votes could move south away from the so-called blue wall states Democrats currently rely on to win the White House - Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania - and to red states like Texas, Georgia and Florida. Neera Tanden.TANDEN: With population trends, the blue wall will not have sufficient electoral strength to win the presidency. Democrats will need to definitely win states like Iowa, Ohio.LIASSON: ...Or West Virginia, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, Nebraska, Georgia, Florida - all places where in the past, says Adam Jentleson, Democrats could and did win.JENTLESON: Democrats have been able to compete in these states, and we need to get back to being able to win there if we're going to have any hope of overcoming conservative structural advantages, long-term.LIASSON: Those structural advantages - like partisan gerrymandering, the Electoral College, the rural tilt of the Senate - all favor Republicans. And Democrats are just now beginning to figure out what they need to do to overcome them. Mara Liasson, NPR News.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

China has recently started buying U.S. soybeans again, but in much smaller quantities than before.\n                \n                    Kirk Siegler/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kirk Siegler/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   HURON, S.D. — American farmers are welcoming the $12 billion assistance package President Trump announced for them this week, but there's also evidence that his trade policies are a big reason many farmers aren't profitable this year.   Farmers like Kevin Deinert in South Dakota, who opens the hatch of a shiny silver grain bin on his farm that's full of this year's soybean harvest.   \"I stored everything I could, so it's full, as you can see,\" he says. \"A little too full.\"   In recent years, Deinert's bins would be empty by now, his soybeans sold to China, which has been buying about 25 million metric tons annually from the U.S. since 2019.   \n   But this spring, they started buying them from Brazil and other countries instead, in response to President Trump levying tariffs against Chinese exports to the U.S.   The Chinese market evaporated as prices farmers pay for fertilizer and other products they need have been rising sharply due to inflation and tariffs Trump imposed on Canada and other countries that produce them.   That's left a lot of farmers in the red. Deinert says the $12 billion aid package will help.   Aid appreciated, but farmers prefer trade   \"It's meaningful,\" he says, \"I don't want to say it's not. But is the quantity going to alleviate all the farmers' concerns? I don't think so.\"   Even conservative agriculture groups like the Farm Bureau Federation, which welcomed this week's aid package, say it alone won't restore farmers to financial health. In a statement, Missouri Farm Bureau President Garrett Hawkins called the bridge payments an important first step.   \"We look forward to continued efforts from the federal government to recalibrate trade strategies, open new markets, bolster domestic demand, and strengthen long-term farm viability,\" Hawkins said.   State chapters of the historically less conservative National Farmers Union have been more critical, saying the culmination of President Trump's two trade wars, the first during his first term in 2018, is causing irreparable damage in the Heartland.    \n   Doug Sombke, president of the South Dakota Farmers Union, says the administration is having to bail out farmers as a result of the President's own trade policies.   \"He's back at the fire and he's trying to put it out with a garden hose,\" Sombke says. \"And it's an inferno.\"    Agricultural lobbying groups across the nation say farmers have lost long standing trade relationships while also paying four to five times more for everything from fertilizer to farm equipment. Many are also still recovering from supply chain disruptions from the pandemic.    Kevin Deinert, who's also president of the South Dakota Soybean Growers Association, would like to get back to relying on international markets for income.   \"You know, as farmers we want trade, not aid,\" he says.   The Trump administration did strike a new trade deal with China in November. It says China will buy 12 million metric tons of American soybeans by the end of February, and 25 million metric tons in the next three years. If it holds, that would only bring farmers back to roughly the same situation they were in before the President started a second trade war.    Deinert says he's heard some grain is finally moving to Asia again. But his bins are still full.     \"We haven't seen anything on paper,\" he says. \"Right now we're just trading on headlines.\"   The White House says that payments from the $12 billion in aid package should arrive in farmers' bank accounts in late February. They have to apply for them by Dec. 19, and should know exactly how much they'll receive in January. The administration also points to its \"Big Beautiful Budget Act,\" which includes provisions that will increase price support for commodity crops like soybeans and corn starting late next year.    The timing here is crucial as farmers are trying to figure out how much they'll have to invest, or need to borrow, to buy seeds and other supplies to plant in the spring. A guarantee of federal payments on the way could help them get financing.   \n   But John Kippley, a farmer near Aberdeen, S.D., who also owns a tax preparation company, worries it's too little too late.   \"Banks are really nervous right now because they don't know what's going to happen,\" says Kippley, who is 80. \"Is he [Trump] going to put more tariffs on? Or is he going to less up on the tariffs? It just feels like the foreign countries don't like us anymore.\"   The fate of the farm economy is especially consequential with next year's midterm elections approaching. Farm states like South Dakota, home to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, have long been strongholds for Trump and the Republican majority in Congress.\n",

Today's top stories   The Senate is set to vote today on two health policy plans — one from Democrats and one from Republicans — aimed at reducing costs for individuals purchasing health insurance on Healthcare.gov. Meanwhile, some House Republicans want to force a vote to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act, which are set to expire in less than three weeks. They warn that Republican leaders risk losing voters and the majority if they let the subsidies expire without a replacement.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The dome of the U.S. Capitol Building is visible on the Hill in Washington, DC.\n                \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Win McNamee/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Republicans hold a small Senate majority, and because the bills need 60 votes to pass, NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin tells Up First that neither option will likely move forward. This is unwelcome news for people who are currently navigating open enrollment and are hoping for some relief. Simmons-Duffin spoke with Ellen Allen of Charleston, W.Va., yesterday, who said she enrolled in a bronze plan without vision and dental coverage. This plan costs Allen a monthly premium of $1,967.50, which is four times this year's cost for a plan that covers less. Polling suggests that the enhanced subsidies are quite popular across party lines, according to Simmons-Duffin. She predicts it's unlikely the votes will be the end of the story, and that Congress may continue to work toward a solution.   \n   The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point yesterday in a 9-3 vote. The Fed made its decision in an effort to support the weakening job market. Stubborn inflation and delayed economic data complicated the decision-making process. The rate cut came as a relief to investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped nearly 500 points.    🎧 Fed policymakers say in updated forecasts that they expect to cut interest rates just once more in 2026. Inflation has come down significantly, but it still remains above the Fed's 2% target, according to NPR's Scott Horsley. The president's tariffs have pushed up the price of imported goods. Although Fed officials don't believe tariffs will have a long-lasting effect on inflation, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell says they are not taking any chances. Powell says the best way to help with affordability is not only to get inflation down but also to ensure a robust job market.   President Trump said yesterday that U.S. forces seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela. Attorney General Pam Bondi released a video showing what appear to be U.S. forces and the Coast Guard rappelling from a helicopter onto the tanker. Congress is demanding answers about U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats, particularly in regards to a Sept. 2 incident where the military killed two men who survived initial strikes. Adm. Alvin Holsey, who oversaw the strikes, is stepping down this week.    \n   🎧 Officials have not provided many details publicly about Holsey's departure, but it is unusual for a top commander to leave one year into a typical three-year assignment, Steve Walsh of NPR network station WHRO says. Holsey appeared in a closed-door meeting before lawmakers this week to address concerns about the ongoing boat strikes. Reports hint that he was diplomatic in his messaging, Walsh says. Meanwhile, lawmakers' concerns remain as they continue to demand video of the Sept. 2 strike and the administration's legal rationale for carrying out around 22 strikes on alleged drug boats, which have killed 87 people.

But overhunting and habitat loss have led to their decline over the decades. Now, black bear sightings have increased in the state, and researchers believe their populations are growing elsewhere as well. While West Texas is celebrating the bears' return, their presence has posed challenges and concerns as they venture into neighborhoods, enter yards and threaten livestock and pets. Here's how some states are coping:    🐻 In states like Montana and Colorado, residents install bear-resistant dumpsters and trash bins. In some cases, they may use alarm systems or sprinklers to try to startle bears.🐻 Wildlife biologists stress that residents should remove food and anything that could attract hungry bears to their area.🐻 Biologists are also working to prepare people to live with black bears and educate them in the hope of reducing bear-human conflicts.   \n   3 things to know before you go   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Involution, an obscure term used in agricultural economics, leapt from the pages of academia into the Chinese meme world, then became part of Chinese government policymaking.\n                \n                    Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"Involution,\" an obscure term used in agricultural economics, is NPR's \"Word of the Week.\" Here's how it leaped from academia into Chinese meme culture — and how it ultimately influenced government policymaking.This week's Far-Flung Postcard series takes you to a food stand in the one-horse town of Marikavalasa in India, where working women go to enjoy a treat and unwind in the evening before returning to the grind.Sophie Kinsella, the author of the massively popular Shopaholic book series, has died at the age of 55.

This was despite months of pressure from President Trump.   \n\n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  For the first time, Republican state lawmakers have voted down President Trump's call for congressional redistricting. The vote happened in Indiana today. The state Senate there defeated a plan to redraw the voting map in a way that could have flipped two House seats that are now held by Democrats. This was despite months of pressure from Trump, who's been pushing Republican-led states to redistrict and help the party hold on to the House in next year's midterm elections. We're joined now by Ben Thorpe from WFYI at the Capitol building in Indianapolis. Hi, Ben.BEN THORPE, BYLINE: Hi.CHANG: OK, so tell us about the debate and the vote in the state Senate today.THORPE: So there have been months of pressure from Washington and back-and-forth over how the senators were going to vote. I think it's worth emphasizing that here in Indiana, they are overwhelmingly Republican. There were protesters against redistricting that you could hear from inside the Senate chamber today, and looming over everything was this pressure from the Trump administration. Here's one of the Republicans who opposed the new voting map, State Senator Spencer Deery.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SPENCER DEERY: And as long as I have breath, I will use my voice to resist a federal government that attempts to bully, direct and control this state or any state. Giving the federal government more power is not conservative.THORPE: Opponents also noted that states usually redistrict early in the decade after the census comes in. Republicans just passed the current map in 2021. And Democrats - there are only 10 in the Senate - said the new map would have split up voters in Indianapolis in ways that would weaken the voting power of Black communities and could be illegal racial gerrymandering.CHANG: OK. And in the end, the vote was 31 against and 19 in favor - is that right?THORPE: That's correct.CHANG: So what was the case that Republicans in favor of redistricting making (ph)?THORPE: So Republicans in favor of this new map have pointed to Democratic states where they see gerrymandering taking place and have argued that Indiana has a responsibility to try an even the playing field for Republicans. Part of their concern has been that if Democrats are able to regain control of the House it's going to be a setback for the MAGA agenda and could lead to another impeachment effort against Trump. Here's Republican State Senator Mike Young.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE YOUNG: Only a handful of districts throughout the United States will determine who controls Congress, and we may or may not do our part today to keep our nation in the hands of Republicans.THORPE: So Republicans basically saw the two Democratic congressional seats in the state as something that they could redistrict to give Republicans that edge.CHANG: And what was President Trump doing specifically to try to push this redistricting through?THORPE: There was a lot of pressure. President Trump has been calling out Republican senators on social media, has threatened to support primary challenges against any lawmaker who is in support of this map. So it's been really tense. And then in recent weeks, several senators reported anonymous threats against them. Some said police had been called out to their homes with false reports of swatting attacks that could have been really dangerous.CHANG: Wow, OK. So then overall, where does Trump's redistricting push stand at this moment?THORPE: Republicans still have a few seats' lead in this nationwide redistricting race. They redistricted in Texas, North Carolina and Missouri. Democrats have only counted so far in California. But other Republican states - Kansas and Florida - have considered it, and we'll see if they're watching what happened here in Indiana today.CHANG: That is Ben Thorpe from WFYI. Thank you so much, Ben.THORPE: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF HI-TEK SONG, \"ALL I NEED IS YOU\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

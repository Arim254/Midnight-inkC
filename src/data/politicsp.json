Whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen, but he knew nothing about it. And would you leave it at that? You don't have to embarrass our guest by asking a question.\"   The CIA concluded the crown prince approved the 2018 operation that killed and dismembered Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Turkey, but Salman maintained he had no knowledge of the attack, which he's called \"heinous\" and \"unjustifiable.\"   \n   On Tuesday, he said that his country has \"improved our system to be sure that nothing happened like that. And it's painful, and it's a huge mistake, and we are doing our best that this doesn't happen again.\"   Trump also dismissed questions about a conflict of interest regarding his family's business ties to Saudi Arabia while hosting Salman as president. He said that he has \"nothing to do\" with the family business and added that while he helped build a successful business, he \"decided to leave that success behind and make America very successful.\"   The two men touted a deal between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia that would bring hundreds of billions in investment into the United States in exchange for access to key military and technology assets for the Gulf nation.   After a trip to Saudi Arabia in May, the White House announced the Middle Eastern country had made a $600 billion \"commitment to invest in the United States.\" During the meeting inside the Oval Office on Tuesday, Salman said Saudi Arabia is going to invest more than that.   \"We are going to increase that $600 billion to almost $1 trillion of investment — real investment and real opportunity,\" Salman said about deals related to technology, including artificial intelligence.   \n   It's unclear if that meant Saudi Arabia plans to invest $1 trillion directly or if Salman believes the investment will grow to be worth that much. The crown prince has expressed that Saudi Arabia has particular interest in AI.   On defense, Trump and Salman reiterated plans for the U.S. to sell F-35s to Saudi Arabia. But Trump said he doesn't think Israel will be concerned about the deal. In fact, he believes the exact opposite, stating \"they're going to be very happy.\" Trump also said he could see a formal civil nuclear deal with Saudi Arabia happening eventually but \"it's not urgent.\"   When it came to the Abraham Accords, a set of agreements that established diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab states that Saudi Arabia is currently not a part of, Salman didn't directly say whether or not the country would join. Salman said he believes having relations in the region is \"a good thing, and we want to be part of the core, but we want also to be sure that we secure a clear path of two-state solution,\" referring to Palestinian statehood.   Salman said they had a \"healthy discussion\" with President Trump on the topic and that \"we're going to work on that to be sure that we can prepare the right situation as soon as possible to have that.\" Trump added a conversation on a two-state solution would be discussed further as well.   Salman's trip to the White House isn't over just yet. A dinner is planned this evening at the White House following today's meetings.\n",

Greg Abbott has quickly appealed to the Supreme Court a ruling that the redistricting passed by lawmakers at the urging of President Trump was based on racial gerrymandering.   \"Any claim that these maps are discriminatory is absurd and unsupported by the testimony offered during ten days of hearings,\" Abbott, a Republican, said in a statement. \"This ruling is clearly erroneous and undermines the authority the U.S. Constitution assigns to the Texas Legislature by imposing a different map by judicial edict.\"   A three-judge panel had earlier Tuesday placed a temporary block on the map that Republican lawmakers passed this summer and ordered the state to use the district maps from the last two elections.   \n   The map that was overruled had been drawn to give Republicans an advantage in flipping as many as five House seats held by Democrats.    \"To be sure, politics played a role in drawing the 2025 Map. But it was much more than just politics. Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map,\" wrote the majority from a three-judge panel.   The panel heard a trial on the case in October. The plaintiffs included several civil rights groups and individuals.   The ruling is a blow to Trump and the Republicans in a nationwide redistricting race that began in Texas this summer.   Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate, also said he would appeal the ruling on the \"Big Beautiful Map\" which he called \"entirely legal\" in a statement.   Democrats praised the court ruling. \"Race was always a driving factor and a driving factor to make it harder for minority Texans,\" said Texas Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher in an interview. \"This map was drawn to make it harder for them to have an impact in elections.\"   \n   The court's decision, in a 2-1 ruling, comes at a pivotal moment. Around the country, Trump is pressing Republican state lawmakers to reshape congressional voting maps to hold the party's slim majority in the House and support his agenda.   Using their heavy Republican majority in the legislature, Texas lawmakers passed a map in August designed to help their party grow its ranks in the 2026 elections for the U.S. House.   The process gained national attention when Democrats in the legislature fled the state for over two weeks to delay a vote and Republican leaders threatened to arrest them. Democrats argued the new map weakened the voting power of Latino and Black communities.   \n   The redistricting in Texas also prompted California Democrats to act. This month California voters passed an initiative allowing redistricting that could help Democrats win five seats in that state.   Was it partisan gerrymandering or racial gerrymandering?    Republicans in the Texas Legislature passed the map saying it was designed to improve their party's chances of winning five congressional seats. They noted that, unlike in some states, the law in Texas does not prohibit redistricting for partisan advantage and that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that federal courts could not intervene when it's done.   But partisan gerrymandering can often overlap with racial gerrymandering, which is illegal. Opponents of the map argued in court that it intentionally diminished the voting power of minority communities.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Texas state Sen. Sarah Eckhardt, a Democrat, right, questions Republican Sen. Phil King during debate in August over the Republican-backed district map that a federal court blocked and called a racial gerrymander on Tuesday.\n                \n                    Eric Gay/AP/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Eric Gay/AP/AP\n    \n\n   \n   The 160-page opinion was written by District Judge Jeffrey V. Brown, who was appointed by Trump during his first term as president. His ruling drew upon statements and contradictions in what Republican lawmakers said as the maps were passed.   A letter the Department of Justice wrote to encourage the redistricting, ended up being grounds the court used to block the effort.   The judges noted that when Gov. Abbott originally called lawmakers into session to draw the map, he cited a letter from justice department officials criticizing districts that had majority non-white voting populations as \"racial gerrymanders.\" In other words, the letter implied the districts as they stood gave non-white voters an advantage and that had to be reversed.   Eventually, Texas Republicans said the map was not intended to correct for a racial tilt but for partisan gain.   That letter put lawmakers, who for years had denied their use of race when making maps, in \"a difficult spot\" according to University of Texas at Austin political scientist Josh Blank, because they were \"ultimately saying opposite things.\"   Brown's ruling criticized the construction of the letter itself, which was sent by Harmeet Dhillon, head of the Justice Department's civil rights division. \"It's challenging to unpack the DOJ Letter because it contains so many factual, legal, and typographical errors,\" Brown wrote.   \n   \"This decision is a rebuke of Donald Trump and to some degree a rebuke of lawmakers in Texas,\" said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political scientist with the University of Houston. \"They think the process was flawed and the Department of Justice was not credible in their legal arguments.\"   Rep. Gene Wu, Democratic leader in the Texas House, said Tuesday's ruling shows the courts still hold true to American principles.   \"The striking down of the maps is fundamentally a sign that the courts still believe in the core principles of this country: That one man, one vote idea is something that is absolute and must be kept up,\" Wu said.   Around the country, Republicans have more options for redistricting seats their way than Democrats do, in part because the GOP controls more state legislatures. Usually, states redistrict at the start of the decade after the national census.   At the behest of Trump, lawmakers in Missouri and North Carolina passed new maps that could help the GOP win a seat in each state. Ohio drew a map that analysts say gives Republicans a slight advantage in a few seats.   For Democrats, in addition to the five seats that could be gained in California, a court-ordered redistricting in Utah could help Democrats win a seat there. And Virginia Democrats have started a process that could yield two seats in that state.      Blaise Gainey covers state politics for The Texas Newsroom.

The flight landed near the Polish border in the early hours on Monday. Since Russia's invasion in 2022, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has deported 105 Ukrainians in total, with 13 in the last quarter of 2024, according to the latest data available in ICE's publicly available tracker.   \n   The Trump administration originally wanted to send 80 people on the flight, according to Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine's ambassador to the United States. That original list also included at least one person that Ukraine had previously been unable to claim as a citizen of the country.   It wasn't immediately clear why only 50 people out of the group of 80 ended up in Ukraine.   Immigration lawyers have raised concerns that those deported to Ukraine could be conscripted to fight in the war. All men in Ukraine from ages 25 to 60 are eligible to be drafted, though some women and younger people have also volunteered. While U.S. law permits deportations, including to countries that people are not originally from, domestic and international laws prohibit deportations to place where someone may face violence, persecution or torture.   \n   The Trump administration has brokered deals with countries with notorious human rights records or who are facing conflict, including with South Sudan, Libya, Eswatini, Rwanda and El Salvador, to receive deportees from the United States, as it seeks to ramp up mass deportations.   Six of the 8 men deported to South Sudan over the summer are still there, according to their lawyers, while the Associated Press reported that those sent to the other countries have been imprisoned there.   \"Currently, border guards have ensured their registration in the border relation for entry into Ukraine in accordance with the rules established by law,\" Andrii Demchenko, spokesman for Ukraine's State Border Service, told NPR. \"It is worth noting that Ukraine accepts its citizens in any case.\"   \n   The spokesperson said Ukraine would accept any of its own citizens who had been deported from the U.S.   The embassy did not answer questions regarding what would happen to people deported to the country.   \"It should be noted that deportation is a widely used legal mechanism provided for by the immigration laws of most countries around the world,\" Stefanishyna said in a statement provided to NPR. \"It is a routine procedure applied to all foreign nationals and stateless persons who violate the terms of their stay in the United States, regardless of their nationality.\"   \n   One migrant first profiled by NPR fought immediate deportation   Eric Lee, an immigration lawyer with a client on the flight, said the detainees include people who have lived in the U.S. since they were children.   \"Many have U.S. citizen spouses and children. Some do not even speak Ukrainian, and others are not even Ukrainian citizens, having been born in the Soviet Union before Ukraine existed as a separate country,\" Lee said in an interview.   One of Lee's clients, Roman Surovtsev, was recently transferred through several detention centers in Texas in preparation for the deportation to Ukraine, even as his attorneys continue to fight his removal in court.   \n   According to Justice Department court filings, the administration had intended to put him on the flight. NPR confirmed he ended up not being deported after an immigration court stayed his deportation hours before the flight, while his case was reopened in immigration court.   Surovtsev, who lived in Dallas with his U.S. citizen wife and two children, was born in the Soviet Union. He came to the U.S. as a refugee, but lost his green card when he was a teenager when he pleaded guilty to a carjacking in California.   \n   As NPR has previously reported, the U.S. previously tried and failed to deport Surovtsev to Ukraine, which was unable to provide the necessary travel documents for deportation. For years, Surovtsev completed yearly check-ins with Immigration and Customs Enforcement until he was detained during his visit in August. ICE then tried to give him deportation documents, but those papers were in Ukrainian, a language he does not speak.   \n   His team of lawyers was able to vacate his conviction and move forward with reinstating his green card. Still, Surovtsev has remained in detention.   U.S. District Judge Ada Brown, who was appointed by President Trump, originally blocked Surovtsev's removal earlier this month through Jan. 13 but reversed her decision a few days later, surprising Surovtsev's attorneys.   \"He is likely to receive his green card once again very soon. And he has also not been given the opportunity to express his fear of being deported to an active war zone,\" Lee said.   A DHS spokesperson said in a statement that Surovtesev has already received due process.   \"He received full due process and was ordered removed by an immigration judge on November 4, 2014 — over a decade ago,\" the spokesperson wrote. \"Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, if you break the law, you will face the consequences. Criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the U.S.\"\n",

Many commenters, including some of Trump's own supporters, hated the idea. They complained that it would result in Americans being in debt for their entire adult lives, essentially renting from a bank. They complained that this type of mortgage would explode the amount of interest homeowners would have to pay over the lifetime of their loans. They complained that borrowers would be stuck paying interest-only payments for many years and be prevented from actually paying down their principal and building equity in their homes.   \n   \"It will ultimately reward the banks, mortgage lenders, and home builders while people pay far more in interest over time and die before they ever pay off their home,\" posted Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green (R-Ga.). \"In debt forever, in debt for life!\"   President Trump \"is creating generational debt,\" said Josh Johnson on The Daily Show. \"They're going to be fighting to get out of grandma's will. Grandkids will be like, 'I barely knew her!'\" (Side note: Josh Johnson is very funny. I'm a fan.)   The uproar over the 50-year mortgage idea reached such a high pitch that apparently the White House was furious with the administration official who pitched President Trump the idea, according to reporting from Politico.   Sure, it won't solve our housing affordability problem. But is a 50-year mortgage really such a crazy idea?   \"It's not quite as outlandish as it sounds,\" says John Campbell, an economist at Harvard University.   \"Honestly, I kind of think it's a fine idea,\" says Eric Zwick, an economist at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business. \"It's not obviously so different from a 30-year fixed mortgage.\"   The 50 vs The 30   First of all, the reality is most homeowners ditch their mortgage well before its end date. Some refinance. Others move.   \n   In America, unlike some other countries, including the UK, you can't take your mortgage with you if you sell your house. So when people sell their house and move, they end their mortgages.   The typical American homeowner spends less than 12 years in their home, according to a Redfin analysis of the U.S. Census data. That's actually high compared to recent history. Back in the early 2000s, Americans typically spent only about seven years in their houses.   \" Most people will not have that 50-year mortgage product for that length of time,\" says Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist of Redfin. \"I think in a world where this product exists, a lot of people might sign up for it initially and then try to refinance later.\"   In other words, the 50-year mortgage would not be a 50-year trap. It would basically serve as another option on the menu for homebuyers looking to finance their homes. And, because you have longer to pay off the loan, it comes with the benefit of having somewhat lower monthly payments. Maybe that could help some secure their dream house or reap the benefits of investing in the housing market.    \"I think affordability is a concern in the housing market,\" Zwick says. \"And one element is the down payment, but another element is the monthly payment. And a longer duration mortgage is gonna lower the monthly payment.\"   And, sure, there are real drawbacks to this sort of financing, including especially a much higher interest bill over the life of the loan and an extended period where homeowners aren't paying down their principal and building equity. But those same issues also arise with the 30-year fixed mortgage, albeit to a lesser degree.   And Americans apparently love the 30-year mortgage. More than 90% of American mortgage holders have one!   The American mortgage market is weird   The fact that so many American homeowners have long-term, fixed rate mortgages, and they're able to basically refinance pretty easily whenever they want, makes the U.S. mortgage market pretty weird compared to most other countries.   \n   We won't get into the complicated history here (we might actually do a Planet Money episode on this history in the future). But, for now, we'll say the 30-year mortgages date back to the Depression era. And they're fundamentally a creature of government intervention. The government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy mortgages from private lenders, allowing them to offload (and socialize) the risks associated with lending large sums of money for decades at fixed interest rates.   Without this intervention, the 30-year mortgage would probably not be so ubiquitous. I mean, think about it. Would you want to lend someone hundreds of thousands of dollars for decades and freeze the amount they will pay you for providing them with that money? What if they lose their jobs or die? What if interest rates skyrocket and you can find much more favorable terms for lending out that money? And then, to boot, if interest rates fall, the borrower can just walk away from that loan and get a new mortgage at any time when economic conditions are more favorable to them? I mean, yikes. No thanks.   A long time ago, Planet Money interviewed financial journalist Bethany McLean about 30-year fixed mortgages, and she described them as \"a financial Frankenstein's monster\" from the perspective of lenders.   Without an important role for the government in backing these loans, \"I don't think any rational bank would offer this product,\" says David Berger, an economist at Duke University.   \" You need the public sector to play an important role for really long duration mortgages to be viable in the financial system,\" says Joseph Gyourko, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.   It helps explain why this sort of mortgage system is so rare in the world.   The Pros of long-term, fixed-rate mortgages    There are some clear benefits of the weird mortgage system we have in the United States. One is lower monthly payments because homebuyers can pay off their loans over 30 years. Another is homebuyers are given an incredible ability to freeze their housing costs in stone and then refinance when it suits them.   \n   Several of the economists we spoke to had 30-year mortgages themselves, and they had refinanced when rates sank below 3 percent a few years ago. They were very nice people, but I hate them now. (I bought a house more recently and the mortgage rate is close to 7 percent).   Anyways, the ability to freeze rates and then refinance later if the opportunity arises is clearly a huge benefit to homebuyers. It offers predictability on your housing costs. And, especially nice, a fixed-rate mortgage basically shields you from inflation and its accompanying higher interest rates. Everything else may get more expensive, but your housing payment actually falls in real terms when there's inflation!   The Cons of long-term, fixed-rate mortgages   That said, as we already alluded to, both 30-year and hypothetical 50-year mortgages come with costs: they tend to have higher interest rates than adjustable rate mortgages and you have a longer period upfront paying interest and not actually paying down your loan much.   But there's more.   If the housing market gets dicey and prices start plummeting, having a large outstanding loan at a fixed interest rate can create serious problems. Gyourko, the economist at Wharton, says long-term, fixed-rate mortgages increase the probability that you can go underwater on your home, a situation where you owe more on your house than it's worth.   \" The borrower on a really long duration loan — 30 or 50 — does not build equity very quickly at all,\" Gyourko says. \" There's a risk that if there's a severe drop in house prices, you go underwater.\"   Going underwater is a nightmare. If you sell, it means the money you get won't cover your debt. It gets much harder to refinance, meaning you're stuck with a higher interest rate than you could otherwise get in a situation where the housing market tanks.   If you have a fixed-interest rate and the housing market tanks, \"your house price goes down and you're kind of stuck,\" says Berger, the economist at Duke. \"No one is gonna lend to you when you're underwater. If you had an adjustable rate, your rate would've just dropped automatically,\" and maybe that would help you make your housing payments and not lose your house.   \n   \"And are you more likely or less likely to be laid off if house prices drop a lot? Answer: more likely,\" Gyourko says. \"So you run that risk of those two events coinciding, and then you've lost a huge amount of your personal wealth.\"   Depending on the state of the economy, the direction of interest rates, and your financial circumstances, it might not make sense to fix your interest rate. Actually, that may be the case right now. Interest rates spiked in 2022 and 2023 and have already started to come down, and many expect them to go down further, especially if the economy enters a recession.   \" Right now, I think it does make more sense for people to get an adjustable rate mortgage,\" Fairweather, the chief economist at Redfin, says.   Adjustable-rate mortgages typically start with lower interest rates than fixed rate mortgages. Fairweather says you can think about the choice to buy a long-term, fixed-rate mortgage instead of an adjustable rate mortgage as effectively paying extra for insurance against future interest rate hikes. And, just like the standard advice for buying any other kind of insurance, \"you don't really want to get insurance if you can afford to self-insure,\" she says. In other words, if you think you could afford the possibility that interest rates spike in the near future, it probably makes sense to get an adjustable rate mortgage.   \" So if you get the adjustable rate mortgage, what I would advise is to make sure you have some room in your budget left over for when the mortgage rate resets potentially at a higher level so that you're not hit with costs that you aren't able to pay,\" Fairweather says. \"But if you could take that savings and you know, put it in your savings account, then you'll probably end up a-okay with an adjustable rate mortgage and actually save money compared to the fixed rate.\"   \n   Fixed-rate mortgages may distort our economy   But there are other, economy-wide issues with having so many mortgage-holders with long-term fixed rates.   One is that the government involvement in the housing market that makes our system of widespread 30-year mortgages possible can occasionally result in big problems for taxpayers, especially if regulators aren't vigilant in preventing shady loan practices. Just see what happened during the global financial crisis back in the late 2000s.   \"The worst possible situation is what happened in the global financial crisis when Fannie and Freddie were basically insolvent, were put on the treasury's balance sheet and to this day remain there,\" Gyourko says.   Another problem with America's weird system of ubiquitous fixed-rate mortgages is that it may weaken the Fed's ability to juice the economy or lower inflation when needed (aka conduct monetary policy).   That's because fixed-rate mortgage holders are shielded from interest rate changes. If everyone had an adjustable rate mortgage, the Fed could maybe more easily juice the economy by lowering people's monthly payments, nudging them to spend more in the economy. That said, if interest rates go low enough, it will induce many American homeowners to refinance, lower their payments, and potentially goad them to increase their spending and boost the economy.   In inflationary times though, when the Fed needs to bring down spending in the economy, the Fed's job may be tougher and more distortionary to the economy. If everyone were on adjustable rates, the Fed could just raise rates and, boom, homeowners would probably start spending less and inflation would come down. But most American homeowners are shielded from rate increases, so it's new homebuyers — often younger people — who feel more of the pain. Some argue that's unfair.   Speaking of unfairness, Harvard's John Campbell points out that maximizing your personal wealth in our weird mortgage system relies on considerable financial literacy, and populations that are poorer and less educated tend to be less financially literate. So this system results in greater inequality.   \n   \"A lot of people don't know when to refinance and they just don't do it,\" Campbell says. \"And there's some very troubling evidence that, in this country, black and Hispanic borrowers are much slower to refinance than white borrowers.\" The result, he says, is they tend to pay higher interest rates.   There's another problem with our system: lock in. This has been talked about in recent years. There are tons of homeowners out there who now have rock-bottom interest rates on their mortgages — like, ahem, many of the very financially literate economists I spoke to — and they're reluctant to move.   Lock-in may be one reason why American home prices have been stubbornly high over the past few years, even as interest rates have spiked. Other countries, where adjustable rate mortgages are more the norm, have seen their housing prices dip a lot more in recent years.   \" I think that their housing markets are more reactive to their overall economies,\" Fairweather says. \"So in other places where there's more adjustable rate mortgages, when interest rates go up, that means that homeowners have a reason to sell because their payments are going up. And if they can't afford them or they don't want to pay them, then they'll put their homes on the market.  In our housing market, that doesn't happen. There is this unequal treatment between first time home buyers and existing homeowners. And it really benefits long-term homeowners.\"   Even more, economists believe that the lock-in that fixed mortgages create is bad for the economy. Many people may be refusing jobs where they could be more productive because they don't want to move.   The real fix for housing affordability   So, yeah, many of the problems identified with the 50-year mortgage idea are also present with the 30-year mortgage.   The real motivation for this idea is to enable more Americans to buy houses. With high prices and higher interest rates than a few years ago, many Americans are priced out.   \n   The economists we spoke to all stressed that this new financial product will not solve the fundamental problem of housing affordability. To do that, we need to start building a lot more homes. Some even said that by juicing demand with this new financial product and not increasing supply, this proposal could actually make housing prices go higher, contributing to the problem.   \"Proposals to help home buyers — whether it's this 50-year mortgage or whether it's Kamala Harris's proposal in her presidential campaign to give money to first time homebuyers — the main beneficiaries are actually the people selling houses,\" Campbell says. \"Because given the supply, if you make it easier for buyers, they're bidding against each other for the same supply. The price is gonna go up. The winner is gonna be the person selling.\"   So, yeah, we need to build more homes. But, in that world, maybe a 50-year mortgage would have some benefits for some people. Of course, they will need to know the facts about this financial product and make sure it's the right product for them.   Berger, the economist at Duke, recommends that the government invest more in helping Americans become more financially literate about mortgages and provide better information about alternative financial options to the 30-year mortgage. This stuff is complicated!\n",

    "body": "\n      The House and Senate voted overwhelmingly to approve a bill that would compel the Department of Justice to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  In a watershed moment on Capitol Hill, both the House and Senate approved a bill to release the Jeffrey Epstein files. Nearly every House member voted yes, and then hours later, the Senate set up a process to unanimously approve it. The rapid-fire progress is a far cry from when Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie began pushing for the bill months ago.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)THOMAS MASSIE: We fought the president, the attorney general, the FBI director, the speaker of the House and the vice president to get this win.DETROW: President Trump has said he would sign the measure, marking a huge reversal. Joining us now is NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales. Hey, Claudia.CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Hey, Scott.DETROW: So Republicans rarely go against President Trump's wishes. How did this come together for something that was so controversial for Republicans up until just a few days ago?GRISALES: Right. This dragged out much of the year, and this sudden resolution was striking. First, a little bit of background. Massie worked alongside California Democrat Ro Khanna, starting what's known as a discharge petition four months ago. This is an arcane procedure that skips committees and leadership to force a floor vote with signatures from a simple House majority, and they hit that mark last week. Trump fought them all the way until this past weekend as momentum shifted in their favor, and it set the stage for the House to pass it 427 to 1. And now the Senate's moving pretty fast. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer got unanimous consent to pass the bill automatically after the House sends it over. Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters tonight he expects that to happen tomorrow morning.DETROW: Quick aside, Claudia. I did not know the Senate had the ability to pass bills automatically. I learned something today.GRISALES: Right. Exactly. And usually you see this happen with noncontroversial bills, bills that are low profile.DETROW: Yeah.GRISALES: This is exactly the opposite.DETROW: Right.GRISALES: So it was very remarkable, Republicans really wanting to turn the page on something that has taken up so much oxygen...DETROW: Let's...GRISALES: ...Here in Washington.DETROW: Let's talk more about that. President Trump did an abrupt about-face, said his party should vote for this bill, after fighting it for months and in a really intense way. How did Republicans on the Hill address that huge shift?GRISALES: Well, House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters he had major issues with the process, and he rejected claims this was a reversal.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE JOHNSON: Having now forced the vote, none of us want to go on record and in any way be accused of not being for maximum transparency.GRISALES: And he said he voted yes with a caveat. He expected the Senate to amend the bill to ensure survivors' names were redacted, among other concerns. But Thune told us tonight that wasn't needed, especially after this overwhelming House vote.DETROW: Epstein survivors were at the Capitol today. What did they have to say?GRISALES: They told harrowing stories of the abuse they suffered, and many asked Trump to stop injecting politics into this fight. That includes Jena-Lisa Jones, who was once a Trump supporter. Let's take a listen.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JENA-LISA JONES: I voted for you, but your behavior on this issue has been a national embarrassment.GRISALES: She said this fight has been distressing, as Trump has gone back and forth on releasing the files. And when the bill finally passed in the House, survivors in the gallery broke out in cheers and emotional applause.DETROW: Another big player here is Georgia Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a longtime ally of President Trump who pushed for this bill to move forward, and that led to a pretty high-profile rift.GRISALES: Right. After that clash, Greene faced a pipe bomb scare. Her son received a death threat. Today, she said she fought for Trump for six years and gave him her loyalty for free.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARJORIE GREENE: I've never owed him anything, but I fought for him for the policies and for America First. And he called me a traitor for standing with these women.GRISALES: And she says this fight has now torn the MAGA movement apart. And as a reminder, Trump and Republicans made releasing these files a top priority on the campaign trail last year, and Democrats have added fuel to this fire by pushing for this.DETROW: What happens next?GRISALES: President Trump is expected to sign the bill as soon as tomorrow. Then it'll be up to the Department of Justice to interpret what can and should be redacted and what can actually be released to the public. It's unclear how long that could take.DETROW: NPR's Claudia Grisales, thank you so much.GRISALES: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

He was believed to have abused many minors before his death in 2019. The Justice Department said earlier this year there was nothing worth releasing. People who doubt this include Annie Farmer, one of Epstein's accusers, who spoke yesterday on NPR's MORNING EDITION.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)ANNIE FARMER: There's a piece about accountability, wanting people that not just participated in these crimes, but also that allowed them, that funded them, that looked the other way. I think there's a reckoning for all of that that needs to happen. And so this idea that, no, there's nothing more to see here, we don't buy it.MARTÍNEZ: NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt is with us. Barbara, so how does this congressional action work?BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Well, it would compel the Justice Department to release all unclassified files. So that's records, documents, communications, all investigation materials, essentially, within 30 days, and that includes documents related to Epstein's death. As a reminder, the administration has already released thousands of files to the House Oversight Committee, documents that also include names of other people connected to Epstein, but there are still more files that haven't been made public. And there's renewed interest in this. Democrats on the panel recently released emails where Epstein told a journalist that President Trump, quote, \"knew about the girls,\" unquote, seemingly referring to the people Epstein was allegedly trafficking. The president has previously said he had a falling out with Epstein many years ago, and he has not been tied to any wrongdoing.MARTÍNEZ: All right. So say this passes the House, the files still would have a few steps to go before they're made public.SPRUNT: That's right. And there are a few question marks here. What is the scope of what's in these files? We know that the measure gives some latitude to the Justice Department to withhold or redact portions of them, including documents that could jeopardize active investigations. So could that lead to delays? President Trump has already called for an investigation into Epstein's alleged ties to prominent Democrats, for example. And another big question mark is the Senate. Will leadership bring this for a vote in that chamber? I think if there's a lot of support from Republicans in the House, it ups the chances of this moving in the Senate.MARTÍNEZ: So after the House, after the Senate, then it goes to President Trump's desk.SPRUNT: That's right. And he has said that he would sign it if it comes to his desk. But an interesting element in this - he already has the authority to direct the Justice Department to release documents. He did that in other cases with documents related to the investigations of the assassinations of the Kennedys and Martin Luther King Jr., for example. But that's not what's happening here. Instead, the House is forcing a vote that would compel the administration to release the documents. Big difference.MARTÍNEZ: Wondering, Barbara, what you make of that reversal from President Trump on whether Republicans should back the measure or not.SPRUNT: Yeah. That was a major U-turn. I think it speaks to how important this issue is to the base. I think it's notable that there was a pressure campaign from the White House to convince key Republicans, including some of his most vocal supporters, no less, not to sign the petition to force a vote on this. That didn't work, and to me, it shows that this is an area where the president doesn't have a firm grip on the House. I think the writing was on the wall that a lot of Republican House members were prepared to vote yes for this, with or without the White House's blessing. So the president's about-face could be a way of giving in to, you know, giving the go-ahead to something that was already coming.MARTÍNEZ: That's NPR's Barbara Sprunt. Thanks a lot.SPRUNT: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

During the rare rehearing of a Louisiana redistricting case in October, the court's conservative majority appeared inclined to weaken the Voting Rights Act's Section 2 protections against racial discrimination in the political mapmaking process.   Such a ruling could spark a new wave of congressional redistricting, especially in the South, where voting is often racially polarized and Section 2 has long prevented the dilution of Black minority voters' collective power. Without the current Section 2 protections, Republican-led southern states may undo districts where Black voters have a realistic opportunity of electing their preferred candidates, who are usually Democrats.   \n   This redrawing could give the GOP a sizable boost, as the party seeks to keep control of the House of Representatives.   \n   When the Supreme Court would release its decision is crucial. Time is running out to redo maps, which have to be finalized ahead of a state's filing deadline for candidates seeking to run in a primary election for the midterms.   \"The earlier the decision comes, the more likely the decision is before the date for candidates to declare that they're going to be running, and the more time there is for legislatures to meet and consider maps and redraw their maps,\" says Nick Stephanopoulos, a professor specializing in election law at Harvard Law School.   The next batch of filing deadlines arrives in December. Still, Stephanopoulos notes these cut-off dates are \"just products of state law.\"   \"If a state legislature that's hellbent on gerrymandering wants to do so, it wouldn't be especially surprising if that same legislature delayed the filing deadline, potentially even change the date of the primary election, in order to give themselves enough time to gerrymander,\" Stephanopoulos says.      \n      Last month, Louisiana's Republican-controlled legislature shifted the state's election calendar, pushing its cutoff date for candidate declarations from January to February, and the spring primary from April to May.   The change could take advantage of a possible earlier-than-usual decision from the Supreme Court, which typically releases major rulings in June. Louisiana had asked the justices for a decision in the state's redistricting case early next year, given the calendar crunch.   In Alabama, which has a January deadline ahead of a May primary election, a Republican state lawmaker is proposing to allow a special primary to be held by August if a change to a voting map is \"made at a time too late to be accommodated during the normal primary election schedule.\"   There's no definitive list of districts protected by Section 2   Which other states may rush to respond to a weakening of redistricting requirements under the Voting Rights Act's Section 2 is hard to predict, says Michael Li, a redistricting expert at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's law school.   \n   To begin with, Li explains, there is no definitive list of Section 2 districts that could be affected by the Supreme Court's ruling because states usually don't explain their reasoning for drawing the boundaries of a voting district the way they do. To come up with a list, \"you'd have to go district by district and do a case-by-case assessment of whether there actually is Section 2 liability or not,\" Li says.   And some states may start claiming a district was drawn to get in line with Section 2 even if the law would not have required an opportunity district for racial minority voters.   \"It may just be an excuse to get rid of heavily minority districts even if there's not a legal obligation to do so,\" Li adds.   \n   On the other hand, some Republican-led states may want to try to keep Section 2 districts that are Democratic-leaning in place.   \"There are many places in the country where getting rid of Section 2 districts would make neighboring Republican districts much more competitive. And that may not be what Republicans want,\" Li says. \"It's more efficient for Republicans to have a heavily Black, and thus heavily Democratic, district to sop up as many of these high-turnout Black voters as possible.\"   Another wild card amid the ongoing mid-decade gerrymandering fight is how Democratic-led states would react in a redistricting world without Section 2's current requirements.   \"If blue states elsewhere observe Republicans massively gerrymandering, flipping 10 to 15 minority-opportunity districts and giving Republicans a big structural advantage in the battle for the U.S. House, I think there's going to be enormous pressure to respond to offset those gerrymanders in blue states,\" says Stephanopoulos at Harvard Law School. \"At this point, the only remaining way to do that is by weakening some of the districts that are now held by minority-preferred candidates in blue states.\"   \n   Edited by Benjamin Swasey\n",

That means that migrants' use of safety net programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or Medicare, could be considered when determining whether they should be granted further legal status, such as a green card.   Homeland Security Department officials released a new proposed regulation this week that's set to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday. It would rescind a Biden-era version of the public charge rule, and expand the scope of what public benefits may be considered by immigration officers, to any social or health services people may use.   \n   \"Rescission would restore broader discretion to evaluate all pertinent facts and align with long-standing policy that aliens in the United States should be self-reliant and government benefits should not incentivize immigration,\" the proposal states.   Advocates were quick to criticize the proposal, arguing its new broad scope is too vague and could disincentivize the use of the benefits by immigrants who need them and qualify for them.   \"This dangerous proposal puts the nation's health and economic wellbeing at risk,\" said Adriana Cadenas, executive director of the Protecting Immigrant Families Coalition. \"By creating chaos and confusion, it deters lawfully present immigrants and U.S. citizens from seeking health care and help they need and qualify for under federal law.\"   \n   Politics of social safety net programs   The proposed regulation from DHS comes as the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are making false statements of rampant fraud in immigrants' use of social safety net programs.   People without legal status do not have access to SNAP, the healthcare marketplace, Medicaid and other public benefits.   Still, Congress recently applied further restrictions stripping health coverage and SNAP access from a range of lawfully present immigrants including refugees, asylum seekers and those with other humanitarian protections. It also cut funding from states that use their own funds to provide health care regardless of citizenship status.   \n   The new rule proposed this week takes a broad approach that would also consider state-funded benefits in the review of immigrants' applications.   U.S. citizen children of noncitizens are still eligible for these programs.   \n   Executive order targeted benefits   In February, Trump issued an executive order to end \"all taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal aliens.\"   Trump's order is part of the administration's broader political messaging about Democrats and immigration. It came despite the lack of data to support the idea.   Only about 1% of over- or underpayments for SNAP were related to eligibility for citizenship. This data also does not indicate those without legal status were fraudulently using the program.   \n   Trump in his first term had expanded the scope of benefits that could count as a \"public charge\" on someone's immigration record, and therefore make it harder for them to receive permanent status.   Public health providers said the regulation at the time created a chilling effect on immigrants being afraid to seek benefits they might have access to. The effect was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, when advocates said immigrants feared seeking health resources, such as getting medical care or using a food bank, out of concern that they would be considered a public charge for doing so.   \n   In 2022, the Biden administration unveiled a new rule affecting immigrants and benefits that was similar to the regulation before Trump's 2019 revision. It meant that using benefits such as the SNAP, housing aid or transportation vouchers would not count against green card applicants.\n",

Today's top stories   President Trump will host Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) at the White House today. It's his first visit since the 2018 killing of Washington Post journalist and Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul, which led to global condemnation.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is pictured during a meeting with the US secretary of state at Al Salam Palace in the Red Sea port of Jeddah on June 24, 2019.\n                \n                    Jacquelyn Martin/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jacquelyn Martin/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 The two leaders have business and security deals to announce, NPR's Aya Batrawy tells Up First. The defense pact would give Saudi Arabia guarantees that the U.S. would use military measures if necessary. MBS also wants advanced F-35 jets that currently only Israel flies in the Middle East. The Saudis are also seeking U.S. civilian nuclear technology and advanced AI chips, and in exchange, the crown prince says he is prepared to invest $600 billion in the U.S.   The U.N. Security Council yesterday adopted a U.S.-drafted resolution endorsing Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza and authorizing an international stabilization force for the territory.    🎧 The Security Council resolution only alludes to a possible pathway to Palestinian statehood, Michele Kelemen reports. Russia's Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya, who abstained in the vote, emphasized that the resolution shouldn't serve as a cover for the U.S. and Israel in controlling Gaza, or signal the end of a two-state solution.   \n   The House of Representatives is expected to vote today on a measure to release documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. If it passes, it will then be sent to the Senate. Trump informed reporters yesterday that the Senate could take up the bill and he would sign it if it passes. The measure would compel the Justice Department to release all of its files on Epstein within 30 days.    🎧 NPR's Barbara Sprunt says an interesting element to this process is that Trump has the authority to direct the Justice Department to release documents. The president has done this in other cases with documents such as investigations into the assassinations of the Kennedys and Martin Luther King Jr.   In a Louisiana redistricting case, the Supreme Court's conservative majority seemed inclined to weaken Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act in an October rehearing. Section 2 protects against racial discrimination in the political mapmaking process. Depending on the timing, a ruling of this stature could allow states to redraw congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, particularly in Republican-led southern states, potentially diluting Black voters' chances to elect preferred candidates, usually Democrats. Here's a deeper look into why this ruling is significant.

State lawmakers were considering how to make up a funding shortfall from Washington, D.C. where Republicans in Congress aimed to cut off federal funding to clinics that provide abortion.   Smith told the committee that she doesn't have health insurance and that Maine Family Planning's nonprofit clinics were her only source of health care.   \n   \"In the last four years I've received care there, not once did I have an abortion,\" Smith testified. \"I did, however, have access to STD and STI (sexually transmitted disease and infection) testing, referrals for thyroid testing and blood panels, pap smears, breast examinations, referrals for mammograms, and a premenstrual dysphoric disorder diagnosis. The last two I listed saved my life,\" she said.   Smith, who's 36, says she was inspired to testify and write an op-ed, because she's worried about what would happen if Maine Family Planning had to close in the face of deep federal funding cuts. \"I can't imagine what would happen to our communities if we lost such a keystone — that's what really fueled my fire,\" she says.   Maine Family Planning did get a year of additional funding from the state, but it also lost Medicaid revenue for one year with the passage of President Trump's tax and spending bill — a 20% hit to the organization's funding.   \n   The \"defund\" effort beyond Planned Parenthood   In Maine, abortion is legal and widely supported by the electorate. In a poll released by the Pew Research Center this summer, 72% of Mainers say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. The state legislature has moved to expand access to abortion care since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade three years ago.   Now, the Trump administration and congressional Republicans are using federal funding as a lever to restrict abortion access in states, like Maine, where it is legal and protected by state law.   \n   Republicans and anti-abortion rights activists have long sought to end Medicaid dollars flowing to Planned Parenthood for any reason, arguing that federal reimbursement even for unrelated services indirectly supports abortion in clinics that specialize in reproductive health. In July, they were finally able to accomplish that goal.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Maine Family Planning operates 18 clinics around the state, including this one in Augusta, Maine. It provides primary care in addition to a full range of reproductive health care.\n                \n                    Greta Rybus for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Greta Rybus for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   The provision in the law blocks federal Medicaid funds from being paid to reproductive health nonprofits that receive more than $800,000 in Medicaid payments in a year. It took effect when the bill was signed by President Trump on July 4. (Republican senators changed the timeline from a decade to a single year of defunding to comply with Senate rules.)   Very few organizations fit the $800,000+ description. Planned Parenthood is one of them, another is Health Imperatives in Massachusetts, and so is Maine Family Planning.   \"Where am I going to go?\"   About half of Maine Family Planning's patients are on Medicaid. The organization is no longer reimbursed for their visits.   That's about $2 million gone, says George Hill, Maine Family Planning's president and CEO.   \"That's difficult. You have to make some difficult decisions,\" he says. \"Either you generate more revenue, or you cut costs.\"   \n   On Oct. 1, the organization let patients know they would be ending primary care services at the end of the month at three clinics in the far reaches of the state: Houlton, Presque Isle and Ellsworth. That change affected nearly 1,000 patients, including patients on Medicaid and those with private insurance.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                George Hill, Maine Family Planning's president and CEO has worked in health care for almost 40 years. \"We have a mission,\" explains Hill, \"to make sure that the full range of sexual and reproductive health care is available to as many patients as possible.\"\n                \n                    Selena Simmons-Duffin/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Selena Simmons-Duffin/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"The day that our portal message went out [to patients], the phones just started ringing off the hook,\" says clinical services director Melissa Gray. \"It was the same message over and over again: 'Where am I going to go? You folks have helped me with things that nobody else had helped me with, I never felt like you were judging me. I don't want a different provider, I want to keep seeing you.'   \n   \"It was really heartbreaking and a hard couple of days for staff,\" she says.   Gray and her team spent all of October trying to connect those patients to new doctors, and making sure they were set up with enough refills of medications to last them when there were long waits before they could be seen by the new practice. Maine has a health care provider shortage, which made that task harder, she says. \"There already weren't enough providers — we were getting new patient requests all the time,\" she says. \"Now there's less.\"   The goal of scaling back primary care was to try to preserve family planning for longer. All 18 of their family planning clinics around the state are still open. \"We have a mission,\" explains Hill. \"And our mission is to make sure that the full range of sexual and reproductive health care is available to as many patients as possible.\"   They're still seeing Medicaid patients for sexual and reproductive health without getting paid for it.   A stack of billing sheets, just in case   One of their clinics is in Thomaston, Maine, a small town along the coast. Vanessa Shields-Haas is the nurse practitioner there. The clinic is bright and friendly, with colorful \"condom art\" on a bulletin board in the waiting room.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The rotating seasonal scenes in the waiting room at the Maine Family Planning clinic in Thomaston are crafted from colored condoms.  \"I think they're fun,\" nurse practitioner Vanessa Shields-Haas says. \"Patients love them.\"\n                \n                    Selena Simmons-Duffin/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Selena Simmons-Duffin/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Shields-Haas is infuriated by the funding cuts to Maine Family Planning and what they mean for her patients.   \"A lot of my patients — maybe they're working at a hotel or they're waiting tables, they're serving lobster rolls to hungry tourists, starting oyster farms,\" she says. \"These are people that are working really hard.\"   She does a lot for them: fertility treatments, biopsies, prescription refills, even vasectomies. And she's continued to do all those things for her patients covered by Medicaid without getting reimbursed.   \"We haven't been turning them away,\" she says. \"I fill out the billing sheets and we stack them up in the event that we could be reimbursed possibly in the future.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Vanessa Shields-Haas has been providing medical care for patients covered by Medicaid without getting reimbursed. \"We haven't been turning them away,\" she says.\n                \n                    Selena Simmons-Duffin/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Selena Simmons-Duffin/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   She says patients are confused by what's happening, and many have sent her messages asking if they can still go to her for care. She assures them that they can, although she worries about the future.   \n   \"Unfortunately, decision-makers in Washington are having such a profound impact on what we can and can't do,\" she says. \"Not being able to be reimbursed for the visits is really crippling, financially.\"   A legal challenge   For George Hill, political interference in sexual and reproductive health care is nothing new. \"I've been in the field since 1987, so close to 40 years, [through] several different presidential administrations that have been hostile to the care that we now provide,\" he says. \"This is — by volume and velocity — probably the worst that we have seen.\"   Just weeks after the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into law, Maine Family Planning filed a lawsuit to challenge the provision that blocks them from getting Medicaid funding.   \"The lawsuit was filed essentially because Maine Family Planning says this is unfair and it's wrong and it's unconstitutional to be singling out and targeting certain providers based on this animus against abortion,\" says Autumn Katz, interim director of litigation at the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represents the organization in its lawsuit.   \n   The federal government defended the provision in a court filing, arguing that it promotes Congress' \"goal of reducing abortion\" and suggesting Maine Family Planning could get its funding back if it stopped providing abortion.   (Planned Parenthood filed a separate lawsuit and was able to secure an injunction. In Maine, the injunction request was denied and so the provision is in effect while the lawsuit works its way through the courts.)   Another threat looms   Anti-abortion efforts at the federal level may not stop with the Medicaid law.   Another 20% of Maine Family Planning's budget comes from the federal government through Title X — a decades-old grant program that enables the clinics to see uninsured patients. In October, the Trump administration fired the whole team that works on that program. Those firings were reversed in mid-November as part of the deal to end the shutdown, but the administration could try to end the program in another way.   \n   Hill says he isn't sure what's going to happen next with the lawsuit and Medicaid, or Title X, but he says they're not giving up. The state law that patient Ashley Smith advocated for provides short term funding from the state to help fill the budget gap. Hill says they're exploring new potential partnerships and new ways to raise revenue they haven't tried before.   He quotes Rep. Pat Schroeder, the late Democratic lawmaker from Colorado: \"You can't roll up your sleeves and get to work if you're wringing your hands,\" he says. \"We're going to continue to do the work. We're not going to stop.\"\n",

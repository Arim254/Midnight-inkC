The bill passed Wednesday night despite Republicans' narrow margin in the House. Six Democrats joined their Republican colleagues to get the bill over the finish line 43 days after the shutdown began: Reps. Henry Cuellar of Texas, Don Davis of North Carolina, Adam Gray of California, Jared Golden of Maine, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, and Tom Suozzi of New York.   Two Republicans -- Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Greg Steube of Florida -- voted no. The final vote was 222 to 209.   \n   President Trump signed the bill shortly after the House vote. Trump blamed Democrats for the shutdown at the signing event in the Oval Office.    \"This was an easy extension but they didn't want to do it the easy way,\" Trump said. \"They wanted to do it the hard way.\"   In addition to extending last year's spending levels through the end of January for most of the government, the bill provides funding for some agencies through the end of next September, including payments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The program, which provides food aid to nearly 1 in 8 Americans, has been mired in a court battle because of the shutdown.   The bill includes a measure to reverse layoffs the Trump administration imposed during the shutdown, provides backpay for federal employees, and institutes protections against further layoffs.   But the central issue underlying the entire shutdown — extensions on enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire at the end of the year — is not addressed in the bill.   Instead, as part of the deal reached with a bipartisan contingent of senators, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., agreed to hold a vote in mid-December on Democrat-drafted legislation aimed at extending those subsidies.   \n   That doesn't sit well with many Senate Democrats, who remain wary of the pledge.   \"A handshake deal with my Republican colleagues to reopen the government and no guarantee to actually lower costs is simply not good enough,\" said Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., who voted against the measure.   Even if a December bill addressing the expiring subsidies passes the Senate, it would need to go to the House. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has not made a guarantee to bring such a bill to the floor for a vote.   A lot of pain, not a lot of gain   Government shutdowns historically have not been effective tools for advancing a party's policy goals. The last six weeks proved that to be the rule, not an exception.   The decision by Senate Democrats not to fund the government before Oct. 1 was fueled, at least in part, by demands from the Democrats' political base to be a strong opposition party. The party homed in on a promise that they would not fund the government unless Republicans agreed to extend subsidies for people who buy health care through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.   The decision came after key Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, voted alongside Republicans to avoid a shutdown in March. The result was a furious Democratic base, who demanded the minority party exert what little leverage it has to force a negotiation with Republicans in exchange for their votes to fund the government.   With an eye toward the expiring subsidies and resulting skyrocketing premiums, Senate Democrats stood firm during the October shutdown, hoping their resolve, paired with the devastating impacts of the shutdown on millions of Americans, would bring Republicans to the negotiating table.   But the strategy ultimately didn't work. Republicans didn't budge and continued to hold regular votes to fund the government.   \n   In the meantime, 42 million Americans who participate with SNAP didn't receive the food aid they rely on. Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees had to remain on the job without pay, leading to the Federal Aviation Administration's order to scale back flights. Millions of federal workers went without pay.   The group of seven Democrats and one independent senator who voted to end the shutdown acknowledged that waiting longer wouldn't bring about a different result.   \"There was no guarantee that waiting would get us a better result, but there was a guarantee that waiting would impose suffering on more everyday people,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told NPR.   The result is an end to a shutdown that does not address the core demand from Democrats on the subsidies. Instead they are left to defend the kind of handshake agreement that they once said was insufficient.   Thune's ultimate deal with Democrats aligns with his repeated statements throughout the shutdown that Republicans would be open to negotiating on the expiring subsidies only after the government was funded, not before.   Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, one of the six Democrats who voted for the bill in the House, said there is still an opportunity to address health care.   \"Congress still has a window to pass bipartisan legislation to extend the ACA premium tax credits,\" Golden said in a statement. \"In September, I joined a bipartisan coalition in the House to put forth legislation to extend the credits for one year and now, with the shutdown now over, I urge members of both parties who care about affordable health care to come back to the table so we can get the job done.\"   Another factor that didn't go Democrats' way is the president himself. President Trump has been known at times to upend Congressional Republicans' game plan. But he took a step back during the shutdown and let Thune drive the GOP strategy. He didn't take the bait from Democrats who repeatedly asked where Trump \"the great negotiator\" was in the discussions.   \n   What happens now?    Both parties have significant choices ahead that could lay the groundwork for their political successes and headaches through next year.   Senate Democrats have about a month to craft a bill that addresses the expiring ACA subsidies in a way that brings enough Republicans on board for passage.   If they're successful at getting an extension, Democrats will be able to start 2026 with a policy victory in hand that will shape their messaging going into the midterm elections. If Republicans don't support it, Democrats still have what they see as a winning issue — health care — to run on next year.   Some Republicans have shown interest in addressing the subsidies, but want to institute reforms like fraud prevention and income caps.   And both parties have to contend with the fact that the government is only funded for a few months. Congress will still have to pass nine other appropriations bills before the continuing resolution ends.\n",

But suspending funding to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP, may have long-lasting impacts, say some experts and those who depend on the program to feed their families.      \n   Jacqueline Giammona, a single working mom of two boys, relies on SNAP for most of her groceries. By last week, her pantry and freezer were near empty.    The Sacramento, Calif., resident was among those in some states who saw November benefits hit the EBT card they use to buy food, amid back-and-forth legal wranglings that reached the Supreme Court.   \"I was really relieved,\" she said, but there was a nagging feeling in her gut. \"Okay, what if they take it away?'\"   \n   Giammona can't fathom why the government would deprive low-income people of a necessity like food. She considers it an \"abuse of power\" with lasting consequences.   \"People are going to distrust the government, and I think that people are going to be really angry about it for a long time,\" she said.   SNAP is the country's largest anti-hunger program, serving the 1 in 8 U.S. residents who live at or just above the poverty line. For more than 60 years it has stood as a key safety-net for those in need.   Funded each year by Congress, its budget is designed to grow and shrink to meet the demand. To see it compromised was startling, said Craig Gundersen, an economics professor at Baylor University.   \"This is a big surprise,\" Gundersen said. \"It really has broken this entitlement status of SNAP, and that's of concern.\"   \n   President Donald Trump has been a critic of SNAP. During the shutdown, he called it out as one of the \"Democrat programs\" he pledged to cut. On his social media platform Truth Social he falsely claimed former President Joe Biden expanded it by \"Billions and Billions of dollars\" and that benefits were given randomly \"to anyone for the asking, as opposed to just those in need.\"   In late October, as the government shutdown wore on, the U.S. Department of Agriculture posted on its website that it would not pay the full $8 billion in SNAP benefits due for November. The message blamed Democrats for the shutdown and the consequent suspension of payments.   \n   Crystal FitzSimons, president of the Food Research & Action Center, said she felt \"shock, outrage, disbelief.\"   \"It was a policy choice that was made by this administration,\" she said.   The administration challenged the ruling of three lower courts that it had reserve funds to pay full SNAP benefits, arguing it needed the money for other children nutrition programs. The Agriculture Department said it had about $4.5 billion in a contingency fund that would cover roughly half of November's benefits. Two judges said the administration should tap other reserves to make up the difference.     The deal cut by Congress to reopen the government funds SNAP through September 2026. But FitzSimons is nervous that the program could be used again as a negotiation tactic.   \"Once you break a taboo,\" she said, \"it's that much easier to break a taboo.\"   Ideally, she'd like to see lawmakers pass a bill to ensure there is no future delay in SNAP benefits, even in a government shutdown.   \"Could Congress compel USDA to actually act? They could,\" she says. \"I'm not sure that we'll be able to get that done before Oct. 1, 2026.\"   \n   Some advocates also worry the SNAP disruption will dissuade people who face hunger from getting help.    \"By making SNAP payments uncertain the shutdown will likely further decrease the number of eligible people who will apply,\" said Joel Berg, CEO of the nonprofit Hunger Free America.   The Agriculture Department did not respond to an NPR request for comment about concerns over mistrust in the program and plans to address that.   The weeks of hardship, anxiety and chaos caused by the funding pause have, however, shined a light on the importance of the program, many noted. SNAP recipients have seen an outpouring of support from people around the country and lawmakers from both major parties.    \"If anything, I think that this shutdown and this disruption of SNAP benefits will make Americans more aware this is really an important program and should retain its entitlement status,\" said Gundersen.   \n   Brittany Jansen, of Phoenix, hopes more people will realize hunger affects those close to them.   Jansen applied for SNAP benefits 10 months ago, after she and her husband racked up thousands of dollars in credit card debt for groceries and gasoline. He changed career paths and has yet to find a full-time job. She bartends part-time, and they split shifts because they can't afford child care for their two toddlers.   Her own mother didn't fully grasp the struggle.   \"When I first told her that we were getting benefits she was confused,\" Jansen said, \"because she was like, 'Well, you both have jobs!'\"   Since the shutdown and SNAP funding pause, Jansen has been more open about the fact that her family needs help.   \"And I think people are just kind of surprised,\" she said.\n",

Today's top stories   The House Oversight Committee yesterday released over 20,000 documents turned over to Congress from Jeffrey Epstein's estate. Among the documents were new emails from the convicted sex offender that mention President Trump, often expressing displeasure with him and his presidency. Democrats and Republicans have differing views on what the documents say about Epstein.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A protester holds a sign related to the release of the Jeffrey Epstein case files outside the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 12, 2025. Democrats released emails Wednesday in which Jeffrey Epstein suggested Donald Trump was aware of the disgraced financier's sexual abuse and had \"spent hours\" with one of his victims at his house.\n                \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 The majority of the emails were obsessively tracking Trump's ascent to the presidency from 2015 to 2018. Epstein mocked Trump and even wrote a note saying there isn't one decent cell in Trump's body to former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, NPR's Stephen Fowler tells Up First. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the release of the emails proves nothing. House Speaker Mike Johnson has been opposed to the effort from some Republicans and Democrats to release all unclassified files held by the Justice Department around the life and death of Epstein, who died by suicide while awaiting trial in 2019. Arizona Rep. Adelita Grijalva was sworn into Congress yesterday, meaning the bipartisan push now has enough support to force a House floor vote on the Epstein files bill.   \n   The longest government shutdown in U.S. history is now over after Trump signed a bill to fund it last night. The bill includes measures that reverse the layoffs imposed by the Trump administration during the shutdown, provide back pay for federal employees, and fund some agencies through the end of next September. The bill does not extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, which expire at the end of the year.    🎧 NPR's Barbara Sprunt says she is watching how Democrats will craft a bill that could appeal to Republicans, addressing the expiring subsidies during the promised December vote in the Senate on the issue. If they are successful, Democrats will be able to begin the new year with a policy victory. If Republicans oppose the bill, Democrats will have what they see as a winning issue to campaign on: the high cost of health care.🎧 There are signals that a one-year extension of the federal subsidies could be possible, but there is no concrete deal at this point, says NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin. Republicans say that the subsidies don't address the rising health costs and that they were supposed to be a temporary pandemic policy. Meanwhile, Democrats want to maintain the generous subsidies that have kept the monthly premium costs down.   \n   Israel deported 154 Palestinian prisoners last month as part of the exchange for Hamas freeing its final group of Israeli hostages. The prisoners were sent into exile in Cairo, never to return to their homes in the Palestinian territories. Israeli security experts say the deportation policy aims to prevent released prisoners from re-engaging in militant activities, but past incidents indicate that this practice can have unintended long-term consequences for Israeli security.

The FDA plans to remove warning labels from estrogen-based hormone therapy used to treat menopause symptoms. These warnings originated from the early 2000s when a Women's Health Initiative study found this type of therapy increased the risk of heart attacks, strokes, blood clots and breast cancer. However, experts now believe that more is known about safe and effective combinations of therapy when it is started earlier than the age of the women in the study, which was 63. Here are some things to consider when talking to your healthcare provider about the therapy:    👩‍⚕️ Experts recommend starting the therapy before the age of 60 or within the first 10 years of menopause onset.👩‍⚕️ Have a discussion about how long you should be on the therapy. In general, women stay on it for three to five years, but that isn't a hard rule.👩‍⚕️ For those who prefer not to undergo hormone therapy, there are alternatives available. The FDA has approved two non-hormonal medications for treating severe hot flashes during menopause.

The aurora borealis was spotted in a large swath of states, including Tennessee, New York, New Mexico and Idaho. The northern lights could be seen as far south as parts of Florida and Alabama, a relatively rare occurrence highlighting the severity of this week's storms. Auroras are becoming more frequent in the U.S. as the sun approaches the peak of its 11-year solar cycle. This trend is expected to continue for several months.

The announcement follows harsh criticism from the Trump administration about California and other states granting licenses to people in the country illegally. The issue was thrust into the public's consciousness in August, when a tractor-trailer driver not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people.   Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that California's action to revoke these licenses is an admission that the state acted improperly even though it previously defended its licensing standards. California launched its review of commercial driver's licenses it issued after Duffy raised concerns.   \n   \"After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we've exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,\" Duffy said, referring to the state's governor. \"This is just the tip of iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.\"   Newsom's office said that every one of the drivers whose license is being revoked had valid work authorizations from the federal government. At first, his office declined to disclose the exact reason for revoking the licenses, saying only they violated state law. Later, his office revealed the state law it was referring to was one that requires the licenses expire on or before a person's legal status to be in the United State ends, as reported to the DMV.   Still, Newsom's spokesperson Brandon Richards shot back at Duffy in a statement.   \"Once again, the Sean 'Road Rules' Duffy fails to share the truth — spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,\" Richards said.   Fatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year also highlight questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash that killed three people last month involved a truck driver in the country illegally, only adding to the concerns.   \n   Duffy previously imposed new restrictions on which immigrants can qualify for commercial driver's licenses. He said earlier this fall that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver's licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy has taken action against because it was the first one where an audit was completed. The reviews in the other states have been delayed by the government shutdown, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards.   Duffy revoked $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn't enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he reiterated Wednesday that he will take another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses if they don't invalidate every illegal license and address all the concerns. But revoking these licenses is part of the state's effort to comply.   The new rules for commercial driver's licenses that Duffy announced in September make getting them extremely hard for immigrants because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible. States will also have to verify an applicant's immigration status in a federal database. The licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner.   Under the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2b is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business. But the rules won't be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers will be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.   Those new requirements were not in place at the time the 17,000 California licenses were issued. But those drivers were given notices that their licenses will expire in 60 days.   \n   Duffy said in September that investigators found that one quarter of the 145 licenses they reviewed in California shouldn't have been issued. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver's work permit expired — sometimes years after.   Newsom's office said the state followed guidance it received from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about issuing these licenses to noncitizens.\n",

Trump administration officials are proposing a 50-year mortgage option.\n                \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Most people who take out mortgages go with a 30-year term. But President Trump wants the federal government to back a 50-year mortgage option for homebuyers — a plan that would be \"a complete game changer,\" according to Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte.   Backers of the idea say it could help more prospective buyers get into a home they might not otherwise afford. But skepticism abounds, with Fox News' Laura Ingraham telling Trump this week that the proposal \"has enraged your MAGA friends.\"   Ingraham cited \"significant MAGA backlash, calling it a giveaway to the banks and simply prolonging the time it would take for Americans to own a home outright.\"   \n   Trump said the criticism is overblown: \"All it means is you pay less per month, you pay it over a longer period of time. It's not like a big factor. It might help a little bit.\"   The proposal is being floated at a time when many are struggling to get a foothold in the housing market. The pace of home sales has slowed, as potential buyers navigate two main obstacles: mortgage interest rates spiked in recent years, and home prices continue to rise in many areas.   \n   The new plan would also expose borrowers to debt for 20 additional years compared to a 30-year mortgage. And because standard repayment schedules devote far more money to paying interest in the early years of a loan rather than paying down the principal, it would take home buyers even longer to build equity in their property.   \"You're going to be paying almost all interest for the first 10 years. It's really akin to an interest-only loan at that point,\" says Chris Hendrix, senior vice president for the home loans unit of NBKC Bank in Kansas City. He adds, \"that's true for a 30-year loan too: for the first 10 years, you're paying mostly interest on that loan. But it would look even worse on a 50-year loan for sure.\"   \n   Many questions remain about the plan, which the Trump administration revealed over the weekend.   How do the numbers look on a 50-year versus 30-year mortgage?   Using a $400,000 home with a 6.25% interest rate and a 10% down payment as an example, Realtor.com senior economist Joel Berner said via email, \"a 50-year loan would save at most about $250 per month compared to the 30-year loan.\"   That would help buyers in the short term — but over decades, buyers would end up paying much more.   \n   \"Total interest on the 50-year loan would amount to $816,396 compared to $438,156 on the 30-year loan, a difference of $378,240,\" he says. \"That's 86% more interest over the life of the loans.\"   Berner cautions that his hypothetical example assumes the same interest rate for both loans. In reality, he says, the interest rate for a 50-year loan would be higher than one for 30 years, making the disparity even more pronounced. \"The longer the life of the loan, the more compensation the lender will demand.\"    Loading... \n   Why would a bank want to offer a 50-year mortgage, and why would a buyer want one?   \"Buyers do benefit from spreading out the high cost of a home purchase over a longer period,\" Berner says, \"but lenders certainly benefit too by having a longer period to charge higher interest rates.\"   Bruce Marks, the CEO of the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America, a nonprofit that helps people get low-cost mortgages, is skeptical that home buyers will embrace the plan.   \n   \"It will have no legs because they've tried to do a 40-year term that has not taken off,\" he says, referring to 40-year mortgage modifications that have been offered in earlier attempts to help struggling homeowners.   The 50-year proposal \"is even worse,\" Marks says. \"It will go nowhere. Borrowers will not do it. They see through that. They will know that they will not generate any wealth.\"   The potential timing of a 50-year mortgage is uncertain.   \"There's a lot of legal analysis\" over the proposal, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said this week, as he implied the plan might require legislation. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, mortgages longer than 30 years don't meet the criteria for qualified mortgages — meaning they're ineligible to get the backing of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and lenders would be hesitant to offer them.   \n   In response to criticisms of the plan, Hassett said homeowners also build equity when their properties appreciate in value. Noting that prices tend to increase, he added, \"I don't think that the absence of equity is a serious concern about this.\"   Could other changes help ease the housing crunch?   \"This is not the best way to solve housing affordability,\" Berner says. \"The administration would do better to reverse tariff-induced inflation, which is keeping the rates on existing mortgages high, and to encourage the expansion of housing supply by promoting homebuilding.\"   Hendrix says he understands the White House's motivation: to address a housing crisis.   \n   \"The median homebuyer right now in the nation is 59 years old. It is the highest that it's ever been since we started tracking it since 1981. What else is staggering is the median age for a first-time homebuyer is 40 years old right now. You're looking at a generation that has not had the ability to get into a property, start building equity, start building wealth from a home.\"   Lower interest rates could help, Hendrix says. But he adds that the government also has other tools, such as helping first-time homebuyers and encouraging housing construction.   One change Marks would like to see is any move that might limit individual homebuyers from being outbid by large corporations that add homes as part of their investment portfolios. Another, he says, is any policy that might support buyers secure mortgages of 30 years or less.   \"The 30-year term has always been the sweet spot in this country. And that sets us apart from every other country. And we should not just try to eliminate that or undermine that. We should double down,\" he says, and find ways to give consumers more flexibility and financial well-being.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Scott Detrow speaks with Rep. Robert Garcia, ranking Democratic member of the House Oversight Committee, about newly-public emails that appear to tie Jeffrey Epstein to President Trump.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  Today, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released emails between Jeffrey Epstein and his confidants that suggest that President Trump may have known about Epstein's sex abuse operations. In one email, Epstein writes that Trump, quote, \"spent hours at my house\" with one of Epstein's victims. In another, he writes that Trump, quote, \"knew about the girls.\" In the third, a writer advises Epstein that he can use his history with Trump as a, quote, \"valuable PR and political currency\" should he ever need to. Democrats are trying to force the Department of Justice to release more information from its investigation of Epstein and accuses the White House of a cover-up.In response to today's release, the White House said that these were, quote, \"selectively leaked emails\" to, quote, \"create a fake narrative.\" And Republicans on the Oversight Committee released more than 20,000 pages of documents from the Epstein case from which these three emails came. Let's hear more from Representative Robert Garcia of California. He is the ranking Democratic member of the House Oversight Committee. Congressman, thanks for joining us.ROBERT GARCIA: Sure thing. Happy to be here.DETROW: Let's start with this. We have long known now that the future president and Jeffrey Epstein were friendly before they had a falling out around 2004, which was well before Trump ran for president. What did we learn that was new here? Did this bring any new information?GARCIA: I think that the emails today show clearly that there is a relationship between Donald Trump and Epstein. As far as what Donald Trump knew, what he participated in I think are real questions. And I think the thing on everyone's mind, certainly those of us on the committee, is why the cover-up? Why won't the White House release the full Epstein files?You have an email today essentially saying that Donald Trump may have spent hours with one of the victims. As you said, another email that talks about Donald Trump possibly knowing what was happening with these girls. And I think this is really disturbing stuff. We want justice for these women and these survivors. We know that many were abused when they were underaged. And powerful men were involved. And our whole goal here is to get to the truth. And we are imploring the Department of Justice to release the files.DETROW: But again, we've all been blanketed with the pictures of these two men together. We saw a lot of reporting earlier this year of these alleged birthday notes that Trump was writing to Epstein. What new information did you learn from these emails?GARCIA: Well, I think part of it is the president admitting that there was a real relationship here between him and Epstein. And I think that is what today's emails actually also show. First, these 23...DETROW: Well, these are all other people talking about Trump.GARCIA: Absolutely.DETROW: Trump does not appear himself.GARCIA: That's right. This is Jeffrey Epstein's emails. And there's 23,000 documents here, of course. So what's important is, when you spend the entire campaign saying you're going to release the Epstein files, when we know that Jeffrey Epstein has said that Donald Trump was his best friend for 10 years - the birthday note you just referenced, Donald Trump, as a reminder, said it didn't exist until we actually produced it with his own signature.And so Trump has a record of lying about this. And he has a record of saying that he wanted to release, and now they're refusing to do so. I think it's important to note that every single piece of evidence we want to release to the public. This is about transparency, it's about oversight and it's about getting justice for the victims.DETROW: Curious how you're approaching this. This is a case laden with conspiracy theories. These are emails, many of whom are coming from not especially trustworthy people. How are you verifying this information that you're looking at?GARCIA: Look, I think the important thing is that people absorb and read the documents for themselves and make their own judgments. I think for us, clearly anything that is a correspondence from Jeffrey Epstein, whether it's to Ghislaine Maxwell, which we saw today in one of those emails, or others is significant. And what we're trying to say right now at this moment is the only way to get the full picture of what happened is for the DOJ to follow the subpoena sent by the Oversight Committee and to hand over all of the documents.There are an enormous amount of documents, photographs, possibly videos that the public has a right to know what actually happened. We know, for example, that back when the Epstein case was being developed and prosecuted, there were multiple men that were going to be named as coconspirators in this and that that was all essentially washed aside by, at the time, Alex Acosta, who then becomes, of course, Trump's labor secretary. So there's a lot of questions here.DETROW: I want to make sure we get to a few more points here. This is also a notable day in that you're about to gain another Democratic member of the House, who will sign the discharge petition and force a vote, possibly, on the House floor to release the files. We know the White House is pressuring the four Republicans who have signed onto that petition to pull their names. Are you in communication with any of these Republican representatives who have been having meetings at the White House today?GARCIA: Look, I've been talking to many Republicans. There's no question that if we hold and they hold, this will pass the House, and there will be numerous Republicans that'll vote yes. They understand that this is important to their constituency. The Epstein files and its release is very bipartisan when you ask the American public. And again, the question...DETROW: What especially is important? Because again, this is something that's been playing out for more than a decade now. This is somebody who's been long dead but continues to make news. Why is this the priority for you given all of the other issues the federal government is facing?GARCIA: Well, look, I think there's a lot of important things. We got to focus on health care. We got to focus on lowering costs. This goes straight to the corruption of this administration. And Donald Trump spent his campaign talking about this. And if you were going to lean in so hard on a campaign promise and then essentially go back on it, we have to ask why. And in meeting all these women and these victims and survivors, they want justice. I've talked to many of them personally, one on one. And they deserve justice, and they deserve the truth. I also...DETROW: How do you balance...GARCIA: But let me say one more thing because I think it's really important. When you have powerful men - and I don't care what party they're in or what their job is. When you have powerful men abuse, rape and traffic women and yet you don't bring justice to those women, what are we saying to American kids, to girls, to women across this country that the most powerful men can get away with this? And that has to also drive our investigation.DETROW: Congressman, we've got about 30 seconds left. But how do you balance transparency and protecting these victims, who have been abused so many times at this point forward, with the release of thousands of pages of information?GARCIA: What's most important at the end of the day is we've got to protect the victims. And so we're doing that. We're redacting names. We've made that promise. And everything else we're going to get out to the public.DETROW: That is Congressman Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee. Thank you so much for talking to us.GARCIA: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

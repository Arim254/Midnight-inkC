The former vice president was politically prominent from the 1970s until his death. We're also following elections on this Tuesday, on this last day of voting across the country today, from New Jersey and Virginia to California. It's just one of several tests President Trump is facing this week. NPR's senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith is with us now to walk us through it. Good morning, Tam.TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning.MARTIN: So let's start with the gubernatorial elections. How much can be read into the results?KEITH: Well, New Jersey and Virginia aren't exactly presidential swing states, but these races for governor are a first chance to see how voters are feeling almost a year into the Trump presidency. And President Trump put out several social media posts overnight last night, urging people to vote Republican and bashing the Democratic candidates, Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey. He has endorsed the Republican candidate in New Jersey, Jack Ciattarelli, but Trump hasn't endorsed the Republican candidate in Virginia, Winsome Earle-Sears, which led to some verbal gymnastics during a tele-rally that the president called into last night.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Vote Republican. You know, just - if I just cover one subject - your energy prices will go way down as opposed to your energy prices going through the roof. Just that one subject alone is so big. But every Virginia patriot should get out and vote and all Republican up and down the line. It's so important.KEITH: The race in New Jersey appears to be closer than the one in Virginia, which may explain why Trump is expending more political capital there.MARTIN: Talk briefly about California. What does Trump have on the line in that election?KEITH: Yeah. So California voters are considering a ballot measure to temporarily redraw the state's congressional district lines to give Democrats a bigger advantage. This was a response to the new maps in Texas that came at President Trump's request and gave Republicans more safe seats there. If the California measure passes - and it has overwhelming support in recent polls - it would at least partially offset Trump's effort to give Republicans a better chance in next year's midterm elections, which Trump says is key to keeping his agenda on track.MARTIN: There's another possible barrier to Trump's agenda this week. The Supreme Court hears arguments tomorrow about Trump's tariff policy.KEITH: Yeah. And we don't know how they will rule, but - right? - President Trump seems pretty concerned about this tool of raising taxes on imports, to extract concessions from other countries being taken away from him. He has said that it could lead to the ruination of our nation. And here's what he said on \"60 Minutes\" over the weekend.(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"60 MINUTES\")TRUMP: I think our country will be immeasurably hurt. I think our economy will go to hell. Look, because of tariffs, we have the highest stock market we've ever had. Because of tariffs, 401(k) is at the highest level that - and this is millions and millions of people - that we've ever had - 401(k)s. I think it's the most important subject discussed by the Supreme Court in a hundred years.KEITH: Of course, mainstream economists and many business leaders say the tariffs are driving up prices and creating uncertainty. So it's not clear that the president's dire predictions will come to fruition.MARTIN: What else are you watching?KEITH: Well, last night, President Trump turned to Truth Social to criticize the media for saying his poll numbers are low. He claimed falsely that he has the best numbers he has ever had. There's also some political risk for the president, as the government shutdown is about to break a record as the longest one in U.S. history. Polls indicate that, despite the president's best efforts, Democrats are not getting all the blame. Trump so far has refused to negotiate, though there is some movement on the Hill suggesting that the ice might be thawing.MARTIN: That's NPR's Tamara Keith. Tam, thank you.KEITH: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      There are several big races to watch this Election Day. New York City will elect a mayor, New Jersey and Virginia will pick a governor and California will decide a consequential redistricting ballot.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Voting ends today in a handful of high-profile elections, including for mayor of New York City and for governor in New Jersey and Virginia.STEVE INSKEEP, BYLINE: It's a tradition to watch those three elections. They always come in the first year of a presidency, and people look for clues to what voters are thinking. This year, there's an extra big election to watch - a ballot measure in California that could influence who captures Congress next year.MARTIN: Here to talk us through these races is NPR political correspondent Ashley Lopez. Ashley, good morning.ASHLEY LOPEZ, BYLINE: Good morning.MARTIN: Let's start in California. It's a one-issue election - kind of unusual.LOPEZ: Yeah, kind of. It's a one-ballot measure on the ballot asking voters to allow state lawmakers to redraw their congressional map ahead of the 2026 election. California has an independent redistricting commission, which is something voters approved about 15 years ago. If passed, this measure would allow Democrats in the state to bypass that commission so that they can do a partisan gerrymander. That means they would draw up to five more seats that their party is favored to win in the midterms.MARTIN: But you can't think about California in isolation here because it's part of a national redistricting fight between Democrats and Republicans in a number of states. So in this case, this is Democrats in California responding to Republicans in Texas.LOPEZ: That's right. And Democrats went as far as saying that in the ballot language of this measure, Texas redrew its map at the request of President Trump and created five more favorable seats for Republicans in the state. And California basically wants to offset that edge that Trump wants. And this measure looks like it's likely to pass. I was actually in Southern California last week, and many Democratic voters told me they have, like, mixed feelings about bypassing the independent redistricting commission and allowing gerrymandering. But they think it's more important to fight back against Trump and Republicans, and this is one way they can.MARTIN: All right. Let's move to the other coast, to New York City. What should we know about the mayoral race there?LOPEZ: Right. So the frontrunner for that race is Zohran Mamdani, who is 34 years old, and he's a member of the New York State Assembly. He won the Democratic primary this summer, which surprised a lot of folks because he was relatively unknown when he entered the race. And he beat a former governor in that primary contest - Andrew Cuomo. Cuomo decided to stay in the race by running as an independent. In the last days of the campaign, Cuomo has gotten some big endorsements, including the president's. But this hasn't been an easy fight for him. Mamdani has a very energetic grassroots campaign that has engaged a lot of young voters in the city, especially on affordability issues.MARTIN: Also interesting that the president bypassed the Republican in the race to go to Cuomo as an independent. OK. So what should we keep an eye on when it comes to the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia?LOPEZ: Yeah. So Democrats are out of power in Washington, obviously, but governorships have been this area of government where they've been able to somewhat push back against the Trump administration. So the stakes of these races are particularly high for Democrats. In Virginia, Democrats have a decent shot. Abigail Spanberger, a former member of Congress, is pulling ahead in that race against Republican Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears. And there's a history of the party in power in the White House typically losing the race for governor in Virginia.MARTIN: And what about New Jersey?LOPEZ: Yeah. I mean, that race might be a little tougher for the Democratic Party. Besides the polling being close, history is not on the party's side like it is in Virginia. Voters have not elected the same party for governor for three terms in a row since the '60s, so Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill is seeking to defy that trend against Republican Jack Ciattarelli.MARTIN: So what, if anything, about tonight will you be looking for as a possible clue to the midterm elections next year?LOPEZ: Well, I'm going to be looking at how Democrats perform in these races. Yes, they're favored to win a lot of them, but there is a big difference among these candidates. Mamdani and Spanberger, for example, represent very different parts of the Democratic coalition. And results could tell us something about how voters are responding to different kinds of candidates and messaging as the party looks to next year.MARTIN: That is NPR's Ashley Lopez. Ashley, thank you.LOPEZ: Yeah. Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

A special election in California allows the state's voters to weigh in on what is now a cross-country redistricting battle between the two major parties ahead of next year's midterm elections.   \n   Here are details on that contest and three others we're watching this Election Day. (And when polls close, find results for these key races here.)   California redistricting   Proposition 50 would replace California's current congressional lines with a map favoring Democrats.   The maneuver is Gov. Gavin Newsom's answer to President Trump pushing Texas and other GOP-led states to redraw their congressional maps to give Republicans a better chance of hanging onto the party's slim majority in the U.S. House.   \n   If voters approve Prop 50 — which appears likely — the new districts could help Democrats win up to five more House seats in the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections. The proposition is written to expire after the 2030 election, returning line-drawing power to the state's existing independent citizens' redistricting commission.   — KQED's Guy Marzorati      New York City mayor   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                New York City mayoral candidates former New York Gov.

Andrew Cuomo and nine other Democrats in the primary by running a grassroots campaign that inspired younger voters through a relentless focus on making New York City more affordable.   His primary win energized portions of the party's base, while making him a foil for Republicans across the country.   \n   Cuomo opted to stay in the mayor's race by running as an independent. He's criticized Mamdani as too inexperienced to deal with Trump. Cuomo has also argued that the state legislator's campaign platform, which includes free buses and universal childcare, can't be delivered.   If elected, Mamdani would be the city's first Muslim mayor and, at 34, its youngest in more than a century.   — WNYC's Brigid Bergin      New Jersey governor    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Rep.

Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy pilot, held an endorsement rally with former President Barack Obama on Saturday and has a slight edge over Ciattarelli in recent polling.   Polls also show issues like housing affordability and high electric bills are top of voters' minds, but the contest has been dominated in recent weeks by personal attacks on both sides.   If Sherrill wins, it would be the first time since the 1960s that New Jersey voters elect a governor from the same party three terms in a row.   — WNYC's Mike Hayes      Virginia governor    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Lt.

Today, his Brooklyn tech company makes a free app for people on the federal government's anti-hunger Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.   About 5 million people use Propel's app to check their SNAP balances, and get coupons and discounts on groceries. That gives Chen a pretty good view into how they're being affected by the federal government's unprecedented delay in sending out November payments.   \"Their budgets are already extremely tight. There's usually not a lot of wiggle room,\" Chen says. \"So a delay of even a few days on an expected deposit ends up being a really, really huge deal.\"   \n   Now his company is trying to bridge that gap, joining other private businesses, nonprofits, and individuals scrambling to offset the government's delayed SNAP payments. On Saturday, Propel started giving payments of $50 to people using its app, prioritizing those with children and little or no income.   \n   \"We understand that $50 is not enough,\" Chen says, adding that Propel is trying to reach the largest number of families and \"provide an amount that gives them a little bit of breathing room.\"   The company has identified about 230,000 users who fit this \"high need\" profile. It has donated $1 million of the total $10 million it needs to fund $50 payments to most of them, and is hoping to beat that target.   Looking for partners   Propel has also lined up some donations from its corporate partners, including the New York anti-poverty nonprofit Robin Hood and ecommerce platform Babylist. It also set up a crowdfunding campaign with the nonprofit GiveDirectly, which runs similar programs all over the world and which has worked with Propel in the past.   GiveDirectly says it's raised a total of $6 million, including Propel's contributions, so far.   \"The sheer scale and volume of this need is so immense. We're talking about millions of low income Americans who are at risk of not getting this assistance,\" says Sarina Jain, GiveDirectly's senior program manager focused on U.S. disaster responses.   \n   Even as they've scrambled to launch this donation program, Chen and Jain acknowledge that all of the efforts from non-profits and private companies can never replace the federal government, which spends $8 billion every month on the country's largest anti-hunger program.   \"At the end of the day, the single biggest thing we can do in this country is to get SNAP back online, depositing on a predictable schedule to the people who receive it,\" Chen says.   42 million SNAP recipients face delayed payments    Almost 42 million people rely on SNAP. Now they're waiting for payments that the government stopped making on Saturday — and they're facing delays that could stretch into months.   After two federal judges ruled that freezing SNAP payments is unlawful, the Trump administration on Monday said it would restart partial SNAP payments.   But the government added that states would only receive about half the amount of federal funding they usually get. It plans to use money from an Agriculture Department contingency fund, which contains only $5 billion — well short of the $8 billion it costs to provide full SNAP benefits each month.   The government also warned that it could take some states \"anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months\" to process the reduced payments.   That could be disastrous for many SNAP recipients, such as Shenita Melton. The 37-year-old lives in rural Anson County, North Carolina, and relies on SNAP to help feed her four children.   Propel connected NPR to Melton, who said last week that she was already starting to scramble to find enough food for her kids — especially her three teenagers, who \"eat a lot.\"   There aren't many food banks in the rural area where she lives. The few that do exist only allow people to pick up groceries once or twice a month.   Melton also says that many of the groceries at those food banks are expired.   \n   \"I'm kind of scared to give my kids expired food,\" she says. \"But sometimes you have to do what you have to do.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      As the shutdown enters its 35th day, NPR's Steve Inskeep talks with House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark to discuss how she sees the shutdown ending and whether her party has any leverage.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Representative Katherine Clark has been listening with us. She is the No. 2 Democrat in the House of Representatives, the Democratic whip. Welcome to the program.KATHERINE CLARK: Oh, good to be with you. Thank you for having me.INSKEEP: We are reporting throughout the morning on the death of Vice President Cheney, which we have learned - former Vice President Cheney. I'm sure as a Democrat, you did not agree with Cheney on many, many things. But at the end of his life, he agreed with you on one big thing. So what are your thoughts now?CLARK: Yes. You know, we extend our deepest sympathies and prayers to Dick Cheney's family and especially to our former colleague, Liz Cheney. And I do admire how Dick Cheney stood by her as she took on her own party and at great political cost to herself to expose the truth that Joe Biden won the election in 2020 and that we had a fair and secure election. Not an easy thing to do, and I admire that about both of them.INSKEEP: Is there something to be said about government service here as well? Cheney spent well over 30 years in senior positions in the government, again, often doing things you would disagree with, but doing them by his lights for the country.CLARK: You know, there is something to be said. And I hope that as we are in the very challenging time that we are facing in Congress that all of us remember the responsibility that is placed with us. And I think it is part of the moment that we are in that we have a president that demeans public service, that uses his office for his own enrichment and fosters and creates deep cynicism about government and wanting to serve people. So I hope this is a moment that my colleagues will reflect on why we're here in Congress, and that is to fight for the American people and to make life better for them.INSKEEP: Well, let's talk, if I can, about your work now. We heard Tamara Keith say something about maybe some signs of ice thawing in the shutdown. Any idea what she's talking about?CLARK: Well, I certainly hope that today is the day that House Republicans decide to come back to Washington, break their five-week vacation that they have taken and get to work. We need to end this shutdown. We need to make sure that we are addressing the health care crisis that the Republican Party has created and get some relief for people that are looking at sky-high premiums.INSKEEP: I want to ask about that, but I also want to check because you said you hope that today is the day. Is that just a hope, or do you have some information?CLARK: You know, it is a hope because as of right now, Speaker Johnson has said we are not in session this week. He has not come to the negotiating table once. We have a president who calls himself the great negotiator who not only left the country during a shutdown but has done anything but sit down with Democrats and negotiate.INSKEEP: Well, let's talk about that because President Trump was on \"60 Minutes\" over the weekend and was asked if he would help to end the standoff, as he tried to do during his first term. And here's some of his response. Let's listen.(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"60 MINUTES\")PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm not going to do it by being extorted by the Democrats, who have lost their way. There's something wrong with these people.NORAH O'DONNELL: So then what happens on November...TRUMP: Schumer is...INSKEEP: OK. Being extorted by the Democrats - that's how he describes your demand to restore or extend Obamacare subsidies. I'm recalling that during battles in the Obama administration, President Obama, after trying to negotiate with Republicans, finally said, it's up to you guys. Do your job. What would you say to the president effectively telling you, do your job?CLARK: You know, Donald Trump has said he is both president and speaker. He needs to tell Mike Johnson and Senator Thune to come to the table and negotiate. It is very hard. I'm a lawyer. I've been a lawmaker for some time. You cannot negotiate by yourselves. And the president has had one brief meeting before the shutdown with Democratic leadership, and that's it. That's not how negotiations work. Posts on Truth Social are not a substitute for putting the American people first. And he is so busy building ballrooms, holding \"Great Gatsby\" celebrations, sending $40 billion to Argentina while he's making the choice to withhold food. Talk about holding hostages. It's outrageous behavior that they will not come to the table to work on making life easier and less expensive for American families.INSKEEP: Got about 20 seconds here, but I just want to ask directly. I realize it's not your choice to be out of session for the past month-plus. But I've been thinking about this. I'm a taxpayer, which means I help to pay for Congress. Am I getting any value at all out of Congress at this time?CLARK: You know, it is a really hard case to make when we have federal workers who are showing up for work and not getting paid and we have Mike Johnson saying in the House, we are going to get paid and not show up for work. Isn't that sort of the basic of what they owe the American people? And today would be a good day to come to work and make sure we can get relief.INSKEEP: Representative Clark, Katherine Clark, thanks so much.CLARK: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

Rollins asserted on X on Sunday that an unprecedented and controversial data demand her agency made to states earlier this year had revealed troubling things about SNAP. The U.S. Department of Agriculture ordered states to turn over the personal data of all SNAP recipients over the last five years, including names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers and addresses.   \n   \"[W]e told every state to send us their SNAP data so we could make sure illegal immigrants aren't getting benefits meant for American families,\" Rollins wrote.   \"In just the states that cooperated, we've already uncovered massive fraud,\" the post continues. \"The Democrat Party has turned its back on working Americans and built its entire strategy around protecting illegal aliens. They know if the handouts stop, those illegals will go back home, and Democrats will lose 20+ seats after the next census.\"   Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for SNAP benefits and never have been. Only certain categories of lawfully present noncitizens are eligible for the program, and state officials verify their status during the application process using a federal data system. Parents of U.S. citizens can sign their kids up regardless of their own immigration status.   \n   Most states with Democratic governors have refused to turn over their SNAP recipients' data to USDA, citing federal privacy laws. A federal judge in San Francisco blocked the USDA from withholding funding from states that do not comply and ruled last month that states were likely to prove the data demand was not lawful.   NPR reporting last month found that at least 27 mostly Republican states did turn over data for millions of people to USDA. (Rollins has since said 29 states had turned over their data though a USDA spokesperson acknowledged she had mistakenly identified Colorado as a state that had given data).   \n   In an appearance on Fox News on Sunday, Rollins elaborated on what she said the states' SNAP data revealed.   \"We have found thousands and thousands of illegal use of the EBT card,\" Rollins said, referring to the electronic benefit transfer cards used by SNAP recipients. \"We have been moving people off of SNAP. We've got almost 700,000 people, I think we've moved off just since the president took office. We've arrested about 118 people.\"   She added, \"We found one guy in six different states getting a benefit. We found about 5000 people that are dead who are still getting benefits.\"   People with experience analyzing SNAP and other safety net programs say such statistics need more detail and context and about how they were calculated to be evaluated.   \"We have real questions about how they've arrived at these numbers,\" said Nicole Schneidman, an attorney with the nonprofit, Protect Democracy. Schneidman represents SNAP recipients and hunger and privacy groups who sued over USDA's data demand to states.   \"One thing that's really important for people to keep in mind is that 42 million people across the country receive SNAP on a monthly basis. And so these numbers that are being referenced are trivial in the grand scheme of the millions of people across the country who are receiving SNAP,\" Schneidman said.   Tracy Roof, a political scientist at the University of Richmond, pointed out that Rollins asserted she had removed 700,000 people from the program, but did not specify why.   \n   \"If they're only arresting a little over 100 people, then clearly a lot of those 700,000 people are not committing fraud,\" Roof said. \"They are probably people being removed from the rolls because of recent legislative changes.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                An employee with the Houston Food Bank fills boxes with free goods during their special food distribution at the NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, on Nov. 1, 2025. Approximately one in eight Americans receive food stamp benefits from the U.S. government.\n                \n                    Mark Felix/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mark Felix/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Deep cuts that Congress approved to SNAP earlier this year mean that some people are no longer eligible for the program, such as certain categories of lawfully present noncitizens.   And while Rollins has suggested there was something suspicious about the fact that SNAP has expanded in recent years, Root said the reason is \"because of the high prices for food and the fact that a lot of people just can't stretch their dollars from their incomes enough to be able to feed their families.\"   \n   Some in the pro-Trump media space quickly reported that Rollins had found huge numbers of undocumented immigrants enrolled in SNAP, even though she did not explicitly make that claim. The host of Fox and Friends, Rachel Campos-Duffy, claimed, without evidence, that \"20% of illegals are on SNAP\" in a question to Rollins.   The narrative fits into a larger rhetorical strategy by the Trump administration, said Roof.   \"The same thing is being done with Medicaid to say that Democrats are trying to provide coverage to all these illegal immigrants, which it's not,\" Roof said.   The USDA did not respond to a request for more information about the agency's findings in the state data, including whether it had identified ineligible immigrants improperly receiving SNAP benefits.   Even before Rollins' latest comments, right-wing influencers have been promoting false claims about immigrants accessing SNAP on social media.   Noncitizens account for less than five percent of SNAP beneficiaries, according to USDA data from 2023. \"Immigrants who are eligible take up SNAP at lower rates than U.S.-born people,\" said Julia Gelatt, the associate director of the U.S. program at Migration Policy Institute. Gelatt said participation rates are especially low for eligible members in mixed status families.   \n   The USDA is verifying the citizenship or immigration status of all SNAP recipients whose data they receive from states, according to the USDA's filings in federal court. The agency is using a federal data system known as SAVE that the Trump administration has turned into a citizenship look up tool by linking various data sets for the first time. USDA has not yet revealed the findings of its SAVE checks.   Protect Democracy's Nicole Schneidman said she had concerns at the outset of USDA's data collection from states that it could be used to bolster an inaccurate narrative about fraud to justify shrinking the program.   \n   \"These claims, and the strategy of trying to undermine the caliber of a fundamental social safety net in this country, is exactly what we always feared would transpire should they receive this data from the states and manipulate it for these kinds of ends,\" Schneidman said.\n",

The cause was complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, the statement said. Cheney had dealt with a history of heart problems.   \"Dick Cheney was a great and good man who taught his children and grandchildren to love our country, and to live lives of courage, honor, love, kindness, and fly fishing,\" the statement said. \"We are grateful beyond measure for all Dick Cheney did for our country. And we are blessed beyond measure to have loved and been loved by this noble giant of a man.\"   In a statement, former President George W. Bush, who picked Cheney as his vice president, said the death \"is a loss to the nation and a sorrow to his friends. Laura and I will remember Dick Cheney for the decent, honorable man that he was.\"   Bush added that Cheney \"was a calm and steady presence in the White House amid great national challenges. I counted on him for his honest, forthright counsel, and he never failed to give his best.\"   \n   An inauspicious beginning   There was little in Cheney's early life to foreshadow the immensely influential role he would one day play at the highest levels of American politics. Born the son of a government conservation worker in Lincoln, Neb., in 1941, he would flunk out of Yale University and work as a lineman for a power company in his new home state of Wyoming. Toss in a pair of drunken-driving convictions, and it's an inauspicious young adulthood.   But turn it around Cheney did: marriage to his high school sweetheart, Lynn; two children; a college degree at the University of Wyoming; graduate school at the University of Wisconsin.   While Cheney was turning his life around, the U.S. was caught in the throes of the Vietnam War. Cheney supported that war but never fought in it. He received five military deferments. Critics would seize upon this decades later, as Cheney helped lead the U.S. into another controversial war — this one in Iraq.   Ordinary to extraordinary   The future vice president began his political career as a congressional intern in 1969. That same year he went to work for a future partner in the Bush administration — Donald Rumsfeld, who ran an economics office in the Nixon White House.   \n   Cheney left the White House before Nixon's resignation, but in 1974 he was back working for the new president, Gerald Ford. Cheney moved up quickly, becoming Ford's chief of staff at the age of 34.   It was then that he began to develop a philosophy that would come to full flower in the White House of George W. Bush. His belief was that the power of the presidency must be not only protected, but also restored. In the 1970s, he watched as Congress enacted reforms in response to Watergate and to Vietnam.   \"We've seen the War Powers Act, an anti-impoundment control act, and time after time after time, administrations have traded away the authority of the president to do his job,\" he said in a 2002 interview on Fox News. \"We're not going to do that in this administration. The president is bound and determined to defend those principles and to pass on this office, his and mine, to future generations in better shape than we found it.\"   \n   War, a recurring theme   In 1978, Cheney ran for Congress in Wyoming and won. That was also the year he suffered the first of a series of heart attacks. He served in Congress for a decade and finally gave up his seat to become secretary of defense for President George H.W. Bush.    This job brought Cheney's first confrontation with Saddam Hussein, when he directed Operation Desert Storm in the Middle East. The war ended quickly after Iraqi troops were evicted from Kuwait. At the time, there were some who felt the U.S. should continue all the way to Baghdad and topple Saddam's regime. President Bush declined; in 1994, Cheney defended that decision.   \"The notion that we ought to now go to Baghdad and somehow take control of the country strikes me as an extremely serious one in terms of what we'd have to do once we got there,\" he said. \"You'd probably have to put some new government in place. It's not clear what kind of government that would be, how long you'd have to stay. For the U.S. to get involved militarily in determining the outcome of the struggle over who's going to govern in Iraq strikes me as a classic definition of a quagmire.\"   \n   Cheney left the Pentagon when the first President Bush lost to Bill Clinton. Two years later, he flirted with a presidential run of his own but instead headed to the private sector, joining the giant energy services company Halliburton.   \n   Changing the vice presidency — and foreign policy   The job made Cheney a wealthy man, but he stayed involved in conservative politics. In 2000, he was asked by Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush to lead the search for a running mate. Bush later made a surprise announcement that he had chosen none other than Cheney.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Dick Cheney and George W.

Cheney also redefined the office of the vice president. He became President Bush's closest adviser and a dominant player in shaping policy. Critics alleged that Cheney was really the man in charge at the White House.    The events of Sept. 11, 2001, only reinforced this notion. While Bush was in Florida that day, Cheney was at the White House. He was literally carried by Secret Service agents to an underground bunker. In an interview years later on NBC's Meet the Press, Cheney said it was he who told Bush not to return to the White House.   \"I said, 'Delay your return. We don't know what's going on here but it looks like, you know, we've been targeted,'\" Cheney said, adding that \"things that we did later on that day tied directly to guaranteeing presidential succession.\"   \n   After the Sept. 11 attacks, Cheney advocated an aggressive new foreign policy in which potential threats would be met with swift, preemptive action. No longer would the U.S. wait for an enemy to strike first. He helped sell the Iraq War by issuing dire warnings to the American people. At the same time, he famously predicted that the mission itself would be relatively easy.   On Meet the Press, Tim Russert, who then hosted the show, asked Cheney if the American people were ready for a long, bloody battle.   \n   \"I don't think it's likely to unfold that way, Tim, because I really do believe we will be greeted as liberators,\" Cheney said.   As the war dragged on, Democrats seized that statement as evidence of how Cheney's determination to go to war had clouded his judgment. There was talk that his views had changed from his earlier days in politics.   Controversy follows Cheney   While Cheney's disposition was never particularly sunny, critics assailed the vice president as a relentlessly grim figure. Late-night comics called him Darth Vader. Even President Bush had fun with his vice president's image on Halloween one year.   \"This morning I was with the vice president,\" Bush told reporters. \"I was asking him what costume he was planning. He said, 'Well, I'm already wearing it,' and then he mumbled something about the dark side of the force.\"   There were other controversies that dogged Cheney as the Bush administration's popularity plummeted in its second term. In 2007, his chief of staff and top adviser, Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, was convicted of perjury in an investigation into the leaking of the name of covert CIA operative Valerie Plame. Cheney was not implicated in the case legally, but he was tainted by the scandal nonetheless.   \n   Then, in what was one of the more bizarre incidents involving someone as high-ranking an official as Cheney, he accidentally shot and wounded a friend, attorney Harry Whittington, in the face and chest with birdshot pellets during a 2006 weekend quail-hunting trip at a Texas ranch.   Even in a strange story like this, some of the classic Cheney traits, such as secrecy, were on display. The story didn't come out for two days, and when it finally did, Cheney himself took days longer to speak about it, finally doing an interview with Fox News.   On Cheney's final day in office, he sat in a wheelchair, the result of an accident, bundled up against the frigid cold, and watched as President Barack Obama was sworn in.   \n   Out of office, he emerged as a frequent and outspoken critic of the Obama administration, even accusing the president of not understanding that the U.S. was at war.   In February 2010 he made a surprise appearance at CPAC, the conservative political action conference in Washington. The crowd erupted.   It was one of the last moments of big public adulation for Cheney. With the rise of Donald Trump, Cheney's brand of politics and his interventionist foreign policy fell out of favor in the party. Trump would often lambaste Cheney for launching what he called \"forever wars.\"   It carried into the next generation as Trump attacked Cheney's daughter, former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), when she voted for Trump's impeachment after a riot at the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.   Trumps relentless criticism of her contributed to Liz Cheney's defeat when she ran for reelection in 2022. Along the way, her feather appeared in television spots on her behalf.   \"In our nation's 246-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,\" Dick Cheney said in the ad.   It was his last big public moment in the political arena. Two years later, he would endorse Democrat Kamala Harris over Trump for president.   In the end, the power of the Cheney name was greatly diminished in GOP politics. His legacy became one of contradictions: Trump supporters despised him, while some Democrats embraced him — if reluctantly — and still many others would always condemn him as a war criminal for his role in Iraq.   Now Cheney has died, with a legacy in government service, foreign policy and the balance of power between the branches of government. No matter his contradictory legacy, he leaves behind a personal stamp on a presidency greater than any vice president before him.\n",

In a court filing, officials said depleting that fund means \"no funds will remain for new SNAP applicants certified in November, disaster assistance, or as a cushion against the potential catastrophic consequences of shutting down SNAP entirely.\"   Starting Nov. 1, SNAP benefits did not hit accounts as expected after the USDA, which administers SNAP, froze funding, citing the federal government shutdown. The shutdown is now in its 35th day.   \n   It is unclear when low-income families who depend on SNAP will receive these partial funds. The Trump administration said it anticipates long delays — \"anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months\" — before benefits arrive in the hands of registered SNAP recipients.   President Trump threw the plans into further uncertainty by posting on Truth Social that benefits \"will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!\" It is unclear if that means the government will not follow what it stated in court filings.     Last week, two federal judges ordered the Trump administration to use emergency funding to provide SNAP benefits for the 42 million people who rely on the program to feed their families. U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston ruled the Trump administration has until Monday to decide whether to pay at least partial SNAP food benefits but did not issue a temporary restraining order. In Rhode Island, U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. granted a temporary restraining order and said the Trump administration must submit a plan on how it would comply with his order, or \"at least an update,\" by noon on Monday, Ocean State Media reported. Both judges were appointed by former President Barack Obama.   \n      Are you worried about your SNAP benefits? NPR wants to hear your story      SNAP, the country's largest anti-hunger program, dates back to the Great Depression and has never been disrupted this way. Most recipients are seniors, families with kids and people with disabilities.   Food banks are stretched thin   In the few days since SNAP funding elapsed, food banks across the country have experienced a surge of people in need of their services, leading to long lines and widespread worries about how they will meet the escalating demand in the coming weeks. Some food bank administrators warn that it may soon amount to a public health crisis.   Small grocery stores, local farmers, and other retailers authorized to accept SNAP benefits are also bracing for changes as many of their usual customers are without the means to pay for food this month.   Some local communities have set up informal systems to support their neighbors in need of food assistance. In several cities, food banks have collaborated with government officials to connect residents with food resources. Others put out calls for volunteers to support their work.   While many food banks have previously dealt with difficult situations like natural disasters that strained their operations, the scale of this nationwide shutdown represents an unprecedented national food crisis. Senior citizens may be disproportionately impacted.   — Anusha Mathur, NPR   Read more: 'The helpers need help'. Food banks brace for impact as SNAP cliff looms   Reporters from the NPR Network are covering the uncertainty and lapse in benefits in states across the country.   Here's what we know so far.      State-specific impacts:   Alabama   Roughly 749,000 people are enrolled in SNAP in Alabama, according to the USDA. In 2024, SNAP assistance reached 15% of the state population (1 in 7 people). Alabama's Department of Human Resources (DHR), the agency responsible for SNAP in the state, says on its website that individuals can still apply for SNAP benefits during the suspension and DHR will continue to process applications and determine eligibility. Benefits will not be issued until the suspension is lifted.Current SNAP recipients, however, \"must continue to recertify their benefits, report as they normally would, and submit all documentation that would normally be required for them to continue in the program,\" DHR says. This is necessary so that each SNAP recipient can more quickly use their November funds in the grocery stores.   \n      Alaska   Roughly 66,000 people are enrolled in SNAP in Alaska, according to the USDA. The Alaska Department of Health said on Oct. 31 that it had not received funding for November's SNAP benefits [Alaska Public Media]Officials say the division will continue adding SNAP beneficiaries during the shutdown and Alaskans who lost food because of Typhoon Halong in western Alaska can apply to get October SNAP benefits re-issued. Michelle DeWitt, executive director of Bethel Community Services Foundation, said the state's formal food security safety nets are already stretched thin in the wake of the early October storm. [Alaska Public Media]Sen. Lisa Murkowski told NPR's Scott Detrow that she hopes that contingency funding can be used to help pay out SNAP benefits, particularly for those impacted by Typhoon Halong. \"I have seen different statements indicating that these contingency funds need to be reserved for disasters,\" she said on Friday. \"For those SNAP recipients in Alaska who have suffered this disaster, yeah, we want to make sure that they have some level of assistance or relief there.\"      Arizona   More than 887,000 people are enrolled in SNAP in Arizona, according to the USDA. Indigenous communities, including the Navajo and Cherokee Nations have been hit particularly hard. A third of Navajo households depend on SNAP. Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. declared a state of emergency \"due to this federally imposed food crisis.\" [KJZZ]The Arizona Department of Economic Security, which administers SNAP in the state, is directing Arizona SNAP recipients to local food banks if they need immediate food assistance. Food banks in Arizona can be found through the Arizona Food Bank Network. [KJZZ]      Arkansas   Roughly 236,000 people are enrolled in SNAP in Arkansas, according to the USDA. Arkansas' Department of Human Services says SNAP beneficiaries should prepare for a delay or disruption in November benefits, according to an Oct. 22 post on the agency website. The agency is awaiting further guidance from USDA.Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders directed $500,000 to six food bank networks across Arkansas, blaming Democrats for the shutdown and the impact on SNAP beneficiaries in her state: \"The simplest, fastest solution remains for Democrats to reopen the government and fund programs like SNAP, but in the meantime, my administration will work with our legislators, churches, and food banks to help feed Arkansans.\"Arkansas' DHS is pushing SNAP recipients to find local food pantries, churches and other organizations for temporary food assistance and to check for eligibility of other food programs. As the benefits run dry, some community members have established informal systems to foot their neighbors' grocery bills. [Little Rock Public Radio]   \n      California   Over 5.5 million people are enrolled in CalFresh — the state's implementation of the federally funded SNAP program. Well over 1 million people in LA County. The other major SoCal counties — San Bernardino, Riverside and Orange — each have more than 300,000 people on CalFresh,according to state data. [LAist]Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Oct. 22 that he would deploy the California National Guard to support food banks across California as the federal government shutdown drags on. [KQED] Early into November, food banks and pantries in Los Angeles are already experiencing an uptick in people needing their services [LAist]. In the San Francisco area, local restaurants and businesses have stepped up to feed families depending on CalFresh [KQED] and have been relying on volunteer support [KQED].

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  The many voices we're hearing about this election include Faiz Shakir. He is the chief political adviser of independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. He directs the media organization More Perfect Union. He's come by Studio 31 this morning. We've got him some coffee with a little cream. Is that right? Did we get you - is it good?FAIZ SHAKIR: Thank you, Steve.INSKEEP: OK.SHAKIR: Good to see you.INSKEEP: It's the staff who brought it by. Glad it's according to your order. So how will you read first the New York results?SHAKIR: Well, already Zohran Mamdani has engineered a massive turnout. If you go back to the 2024 election, Steve, and you say, what were the challenges of the Democratic Party and the Harris campaign? It's that they didn't mobilize traditional constituencies and get new voters into the voting booths.INSKEEP: Yeah.SHAKIR: And it was a - one of the reasons why she didn't win. Here you have Zohran Mamdani almost answering for the problem. He's in the primary and now in the general - if you look at the early vote turnout in New York, already engineering massive turnout, particularly among constituencies - people of color, young people - who were least likely to vote in the last election cycle. And that's good news.INSKEEP: There's a couple of different ways I could think about Mamdani's appeal, and one is he's a Democratic socialist and he has a certain set of policies. But another way to think of him maybe is just that he's young and he's talented and different, and so he's interesting to younger people. Which do you think it is?SHAKIR: He's all of those, and he has an agenda that speaks affirmatively at a time when I think one of the struggles of the Democratic brand is, what are you going to do if I put you into power? What are the answers to the solutions that you want to bring? Here comes Zohran Mamdani saying, hey, buses fast and free, child care universal, new grocery stores to service underserved populations. Here comes taxes that - we tax more on the rich. These are affirmative visions of a society that we want to have. And I think Mamdani has tried to hopefully urge a lot of other Democrats to say, campaign on the back of something, not just against Donald Trump.INSKEEP: Just to be clear, you're saying these are not symbolic promises. People will expect him to deliver those exact things if he is elected.SHAKIR: Thankfully, Mamdani is impressive in this way that he understood the tools that the mayor actually has. When he says freeze the rent, he knows that that's a power that the mayor has. When he talks about expanding bus lanes...INSKEEP: Yeah.SHAKIR: ...That's something he has already done. So I think he's been grounded in what are the actual authorities that the mayor has, and how can I use them to do something for you?INSKEEP: Although, I think I just want to pause on this for a moment. I mean, the mayor does have the authority to freeze the rent. The city government messes with rent all the time in New York, and the rent is still too damn high. I mean, rent control doesn't seem to have worked in New York City. Is there...SHAKIR: Because what...INSKEEP: ...A danger in making these promises that maybe you can't do much with?SHAKIR: Well, one of the challenges of a candidate at this moment - any candidate - is integrity. When you say you're going to fight for somebody, is it in your bones? Is it in your DNA? One of the reasons I think Mamdani's succeeding and so many people - Bernie Sanders is so popular right now is that there's a sense that while corruption is all abound around us in politics - Trump is certainly leading the way in the most corrupt government we've seen in our modern lifetimes - here comes people with integrity saying, we may disagree, but the North Star solution is improving your life. And know that when I'm in office, I won't forget about you. I am wholly focused on it. You can trust me.INSKEEP: I want to underline another aspect of this that I'm sure you're very familiar with. Mamdani has become a big star on Fox News, possibly the biggest star short of Sean Hannity. He's on all the time. People are warned about him continuously. He actually went on Fox News and took some questions, of course. But I'm curious if you think that kind of intense attention by Republicans helps him or hurts him.SHAKIR: Well, you know, nationally, it's a challenge because Zohran Mamdani is a New York City mayoral candidate, and he has done a fantastic job of making himself aware to the people of New York City. Now, if you live in Nebraska or if you live in California, if you live in Arizona, you know, why does Zohran Mamdani matter to you? Not much. But Fox News has decided and the right has decided, well, I want to tell you that this is scary - a scary proposition. And I suspect that one of the lessons that comes out of the Mamdani campaign is that people in Arizona, Nebraska, California will have to figure out the way that they speak to their own constituencies that learn some lessons about the successes that Mamdani's had, both in how he's communicated but the fact that he's got a substantive agenda that people believe and trust in and want desperately. Especially as Trump - you know, leading our economy, I think, right now, as polling has suggested, he's the least popular he's ever been on the economy - 70% disapproval.INSKEEP: Let me ask about that because Trump is unpopular right now, and Democrats seem to be even more unpopular. And it's a close race, at least in New Jersey. We don't know what's going to happen there. Does it bother you that Democrats have not been able to take so much advantage of Trump's unpopularity?SHAKIR: We'll see. I mean, I - you know, you'll find out what the results of this were. If you look at 2024 election, Kamala Harris wins both of those states by six points. So that's the baseline heading into this election cycle. If you go back to how Trump - how we did in the first Trump term, you know, Virginia - I think the gubernatorial candidate there was a Democrat, Ralph Northam. He won by nine points. In New Jersey, they won by double digits in Trump's first term. So I think you can overperform the baselines of plus-six if that's the way you're looking at it.INSKEEP: I guess I'm just thinking Democrats don't seem to have a very coherent national message at this point.SHAKIR: Well, yes. You're right. And I - you know, that's one of my challenges and problems and frustrations right now, is that you should go into this election cycle saying, here's three, four, five things that we as Democrats want to do. That said, there's an energy and enthusiasm out there among the public that is incredible. Already in the - Trump's second term, you're seeing more activism and action and grassroots engagement than you did in Trump's first term.INSKEEP: Faiz Shakir, chief political adviser to Bernie Sanders, thanks so much.SHAKIR: Thank you, Steve.

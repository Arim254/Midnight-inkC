The resolution failed by a vote of 215 to 215, falling short of the simple majority needed for passage. It directed the U.S. to remove any military presence from Venezuela, which would have required the president to seek congressional approval to order such action.   \n   Rep. Brian Mast, the House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman, said the U.S. military completed its Venezuela mission with \"Operation Absolute Resolve,\" the Jan. 3 U.S. invasion and capture of Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro and his wife.   \"'Operation Absolute Resolve' was a law enforcement action to bring Nicolás Maduro, an indicted narco-terrorist with a $50 million bounty, to justice,\" Mast, R-Fla., said on the House floor, echoing a familiar GOP refrain. \"And President Trump finished the job.\"   Ultimately, the war powers resolution led by Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., drew support from all Democrats and two Republicans, Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Don Bacon, R-Neb. Supporters argued Congress should have a say before the U.S. sends additional military forces into Venezuela.   \n   \"I guess the best we can get from the current majority here is that there's never a good time for Congress to assert its war powers. It's either too soon or it's too late,\" McGovern argued. \"Well, I don't think it's too late because we're still dealing with the consequences of this unauthorized, unlawful military strike.\"   Trump's escalation of military action targeting Venezuela has drawn widespread bipartisan unease in Congress, with some Republicans expressing their concerns behind closed doors. Many have complained they were caught by surprise, the administration has not shared enough information about the mission and the plan ahead remains murky.   \n   Massie, however, is not one of them.   \"Our loyalty must be to the Constitution and not to any party,\" Massie argued on the House floor ahead of the vote. \"If our country wants war then Congress must vote on it. We are the voice of the people.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      How do Biden-to-Trump voters feel about year one of Trump's second term? A focus group of Pennsylvania voters provides some unique insight.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  OK, with America so polarized, swing voters - meaning those who shift between parties and candidates - are key for determining who wins elections. For a little insight into how some swing voters are viewing the first year of President Trump's second term, we're joined now by NPR's senior national political correspondent Mara Liasson, who observed a unique focus group. Hi, Mara.MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi there.CHANG: Hi. OK, so tell us about what made this focus group so interesting to you.LIASSON: Well, first of all, a focus group is not a poll. It's not a statistically significant sample. But it can provide a lot of information on the why - why voters feel a certain way. So we have a focus group of 14 voters, all from Pennsylvania. They voted for Joe Biden in 2020, then swung to Donald Trump in 2024. And this is part of NPR's Swing Voter Project, and it's conducted by two research firms, Engagious and Sego. NPR is the media partner. And these focus groups are going to occur monthly, so we're going to be bringing you these insights every month.CHANG: Oh, interesting. OK, so the 14 voters, do we know their political leanings?LIASSON: Yes. They are right-leaning. More identify as Republicans and independents than Democrats. But one thing they have all in common is they take a very dim view of both major parties. They were asked to use one word to describe each party. Here's what they had to say about Republicans.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #1: Trump.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #2: Weak.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #3: Conservative.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #4: Bewildered.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #5: Outspoken.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #6: Patriotic.KIMBERLY: Loyal.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #7: Immoral.LIASSON: And here's what they said about Democrats.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #8: Distracted.KIMBERLY: Unprepared.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #1: Panicked.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #5: Sensitive.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #2: Whiny.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #9: Scary.GRACE: Disoriented.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #10: Corrupt.UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT #11: Weak.LIASSON: So even though most independent voters actually align with one party or the other, their displeasure with both parties are why they move back and forth.CHANG: Clearly. OK. These voters, I understand, were asked a lot of topics in the news, like immigration, Venezuela, Greenland. You listened in. Was there a main takeaway for you?LIASSON: My main takeaway was these voters have not abandoned Trump altogether, but they want him to focus less on foreign affairs and more on the economy. And more importantly, they feel like all the action with Venezuela and Greenland is chaotic, and it's making them economically anxious. Here's one voter, Grace (ph) - only used her first name. And in this clip, you can hear the moderator of the focus group, Rich Thau.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GRACE: When the invasion occurred with Venezuela, no one in America had any idea that that was going to happen. We just turned on the news. They went in in darkness, and it just happened. So now I feel like, what's next? I have this feeling of, I don't know what's going to happen next.RICH THAU: And that's causing economic anxiety for you (ph)?GRACE: Correct.LIASSON: Now, the White House says Trump is going to talk more about the economy, he's going to take weekly trips, but they haven't always been able to get him to focus on that. Voters in our group were frustrated. They said Trump was too focused on Greenland and Venezuela and not getting the Nobel Peace Prize. And even voters who see some good things happening are still unsatisfied, like Kimberly (ph), who's an independent from Philadelphia.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KIMBERLY: Aside from gas being down, aside from the border being closed - those are two great things - but I really don't see the president speaking to working individuals.LIASSON: So you're going to hear that message from Democrats.CHANG: OK. Well, given some of the critical comments we've just heard, were any of the participants regretting their vote?LIASSON: Very, very few - 8 out of the 14 said they disapprove of Trump's job performance, but only two voters said they would vote for Harris if there was a do-over. So what we're going to be watching over the next 10 months is how these mixed feelings shape the midterms. Trump is not on the ballot, but Republicans are, and views of Trump will shape voter choices.CHANG: That is NPR's Mara Liasson. Thank you so much, Mara.LIASSON: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The president said he wouldn't use force to take control of Greenland. But his remarks were again highly critical of U.S. allies in Europe and elsewhere.\n                \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Evan Vucci/AP\n    \n\n   \n   President Trump has backed off his threat to take Greenland by force.   Yet Trump still delivered a fresh round of highly inflammatory remarks at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday that once again rattled U.S. allies and threatened to tear down the pillars of the world order constructed by Washington 80 years ago.   \"I don't have to use force. I don't want to use force. I won't use force,\" Trump said of Greenland in a lengthy speech to the world leaders and other prominent figures assembled for the annual event in Davos, Switzerland.    The president made clear he still wants the territory. Later, he took to social media and claimed there was a \"framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region.\"   \n   Greenland was the crisis of the day. Yet it also reflected how Trump's demands have created an increasingly hostile relationship with U.S. allies, leading to head-spinning changes to these long-standing partnerships.    U.S. allies have often tried to appease Trump to avoid open confrontation. However, his demand for territory belonging to Denmark, a close U.S. partner and a founding member of NATO, has crossed a line and prompted blunt responses from some.   Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech Tuesday at Davos went viral when he said the global order, built by the U.S. out of the ashes of World War II, is now tumbling down.    \"Today I will talk about a rupture in the world order, the end of a pleasant fiction and the beginning of a harsh reality, where geopolitics, where the large, main power, geopolitics, is submitted to no limits, no constraints,\" he said.   Carney didn't mention Trump by name, but the implication was clear.   In a sign of the times, the Canadian leader visited China last week, where he signed an economic agreement that calls for China to sell electric vehicles to Canada. The move comes as Trump's tariffs on Canada have caused trade tensions over the past year. To drive home that point, Carney said China was now a more reliable partner than the U.S.   \n   Trump undermines global networks   Prior to Trump, nearly all U.S. presidents since World War II have worked largely from the same playbook based on a global network of military alliances, an emphasis on free trade and calls for greater democracy.   \n   The U.S. and its allies have hugely benefited from this system, though as the world has changed, many of these institutions have not kept pace. Trump often describes them as burdens that inhibit his desire for swift, decisive action.   Trump has taken aim at military alliances such as NATO. He has tossed out long-standing trade arrangements in favor of punishing tariffs. He frequently dismisses political, diplomatic and cultural ties built up over decades.   \"The American-dominated liberal world order is over,\" Robert Kagan, of the Brookings Institution, wrote in a recent essay in The Atlantic.    \"This is not because the United States proved materially incapable of sustaining it. Rather, the American order is over because the United States has decided that it no longer wishes to play its historically unprecedented role of providing global security. The American might that upheld the world order of the past 80 years will now be used instead to destroy it,\" Kagan said.    Trump says his actions fall under the broad banner of \"America First.\" And in his first term, Trump consistently sought to keep U.S. forces out of foreign conflicts.    But in his second term, Trump has often turned to the military. In the past year, the U.S. has bombed four countries in the Middle East (Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen) and two in Africa (Nigeria and Somalia). Trump has threatened others, both friends and foes. And the U.S. recently ousted Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro.   An argument based on false statements    In his speech at Davos, and in many other remarks, Trump makes his case with statements that are demonstrably false.   \n   \"NATO has treated the U.S. very badly. We've never asked for anything. We've never got anything,\" Trump said on Wednesday.    After the al-Qaida terrorist attacks in 2001, NATO countries rushed to join the U.S. in the war in Afghanistan. This was the first and only time that NATO's Article 5 was triggered — the section saying an attack on one is an attack on all.   More than 1,000 troops from other NATO countries were killed in Afghanistan supporting the U.S.-led war. (The U.S. lost more than 2,400 troops in Afghanistan.)   Trump repeatedly portrays Europe as weak and in decline, unable to carry its weight on the global stage. But Europe and other allies still have ways to push back against the U.S. For starters, the U.S. has more than 700 military bases outside the U.S., with many in Europe.   Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who generally has good relations with Trump, recently criticized his approach to Greenland, which has included threats of tariffs against her country.     \"This strategy is wrong,\" she said. \"So what do you mean, that we must leave NATO? That we must close U.S. bases, we must sever trade relations, we must storm McDonald's?\"\n",

On Tuesday, NPR observed online focus groups with 14 voters from Pennsylvania who supported Joe Biden in 2020 and then swung to Trump in 2024. Seven of those voters identified themselves as Republicans, six identified as independents, and one identified as a Democrat.   The focus groups were part of the Swing Voter Project, conducted by the companies Engagious and Sago. NPR is a partner on the project.   \n   While focus groups don't provide a statistically significant sample like a poll does, they can provide insight into how some key voters view news events.   \n   In this case, eight voters said ICE is generally \"getting things about right,\" while six said it has \"gone too far.\" No one thought it has \"not gone far enough.\"   Rich Thau, president of Engagious and the moderator of the focus groups, said he observed \"a lot of frustration with ICE and how ICE has been performing around the United States\" with these Pennsylvania voters.   \"There was widespread awareness of what happened to Renee Good on Jan. 7,\" he said. \"You have a big division in these groups. It shows that there's an underlying frustration with how things are going and how things are being executed in the United States.\"   Divided blame for fatal ICE shooting in Minneapolis   Most voters had seen video of the shooting. Hassan C., a 39-year-old independent, said the agent who shot and killed Macklin Good was clearly to blame. (Participants agreed to be part of the focus groups on condition that they be identified by their first names and last initials only.)   \"From what I saw in the video, she was trying to drive away and the ICE agent moved out of the way,\" he said. \"He was no longer in harm's way. And when he started shooting her, he was no longer in the path of the vehicle.\"   \n   There were mixed opinions on who was more to blame for the incident, though. When asked, four voters blamed Macklin Good, five blamed the ICE agent, and another four said both were equally to blame.   Grace P., a 60-year-old Republican, was among the voters who felt both individuals were equally to blame. While she said that Macklin Good \"was putting herself in danger by even being there,\" she also felt the officer went too far.   \"These officers should be trained that you should never be shooting to kill,\" she said. \"There's something wrong with that scenario right there.\"   Kimberly K., a 46-year-old independent voter in Philadelphia, was one of the six voters who said ICE is generally \"getting things about right\" across the country. She said she has a \"soft spot\" for law enforcement officials because her husband worked in law enforcement for 33 years.   \"I know that's a job that not everybody can do,\" she said. \"So I just feel like a job needs to be done and they're doing it and there are other variables that make it very difficult.\"   Just two voters said Trump had any blame in the shooting, despite sending federal agents to Minnesota.   Voters want a clearer focus on the U.S. economy   A majority of the voters did, however, say that Trump needs to start focusing more on economic issues and less on foreign affairs.   In the last few weeks, the U.S. military seized Venezuela's leader and Trump has renewed his threats to acquire Greenland. When asked, all 14 voters said they were opposed to any use of force to acquire the territory. Trump on Wednesday backed off those threats and said a \"framework\" for a deal on Greenland had been reached with European leaders.   \n   \"There's a concern that he's trying to do too much on too many things and he's not singularly focused on the thing that matters to most of [voters], which is their pocketbooks,\" Thau said. \"Their frustration here is with the international activities — Greenland, Venezuela, Iran, Ukraine, Gaza, go down the list.\"   Matt A., a 31-year-old Republican, said Trump's lack of focus on economic issues has created more anxiety for him.   \"The everyday, middle-class working person sometimes gets forgotten in some of Trump's policies,\" he said.   \n   Jeremy F., a 39-year-old independent voter, said he \"definitely\" doesn't think that Trump \"cares about everyday people.\"   \"I mean, the way he lived his entire life well before he ever became president, he just only cared about money, prestige and himself,\" he said. \"It's all about him. It's him, you know? So, yeah, he's not worried about us.\"   Jeremy said Trump's focus on Venezuela and Greenland only frustrates him more because he said he voted for Trump in 2024 because \"it seemed that he was less of a war hawk.\"   \"He ran on that,\" he said. \"He ran very strongly opposing war and opposing military conflicts around the world. And now he's just going left and right and starting them.\"   Overall, eight of the 14 voters said they disapprove of Trump's job performance. But most of the group was also critical of Democrats, using words like \"weak\" and \"broken.\"\n",

Smith gave his first public testimony about his work Thursday, appearing before the House Judiciary Committee. Republican members of the panel attacked Smith's move to collect phone records of lawmakers who had been in contact with Trump allies around the time of the Capitol riot in 2021. And they cast the historic investigations of Trump as politically motivated.   \"It was always about politics and to get President Trump. They were willing to do almost anything,\" said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, the panel's chairman.   \n   \"I am not a politician, and I have no partisan loyalties,\" Smith responded. \"My office didn't spy on anyone.\"   Neither of Smith's cases reached a jury before Trump won the 2024 election and returned to the White House last year.   \n   In a videotaped deposition, Smith said the president had only himself to blame, for charges he tried to overturn the will of voters in 2020.   \"The evidence here made clear that President Trump was by a large measure the most culpable and most responsible person in this conspiracy,\" Smith said in the deposition, which congressional Republicans released on New Year's Eve. \"These crimes were committed for his benefit.\"   Smith said the violent attack at the U.S. Capitol, which injured 140 law enforcement officers, would not have happened, except for Trump. He said he could not understand the president's mass pardon of members of the Capitol mob on Trump's first day in office and predicted many of them would commit new crimes in the years ahead.   \n   \"No one should be above the law in our country, and the law required that he be held to account,\" Smith told lawmakers Thursday. \"So that is what I did.\"   He has been eager to defend the work of prosecutors and FBI agents who worked on the investigations of the president. Most of those people were fired after Trump returned to power.   Asked about regrets or mistakes, Smith said if anything, he would have expressed more appreciation for members of his team, who \"sacrificed\" so much during their government service.    \n   Trump suggests Justice Department should probe Smith   During the hearing, Trump posted on Truth Social that Smith was being \"decimated\" by Republican questions.   \"Jack Smith is a deranged animal, who shouldn't be allowed to practice Law,\" Trump wrote. \"Hopefully the Attorney General is looking at what he's done, including some of the crooked and corrupt witnesses that he was attempting to use in his case against me.\"   Smith declined an opportunity to respond directly to the president's words from the witness table, but he said he fully expected the Trump Justice Department to find a way to punish him. The Justice Department has already moved to bring criminal charges against two of the president's perceived foes.   \"I will not be intimidated,\" Smith said.   \n   Trump has promised at different times to launch a criminal investigation into Smith or even throw him out of the country.   One area where Smith tread carefully is the investigation into classified documents that the FBI found in a ballroom, a bathroom and an office at Trump's Florida resort. A second volume of Smith's final report that concerns that episode has been blocked from release by Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee who oversaw the case, but media organizations and nonprofit groups have pushed to release it.   Trump's personal lawyer made a fresh plea this week to keep those findings secret. The president argues that Smith's report contains grand jury and privileged materials that would hurt Trump's constitutional and privacy rights if released.\n",

    "body": "\n         Rahm Emanuel has been a fixture in Democratic Party politics for more than 30 years — serving as a member of Congress, President Obama's chief of staff, mayor of Chicago and ambassador to Japan.   He is now exploring a campaign for the presidency, an effort that seems designed to challenge some orthodoxies of that same party. He has argued that Democrats have the wrong focus on social issues, education and the economy. Appearing on a podcast with the conservative host Megyn Kelly, he answered a question about transgender people in a way she praised, and then he joked that he would need \"witness protection.\"   \n   Emanuel joined me for an extended NPR video interview in Washington, D.C., during which he expanded on his critique of Democrats, hammered the Trump administration and offered advice for the upcoming midterm elections that will decide control of Congress.   You can watch the full video interview above. Below are highlights:   He says the U.S. is throwing away global alliances   We spoke just after Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney delivered a much-noticed speech at the World Economic Forum, saying that the U.S.-led, rules-based world order was over, a \"fiction\" that other nations should abandon now that the U.S. itself no longer respects it. Carney was responding to President Trump, who had used a series of threats in a bid to take control of Greenland.   \"Carney's not wrong,\" Emanuel said. \"We just decided that it's a burden on us, and we're going to see the price for that. And that price will be more than the American people, in a host of issues–economic, political, strategic, defense-wise–than the American people are ready to bear alone.\"   He says the Trump administration betrays the idea of America held by Emanuel's family    He surely has told the story before, but Emanuel seemed genuinely moved while talking of photographs on his family's living room wall growing up. They showed 14 ancestors, \"28 eyes,\" many of whom perished in European pogroms or the Holocaust. \"We knew growing up that America was a very special place,\" he said.   \n   He said that idea of the country completely clashes with the spectacle of immigration agents flooding Minneapolis in recent weeks.   \"The idea that you have ICE agents chasing people, firing tear gas… The president attacking people on both religion, gender or faith… That is unimaginable,\" he said.   He says local governments should cooperate with ICE — in very limited cases   We had a lengthy exchange over whether local officials should collaborate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, even when they disagree with the mission. Tom Homan, President Trump's border czar, has said he wished Minneapolis would allow agents to arrest people without legal status who are held on unrelated offenses in local jails. Democratic officials have, in past administrations, asked for the same.   Emanuel said he would favor this for people in prison, \"one hundred percent,\" because people in prison have been convicted of crimes. He felt differently about jails, because \"I'm not sure what they're charged with.\"   He says both parties have failed students   Emanuel recently visited Mississippi, a conservative state that has dramatically improved student reading skills. He argued that success could be replicated elsewhere, if not for partisan politics.   \"Republicans have walked away from public education, abandoned it,\" he said. \"Democrats have abandoned accountability and standards.\"   He wants Democrats to spend more time on pocketbook issues   He argues Democrats spent too much time on social justice issues they couldn't win, such as transgender rights.   On Megyn Kelly's podcast, he was asked: \"Can a man become a woman?\" His answer was, \"No.\"   The remark seemed to go beyond debates about transgender children or trans athletes, rejecting the idea that transgender people exist at all.   Asked about this on NPR, Emanuel replied, \"That's not what I said.\" Here is the video of that exchange with him and Kelly.    In our interview, he explained what he wanted to convey – that the issue was a distraction. As mayor in 2016, he said, \"I passed an ordinance on bathroom access, but I never allowed it to distract me from high school graduation rates, reading scores and math scores.\"   \n   \"If I run and the issues on trans are the most important, I'm not your guy and I'm OK with that,\" he said.   He says there is one issue in the 2026 election   Emanuel urged Democrats to focus on Trump, who is unpopular, and the failure of other Republicans to restrain him in any way.   \"This is a referendum election. Keep it focused on the rubber stamp Republican Congress,\" Emanuel said. \"You have to win independents 2 to 1 to win the House. They are uncomfortable with Donald Trump and they're uncomfortable that nobody from the Roberts court, to the press and media, to the Republican Congress are putting a checkmate on him.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Scott Detrow speaks to Ashley Parker of The Atlantic about her essay recapping how President Trump's relentless boundary-pushing has exhausted his critics.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  Today, speaking in Europe, President Trump told an audience of global leaders that for now at least, he has decided the United States will not try to acquire Greenland by military force.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: 'Cause people thought I would use force. I don't have to use force. I don't want to use force. I won't use force.DETROW: The fact that I just read this sentence tells you a lot about the state of the Trump administration now a full year in. In international relations, tariffs, immigration enforcement, federal spending, federal prosecution, sending the military into cities and many more areas, Trump has repeatedly said and done things that were previously assumed to be unacceptable to voters. As Ashley Parker wrote in The Atlantic this week, the Trump administration has pushed the window of what is possible in American politics so far that his opposition just seems exhausted. Ashley, thank you for joining us again.ASHLEY PARKER: Thanks for having me.DETROW: I want to start with the title of your essay. The president has had this term for critics for years now that they suffer from Trump derangement syndrome. And you wrote that there's been so little meaningful resistance this term that we might think about Trump exhaustion syndrome instead. Can you tell me more about what you're thinking about with that?PARKER: Yeah, what I was really trying to explore with this piece one year into his second term was sort of the boiling frog theory of American politics. And I should say upfront that this theory is apocryphal. It's not actually true, but I think it works for our purposes.DETROW: Yes.PARKER: Which is - the way it goes is that if you drop a frog in boiling water, it will hop out. But if you put a frog in lukewarm water and slowly turn up the heat, it will not know to jump out because the changes will be so incremental and gradual, and it will boil to death.DETROW: I think you also gave a really good example when you talked about the boiling frog. You walk through the series of events leading up to the seizure of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela. Can you recap kind of how we got from point A to point B without any of the steps feeling overly dramatic?PARKER: Sure. So it really starts back when - in 2015 when Trump comes to national prominence as a politician in a campaign launch speech that demonizes immigrants broadly as, you know, criminals, rapists, not the best among us, people who are bringing drugs across the border. So he has been getting the country comfortable for a long time with the idea that undocumented immigrants are dangerous and they're a problem. But going to this term with Venezuela, he uses a fairly obscure wartime powers act, the Alien Enemies Act, to essentially declare that we are at war with Venezuela, specifically a Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua. And because we are at war with them, we're able to take certain wartime liberties to deport Venezuelans.DETROW: And a lot of opinion polls along the way showed that, by and large, a lot of these steps did have broad, if not a majority - you know, from time to time, a good chunk of Americans were on board with each of these steps.PARKER: Exactly. Now, there might be images they see of what this actually looks like that they kind of cringe at, but yeah, broadly, they support this. Then he begins a series of strikes on boats in the Caribbean and east Pacific oceans off the coast of Venezuela. And yes, a lot of these boats that are targeted, there are drugs on them. But it is not, as the president has claimed, you know, a huge mob or cartel boss headed to the United States. In some cases, these are small fishing boats, people who are petty criminals, bringing small amounts of cocaine, not to the United States but to neighboring islands like Trinidad. But again, I was talking to someone in the White House, and they said, look, if you ask the average American - should we blow up a boat with drugs on it headed to the United States? - they say, yes.DETROW: And that all sets the stage for the most recent seizure of another country's president...PARKER: Correct.DETROW: ...Who's brought to the United States and put on trial. And maybe, as Steve Bannon put it, a lot of people who read The Atlantic are upset about this. But maybe Americans are actually on board with a lot of this and the pushback to steps toward authoritarianism is a lot different than maybe what we thought it would be in high school social studies.PARKER: Yeah, that's exactly right. A slide towards authoritarianism, you know, when you talk to experts about this, including some of my colleagues, is - people sort of imagine it like the movie version, where there's, you know, men in jackboots marching in the streets and tanks rolling. And that's not really how it often starts. It's sort of a slow slide of getting people comfortable with things that they never thought they would be comfortable with.DETROW: I mean, what is your sense a year into the second term, reporting this story and many other stories? Do you have a sense of what you think Trump's end goals are? Is it, I want to tear down democratic norms, or is it something more straightforward of, I want to be a notable, famous president, or is it even more moment to moment and topic to topic than that? Like, how do you think about this?PARKER: I don't think he has a particular pointed desire to tear down democratic norms. What - essentially, he wants to do what he wants to do, unconstrained by laws and norms and the Constitution. And when he took office the first time, Congress could prevent that from happening. Sometimes a single senator, sometimes a single senator from his own party, could foil something he cared deeply about, and that things like the Geneva Conventions and NATO alliances could get in the way with what he wanted to do. And in many ways, these guardrails worked. And in his second term, he is just unconstrained and doing what he wants to do. And if it means shattering democratic norms, he's more than happy to bulldoze through them, but that's sort of an inadvertent symptom, not the end goal.DETROW: Yeah. Ashley Parker is a staff writer at The Atlantic. Thank you so much.PARKER: Yeah, thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Attorney General Pam Bondi posted online that Nekima Levy Armstrong had been arrested. On Sunday, protesters entered the Cities Church in St. Paul, where an U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official serves as a pastor. Bondi later posted that a second person had been arrested, and FBI Director Kash Patel announced a third.   \n   The Justice Department quickly opened a civil rights investigation after the group interrupted services by chanting \"ICE out\" and \"Justice for Renee Good,\" referring to the 37-year-old mother of three who was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis earlier this month.   \"Listen loud and clear: WE DO NOT TOLERATE ATTACKS ON PLACES OF WORSHIP,\" the attorney general wrote on X.   Cities Church belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention and lists one of its pastors as David Easterwood, who leads the local ICE field office. Many Baptist churches have pastors who also work other jobs.   Church lawyers praise the arrests   Prominent leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention have argued that compassion for migrant families cannot justify violating a sacred space during worship.   Attorneys representing the church hailed the arrests.   \"The U.S. Department of Justice acted decisively by arresting those who coordinated and carried out the terrible crime,\" said Doug Wardlow, director of litigation for True North Legal, which calls itself a public interest civil rights firm, in a statement.   The St. Paul-based nonprofit law firm has taken on religious freedom cases, including filing an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court supporting a Christian counselor who challenged bans on LGBTQ+ \"conversion therapy\" for kids as a violation of her First Amendment rights.   \n   Levy Armstrong, an attorney and longtime activist, had called for the pastor affiliated with ICE to resign, saying his dual role poses a \"fundamental moral conflict.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Vice President JD Vance speaks at an industrial shipping facility on the administration's economic agenda and impacts on the Midwest in Toledo, Ohio, on Thursday.\n                \n                    Jim Watson/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jim Watson/AP\n    \n\n   \n   \"You cannot lead a congregation while directing an agency whose actions have cost lives and inflicted fear in our communities,\" she said Tuesday. \"When officials protect armed agents, repeatedly refuse meaningful investigation into killings like Renée Good's, and signal they may pursue peaceful protesters and journalists, that is not justice — it is intimidation.\"   Vance wants local law enforcement to assist federal officers    State and local elected officials have opposed the crackdown that has become a major focus of Department of Homeland Security sweeps.   Vance arrived in the state less than a month after Renee Good was killed. He has called Good's death a \"tragedy of her own making.\"   Before his Minnesota visit, Vance warned the church protesters: \"Those people are going to be sent to prison so long as we have the power to do so.\"   Later in Minneapolis, he urged state and city law enforcement to help federal immigration officers.   \"We're doing everything that we can to lower the temperature,\" Vance said, adding that he wants \"state and local officials to meet us halfway.\"   Greg Bovino, a U.S. Border Patrol official, said Minneapolis police failed to help federal agents Wednesday who were surrounded by protesters at a gas station. Minneapolis police responded later that they hadn't received any requests from federal agents for assistance on Wednesday.   \n   Protesters appear in court   Levy Armstrong has helped lead protests after the high-profile police-involved killings of Black Americans, including George Floyd, Philando Castile and Jamar Clark. She is a former president of the NAACP's Minneapolis branch.   Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted a photo on X of Levy Armstrong with her arms behind her back next to a person wearing a badge. Noem said she faces a charge under a statute that bars threatening or intimidating someone exercising a right.   \n   Patel posted on X that Chauntyll Louisa Allen, the second person Bondi said was arrested, is charged under a law that prohibits physically obstructing or using the threat of force to intimidate or interfere with a person seeking to participate in a service at a house of worship. Patel said William Kelly has also been arrested.   A message seeking comment was sent to Allen's and Kelly's attorney.   Saint Paul Public Schools, where Allen is a board of education member, said it is aware of her arrest but will not comment on pending legal matters.   Allen and Levy Armstrong are part of a community of Black Minnesota activists.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Cities Church is seen in St. Paul, Minn., where activists shut down a service claiming the pastor was also working as an ICE agent, on Monday in St. Paul, Minn.\n                \n                    Angelina Katsanis/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Angelina Katsanis/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Kelly has defended the protest and criticized the church for associating with a pastor who works for ICE.   In court Thursday, federal magistrate judge Doug Micko granted the women bond and restricted them from traveling outside Minnesota or from going near the church. The government said it would appeal and the women remained in federal custody Thursday afternoon.   Levy Armstrong's attorney, Jordan Kushner, said he offered for her to turn herself in peacefully, but the Trump administration insisted on arresting her.   \n   \"They wanted a spectacle,\" Levy Armstrong's husband, Marques Armstrong, said, recalling around 50 agents came to detain her.   Arrests follow a DOJ civil rights investigation   The Justice Department investigated the church protest swiftly, but found no basis for a civil rights investigation into Good's death.   Administration officials have said the officer acted in self-defense and that the driver of the Honda was engaging in \"an act of domestic terrorism\" when she pulled toward him. Past administrations, however, have moved quickly to probe shootings of civilians by law enforcement officials.   The Justice Department has separately opened an investigation into whether Minnesota officials impeded or obstructed federal immigration enforcement though their public statements. Prosecutors this week sent subpoenas to the offices of Gov. Tim Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her and officials in Ramsey and Hennepin counties, according to a person familiar with the matter.   \n   Judge rejects charges against Lemon   A magistrate judge rejected federal prosecutors' bid to charge journalist Don Lemon related to the church protest, said Kushner, Levy Armstrong's attorney.   Lemon has said he was at the church as a journalist and not a protester.   \"Once the protest started in the church we did an act of journalism which was report on it and talk to the people involved, including the pastor, members of the church and members of the organization,\" Lemon said in a video posted on social media. \"That's it. That's called journalism.\"   Lemon's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement that the judge's action confirms Lemon's work as a reporter was protected by the First Amendment.   It wasn't immediately clear what the Justice Department would do after the judge's decision. Authorities could return to a magistrate judge to again seek a criminal complaint or an indictment against Lemon before a grand jury.   CNN, which fired Lemon in 2023, first reported the ruling.\n",

    "body": "\n      What does President Trump's base think of his second-term agenda? How will they vote in November? We road-tripped through conservative counties in Maryland, New York and Pennsylvania to find out.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  President Trump is one year into his second term at a moment when many scholars and historians and a growing number of voters say Trump has wielded power in ways that are shaking the foundations of American democracy. We wanted to hear how some of Trump's core supporters view his performance so far, so we sent NPR's Brian Mann on a road trip through conservative counties in the eastern U.S.BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: It is a messy, gray, snowy winter morning, and I'm heading first on this trip to Elkton, Maryland, a little town that voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump. The goal today, through what really is Trump country, is to talk to people, to ask how they feel about how this is going.(SOUNDBITE OF DOOR OPENING)MANN: The town's Main Street is mostly empty, but I find Ann Marie Hamilton working in an office and arts nonprofit. She loves President Trump.ANN MARIE HAMILTON: I want to be proud of him, and I was the first time he was in office.MANN: Right away, I hear this deep, personal loyalty, but also uncertainty. For Hamilton, the big question in Trump's second term is affordability, grocery prices and her electric bill.HAMILTON: Prices are high enough that it stings like crazy. Like, you know, he ran his campaign, and we're all like, yay. And yay didn't happen yet.MANN: I ask if Hamilton sees any Democratic leaders offering better ideas, and she shakes her head. She tells me the Democratic brand is dead.HAMILTON: Yeah, broken. Nothing's resonating.AUTOMATED VOICE: Seven twenty-seven east.MANN: My next stop is Milford, a little town in Pike County, a place so conservative some locals call it Trump County, Pennsylvania. Like my other stops, Milford is mostly rural and overwhelmingly white. There's a nasty snowstorm, so the downtown is empty, but I find a little diner, where one of the waitresses, Tina Howell, tells me she thinks Trump is great, but she thinks he's focusing too much overseas.TINA HOWELL: He needs to start worrying about America first.MANN: What about the question of affordability? Have you started to feel any real improvement there?HOWELL: No. Nothing. I think it's getting tighter, actually, for people. Around here it is, in this town.MANN: So some real criticism. But Howell, too, says the Democratic Party isn't offering her choices. She can't name a single Democrat she likes or trusts. It's important to say my approach on this road trip isn't scientific. I'm spending time with random Trump voters in conservative towns. A poll released yesterday by YouGov and The Economist found 1 in 4 Republican voters think the country is on the wrong track under Trump. And I hear some of those doubts. But broadly, people tell me they're comfortable with Trump's use of federal power, including his controversial crackdown on immigrants.My final stop is Whitehall in Washington County, New York, where two-thirds of voters backed Trump in the last election. I meet Frank Juckett, a former Marine, outside the American Legion Hall. He says Trump is an improvement over the Democrats and Joe Biden.FRANK JUCKETT: Better than what we had.MANN: OK. So report card - what's your grade?JUCKETT: A B+.MANN: Pretty much so far, so good.JUCKETT: So far.MANN: While we talk, Juckett echoes many criticisms of Trump, saying he, too, wants the president focused on domestic issues and the economy, not things like Greenland and Venezuela. Juckett tells me he sees Trump as a bully. At one point, he compares Trump's style to that of Russian President Vladimir Putin.JUCKETT: If they're really good and crooked, things get done. And if they're not, they get stepped on.MANN: So the fact that he's kind of a rough character, that's a good thing.JUCKETT: Yes, I think so.MANN: So here's the takeaway. After this first year, many people in Trump's base talk about him critically. I hear skepticism, questions, even some harsh judgments of Trump's character. Several people tell me they want less chaos, less drama. But I also hear deep distrust of the Democrats, and every Trump voter I talked to while in these conservative rural counties say they're willing to give him more time to make their lives better.Brian Mann, NPR News in Whitehall, New York.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

The House approved the funds with overwhelming bipartisan support – with one exception.   Just seven House Democrats voted for the bill funding the Department of Homeland Security through September, citing Immigration and Customs Enforcement tactics in Minneapolis and elsewhere.   \"ICE is totally out of control using taxpayer dollars to brutalize American citizens and law-abiding immigrant families,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters Thursday.   \n   Despite the paper-thin Republican majority in the House, the measure still passed 220-207. Democrats saw the vote as an opportunity to rebuke the Trump administration's immigration crackdown after an ICE officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Macklin Good in Minneapolis earlier this month.   The Senate is expected to vote next week on these remaining funding measures as a group, forcing Democrats to choose between approving or opposing the full slate of funding, which also include billions of dollars for defense, health, transportation and housing.   Democrats had attempted to insert more stringent measures to rein in ICE, such as prohibiting the agency from deporting or detaining American citizens, banning officers from deploying excessive force and explicitly preventing them from conducting raids at places of worship, hospitals and schools.   The Democrats who begrudgingly backed the final package said they won dedicated funds to provide body cameras for ICE officers for the first time and allocated more money for oversight and de-escalation training. The final legislation also holds funding for ICE flat, while reducing the budget for enforcement and removal operations by $115 million and cutting detention bed capacity.   \"This bill is not perfect,\" said Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat whose district covers a long stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border. \"However this bill is better than the alternatives of either funding the department under a continuing resolution or shutting down the government.\"   \n   Democratic leadership concluded that these concessions were not sufficient, though they did not stop members from voting in favor of the measure.   The top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., ultimately decided that grave concerns over ICE outweighed gains in the bill, like increases for funding to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Transportation Security Agency and pay raises for air traffic controllers and members of the Coast Guard.   \"We have to deal with what's happened in this country and we cannot turn a blind eye,\" she said. \"Make the decision based on where your heart is and what you believe in.\"   Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., Appropriations Committee chair, said Democrats were ignoring most of the contents of the funding measure, which includes appropriations for a host of agencies Americans rely on.   \"You're voting against the people that will help you in a hurricane or a tornado or disaster of some sort,\" Cole said. \"Why in the world should they be penalized?\"   House members are departing Washington ahead of a forecasted winter storm for a week-long recess, leaving the Senate to finish the appropriations process before the deadline at the end of next week.   Funding ran out for the federal government at the end of last September. The government remained shuttered for a record 43 days as Democrats fought to renew expiring health insurance subsidies. The shutdown ended with a deal to fund three of 12 appropriations packages through September 2026, but only provided a short-term extension through Jan. 30 for the remaining funding categories.   Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said she will be voting in favor of the remaining funding measures, which keep funding mostly flat and stave off the steep cuts the Trump Administration had called for.   \"The suggestion that a shutdown in this moment might curb the lawlessness of this administration is not rooted in reality: under a CR and in a shutdown, this administration can do everything they are already doing – but without any of the critical guardrails and constraints imposed by a full-year funding bill,\" Murray wrote in a statement. \"The hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need.\"\n",

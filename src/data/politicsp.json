    "body": "\n         Gavin Newsom is in his final year as governor of California, but lately, he's been touring the country to energize voters ahead of the midterm elections.   \"I think it's really important for the Democratic Party not to give up on red states and rural parts of the country,\" he told NPR at an event organized by local Democrats in the town of Manning, South Carolina. Newsom is also widely considered a potential presidential candidate for 2028 — a possibility he has not ruled out — and he sees himself as a leader of Democratic opposition to President Donald Trump, often mocking his brash style on social media.   \n   \"I'm putting a mirror up to President Trump and I'm fighting fire with fire and I am punching a bully back in the mouth,\" he told NPR.   At the same time, Newsom has embraced conversations with major right-wing figures such as Steve Bannon and Ben Shapiro on his podcast, drawing criticism from members of his own party. The governor sat down with All Things Considered for an interview ahead of the release of his memoir, Young Man in a Hurry. He discusses how his struggles with dyslexia shaped his childhood and career, his strategy for dealing with President Trump, and how he thinks the Democratic party should meet this political moment.

Abigail Spanberger speaks after being sworn into office at the Virginia State Capitol on Jan. 17 in Richmond. Spanberger is the first woman elected to the Commonwealth of Virginia's highest office.\n                \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Newly sworn in Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger will deliver the Democratic response to President Trump's State of the Union address Tuesday evening.    Spanberger, who previously served in Congress for six years, became the first woman elected governor of Virginia in November, flipping control of the office from Republican to Democrat. Prior to her career on Capitol Hill, she served in the CIA.   \"We are at a defining moment in our nation's history,\" Spanberger said in a statement ahead of her address. \"Virginians and Americans across the country are contending with rising costs, chaos in their communities, and a real fear of what each day might bring.\"   \n   Her gubernatorial race was under the national spotlight as one of the first major indicators of voters' political leaning during the second Trump administration. Spanberger  focused her campaign on affordability, a message Democrats continue to embrace ahead of the upcoming midterm elections.   Top Democrats in Congress framed Spanberger as a clear contrast to President Trump. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said she has \"always put service over politics.\"   \"Gov. Spanberger will lay out a clear path forward: lower everyday costs, protect healthcare, and defend the freedoms that define who we are as a nation,\" he said in a statement announcing the selection of Spanberger as the party's official respondent to the speech.   The rebuttal to a president's State of the Union is considered an honor, given the high-profile nature of the speech. The selection tends to reflect what party leaders see as top policy priorities and which rising star they regard as the best spokesperson to deliver that message to the public.   Democrats are eager to replicate Spanberger's political success during this election cycle. She was part of a blue wave of Democrats in 2018 who flipped control of the House. She's considered a more moderate voice within the party, who outperformed in a purple state.   \n   She's also faced increasing criticism from conservatives who allege she is veering left after leading a more centrist campaign.   But the rebuttal gig itself, which involves speaking to a typically empty room, can be tough.   Take then-Sen. Marco Rubio (now secretary of state), who delivered a response in both English and Spanish in 2013. His speech is mainly remembered by a singular moment when he went off camera to get a water bottle.   More recently, Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., was mocked for her speech's intense tone and the choice to deliver the response against the backdrop of her kitchen.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., speaks during the ICE Out for Good Protest at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection office on Jan. 13 in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Jemal Countess/Getty Images for MoveOn Civic Ac/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jemal Countess/Getty Images for MoveOn Civic Ac/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   California Sen. Alex Padilla to deliver Spanish language response for Democrats   Padilla, the first Latino elected to represent California in the Senate, was first appointed to the Senate in 2021 to fill the seat vacated by Kamala Harris.   \"Americans don't need another speech from Donald Trump pretending everything is fine when their bills are too high, paychecks are too low, and masked and militarized federal agents are roaming our communities violating Constitutional rights on a daily basis,\" Padilla said in a statement.    The son of Mexican immigrants, Padilla was forcibly removed from a news conference last summer by federal agents after trying to ask DHS Secretary Kristi Noem a question about the Trump administration's immigration enforcement tactics in California.   A video of the experience was widely circulated and Padilla later recounted details of the event during an address on the Senate floor.   \"As Donald Trump, Kristi Noem and MAGA extremists have tried to silence the voices of our Latino brothers and sisters, Senator Alex Padilla has consistently fought back and proven Democrats will not bend the knee to this out-of-control administration,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in a statement. \"House Democrats are proud to have Senator Padilla leading the way as we communicate to Spanish-speaking households across the nation.\"   \n   Trump's State of the Union address comes as the Department of Homeland Security remains shut down. Congressional Democrats have demanded policy changes on immigration enforcement, fueled by the killing of two U.S. citizens in Minnesota by immigration agents.   As has been the case during previous Trump addresses to Congress, some Democrats are choosing to skip the speech entirely and engage in counterprogramming, including a rally called the \"People's State of the Union.\"   Follow for more coverage:   📧 NPR Politics newsletter: Breaking down the big stories and why they matter   🎧 NPR Politics Podcast: Our experts provide insights into what's happening\n",

It's an opportunity for the president to tout his agenda and shape his party's messaging ahead of this year's midterm elections.   But the primetime address comes at a moment when the president has seen his agenda complicated on multiple fronts. That includes trade, where his tariff policies were dealt a rebuke last week by the Supreme Court, and immigration, where Trump and congressional Democrats are deadlocked over funding the Department of Homeland Security.   \n   Plus, Americans are divided on whether Trump's first year has been a success. Six in 10 believe the country is worse off than last year, according to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll, and a majority think the state of the union is not strong.   Here's what you need to know ahead of tonight's speech.   What time is the address?   The president is expected to begin at 9 p.m. ET., and if history is any indication, prepare for a long night. Last year, in what was technically not a State of the Union speech, Trump addressed Congress for over 90 minutes, breaking records as the longest joint address in at least 60 years.   NPR will be covering all of it, with live special coverage and analysis. You can listen on NPR.org, on many public radio stations, in the NPR app or by telling your Alexa device to \"Ask NPR to play Special Coverage\" starting at 9 p.m.   Why does this happen every year?    This is part of the gig for every president. The Constitution requires that the president \"shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.\" It's intended to be a recap of sorts of their previous year in office.   \n   So it's a formality, yes, but there are political stakes. Trump's speech comes at the start of a crucial election year, and his party is on the defensive. GOP lawmakers are fighting to maintain control of the Senate, where they currently hold a 53 to 47 majority, and the House, where their margin is even smaller, 218 to 214. Trump is battling low approval numbers, which are often seen as a warning sign, given that since World War 2 the party controlling the White House historically loses an average of 27 House seats in the midterms and four in the Senate.   What will Trump talk about?   Expect a big focus on immigration, which has been a key pillar of Trump's second term. The administration has defended its enforcement agenda, arguing it's aimed at removing people living in the country illegally who have committed dangerous crimes. However, lawmakers have raised concerns about the tactics used by federal immigration agents in cities around the country, especially after two U.S. citizens were killed in Minneapolis last month.   It will also be worth watching how Trump talks about tariffs. He's long defended imposing import taxes on foreign goods as a way to strengthen American manufacturing, but in a major ruling last Friday, the Supreme Court struck down the main lever the president has used to carry out this policy.   The tariff ruling is part of a broader economic messaging challenge facing the White House. A majority of Americans already say they think tariffs are more likely to hurt than help the economy. Trump has also dismissed affordability concerns as a Democratic \"hoax,\" even though voters report struggling to keep up with the cost-of-living.   Tonight's address is also happening at a crucial moment in U.S. foreign policy. Trump is pressuring Iran to disband its nuclear program, and has not ruled out using force to make that happen. In recent days, the American military has expanded its presence in the Middle East, sending additional fighter jets and a second aircraft carrier to the region.   \n   It's the latest move by Trump in what has been a more muscular approach to foreign policy compared to his first term. The president has approved strikes on countries around the world, announced the U.S. will \"run\" Venezuela after arresting the country's leader and has threatened to buy Greenland. At the same time, Trump has repeatedly labeled himself a peacemaker, despite facing steep challenges in achieving his goals of rebuilding Gaza and brokering an end to Russia's war in Ukraine.   What will the response from Democrats look like?   Newly sworn-in Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger is slated to provide the party's official rebuttal. Spanberger was one of several Democrats who won their races last November, delivering some of the most high-profile victories since the party's bruising losses across the country in 2024.   She may also provide a potential preview of how Democrats may approach their own midterm messaging. On the campaign trail, Spanberger centered her message on affordability concerns and criticized the administration's treatment of federal workers through mass layoffs and the longest government shutdown in history.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Virginia Governor Abigail Spanberger speaks after being sworn into office at the Virginia State Capitol in January. Spanberger will deliver the official Democratic response to President Trump's State of the Union address.\n                \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Win McNamee/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   California Senator Alex Padilla is tapped to deliver the Spanish-language response for Democrats. It's another notable pick for Democrats as they refine their election message, particularly on immigration. Padilla has been an outspoken critic of Trump's immigration agenda and was forcibly removed from a Homeland Security press conference over the summer.   There's also a group of roughly a dozen House and Senate Democrats who plan to boycott Trump's speech and instead hold a counter-rally dubbed the \"People's State of the Union.\" It comes as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., has urged lawmakers to either \"attend with silent defiance\" or skip the event.

Tony Gonzales is facing mounting pressure from within his own party to resign amid new details of an alleged affair between the Texas Republican and a staffer who later died by suicide.   At least four House Republicans have called on Gonzales to either resign or end his bid for reelection after explicit text messages surfaced from Gonzales to his then-employee Regina Santos-Aviles, who later died after setting herself on fire.   \"America deserves better. Tony should drop out of the race,\" posted Texas Republican Rep. Brandon Gill on Monday.   Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., agreed, writing: \"Tony, you should drop out of the race.\"   \n   GOP Reps. Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina have called for Gonzales to resign.   Gonzales' office did not respond to a request for comment, but the congressman has previously denied the allegations.   NPR has not independently reviewed the text messages.   The firestorm comes as House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is clinging to a razor-thin majority in the lower chamber. Republicans currently have a 4-seat majority and there is speculation additional members with retirement plans could leave ahead of this year's midterm elections.   Gonzales is already facing a probe into the alleged affair by the Office of Congressional Conduct, an independent House office, according to a source familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The OCC is expected to turn over their findings to the House Ethics Committee in the coming weeks.   Asked whether Gonzales should resign, Johnson called the allegations \"very serious\" and said the process has to play out.   \"As in every case like this, you have to allow the investigations to play out and all the facts to come out,\" Johnson told reporters on Monday. \"If the accusation of something is going to be the litmus test for someone being able to continue to serve in the House, you'll have a lot of people who would have to resign or be removed or expelled from Congress.\"   \n   Gonzales is in his third term representing Texas' 23rd congressional district, a seat in Southwest Texas. He faces a tough primary contest on March 3, and could head into a repeat of a Republican runoff in 2024 that saw him edge out conservative YouTuber Brandon Herrera by only about 350 votes.   Herrera, a vocal gun rights supporter known as \"the AK guy,\" drew the backing of several Republicans, including members of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus.   In the midst of the fallout on Monday, the political arm of the House Freedom Caucus weighed in to endorse Herrera. The group, whose members have previously attacked Gonzales as not conservative enough, made no mention of the allegations in its endorsement.   \"Brandon is a bold, unapologetic defender of the Second Amendment and a steadfast champion of the constitutional rights that safeguard our freedoms,\" the Freedom Caucus Fund said in a statement on X.\n",

For some supporters of the embattled law enforcement official, it was a patriotic, good-natured show of support for a team bringing home the first gold medal in the sport since 1980. For Patel's critics, though, it was yet another questionable use of government resources by an FBI chief already facing scrutiny over his personal travels aboard a government plane.   An FBI spokesman had said in the days leading up to the game that Patel's trip to Milan during the Olympics was primarily for professional purposes, with the director posting on social media work-related photographs of his meetings with European security officials. But the trip took a more jocular turn Sunday when videos circulating online showed a pumped-up Patel, a hockey fan, drinking beer from a bottle and spraying the rest around the locker room. After one of the players draped his gold medal around Patel's neck, he joined the players as they jumped up and down in celebration.   \n   The episode deepened questions about Patel's personal travels, a persistent storyline from the first year of his tenure not only because of their frequency but also because he had chastised his predecessor, Chris Wray, for his use of the FBI plane. In this instance, the Olympics celebration took place as FBI officials were investigating an armed man who was shot and killed by the U.S. Secret Service after he breached the secure perimeter of President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.   \"The grift & corruption is unreal,\" Democratic Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado posted on X. \"Your taxpayer dollars funding the FBI Director's Italian vacation.\"   Patel responded to the criticism by posting on his personal X account that \"yes, I love America and was extremely humbled when my friends, the newly minted Gold Medal winners on Team USA, invited me into the locker room to celebrate this historic moment with the boys.\"   The White House signaled its backing for Patel, with communications director Steven Cheung writing on X that \"Kash was also in Italy meeting with regional partners and security teams\" and telling a reporter \"don't be mad because America won.\"   An ongoing source of criticism   Patel is not the only Trump administration figure to face questions about his use of government resources, with congressional Democrats also demanding answers from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem about her department's contract for upgraded jets.   \n   But the FBI in particular has struggled to shake questions about Patel's travels on the government Gulfstream G550 for flights around the country that have no known or apparent law enforcement purpose. One example came in October when it emerged that Patel had traveled to State College, Pennsylvania, for a pro wrestling event, where his longtime girlfriend, country singer Alexis Wilkins, had performed the national anthem. Photos posted to social media by Wilkins show the couple side-by-side and smiling for the camera and her holding an oversized golden championship belt.   The trips have come even though as a bombastic podcaster during the Biden administration, Patel had repeatedly lambasted Wray for using the FBI plane for personal travels and even suggested that the jet be grounded.   \"I'm just saying Chris Wray doesn't need a government-funded G5 jet to go to vacations. Maybe we ground that plane. $15,000 every time it takes off. Just a thought,\" Patel said in one podcast interview.   FBI spokesman Ben Williamson has defended Patel, noting that he is required for security purposes to use the bureau jet even for personal trips and consistently reimburses the government for private travels.   \"Kash himself has significantly limited personal travel — but he's allowed to take personal time on occasion to see family, friends or his longtime girlfriend. He doesn't do it often,\" Williamson posted on X in November. \"He works far more full weekends than he does otherwise. And maybe most importantly — ask anyone who works for him, he's on duty 24/7 regardless.\"   Even so, it's long been a sensitive issue for the FBI and Justice Department. The department's inspector general, for instance, last year faulted a since-retired FBI assistant director for taking government-paid trips to the official's \"bucket list\" countries — travel that the watchdog said did include some professional meetings but also consisted of days of beach resort stays.   \n   And in 1993, President Bill Clinton fired then-FBI Director William Sessions after a harshly critical report alleged that he had \"abused government travel for personal purposes.\"   Patel, for his part, has said he complies with all policies, saying in a podcast interview in December that he travels \"under the rules that have been established by the prior 20 years of Congress, DOJ and FBI.\"   A raucous celebration   The latest kerfuffle started last week with media coverage indicating that Patel would be in Italy for the final days of the Olympics.   Williamson responded to the reports by saying on social media that the trip was not personal in nature, had been planned months ago, would include meetings with a cross-section of officials and was consistent with the FBI's \"major role\" in Olympics security.   Once in Italy, Patel posted pictures of his visit to the Milan Joint Operations Center, which he said was charged with protecting the security of American athletes and all those who traveled to Milan for the Winter Games. He also posted a photo of his meeting with the U.S. ambassador to Italy.   He was in Italy on Sunday as the FBI, in the United States, was investigating the intrusion at Mar-a-Lago and continuing its search for Nancy Guthrie, kidnapped from her Arizona home weeks ago. Other concerns confronting American officials that day included an eruption of violence in Mexico and the potential of a Trump administration attack on Iran.   While the hockey game was still underway, Patel posted on X that the FBI was dedicating all necessary resources to the Mar-a-Lago investigation.   Later in the day, videos surfaced showing the FBI director, in a long-sleeve white USA shirt, partaking in the festive locker room celebration and holding out a cell phone as Trump speaks to the exuberant team. Patel, meanwhile, posted on his X account pictures of himself with the team, including one showing him holding an unfurled American flag and another in the locker room.   \n   By Monday, he resumed more of his standard work-related content, sharing posts on social media about falling crime numbers.\n",

Customs and Border Protection later said it would stop collecting these tariffs on Tuesday.   \n   The tariffs that the Supreme Court struck down amounted to around $130 billion. Anyone who paid the taxes should get reimbursed. But the high court did not address how.   \"We not only need the money back,\" said Sarah Wells from Virginia, who sells backpacks and totes for breast pumps, for new moms, \"but we need a process to get the money back that doesn't involve lawyers, really time-consuming paperwork, expensive processes — none of us have the bandwidth or the resources to do that.\"   Indeed, the government already has a routine process to refund tariffs in cases of, say, errors on a customs form. But on Monday, Wells dialed into a call arranged by the small-business group Main Street Alliance and heard lawyers suggest that this time, getting her money back would likely require suing the government.   \"I'm so frustrated that there isn't clear guidance that would make it easier on small businesses,\" Wells said afterward. \"We shouldn't have to become litigators just to get our money back.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sarah Wells sells totes and backpacks for breast pumps, plus other products for new parents. She manufactures overseas for her Virginia-based company, Sarah Wells Bags.\n                \n                    Courtesy of Sarah Wells\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Courtesy of Sarah Wells\n    \n\n   \n   \"A seamless process to refund tariffs\"   For weeks, Wells had obsessively refreshed the Supreme Court's website on opinion days, watching the tariff case. A coalition of small businesses not too different from hers had challenged Trump's use of emergency authority known as IEEPA to set new taxes on virtually all imports, without Congressional approval. Wells says she's paid $35,000 for tariffs on her shipments from China and Cambodia.   \n   On the morning of the high-court ruling, Wells' power went out during a torrential rainstorm. She raced to the nearest cafe for internet access and thought of the ways she could use that refund money.   \"If we got the refunds, I know what I would do is I would start hiring again, because we need it,\" Wells said. Her firm is down a part-time customer service rep; she'd laid off staff and contractors last year, trying to afford tariffs. She held shipments abroad while scrounging for cash to pay tariffs, leaving her top-selling backpacks out of stock for months. Those costs she would never recoup. But maybe at least the duty fees?   \n   In an urgent statement Friday, the National Retail Federation called for the lower court — the Court of International Trade — to \"ensure a seamless process to refund the tariffs to U.S. importers.\" After filing the lawsuit, the small-business plaintiffs in the case had asked for U.S. customs to stop collecting tariffs as the litigation played out, but the government successfully argued there was no need: it could always issue refunds.   On Friday, in a defiant press conference, Trump quickly vowed to find new avenues to reinstate tariffs. Within hours, he set a new 10% blanket tariff; within a day, he raised it to 15%. He called the Supreme Court justices who ruled against his tariffs \"fools\" and \"unpatriotic.\" And he said that repayments to importers would get bogged down in litigation for two, maybe five years.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Danny Reynolds relies on suppliers to import bridal gowns for sale at his Indiana store, Stephenson's of Elkhart. He wonders if those suppliers, who've charged him tariff fees, would send any refunds downstream to his business.\n                \n                    Lily Miller\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Lily Miller\n    \n\n   \n   \"Even less certainty\"   Senate Democrats in the highly divided Congress introduced a bill on Monday that would require U.S. Customs to refund tariffs — with interest — within 180 days, prioritizing small businesses.    Already a long queue of companies — including Costco, Revlon, Bumble Bee and Kawasaki — have lined up for refunds with pre-emptive lawsuits in trade court. In Indiana, Danny Reynolds, who runs the nearly century-old fashion store Stephenson's of Elkhart, wonders where that leaves him.   \n   \"Especially for small businesses who don't have retained legal teams to file suit and sort of get their place in line,\" he said, \"you sort of wonder, will there be anybody going to bat for us?\"   \n   Reynolds doesn't import his clothes himself, but pays another company to bring in the containers. So that supplier actually pays the tariffs as the \"importer of record\" — but it also has been charging Reynolds a tariff fee. When, or if, this supplier gets a tariff refund, would Reynolds actually get any of his tariff fees back?   \"This is so directionless,\" is how Mai, the card game seller, put it. \"I think there's even less certainty of what's going to happen over the next few months with the Supreme Court ruling, to be honest with you.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Alfred Mai, whose San Francisco-based business makes family card games in China, wonders if he'll need to hire a lawyer or a broker to get his tariff refunds.\n                \n                    Courtesy of Alfred Mai\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Courtesy of Alfred Mai\n    \n\n   \n   A system exists, but will it be used?   Looking for guidance, Mai consulted AI on how tariff refunds might work and landed on the same platform as scores of other businesses: an online portal called ACE, where the government has long reviewed refund claims from businesses over clerical errors or miscalculations.   The portal seems to have a lot going for it as a refund venue. It's a well-oiled operation that already exists. It contains meticulous records. The government knows exactly how much each importer has paid. So many business owners had the same thought that Mai struggled to log in, getting error messages for hours, then for days.   \"I'm guessing everyone and their mothers are rushing in right now to try to do what I'm doing,\" he said.   The Trump administration so far has not indicated any inclination toward using this existing system, falling back on comments about litigation.   On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was asked on CNN about \"the big question\": Would American businesses get their tariff money back? Bessent countered that this was, in fact, \"not the big question\" and touted Trump's push to revive American manufacturing and reduce trade imbalances. No matter the question's scale, the answer to it was up to the courts, he said, weeks or months from now. \n",

Scruggs/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   The Justice Department has withheld some Epstein files related to allegations that President Trump sexually abused a minor, an NPR investigation finds. It also removed some documents from the public database where accusations against Jeffrey Epstein also mention Trump.   Some files have not been made public despite a law mandating their release. These include what appears to be more than 50 pages of FBI interviews, and notes from conversations with a woman who accused Trump of sexual abuse decades ago when she was a minor.   NPR reviewed multiple sets of unique serial numbers appearing before and after the pages in question, stamped onto documents in the Epstein files database, FBI case records, emails and discovery document logs in the latest tranche of documents published at the end of January. NPR's investigation found dozens of pages that appear to be catalogued by the Justice Department but not shared publicly.   \n   The Justice Department declined to answer NPR's questions on the record about these specific files, what's in them, and why they are not published.   \n   Other files scrubbed from public view pertain to a separate woman who was a key witness for the prosecution in the criminal trial of Epstein's co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking. Maxwell is seeking clemency from Trump.    Some of those documents were briefly taken down and put back online last week, while others remain hidden, according to NPR's comparison of the initial dataset from Jan. 30 with document metadata of those files currently on the Justice Department website.   NPR does not name victims of sexual abuse.   When asked for comment about the missing pages and the accusations against the president, a White House spokeswoman told NPR that Trump \"has done more for Epstein's victims than anyone before him.\"   \"Just as President Trump has said, he's been totally exonerated on anything relating to Epstein,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told NPR in a statement. \"And by releasing thousands of pages of documents, cooperating with the House Oversight Committee's subpoena request, signing the Epstein Files Transparency Act, and calling for more investigations into Epstein's Democrat friends, President Trump has done more for Epstein's victims than anyone before him. Meanwhile, Democrats like Hakeem Jeffries and Stacey Plaskett have yet to explain why they were soliciting money and meetings from Epstein after he was a convicted sex offender.\"   \n   The White House has previously pointed to a statement from the Justice Department that says the Epstein files contain \"untrue and sensationalist claims\" about the president.   In a letter to members of Congress on Feb. 14 first reported by POLITICO, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche insist that no records were withheld or redacted \"on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.\"    \n   In the last two weeks, as lawmakers have begun to view unredacted copies of Epstein files, members of both parties have criticized the way the Trump administration has handled the release of the files. They have also continued to accuse the Justice Department of violating the law and operating without transparency in redacting information.   First woman accuses Trump of sexual abuse   According to the newly released files, the FBI internally circulated Epstein-related allegations that mention Trump in late July and early August 2025. The list, collected from the FBI's National Threat Operations Center, included numerous salacious allegations. Agents marked most of the accusations as unverifiable or not credible.   But one lead was sent to the FBI's Washington Office with the purpose of setting up an interview with the accuser. The lead was included in an internal PowerPoint slide deck detailing \"prominent names\" in the Epstein and Maxwell investigations last fall.   The woman who directly named Trump in her abuse allegation claimed that around 1983, when she was around 13 years old, Epstein introduced her to Trump \"who subsequently forced her head down to his exposed penis which she subsequently bit. In response, Trump punched her in the head and kicked her out.\"   Out of more than three million pages of files released by the Justice Department in recent months, this specific allegation against Trump only appears in copies of the FBI list of claims and the DOJ slideshow.   \n   But a review of FBI case file logs and discovery documents turned over to Maxwell and her attorneys in the criminal case against her point to one place the claim could have come from — and how serious investigators took it.   The FBI interviewed this Trump and Epstein accuser four times. That is according to an FBI \"Serial Report\" and a list of Non-Testifying Witness Material in the Maxwell case that were also released under the Epstein Files Transparency Act.   Only the first interview, conducted July 24, 2019, is in the public database. That interview does not mention Trump.   Of 15 documents listed in a log of the Maxwell discovery material for this first accuser, only seven are in the Epstein files database. Those missing also include notes that accompany three of the interviews. The discrepancy in the file for the Trump accuser was first reported by independent journalist Roger Sollenberger.    \n   According to NPR's review of three different sets of serial numbers stamped onto the files, there appear to be 53 pages of interview documents and notes missing from the public Epstein database.   \n   In the first interview document, the woman discussed ways Epstein abused her as a girl and, in identifying him to investigators, showed a cropped photo of the disgraced financier. Her attorney said it was cropped because she \"was concerned about implicating additional individuals, and specifically any that were well known, due to fear of retaliation.\"   The FBI agents noted it was a \"widely distributed photograph\" of Epstein with Trump.   A woman whose biographical details and description of Epstein's abuse found in the FBI interview also line up with details from a victim lawsuit. In the December 2019 filing, \"Jane Doe 4\" does not mention Trump, and the woman voluntarily dismissed her claims against Epstein's estate in December 2021.   Attorneys for this accuser declined to comment.   Elsewhere in the released Epstein files, someone in the FBI wrote on July 22, 2025, before the list and slide presentation were compiled, that Trump's name was in the larger case files and that \"one identified victim claimed abuse by Trump but ultimately refused to cooperate.\"   \n   Second accuser says she met Trump at Mar-a-Lago   The other woman whose mention of Trump made the DOJ's presentation appears in Maxwell discovery files released last month in what's known as a Testifying Witness 3500 material list.   In the first interview of six with the FBI conducted between Sept. 2019 and Sept. 2021, the second woman detailed how Epstein and Maxwell's abuse began while she was around 13 years old attending the Interlochen Center for the Arts and described how, at one point, Epstein took her to Trump's Mar-a-Lago club to meet him.   \n   \"EPSTEIN told TRUMP, 'This is a good one, huh.,'\" the interview report reads.   In a 2020 lawsuit against Epstein's estate and Maxwell, the second woman added that both men chuckled and she \"felt uncomfortable, but, at the time, was too young to understand why.\"   That interview was removed from the DOJ's public files some time after initial publication on Jan. 30 and was republished Feb. 19, according to document metadata.   The Justice Department told NPR the only reason any file has been temporarily removed is because it had been flagged by a victim or their counsel for additional review.   Multiple FBI interviews with other people refer to the second woman's meeting with Trump while she was a minor and being abused by Epstein. One interview with a fleeting mention of Trump was removed from the public database and subsequently restored last week, while another interview with the woman's mother is still offline.   In that conversation, the mother recalled hearing that \"a prince and DONALD TRUMP visited EPSTEIN's house\" which made her \"think that if they are there then how could EPSTEIN be a criminal,\" according to NPR's copy of the file that was first published.   The possible omission of files that mention these women's particular allegations against the president come as the Justice Department has warned about other documents it has published in full that includes what it calls \"untrue and sensationalist claims\" about Trump.    \n   At the same time, the Justice Department has removed and reuploaded thousands of pages in recent weeks to fix improperly redacted victim names. That includes documents related to the allegations from these two women, who separately say they were around 13 years old when Epstein first abused them.   Robert Glassman, who represents the woman who testified against Maxwell, sharply criticized the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein files.   \"This whole thing is ridiculous,\" he told NPR. \"The DOJ was ordered to release information to the public to be transparent about Epstein and Maxwell's criminal enterprise network. Instead, they released the names of courageous victims who have fought hard for decades to remain anonymous and out of the limelight. Whether the disclosures were inadvertent or not—they had one job to do here and they didn't do it.\"   A DOJ spokesperson told NPR that the department is working \"around the clock\" to address concerns from victims and handle additional redactions of personally identifiable information that have been flagged.   \"In view of the Congressional deadline, all reasonable efforts have been made to review and redact personal information pertaining to victims, other private individuals, and protect sensitive materials from disclosure,\" the statement read. \"That said, because of the volume of information involved, this website may nevertheless contain information that inadvertently includes non-public personally identifiable information or other sensitive content, to include matters of a sexual nature.\"   NPR's Saige Miller and Ryan Lucas contributed reporting.Have information to share about the Epstein files?

Sitting at a long, mahogany table, surrounded by his administration's top officials, he broached the subject of housing.   \"There's so much talk about, 'Oh, we're going to drive housing prices down,'\" Trump said, seemingly referencing a nationwide movement to make housing more abundant and affordable. But not him, Trump made it clear. \"I don't want to drive housing prices down. I want to drive housing prices up for people that own their homes. And they can be assured that's what's going to happen.\"   \n   Say what you will about President Trump, but the man has a knack for understanding the fears and anxieties of a large swath of American voters and speaking bluntly to reject liberal and libertarian ideas that could potentially scare them.   For more than a decade now, a \"YIMBY\" movement has been working to bulldoze the rules and regulations that have been holding back new housing development. A central goal of this movement — which declares Yes In My Backyard to more development — is to make housing more plentiful and affordable for Americans who are often priced out of owning or even living in the communities they want to.   But the flipside of lower priced and more plentiful housing is … lower priced and more plentiful housing — and, for a large percentage of middle-class Americans, homes are their most valuable source of wealth.   How irreconcilable is the clash between maintaining or building middle-class wealth on the one hand, and making housing more affordable to a wide swath of renters and would-be owners on the other? Are the politics just inherently stacked against meaningful development efforts that would make housing more affordable? In other words, is the YIMBY movement doomed to fail?   Today in the Planet Money newsletter, we hear from a bunch of housing experts and YIMBYs to get their perspective on the thorny political economy around housing policy.   \n   Why politics is stacked against YIMBYs   There are some brutal political realities that the YIMBY movement has to contend with. Almost 66% of American households own their homes. Many of those households have not just one, but at least two voters. Homeowners are more likely to vote than renters, and they're also more likely to be civically engaged.   Katherine Levine Einstein is a political scientist at Boston University who studies the politics around new housing development. Back in 2019, she co-authored an eye-opening book, Neighborhood Defenders: Participatory Politics and America's Housing Crisis.   \"Basically, what we argue is that America's land use regulations have created processes that empower small and privileged groups of neighbors to stop and delay new housing development,\" she says.   Einstein and her colleagues, studying Massachusetts, found that homeowners are much more likely to participate in the crucial local political and regulatory meetings that govern new housing supply.   And they found these weren't just any homeowners. The people who showed up were a class of people who had the time and the political will to attend — let's be honest — pretty darn boring city meetings. They were less likely to work full-time or at all. They were less likely to be students or young professionals. They were less likely to have young kids, with all the time pressures they impose. And they were more likely to be resistant to change in their neighborhoods. In other words, \"the people who attend these meetings are way more likely to be older,\" Einstein says, and they're much more likely to oppose development.   So it's not just the sheer numbers of homeowning voters that YIMBYs have to contend with. It's also the very structure of our nation's political institutions, which systematically empowers local homeowners — and a particular class of especially NIMBY homeowners — to shape what gets built and where.   \n   Since Einstein and her colleagues published this book back in 2019, we've seen state political leaders increasingly recognize that they need to circumvent or actively fight local antagonists to new housing development.   For example, in California, Governor Gavin Newsom has supported a variety of reforms that essentially imposes top-down pressure on local communities to develop more housing. Einstein says there's been a similar effort in Massachusetts.   \" So I think, honestly, in some places the answer is yes, that the state just has to impose development,\" Einstein says. \"There are just some places that are never going to agree to allow new housing. And often those are some of the most privileged places in the country, with really high-quality schools and other public services.\"   Top-down approaches come with political risks. Locals know and care a lot more about their communities than outsiders, and attempts by outsiders to impose development could anger some voters. And top-down impositions could also be painted as less democratic, because the state essentially rejects the self-determination of local communities to oppose new developments.   But, Chen Zhao, the head of economic research at Redfin, a popular home-search platform and brokerage, argues it's not necessarily less democratic because, when you take housing decisions out of local hands and make them at higher levels of government, \"it is about taking the interests of more people into account.\" For instance, the people who have been priced out of the cities where they work and have to commute into.   \"It's not just the folks who live in Manhattan who have a vested interest in Manhattan,\" Zhao says. \"There could be someone who lives across the river in New Jersey who would live in Manhattan if it was more affordable to live here. And so the question becomes, do their interests matter?\"   But serving constituencies that potentially can't or won't vote for you creates some serious challenges for politicians in a democracy. And many municipalities, responding to impassioned NIMBY locals, are actively fighting top-down, state-level attempts to meaningfully move the needle on new housing development.   \n   NIMBYism may be spreading   Of course, not all localities have been opposed to new development. Even the coastal markets known today for NIMBYism were once the sites of a blitz of new housing development after World War II.   In 2005, the economists Ed Glaeser, Joseph Gyourko, and Raven Saks published influential research that found that America's growing metro areas could basically be divided into two groups.   First, there were metro areas in the West and Northeast, often near the coasts, in places like California, Washington, New York, and Massachusetts, which were resistant to building new housing in the face of rising demand. That scarcity of housing supply, coupled with lots of demand to live in these markets, created a sort of pressure cooker of unaffordability for renters and would-be owners. At the same time, of course, it created huge financial gains for those lucky enough to already own homes in these markets.   Second, there were what are sometimes called the \"Sunbelt\" markets, like in North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Texas, and Arizona, which were building like crazy in the face of rising demand. Instead of skyrocketing prices, they saw skyrocketing population growth and more moderate price increases. Back in 2005, Gyourko says, these places were not seeing an affordability crisis like those in the West and Northeast.   Last year, Glaeser and Gyourko released a working paper that looks at what has happened in the two decades since 2005.   \"We continue to undersupply in the big coastal markets,\" Gyourko says. \"But what's new, different and alarming is we're starting to undersupply — and have been for the last decade or two — in the high employment, growth markets in the Sunbelt.\"   In other words, many of the places that used to build a lot are starting to look more like the NIMBY strongholds on the coasts.   Gyourko and Glaeser don't offer definitive evidence for why many Sunbelt markets have begun to see lower rates of new housing development. It could be, for example, that after many years of building, they've already developed on easy-to-develop land, and now development politics have gotten trickier. Even if that were true though, these localities — like those in other high-demand metropolises — could still build more housing vertically with tall apartment buildings. The economists suggest that locals have begun gumming up new development through rules and regulations, much like those on the West and East coasts. In other words, NIMBYism has maybe metastasized.   \n   Why might that be? Maybe people are curmudgeons and just don't like seeing their communities change. Maybe something changed demographically in these places, and there's now more NIMBY-minded homeowners living there.   Or maybe, after decades of development, people are fed up with all of the negative side effects that often come with larger populations, including worse traffic, parking headaches, and more crowded schools or parks. These \"negative externalities,\" as economists call them, can be at least partially mitigated with smart urban planning and investments in public transportation, but often they're not — and it's easy to see why locals could dislike big bursts of new development.   \" I think concentrated development can create backlash,\" Einstein says. \"And we see this historically, and it looks like it may be happening in some pockets of the South as well, that people respond to this development by opposing new development, and perhaps creating regulatory processes that ensure that they have veto power over future projects.\"   Whatever the reason, many metro areas that used to be YIMBY seem to be turning more NIMBY, and housing prices have started rising at a faster clip there as a result.   Austin: A success story or cautionary tale for YIMBYism?    But, Gyourko says, there are at least two clear exceptions to all this: Nashville and Austin.   Both, he says, built so much housing in recent years that supply has outstripped demand, and housing prices have begun falling there.   An analysis from Zillow released in December found that Austin is seeing some of the steepest home value declines in the nation. They estimate the average home price has fallen more than six percent over the last year. Other data sources show a similar story of declining housing prices there.   Some might argue that Austin built too much, and that's a problem. If you're a home or apartment owner who is now seeing your home value decline, you might feel that way. And you might advise, watch out, other cities, the YIMBYs are coming!   \n   But Einstein sees it differently. \"So I guess overbuilding is one way of framing that,\" she says. \"I might also say that's a success story, where we have seen a market like Austin, which got incredibly overheated and got really, really expensive very quickly, now starting to correct a bit and starting to become more affordable.\"   And keep some perspective, she says. \"It's still the case that it is more expensive to live in Austin now than it was ten years ago. So I think it's more that we are starting to see those prices go back to a place that is a little more accessible to more Austin residents.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                AUSTIN, TEXAS - MARCH 19: In an aerial view, the groundwork for apartments is seen undergoing construction on March 19, 2024 in Austin, Texas.\n                \n                    Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Austin and Nashville have taken a more free-market approach to housing development than many other localities, and, now, Gyourko says, the market is responding to the reality that supply has outstripped demand. \"What's happened? How does the market correct? They stopped building,\" he says. \"There's still strong demand to be in those markets. They're thriving economically. So the demand will pick up and in two or three years, they'll likely go back to growing.\"   The YIMBY political fight   While Austin might be seeing falling prices, other local housing markets are still in a price pressure cooker created by intense housing scarcity. For example, with the AI boom, the already exorbitant San Francisco Bay Area has seen sizable hikes in rents and home prices over the last few years.   Not all housing markets react to new development the same. After deindustrialization, many cities, like Detroit, had long periods of falling home prices. Demand to live there fell. And their problem became that their existing housing stock was too big.   But the Bay Area, for example, is the center of a technological revolution. It has tons of high paid professionals who make a lot of money, and people from around the world want to come there and work. There's incredible demand to live there, and, after years of ridiculously low levels of building, there's a deep scarcity of housing. Erecting even a considerable number of new apartment buildings in a market like the Bay Area isn't likely going to tank housing prices.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A view of San Francisco's famed Painted Ladies victorian houses on February 18, 2014 in San Francisco, California.\n                \n                    Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Matthew Lewis is the director of communications at California YIMBY, a policy organization aimed at increasing housing development and affordability. He says their big goal is to build many more apartment and condo buildings in urban cores, which they hope will reduce rent prices and make buying apartments and condos more attainable to a wider swath of people. Their focus is apartments and condos, he says, because those will be able to house way more people than single-family homes, and they will make a bigger dent in the affordability crisis.   \n   Creating more apartments and condos in urban cores, he suggests, also results in fewer negative side effects than building single-family homes in urban peripheries. For example, putting lots more residents on the outskirts of urban cores can result in more clogged freeways and undesirable commuting times.   Lewis suggests there isn't really a tradeoff between single-family home values and the building of apartment complexes, at least in red hot markets like the Bay Area. In fact, Lewis points to studies — including in Alexandria, Virginia and Salt Lake City, Utah — that suggest that adding new apartment complexes in growing urban areas may actually even slightly increase single-family home values.   Lewis argues that more apartments will increase economic activity and business opportunities in booming cities, and that further increases demand to live there, helping to boost single-family home values even while it can reduce rents for apartment dwellers.   \"I think that there's a win-win here on the property value question that's borne out by the evidence,\" Lewis says.   Gyourko believes the vast majority of the nation's growing metro areas have so underbuilt for so many decades, the \" latent demand is so strong, prices won't fall,\" he says. \"Ab sent a recession, the chances of us building so much that we cause a house price collapse — I think it's close to zero.\"   On the one hand, that might be solace to homeowners in coveted housing markets. They don't have to worry about their home value tanking, unless there's a recession or some other calamity. But, on the other hand, that can be super frustrating to those who desperately want housing to become more affordable.   \"This actually makes the politics of getting people to accept more housing incredibly difficult because it is an awful political slogan to say, 'Let's build more housing so price increases aren't as high as they would've been if we hadn't built as much housing,'\" Einstein says. \"Like, no one wants to run on that.\"   \n   But that's kind of the hope in places like the Bay Area and New York City. They can build and, at this juncture, the amount of building they're actually going to do could maybe bring down the growth rate of rents and home prices — and, in a plausible scenario, maybe slow them down below average income growth, and so, over time, housing will become relatively more affordable. But we probably won't see dramatic increases in affordability all of a sudden, especially considering they're not building anywhere near enough to do that.   Despite the political challenges, YIMBYs have had some important victories in recent years. But, arguably, many of them have been accomplished by appeasing the concerns of the massive and powerful voting bloc of homeowners.   For example, one big YIMBY victory: laws that have allowed homeowners in California and other states to build \"Accessory Dwelling Units\" (ADUs) on their properties. Think like allowing homeowners to build a guest house in their backyard. That increases the supply of housing in areas where housing is desperately needed. At the same time, homeowners have a big incentive to support it because they get financial benefits from those new developments.   Another strategy: building apartment buildings in urban settings near transit stops while avoiding new developments in single-family neighborhoods, which are sometimes viewed as politically untouchable.   \" I definitely think it is politically easier to just avoid trying to develop in single-family neighborhoods,\" Einstein says. But, she points out, that solution could be suboptimal for a variety of reasons. One big one: it may contribute to \" patterns of economic and racial segregation,\" where neighborhoods with single-family homes \" remain these isolated enclaves of privilege.\"   As we recently covered in a Planet Money episode featuring Harvard economist Raj Chetty, mounting research suggests that economic and racial segregation is tremendously harmful to the economic prospects of disadvantaged kids.   \n   So what should policymakers do?    To make a real dent in affordability in many places, Einstein says it's not enough to reform and streamline the land-use regulations that have been holding back housing supply.   \" Doing that alone is going to be helpful for building more housing, but it is not going to make housing affordable for people in poverty,\" Einstein says. \"We're not going to, by building more market-rate housing, solve the sort of housing issues for that segment of the market. That is a segment of the market where you need extensive government subsidy.\"   But, Einstein says, streamlining the permitting process for new housing development will also make it easier to build government-subsidized or public housing too.   Einstein says there are reasons to be both pessimistic and optimistic about solving America's housing affordability crisis.   She says she's pessimistic because NIMBYs remain politically powerful, especially at the local level. And while there have been state-level efforts to increase housing supply, many of those initiatives have been riddled with loopholes and poison pills that allow local NIMBYs to distort or water down new housing development efforts. Beyond the difficult politics of new development, rising construction prices add an additional challenge.   But she says she's optimistic because there seems to be a rising YIMBY tide. Boston University, she says, conducts an annual survey of mayors, and over the last several years they've asked them about the economics of housing. \" And we have seen over the last four years, big increases in the proportion of mayors who believe that they need to build more housing in order to reduce prices,\" she says. \"So I think that's really heartening and suggests the people who hold the levers of power understand this problem more than they did even four years ago.\"   And, of course, many homeowners care about issues beyond just their home price. Lewis says the reality is that housing markets have gotten so ridiculously expensive that nurses, firefighters, police officers, and other critical community workers are having trouble living in the cities where they work. And the affordability crisis is affecting homeowners' family members.   \n   \"After a couple generations of people thinking, 'I don't want it here,' now we're hearing people say, 'Oh gosh, my kids had to move three states over.' 'My parents can't find anywhere affordable to live for their retirement,'\" Lewis says.\n",

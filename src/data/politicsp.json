Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., was rushed by a man during a town hall event Tuesday night and sprayed with a liquid via a syringe.    Footage from the event shows a man approaching Omar at her lectern as she is delivering remarks and spraying an unknown substance in her direction, before swiftly being tackled by security. Omar called on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to resign or face impeachment immediately before the assault.   Noem has faced criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in the aftermath of the fatal shooting of 37-year-old intensive care nurse Alex Pretti by federal officers in Minneapolis on Saturday.    \n   Omar's staff can be heard urging her to step away and get \"checked out,\" with others nearby saying the substance smelled bad.    \"We will continue,\" Omar responded. \"These f****** a**holes are not going to get away with it.\"    A statement from Omar's office released after the event said the individual who approached and sprayed the congresswoman is now in custody.    \"The Congresswoman is okay,\" the statement read. \"She continued with her town hall because she doesn't let bullies win.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A syringe lays on the ground after a man (left) who approached Rep.

I’m a survivor so this small agitator isn’t going to intimidate me from doing my work. I don’t let bullies win. Grateful to my incredible constituents who rallied behind me. Minnesota strong.— Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) January 28, 2026 \n   \n   As Omar continued her remarks at the town hall, she said: \"We are Minnesota strong and we will stay resilient in the face of whatever they might throw at us.\"    Just three days ago, fellow Democrat Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida said he was assaulted at the Sundance Festival by a man \"who told me that Trump was going to deport me before he punched me in the face.\"    Threats against congressional lawmakers have been rising. Last year, there was an increase in security funding in the wake of growing concerns about political violence in the country.   According to the U.S. Capitol Police, the number of threat assessment cases has increased for the third year in a row. In 2025, the USCP investigated 14,938 \"concerning statements, behaviors, and communications\" directed toward congressional lawmakers, their families and staff. That figure represents a nearly 58% increase from 2024. \n",

Pretti's death at the hands of immigration officers escalated tensions surrounding the Trump administration's immigration enforcement surge, and has already prompted bipartisan calls for an investigation. Pretti was the second U.S. citizen killed by immigration officers in Minneapolis this month.   According to the preliminary assessment, Customs and Border Protection officers said Pretti resisted arrest before two officers shot him.   \n   But the assessment makes no mention of Pretti attacking officers or threatening them with a weapon — as the administration first described the incident. It also appears to more closely match multiple bystander video and witness testimony of the incident.   The preliminary assessment of Pretti's shooting, known as a death notification, was shared by congressional sources not authorized to speak publicly, and reviewed by NPR. It was based on body-worn camera footage and documentation from the agency, it said.   The CBP assessment describes how officers were initially confronted by two women who were blowing whistles while they conducted an immigration enforcement operation.   \"The [officer] pushed them both away and one of the females ran to a male, later identified as 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a US citizen. The [officer] attempted to move the woman and Pretti out of the roadway. The woman and Pretti did not move,\" the review states, adding that the officer then sprayed both with oleoresin capsicum spray, commonly known as pepper spray.   \n   CBP officers attempted to take Pretti into custody. Pretti resisted their efforts and a struggle ensued, according to the report.   During the struggle, an agent yelled, \"He's got a gun!\" multiple times, the review states.   Approximately five seconds later, one agent discharged his CBP-issued Glock 19 and an officer also discharged his CBP-issued Glock 47 at Pretti. After the shooting, an agent advised that he had Pretti's firearm in his possession, the review states.   Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was quick to describe Pretti's actions as \"domestic terrorism,\" saying Pretti was \"attacking\" officers and \"brandishing\" a weapon before he was killed. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller described Pretti as a \"would-be-assassin.\"   \n   Multiple bystander videos and witness testimony contradict that portrayal of the incident. Pretti can be seen holding only a phone in his hand before at least six officers tackle him, pinning him face down on the ground and shooting him in the back, firing what sounds like 10 shots.   One eyewitness said in a court document that Pretti was not even facing agents when they grabbed him. \"It didn't look like he was trying to resist, just trying to help [a] woman up,\" they wrote.   Noem has come under bipartisan scrutiny for her quick characterization of the incident.   In Washington, Democrats are pushing to block funding for the Homeland Security Department, and several other agencies, after the shooting and the administration's response. Several Republicans, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and John Curtis of Utah, also criticized Noem's immediate effort to blame Pretti, and others called for an investigation.   \n   The assessment of Pretti's death was conducted by an internal Customs and Border Protection oversight office known as the Office of Professional Responsibility; it cautions that any information may be updated as more details come to light.   Homeland Security Investigations, a branch of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is investigating the incident. It's also under review by the Office of Professional Responsibility's Investigative Operations Directorate, which investigates employee misconduct.   The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General was also notified about Pretti's death, according to the assessment.\n",

Trump has said the Cuban government is ready to fall, and that the island would receive no more oil shipments from Venezuela after a U.S. military operation deposed former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.   In its deepening energy and economic crisis, Cuba has relied heavily on foreign assistance and oil shipments from allies like Mexico, Russia, and — previously — Venezuela.   Mexico has sought to balance its long-term support of Cuba's government with pressure from Trump for Latin American leaders to fall in line with his vision for the region.   Sheinbaum said Tuesday that Mexico would continue to show solidarity with Havana, but didn't clarify what kind of support Mexico would offer.   Mexico has faced its own pressure from Washington, as Trump has threatened to take military action against Mexican drug cartels.   Mexico last week transferred dozens of suspected cartel members to the United States to face justice. They were sought by the Trump administration, but Sheinbaum used similar language at the time as she did Tuesday, saying the transfers were made on a sovereign and autonomous basis.   \n   Mexican oil has long acted as a key lifeline for Cuba. In its most recent report, Pemex said it shipped nearly 20,000 barrels of oil per day to Cuba from January through Sept. 30, 2025. That month, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Mexico City. Afterward, Jorge Piñon, an expert at the University of Texas Energy Institute who tracks shipments using satellite technology, said the figure had fallen to about 7,000 barrels.   Sheinbaum has spent weeks saying she would provide clear data on exports to Cuba, but has yet to do so. The Cuban government and Pemex did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   Piñon said that while the future of shipments from Mexico remains uncertain, what was clear is that Sheinbaum is \"walking a tightrope\" between her political rhetoric supporting Cuba and upcoming trade agreement negotiations with the U.S.   Analysts now expect further pressure from Washington to halt those shipments more permanently, given Trump's growing demands that Mexico deliver stronger results in the fight against drug cartels.   Meanwhile, dozens of drivers waited hours in long lines — common on the island — to fill up their cars with gasoline, saying they had heard the news. While some said they weren't particularly worried and said they would find a way forward, others expressed deep anxiety over what the future might hold.   Rolando Graña, 40, spent two hours of his day off in a gas line. For the airport employee, it was a hunt for fuel rather than a day of rest.   \"That's going to affect us a lot more now,\" Graña said.\n",

    "body": "\n      Border czar Tom Homan met with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz Tuesday. Homan takes over from Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino, overseeing ICE operations in the state. Do things look any different on the ground?   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  Minnesota Governor Tim Walz met with President Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, today in what seems to be the beginning of talks since the shakeup in immigration leadership. The Trump administration continues to face significant criticism over immigration enforcement in Minnesota, following two fatal shootings of U.S. citizens by federal agents just this month. Minnesota Public Radio's Brian Bakst is in St. Paul. Hi there, Brian.BRIAN BAKST, BYLINE: Hi there.KELLY: So how'd this meeting between the governor and Tom Homan go today?BAKST: The two met this morning in the governor's state Capitol office, and it really was our first indication that Tom Homan had arrived in Minnesota after being dispatched to the state yesterday by President Trump. The meeting was private, so we don't know everything that was said, but Walz's office says the governor stressed his main objectives. And they include a swift drawdown in the massive presence of federal agents in Minnesota for many weeks now and his request that a state unit be part of the investigation into the deadly shootings of two observers, Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti. Walz entered the meeting hopeful that the tide was changing, and here's what he told us yesterday.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TIM WALZ: Whether it was morality or bad optics and poll numbers, whatever has happened here, there is a definite change of tone. There is definitely a more collaborative tone. I want to make sure that I'm not jeopardizing that, that I'm going to take them for their word right now, that they're going to reduce this force. They're going to let us be part of a fair investigation.BAKST: The White House told us that Homan wasn't available for comment at this time. Trump did tell reporters that he wants an honorable and honest investigation, and in an appearance just a bit ago on Fox News, the president said his administration is going to, quote, \"de-escalate a little bit.\"KELLY: Meanwhile, where you are today, I understand Homan also met with Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis. What do we know about how that meeting went?BAKST: Yes. That meeting happened a bit later in the day. And again, we weren't invited in, and the participants - they weren't available for questions after. But Mayor Frey issued a statement later saying that in part, he appreciated the conversation, and he also pushed for a quick end to the Minnesota operation. Frey says that he conveyed to Homan just how much community trust and local police officer resources had been strained during these past seven weeks of intensive immigration enforcement.KELLY: So these meetings today, of course, follow the big shake-up yesterday. Late yesterday, the White House announced Homan would take over immigration enforcement operations there, that Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino - he was out. And has that translated into any change on the ground, so far as you can tell?BAKST: It's really hard to say, and that's partly because the entire operation has been a bit opaque. Agents would just show up in places, and there would sometimes be clashes. Full arrest data was never disclosed. We've been able to keep some tabs on the number of detainments through court filings, and those are on behalf of immigrants arrested for possible deportation. We'll be watching to see if those court filings challenging detainments fall off.But there's still the sense that residents across the Twin Cities aren't ready to let their guard down just yet. It's really hard for them to tell if the step-down is real. NPR's Liz Baker spoke with Flavio Moreno earlier today as he lit a candle near a memorial to Alex Pretti. He said he wanted to honor Pretti because he died protecting Moreno's community of Latino immigrants. And Liz asked if he thought changes in DHS leadership on the ground would make a difference, and he really wasn't optimistic.FLAVIO MARENO: Not really, not really - I'm thinking we're going to see nothing real till we don't see ICE in the streets.BAKST: Until we don't see ICE on the streets is what he stressed there.KELLY: Meanwhile, Alex Pretti's sister issued her first statement today. Can you describe it?BAKST: Yeah. She wrote about her older brother as kind, generous and said he had a way of lighting up a room - every room he walked into. She called him her hero. But Micayla ended it by criticizing the way Trump administration officials characterized her brother as having malicious intent the day he was killed and asked, where does this end? Mary Louise, that's a question a lot of people in Minnesota also have.KELLY: Brian Bakst from Minnesota Public Radio. Thank you.BAKST: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

The sweeping changes were made to accelerate development of a new generation of nuclear reactor designs. They occurred over the fall and winter at the Department of Energy, which is currently overseeing a program to build at least three new experimental commercial nuclear reactors by July 4 of this year.   \n   The changes are to departmental orders, which dictate requirements for almost every aspect of the reactors' operations – including safety systems, environmental protections, site security and accident investigations.   NPR obtained copies of over a dozen of the new orders, none of which are publicly available. The orders slash hundreds of pages of requirements for security at the reactors. They also loosen protections for ground water and the environment and eliminate at least one key safety role. The new orders cut back on requirements for keeping records, and they raise the amount of radiation a worker can be exposed to before an official accident investigation is triggered.   Over 750 pages were cut from the earlier versions of the same orders, according to NPR's analysis, leaving only about one third of the number of pages in the original documents.    Loading... \n   The new generation of nuclear reactor designs, known as Small Modular Reactors, are being backed by billions in private equity, venture capital and public investments. Backers of the reactors, including tech giants Amazon, Google and Meta, have said they want the reactors to one day supply cheap, reliable power for artificial intelligence. (Amazon and Google are financial supporters of NPR.)   Outside experts who helped review the rules for NPR criticized the decision to revise them without any public knowledge.   \n   \"I would argue that the Department of Energy relaxing its nuclear safety and security standards in secret is not the best way to engender the kind of public trust that's going to be needed for nuclear to succeed more broadly,\" said Christopher Hanson, who chaired the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from 2021 to 2025, when he was fired by President Trump.   \"They're taking a wrecking ball to the system of nuclear safety and security regulation oversight that has kept the U.S. from having another Three Mile Island accident,\" said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"I am absolutely worried about the safety of these reactors.\"   \n   The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment. But in a previous e-mail, it said safety was its top priority.    \"The U.S. Department of Energy is committed to the highest standards of safety in the research and development of nuclear technologies, including the reactor designs utilizing the DOE authorization pathway,\" a department spokesperson wrote to NPR in December.   A new nuclear path   The origins of the changes can be traced to the Oval Office. In May of last year, Trump sat behind the Resolute Desk and signed a series of executive orders on nuclear energy.   \n   \"It's a hot industry, it's a brilliant industry, you have to do it right,\" Trump said as smiling executives from the nuclear industry looked on. \"It's become very safe and environmental, yes one hundred percent.\"   Among the executive orders Trump signed that day was one that called for the creation of a new program at the Department of Energy to build experimental reactors. The document Trump signed explicitly stated that: \"The Secretary shall approve at least three reactors pursuant to this pilot program with the goal of achieving [nuclear] criticality in each of the three reactors by July 4, 2026.\"    Loading... \n   In other words, the Department of Energy had just over a year to review, approve and oversee the construction of multiple, untested nuclear reactors.   That timeline has raised eyebrows.   \"To say that it's aggressive is a pretty big understatement,\" said Kathryn Huff, a professor of plasma and nuclear engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who served as head of the DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy from 2022 to 2024. Research reactors typically take at least two years to build from the point when construction begins, Huff said. Few – if any – have been built on the timescale laid out in the executive order.   Officials at the Energy Department knew the clock was ticking. In June, they met with the heads of several companies at the Nuclear Energy Institute, the nuclear industry's main lobby group in Washington, D.C. They briefed the gathering of CEOs, lawyers and nuclear engineers about the department's new \"Reactor Pilot Program.\"   \"One thing I do want to stress, this is not a funding opportunity,\" Michael Goff, the DOE's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy, said during the meeting, which was recorded. Rather than offering money, the Reactor Pilot Program was promising something else that the companies had long wanted – a pathway to quickly get new test reactor designs through regulatory approval.   \n   \"Our job is to make sure that the government is no longer a barrier,\" said Seth Cohen, a lawyer at the Department of Energy responsible for implementing Trump's executive orders.   The DOE was uniquely positioned to offer a speedy pathway to approval. The nation's commercial nuclear reactors are typically under the regulatory oversight of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Hanson says the NRC is independent and known for its rigor and public process.   Loading...\n   But since the NRC began its work in 1975, the Energy Department has retained the ability to regulate its own reactors, which have historically been used for research and nuclear weapons-related activities.   The rules governing DOE reactors are a mix of federal regulations and directives known as \"orders.\" Changes to federal regulations require public notice and comment, but DOE's orders can be legally changed internally with no public comment period. The orders have historically been made public via a DOE database.   Until now, the DOE's rules have typically applied to just a handful of reactors located on government property. The Reactor Pilot Program expands that regulatory authority to all reactors built as part of the program. Officials explained to the crowd in the June meeting that this includes DOE-contracted reactors built outside of the department's national laboratories.   And while broadening its oversight, officials said, safety personnel located primarily at Idaho National Laboratory would also rewrite the DOE's orders for these reactors.   \"DOE orders and standards are under evaluation as part of this regulatory reform,\" Christian Natoni, an official from DOE's Idaho Operations Office, told the gathering. \"What you will see in the near term is a streamlined set of requirements to support this reactor authorization activity.\"   Rules rewritten   The documents reviewed by NPR show just how extensive the streamlining effort has been.   The new orders strip out some guiding principles of nuclear safety, notably a concept known as \"As Low As Reasonably Achievable\" (ALARA), which requires nuclear reactor operators to keep levels of radiation exposure below the legal limit whenever they can. The ALARA standard has been in use for decades at both the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.   \n   Removing the standard means that new reactors could be constructed with less concrete shielding, and workers could work longer shifts, potentially receiving higher doses of radiation, according to Tison Campbell, a partner at K&L Gates who previously worked as a lawyer at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.   \"So the result could be lower construction costs, saved employment costs and things like that,\" Campbell said. \"That could reduce the overall financial burden of constructing and operating a nuclear powerplant.\"   Huff said that many people in the industry think the concept of ALARA has become overly onerous, and she agrees it's worth reconsidering the standard.   \"The argument against ALARA is that in a lot of cases it's been mismanaged and used overly stringently in ways that go beyond the 'reasonable,'\" Huff said.   But not everyone wants to rethink ALARA.   \"It certainly cost the industry money to lower doses [of radiation],\" said Emily Caffrey, a health physicist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. \"But I don't think it's been incredibly problematic.\"   In a memo issued earlier this month, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright gave approval to end ALARA, in part to \"reduce the economic and operational burden on nuclear energy while aligning with available scientific evidence.\" The existence of the memo was first reported by E&E News.   However, the orders seen by NPR suggest the department had already begun removing the ALARA requirement from the new rules as early as August, months before the secretary's approval was given.   ALARA is not the only safety principle that has been stripped from the orders. Gone too is the requirement to have an engineer designated to each of a reactor's critical safety systems. Known as a Cognizant System Engineer, the idea is to task one person to take responsibility for understanding each part of a reactor that could lead to a severe accident if it failed.   \n   The new rules also remove a requirement to use the \"best available technology\" to protect water supplies from the discharge of radioactive material.   \"Why wouldn't you be using the best available technology? I don't understand the motivation for cutting things like that,\" Caffrey said.   The revised orders leave out dozens of references to other documents and standards, including the department's entire manual for managing radioactive waste. Some lines from the 59-page manual have been integrated into a new 25-page order on radioactive waste management, but pages of detailed requirements for waste packaging and monitoring have been removed.   But perhaps nowhere are the cuts more obvious than in the new order on safeguards and security. Seven security directives totaling over 500 pages have been consolidated into a single, 23-page order.    Loading... \n   Gone are detailed requirements for firearms training, emergency drills, officer-involved shooting procedures and limits on how many hours security force officers can work in a day or week. Entire chapters specifying how nuclear material should be secured and what sorts of physical barriers should be built to protect it have been reduced to bullet points.   \"Security is an expense that the nuclear industry has long complained about,\" Lyman said. Paying for a guard force is costly and many companies would like to reduce the requirements, he said. \"They don't know why they have to pay so much money to protect against something they think is never going to happen.\"   Reviewing the new security rules, Lyman said he felt the general requirements are allowing companies \"to write their own ticket as far as security goes.\" He's especially concerned because several of the new reactor designs use higher levels of enriched uranium in their cores, which could make them targets of theft.   Loosening protections for the environment and workers   NPR's review of the new orders show that, in certain cases, they also appear to loosen rules about discharging radioactive material.   \n   For example, the previous version of an order titled \"Radiation Protection for the Public and the Environment\" states that discharging radioactivity \"from DOE activities into non-federally owned sanitary sewers are prohibited,\" then provides a limited series of exceptions.   The new standard says only that radioactive discharges into sanitary sewers \"should be avoided.\" Similar language changes were made to soften restrictions on groundwater discharges, and protections for the environment.   Experts who were asked to review the changes by NPR agreed that the net effect was to loosen the standards.   \"Anywhere they have changed 'prohibited' or 'must' to 'should be' or 'can be' — that is a loosening of regulation. That's a big change in words, in meaning,\" Caffrey said.    Loading... \n   The changes constitute a \"very clearly a loosening that I would have wanted to see exposed to public discussion,\" Huff told NPR. She calls the relaxing of environmental rules \"especially disappointing\" because the Idaho National Lab – where several of the reactors are due to be built – has been the site of ecological preservation activities in the past. \"I think some of those preservation activities have had a great positive impact on the ecosystem there,\" she said.   There are signs that the Energy Department is seeking to change safety rules beyond the orders seen by NPR. Last week, the department published a plan to exclude some worker safety standards in order to help the reactor program move more quickly. The proposed rule change would strip out some standards for things like respiratory protection and welding. Because the worker safety rules are part of the Code of Federal Regulations, the department was required by law to publish the proposed changes. The agency said in its notice that the changes \"present significant advantages that can enhance operational efficiency and safety for DOE contractors.\"   Concierge service   The new orders are now being used by around 30 experts across DOE and around a dozen experts on loan from the NRC to conduct design and safety reviews of 11 reactor designs being built by ten private companies.   \n   Each company also has access to a \"Concierge Team\" to \"provide assistance to the applicant to ensure expeditious processing of its application,\" according to a memo also obtained by NPR, which has not been made public.   The team is made up of \"representatives from the Secretary's office, the Office of the General Counsel, the Office of Nuclear Energy\" and each team member reports directly to the Secretary of Energy – raising the possibility that senior officials could exert pressure on lower-level staff to speed safety evaluations of the new reactors.   Reactors by July   Ultimately, experts who viewed the new rules had doubts about whether they really would help the Reactor Pilot Program reach its goal of building three new reactors by July.   Hanson said he believes the numerous cuts to the new orders will not necessarily simplify the review process. One of the benefits of having things explicitly written down was that \"contractors and others knew how to comply with the rules,\" he said. \"If you take that away, you might have more flexibility, maybe, but it's also less clear how to do that.\"   The orders also clearly laid out the steps needed to ensure companies abided by other relevant laws, Campbell said. He worries the rewrites that loosen rules on things like radiological discharges could actually lead companies to violate other environmental and safety laws. For example, radiological releases into public sewers might violate legal limits under the Clean Water Act.   Companies may not read those underlying laws, \"so I think you're setting them up to violate statutes or regulations that are going to remain in place,\" he said.   But above all, the fact that the rewrites were done without public knowledge could be the most damaging, said Huff. In the past, public distrust has been a huge barrier to the development of nuclear power, and transparency is an important way to counter that mistrust.   \n   \"In the best world, the public should expect as much openness from the government as is possible,\" she said. \"If it's possible to share with the companies at this point, then there's a really important question as to why it's not public.\"   \n",

And Carlson is more than happy to provide his thoughts and his advice,\" Zengerle says. \"That doesn't mean that Trump always takes that advice, and there have certainly been instances where Carlson's been disappointed by some of Trump's decisions, but he seems to have a seat at the table.\"   \n   Carlson got his start in conservative print media and transitioned to TV in the early days of cable news. After he was let go from CNN and MSNBC (now MS NOW), he was hired by Fox, then abruptly fired in 2023. He has since launched a new streaming show on the social media platform X, where he's espoused far-right fringe positions, such the \"great replacement\" conspiracy theory.   \"Since leaving Fox, he doesn't have a built-in audience anymore and he has to navigate the attention economy. And in order to get people to listen to his podcast, I think he has kind of embraced more outrageous views,\" Zengerle says. \"He's saying things before in a more explicit fashion, whereas in the past he tried to modulate his rhetoric a little bit.\"   \n   Zengerle sees the throughline of Carlson's career as a desire for \"fame, fortune and power.\" To that end, he would not be surprised if Carlson ran for office himself.    \"It's a mistake to think of him as just a media figure because I think his ambitions are bigger than that,\" Zengerle says. \"He operates as a political actor, maybe even more than a media actor at this point.\"      Interview highlights    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Hated By All The Right People: Tucker Carlson and the Unraveling of the Conservative Mind, by Jason Zengerle\n                \n                    Penguin Random House\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Penguin Random House\n    \n\n   \n   On Carlson's shift from print journalism to TV in the '90s   The things that he was good at, in terms of being glib and having an opinion on everything and just being able to appear reasonably intelligent on camera, that was the start of his career. … He would spend all this time and energy crafting these [print] stories, and it might get a little bit of a response. And then he would go on some TV show and make some off-handed remark, and a cabinet member would call him to talk about it. And I think that it was that sort of recognition that made him think that TV was the way to go.   \n   On Jon Stewart's 2004 appearance on CNN's Crossfire, which led to the show's cancellation    I think [it] was a really important moment in Tucker's career and life, because it was a humiliation. He was sort of friendly with Stewart. … He knew, obviously, that Stewart had kind of a dim view of Crossfire and a dim view of cable news. But they all thought they were kind of … play acting the way Crossfire was, you know? You would argue with this person for 30 minutes and then afterwards you'd go out and have a steak and a drink and everybody was sort of doing the same thing, and it was like professional wrestling in some ways. When Stewart came on there and wasn't part of that game, I think Tucker was really surprised and he tried to debate Stewart and Stewart just destroyed him, and destroyed him in front of a studio audience. … It led to the cancellation of the show. It led to Tucker leaving CNN.   \n   I think it was a really important moment in his life and his career because he was a member in good standing of the Washington political and media elite, and I think he felt that his friends in that world did not come to his aid and did not support him the way he would have wanted them to. And so years later, when he developed this populist streak and really turned against people in Washington and legacy media and the things like that, I think he remembered that moment and some of his bitterness towards those people really came out at that point.   On Carlson co-founding the conservative website The Daily Caller in 2010 and pivoting from reporting to tabloidy content    When he launched The Daily Caller, his idea for it was it was going to be a right-wing version of sort of a combination [of] Huffington Post and New York Times. He wanted it to be a very fact-based, heavily reported website. He had a critique of conservative media that conservatives didn't report, they just opined and, \"We need to get back to reporting. We need to get back to presenting facts, and we need to be serious about the news.\" And that was his vision for The Caller. I think within a couple months, looking at the website's traffic, he realized that there was not an audience for that kind of conservative publication — and he pivoted, and he kind of went more in the direction of tabloidy, kind of outrageous stuff.    \n   Increasingly, I think he saw that the types of stories that were getting attention, that were [getting] a lot of traffic, getting clicks, had to do with race, had to do with immigration, and had to do with gender, and he just leaned into that. Eventually he kind of found himself in this competition with Breitbart that Steve Bannon was running at the time. And it was just kind of this race to the bottom in terms of who could write more kind of inflammatory and incendiary stories about Black-on-white crime or about immigrant crime and things like that. And he saw that there was an audience there for that.   On Carlson climbing the ranks at Fox   He really was kind of an afterthought at Fox. You had the stars, you had the Bill O'Reillys, you had the Sean Hannitys. Tucker was just this guy who they could put on the weekend Fox & Friends show and he had some television experience. He was conservative, so he wasn't going to say anything that veered from the party line. He was just kind of a bit player. ...   \n   Then he got his own show, and he got his own show because he was able to use Trump's presidential candidacy to revive his career. ... When Trump came along, those more prestigious Fox shows, they had a basic television problem. They could not find camera-ready, intelligent human beings to go on their programs and make a sensible case for Donald Trump. And Tucker was someone who could, so ... he started getting more airtime that way. And then as Trump's candidacy took off and it became clear that Trump was going to be the Republican nominee. … By the end of the campaign, [Fox News CEO] Roger Ailes had been fired because of the sexual harassment scandal. [News Corps CEO] Rupert Murdoch was now running the network. And the first big move Murdoch made was taking Tucker and giving him his own show at 7 p.m.   \n   Thea Chaloner and Susan Nyakundi produced and edited this interview for broadcast. Bridget Bentz, Molly Seavy-Nesper and Brett Neely adapted it for the web.\n",

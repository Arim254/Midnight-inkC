The battle for support from 53 million registered voters comes against a backdrop of slow economic growth and heightened nationalist sentiment. While more than 50 parties are contesting the polls, only three — the People's Party, Bhumjaithai, and Pheu Thai — have the nationwide organization and popularity to gain a winning mandate.   A simple majority of the 500 elected lawmakers selects the next prime minister.   No outright winner expected   Local polls consistently project that no single party will gain a majority, necessitating the formation of a coalition government.   \n   Although the progressive People's Party is seen as favored to win a plurality, its reformist politics aren't shared by its leading rivals, which may freeze it out by joining forces to form a government.   The People's Party, led by Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut, is the successor to the Move Forward Party, which won the most seats in the House of Representatives in 2023, but was blocked from forming a government by conservative lawmakers and then forced to dissolve.   \"I think we will get the mandate from the people, and we promised the people that we will form the people's government to bring policies that benefit all, not a few in the country,\" Natthaphong told reporters after casting his ballot in Bangkok.   Reformist party softens its pitch   His party's platform continues to promise sweeping reforms of the military, police and judiciary, appealing to youth and urban voters. Legal constraints have led it to set aside demands for reform of a law that metes out harsh penalties for criticism of the monarchy, while putting new emphasis on economic issues.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Police officers and election volunteers prepare for the general election at a voting station in Bangkok, on Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026.\n                \n                    Wason Wanichakorn/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Wason Wanichakorn/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Softening its politics risks weakening its core support, already at risk because the last election had positioned it squarely as the alternative to nine previous years of military-led government, a situation it can't fruitfully exploit this time.   \n   At the same time, its positions critical of the military can be a political liability with the surge of patriotism that emerged during last year's border clashes with Cambodia, said Napon Jatusripitak, director of the Center for Politics and Geopolitics at Thailand Future, a Bangkok-based think tank.   The Bhumjaithai Party, headed by incumbent Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, is seen as the main defender and preferred choice of the royalist-military establishment.   Anutin has been prime minister only since last September, after serving in the Cabinet of his immediate predecessor, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who was forced out of office for an ethics violation regarding mishandling relations with Cambodia. He dissolved parliament in December to call a new election after he was threatened with a no-confidence vote.   Subsequent border clashes with Cambodia allowed Anutin to recast himself as a wartime leader after his popularity initially slipped because of floods and financial scandals. His campaign focuses on national security and economic stimulus.   \"We have done everything that we had to, but we cannot force the mind of the people. We can only present ourselves, and hope that the people will have faith in us,\" Anutin said after casting ballots in northeastern Buriram province, his party's stronghold.   Bhumjaithai, seen as the likeliest party to form the next government, benefits from an electoral strategy employing old-style patronage politics and a machine skilled at grassroots organizing in the vote-rich northeast.   Thaksin's political machine   The Pheu Thai Party is the latest political vehicle for billionaire former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Thaksin-backed parties staged repeated electoral comebacks, only to be ousted by conservative-leaning courts and state watchdog agencies.   It softened its politics enough by the 2023 election to be returned to power after being judged by the previously hostile royalist-military establishment as an acceptable alternative to the more progressive Move Forward party.   \n   The conservative court system rounded on it anyway — ousting two of its prime ministers over two years and ordering Thaksin imprisoned on old charges. The party now campaigns on economic revival and populist pledges like cash handouts, nominating Thaksin's nephew, Yodchanan Wongsawat, as its lead candidate for prime minister.   \"I'm excited, because I think today will be another busy day for the country's democracy,\" Yodchanan told reporters after voting.   Sunday's voting includes a referendum asking voters whether Thailand should replace its 2017 military-drafted constitution.   The vote isn't on a proposed draft, but rather to decide whether to authorize parliament to begin a formal drafting process, which would require many further steps before coming to fruition.   Pro-democracy groups view a new charter as a critical step toward reducing the influence of unelected institutions such as the military and judiciary, while conservatives warn that it could cause instability.\n",

The announcement marks the latest development in the Trump administration's prolonged standoff with Harvard over the White House's demands for reforms at the Ivy League school.   Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a statement Friday that Harvard \"no longer meets the needs of the War Department or the military services.\"   \"For too long, this department has sent our best and brightest officers to Harvard, hoping the university would better understand and appreciate our warrior class,\" Hegseth said. \"Instead, too many of our officers came back looking too much like Harvard — heads full of globalist and radical ideologies that do not improve our fighting ranks.\"   \n   In a separate post on X, Hegseth wrote, \"Harvard is woke; The War Department is not.\"   Starting with the 2026-27 academic year, the Pentagon will discontinue graduate-level professional military education, fellowships and certificate programs, the statement said. Personnel currently attending classes at Harvard will be able to finish those courses.   Similar programs at other Ivy League universities will be evaluated in coming weeks, Hegseth said.   Hegseth earned a master's degree from Harvard but symbolically returned his diploma in a 2022 Fox News segment. A Pentagon social media account run by Hegseth's office resurfaced the clip in which Hegseth, then a Fox News commentator, returned the diploma and wrote \"Return to Sender\" on it with a marker.   The military offers its officers a variety of opportunities to get graduate-level education both at war colleges run by the military as well as civilian institutions like Harvard.   Broadly, while opportunities to attend prestigious civilian schools offer less direct benefit to a servicemember's military career than their civilian counterparts, they help make troops more attractive employees once they leave the military.   Harvard has long been President Donald Trump's top target in his administration's campaign to bring the nation's most prestigious universities to heel. His officials have cut billions of dollars in Harvard's federal research funding and attempted to block it from enrolling foreign students after the campus rebuffed a series of government demands last April.   \n   The White House has said it's punishing Harvard for tolerating anti-Jewish bias on campus. Harvard leaders argue they're facing illegal retaliation for failing to adopt the administration's ideological views. Harvard sued the administration in a pair of lawsuits. A federal judge issued orders siding with Harvard in both cases. The administration is appealing.   Tensions had eased over the summer as Trump teased a deal that he said was just days away. It never materialized and on Monday the president dug deeper, demanding $1 billion from Harvard as part of any deal to restore federal funding. That's twice what he had demanded before.\n",

The posts will be internally archived but will no longer be on public view, the State Department confirmed to NPR. Staff members were told that anyone wanting to see older posts will have to file a Freedom of Information Act request, according to a State Department employee who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation by the Trump administration. That would differ from how the U.S. government typically handles archiving the public online footprint of previous administrations.   \n   The move comes as the Trump administration has removed wide swaths of information from government websites that conflict with the president's views, including environmental and health data and references to women, people of color and members of the LGBTQ+ community. The government has also taken down signs at national parks mentioning slavery and references to Trump's impeachments and presidency at the National Portrait Gallery.   The White House has also launched a revisionist history account of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and has replaced the government's coronavirus resource sites with a page titled \"Lab Leak: The True Origins of Covid-19.\"   \n   The removal of State Department X posts from public view appears to be less about ideological differences with past statements and more about control of future messaging. The directive will see the removal of posts from Trump's first term as well as those under then-Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama.   In response to NPR's questions about the removals, an unnamed State Department spokesperson said the goal \"is to limit confusion on U.S government policy and to speak with one voice to advance the President, Secretary, and Administration's goals and messaging. It will preserve history while promoting the present.\" The spokesperson said the department's X accounts \"are one of our most powerful tools for advancing the America First goals and messaging of the President, Secretary, and Administration, both to our fellow Americans and audiences around the world.\"   \n   The State Department did not respond to NPR's specific questions about whether content will also be removed from other social media sites or whether there will be ways for the public to access archived posts without filing a Freedom of Information Act request.   \"All archived content will be preserved in alignment with Federal Record Act requirements and Department policies,\" the spokesperson said.   Some current and former State Department employees as well as academics worry that it will make the historical record of the government's communications and actions harder to trace.   \"For all the many challenges, certainly, that social media has introduced into politics, it has also created this level of an imperfect but certainly some level of transparency,\" said Shannon McGregor, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who studies the role of social media in politics. \"Even if [the X posts are] still accessible in some kind of archive, it still puts up a greater barrier in terms of having access to that information.\"   In a similar but unrelated move this week, the CIA abruptly took down its World Factbook, a widely used reference manual seen as an authoritative source of information about countries, their economies, their demographics and more. The CIA's announcement said the publication, which has been published since 1962 and first went online in 1997, was being \"sunset\" and gave no further explanation for the decision.   Accounts for embassies, ambassadors, bureaus affected   The State Department directive applies to all the department's active official X accounts, including accounts for U.S. embassies and missions, ambassadors and department bureaus and programs, according to screenshots of internal guidance seen by NPR. The department has used its posts on X and other social media sites for years to share everything from policy announcements and speeches by the secretary of state and ambassadors, to fact sheets for travelers and images from around the world.   \n   \"These posts to be removed are not just press statements. They include our embassies' July 4 livestreams, photos of COVID vaccine donations to other nations, holiday greetings, condolences, cultural programming, and the day-to-day record of diplomacy. They show who the U.S. engaged with, when, and how—often the only public record of those moments,\" Orna Blum, a long-serving senior foreign service officer and public diplomacy specialist who retired last year, wrote in a LinkedIn post about the directive.   \"Once removed, there will be no easy public, searchable access to this history. [The Freedom of Information Act] is slow, discretionary, and often redacted. It's a backstop—not a substitute for open archives,\" Blum wrote.   Since Obama, the first president to use an official account on the social media site then called Twitter, left office in January 2017, handing over online accounts has been part of the transition process between administrations. Some content is archived, but those records typically remain in public view.   Federal agency accounts, including @StateDept on X, are passed along to the incoming administration intact, meaning that posts made under earlier administrations remain visible on their timelines. The State Department also has publicly available archived versions of its website under previous administrations dating back to President Bill Clinton.   Some high-profile accounts, including those of the president, vice president, first lady and White House, are handled differently. For example, the @POTUS handle on X is handed over from one president to the next with its existing roster of followers, but posts from the outgoing president are moved to a new archive account, such as @POTUS44 for Obama, @POTUS45 for the first Trump term and @POTUS46Archive for Biden.   The State Department guidance says the X removals do not apply to official accounts that are already dormant and marked as \"archived,\" like the @SecPompeo account used by Trump's first-term secretary of state, Mike Pompeo.   \n   New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani recently faced similar questions and concerns about transparency and preserving government records after his administration began to delete posts made by his predecessor, Eric Adams, under the @NYCMayor handle on X. However, Adams' posts can be found in a public archive maintained by the city.   As the State Department archives old posts, other agencies post extreme content   In isolation, the removal of State Department social media content is a minor change unrelated to larger overhauls of American diplomacy and foreign policy and the administration's widespread changes to the federal bureaucracy.   \n   But Trump's second-term messaging strategy has been defined by a mindset that social media content is governing and that governing is also achieved through content creation.   The Department of Homeland Security, the Labor Department and other federal government accounts have shared posts that contain white supremacist rhetoric and nods to conspiracy theories like QAnon. And Trump administration staffers frequently use X to spar with critics and post memes that support the president.   \n   On Friday, Trump faced uncharacteristic pushback from some fellow Republicans after sharing a video on his social media site that contained false claims of election fraud — and a short snippet of an unrelated video that contained a racist depiction of former President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama as apes.   That post was deleted, after the White House initially defended it as an \"internet meme.\"\n",

It is also not a new clinical practice guideline, but rather an articulation of the professional group's recommendations \"given the current state of the evidence and variability in legal and regulatory environments,\" it says.   Pressure that's working   That legal and regulatory environment is colored by 27 state bans and a White House aiming to end surgeries and all other types of gender-affirming care for minors across the country.   \n   A week into his second term, President Trump signed an executive order declaring: \"It is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures.\"   In the months since, HHS released a report critical of the research that supports access to this care and warned state Medicaid directors to tread carefully. The Department of Justice announced subpoenas of some children's hospitals and threatened providers with prosecution.   \n   In December, federal health officials proposed a rule that would withhold all Medicare and Medicaid funding from hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to children and teens. Even though it hasn't been finalized, the specter that it will be, along with a deluge of investigations by the HHS Inspector General, has been shuttering hospital gender clinics all over the country.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                HHS Deputy Secretary Jim O'Neill, who has also been the acting director of the CDC since August, is sworn in by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in June 2025.\n                \n                    Amy Rossetti/HHS via AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Amy Rossetti/HHS via AP\n    \n\n   \n   Also this week, a patient won $2 million in a malpractice lawsuit against her plastic surgeon and psychologist in New York state after she had a mastectomy, or \"top\" surgery, as a minor and came to regret it.   The combined threat of malpractice lawsuits, state bans and hospitals ending gender programs, means that the options for transgender teenagers seeking surgery are dwindling, which is the White House's stated goal.   \n   One 15-year-old transgender boy in California tells NPR his plan to have top surgery is on hold since Kaiser Permanente health system stopped providing gender-affirming surgery to youth. \"It's not easy to do it out of pocket,\" he says. NPR agreed not to name him because he fears for his safety.   He calls the new position from the plastic surgeons' group \"disappointing,\" and points out that the Trump administration also recently sent warning letters to the makers of binders, a type of compression top that people can wear to flatten their chest. They are often used by transgender teens who can't get or don't want surgery.   \"Which is crazy because it's not like a binder is permanent. You can take it off anytime you want,\" he says. \"I was going to ask, 'What do they want us to do?' But I think the answer is to detransition.\"   Surgery for teenagers   There's no clear count of how many transgender teenagers have gender-affirming surgery. The full statement from the ASPS \"recommends that surgeons delay gender-related breast/chest, genital, and facial surgery until a patient is at least 19 years old.\" Gender surgery on people under 18 is rare, and most of the surgeries performed are top surgery.   The ASPS tells NPR the group does not gather data on precisely how many are performed. One study of a database of surgical procedures found an average of 800 top surgeries per year in patients aged 18 and younger between 2016-2020. State-level gender affirming care bans proliferated beginning in 2022, and it is unclear how the bans have affected how many transgender minors get top surgery.   \n   Minors who are not transgender also have plastic surgery and face similar risks of complications and potential regret. In 2024, ASPS data shows that more than 9,000 girls aged 19 or younger had cosmetic breast surgery, and nearly 3,000 boys under age 19 had breast reduction surgery.   The ASPS position on breast augmentation for teenagers similarly recommends waiting until age 18 for surgery. \"While both position statements address surgery in adolescents, the ethical considerations are not the same,\" ASPS explained in an email to NPR. \"Cosmetic procedures are generally not dependent on future identity development or long-term psychological trajectories.\"   \n   When it comes to gender-affirming surgery for transgender youth, ASPS added, \"interventions are irreversible, expected benefits are uncertain, potential harms may be lifelong, and patients are minors with evolving preferences and identities who have been diagnosed with a condition of unknown stability.\"   Years of waiting   A mom in California told NPR this week that her child came out to her as transgender when he was 13. She asked that NPR not use her name because she fears for her family's safety. She says she was surprised and didn't know much about trans issues when her son came out. \"He got therapy. We got therapy. We reached out to different organizations, and over time, we've grown to understand better what it means.\"   She says he wanted top surgery. \"Like a lot of parents, the idea of doing this permanent surgery, even for us — we were really frightened to make the right decision, so we told him no,\" she says. \"And he tried, and we watched him trying, wearing binders and tape. After a while, it was just really hard to watch,\" she says. For transgender boys who bind their chests, \"it's very painful — physically painful — trying to get their bodies to fit in a way that they can go out and just have a normal day.\"   When her son turned 15, she and her husband finally agreed to look into top surgery.   \n   \"There are a lot of requirements — it's not something you just go in and get — there is therapy, multiple meetings with different doctors,\" she says. Their original surgery appointment was cancelled when the hospital got cold feet, so they had to scramble to get it rescheduled.   Her son is now 17, he had surgery two years ago, and she says he's really blossomed. \"My only regret is that we couldn't have done it sooner,\" she says. \"To think that other kids who might need this — there's so few kids that do need this — to think they have to just live in a shell and put their lives on pause is so unfair and makes me so angry and so sad.\"   \n   No sea change among other medical groups   In the wake of ASPS's position statement and the Trump administration's promotion of it, there have been conflicting reports about the American Medical Association's position, and whether medical groups, which have long supported gender-affirming care, were shifting that stance.   AMA told NPR in a statement: \"The AMA supports evidence-based treatment, including gender affirming care,\" and added that, based on available evidence, \"surgical interventions in minors should be generally deferred to adulthood.\" AMA says that's not a reversal or an endorsement of the plastic surgeon group's new position, it's a clarification of the group's existing position.   Similarly, the American Academy of Pediatrics sent NPR a statement that the group \"does not include a blanket recommendation for surgery for minors\" and that the decision should be left to doctors and patients and their families, not politicians.   \n   In fact, the ASPS recommendation to wait until age 19 for surgery aligns with the existing standards of care for transgender youth, which \"recommend that patients reach the age of adulthood, which may vary based on where that [transgender] person lives or is seeking care, to be a candidate for gender-affirming surgery.\"   When Kellan Baker of the LGBTQ think tank Movement Advancement Project read the ASPS position, it struck him as nothing new. \"I'm looking at this and I'm like, 'OK, thank you for telling me that water is wet and the sky is blue,'\" he says.   Baker argues that it works to the Trump administration's advantage to frame this as a landmark shift of the medical community towards more restrictions, without acknowledging the political pressure that the Trump administration itself has been exerting to achieve such an outcome.\n",

    "body": "\n      President Trump explains how a racist video clip made it into his Truth Social post. A judge rules that his administration cannot block funds for a massive tunnel project under the Hudson river.   \n\n    AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:  President Trump has taken down a blatantly racist video clip shared on his Truth Social account, but he has yet to apologize for it.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I guess toward the end of it, there was some kind of a picture that people don't like. I wouldn't like it, either. But I didn't see it.RASCOE: The end of the video included a clip with the faces of former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, superimposed on apes. NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith asked Trump about the video while traveling to Florida on Air Force One this weekend, and she joins us now. Good morning, Tam.TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning, Ayesha.RASCOE: The outrage over this video was intense and not just from the left, but from Republican lawmakers, several of whom called on Trump to apologize. Initially, the White House kind of brushed it off, called it fake outrage, but then blamed it on a staffer. What did Trump tell you about how this video was shared in the first place?KEITH: So the thing to know about President Trump is that very late at night, his Truth Social account regularly posts and amplifies a lot of videos and articles and posts from random accounts that validate his worldview. And he attempted to explain away this very problematic post by saying he looks at thousands of things and only looked at the beginning of this one. And the stuff he likes, he says he tells his aides to post, as happened in this case.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Then I gave it to the people. Generally, they'd look at the whole thing, but I guess somebody didn't, and they posted it. And we took it down, and we deleted it, you know?KEITH: It took 12 hours and a lot of calls from angry Republican lawmakers before the White House did take it down. The reporters on the plane Friday night pressed Trump repeatedly, and he said he doesn't need to apologize, didn't make a mistake, won't be firing anyone and is, quote, \"the least racist president you've had in a long time.\"RASCOE: And what was the gist of the first part of the video, the one that he says, you know, he only saw the beginning of, and he liked that part of it?KEITH: So it was promoting a conspiracy theory about election fraud in the 2020 election, the one President Trump lost, but is continuing now, more than five years later, to prove he somehow actually won. The video was focused on Michigan. Though when he was talking about it on Air Force One, he said he thought it was about Georgia. And last week, the administration was defending, sending the director of national intelligence to Georgia, to Fulton County, where the FBI was seizing ballots from the 2020 election. The president last week also called for nationalizing election administration, at least in some Democratic areas, which election administration is constitutionally required to be handled by the states, and state election officials, Democrats and Republicans alike, are expressing alarm about potential federal interference. So this is about way more than idle middle-of-the-night social media posts. It is a real test for Democratic guardrails.RASCOE: On another topic, a federal judge said on Friday that the Trump administration cannot stop funding for an enormous tunnel project between New York City and New Jersey. Now there's been reporting that Trump would be willing to release the funding if Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer helped get New York City's main train station and an airport near Washington, D.C., named after Trump. What did the president have to say about this?KEITH: So, like, the president has put his name on a lot of things recently, including the Kennedy Center. But this story seemed almost too on the nose to be real. And yet, when asked about it, Trump didn't entirely dismiss it.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Chuck Schumer suggested that to me about changing the name of Penn Station to Trump Station.KEITH: In a post on X, Schumer disputed Trump's account, saying, quote, \"absolute lie. He knows it. Everyone knows it.\" The official reason the White House said they put a hold on this funding was to make sure that contracts didn't include anything related to DEI. But it had all the trademarks of retribution for the Democratic congressional leaders who are both from New York. Trump didn't address the funding side of this in his remarks, only the naming. But in his post, Schumer said, only one man can restart the project, and he can restart it with a snap of his fingers, that meaning Trump.RASCOE: That's in NPR's senior White House correspondent, Tamara Keith. Thank you so much.KEITH: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

It's not just Democrats who are concerned, but also independent voters who are expected to play a major role in the upcoming midterm elections.   \"The base loves it, but it's an issue for the independent voters who decide elections in this country,\" said Alex Conant, a veteran Republican strategist. \"Independents want a strong border and they want to deport criminals, but they're really uneasy with having masked federal agents going around in neighborhoods, deporting anyone that they see — as the Democrats are portraying it.\"   \n   After months of aggressive enforcement, Trump's signature issue that twice got him elected is now turning into a liability ahead of this year's midterm elections.   The outcry over what many saw as militant tactics hit a fever pitch after the second fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen by immigration officers in Minnesota.   A new NPR/Marist poll shows that six in 10 Americans disapprove of the job federal immigration agents are doing.   Even typically loyal Republican supporters have called on the Trump administration to make changes and rebuild trust with law enforcement.   \"They, being the White House, need to recalibrate on what needs to be done to make sure that that respect is going to be re-instilled,\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told conservative radio host Mark Davis.   Trump shook up the leadership of the Minneapolis operation, and directed his team to withdraw 700 federal officers.   \"I learned that, maybe we can use a little bit of a softer touch,\" Trump said in an interview with NBC's Tom Llamas. \"But you still have to be tough. We're dealing with really hard criminals.\"   It's a bit unclear what a \"softer touch\" actually means.     Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt largely defended the administration's enforcement efforts Thursday and pointed to different polling - from a Harvard/Harris survey - that she said showed support for their \"deportation agenda.\"   \n   \"Nearly eight in ten Americans say criminal illegal aliens should be deported,\" she said. \"A solid majority also support deporting all illegal aliens, regardless of additional crimes.\"   She also said the administration is now prioritizing criminals who are in the country illegally.   Theresa Cardinal Brown, who worked on immigration policy under two presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said there may be an \"operational pause\" as the administration retools its efforts, both from a policy standpoint and a public relations standpoint.   \"Operationally, you're not really thinking about politics as you're putting together an operation, said Brown, now a member of the Council on National Security and Immigration. \"But politics comes into everything, right?\"   She points to the announcement that body cameras would be deployed to federal immigration officers in Minneapolis, noting that while video can uncover when officers are doing something wrong, body cameras can also vindicate officers when they have done the right thing.   \"I do think that probably the administration is thinking, 'well, if we had body cam footage of our own, we could put our own perspective on it,' \" she said.   Trump has a big incentive to get a handle on this crisis — and to do so quickly.   Conant, who previously worked on Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign, said Trump has left an opening for Democrats to sound more reasonable on immigration ahead of the midterms.   \"If he loses the immigration issue as a political winner, it's a real political problem,\" Conant said, \"not just for Trump, but Republicans more broadly.\"\n",

Iran wants the talks to focus on its nuclear program. The U.S. wants much more. NPR's Jane Arraf has been following this story and joins us from Amman. Jane, thanks for being with us.JANE ARRAF, BYLINE: Thank you.SIMON: What do we know about what happened at the talks?ARRAF: So this was an indirect meeting in Oman, in the capital Muscat. There was the U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.  They were communicating with Iran's foreign minister through Omani officials. Iran described the talks as lengthy and intensive. And the real importance of this was that the meeting took place at all because it's provided some breathing room in what has been a very tense situation in the region.  Trump had threatened military strikes. Iran had said, if that happened, it could spark regional war. Here's President Trump speaking to reporters on Air Force One last night.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We, likewise, had very good talks on Iran. Iran looks like it wants to make a deal very badly. We have to see what that deal is.ARRAF: He noted there are U.S. warships in the region and said the U.S. was in no rush regarding a deal. So that, too, has diffused some of the considerable tension.SIMON: And how has Iran responded?ARRAF: Well, Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said, following the six-hour meeting, that both sides wanted another round. He told Al Jazeera television today that there was no date set yet, but he thinks it should be soon. And asked about the prospect of war, he said Iran was ready for both peace and war.SIMON: The threat of military attack is not the only strategy the U.S. is using, is it?ARRAF: Totally true. Obviously, that military threat is the biggest one, but this week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told a Senate committee that the U.S. had engineered the latest financial crisis in Iran, which sparked widespread protests. He says they did it by creating a dollar shortage in the country.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SCOTT BESSENT: It came to a swift and, I would say, grand culmination in December. When one of the largest banks in Iran went under, the Iranian currency went into free fall. Inflation exploded. And hence, we have seen the Iranian people out on the street.ARRAF: So that financial crisis left many Iranians unable to afford food, and those protests morphed into anti-regime demonstrations. At least 5,000 people, most of them demonstrators, were believed to have been killed. And, Scott, on Friday, the U.S. levied new sanctions it says are aimed at supporting anti-government protesters. Those sanctions are against companies and people it says they are illegally trading Iranian oil. And the White House has threatened additional tariffs against any country trading with Iran.SIMON: Jane, President Trump has been clear he wants to see regime change in Iran. Is that a popular idea in the region, near as you can tell?ARRAF: It is very divided. Israel is very keen. Other countries are terrified of the consequences. I mean, let's face it, Iran is a powerful oil-rich, very complex country, and what they worry about is the chaos that would result if there were an unplanned change of regime. As for these talks, Iran is insisting they focus on its nuclear program. It says that program is for peaceful purposes. Now, the U.S. bombed Iran in December and insists it was developing nuclear weapons, but the U.N. nuclear watchdog says there's no evidence Iran was building a bomb.SIMON: NPR's Jane Arraf.

    "body": "\n      NPR Political Correspondent Domenico Montanaro joins to discuss the Trump administration's engagement in foreign conflicts, as well as what a recent poll says about what where voters stand on several key issues, including immigration and the economy.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  We just heard, of course, from our colleague Jane Arraf on talks with Iran. The Trump administration's also involved in negotiations between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas. Is this level of involvement in foreign conflicts what President Trump campaigned on?DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: You know, a lot of people who voted for him thought that they were getting somebody who is less hawkish, who is not going to involve the United States overseas as much as he has, and his foreign policy actions have been unpopular of late. You know, he has just a 36% approval rating on foreign policy in our latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll that was out this week. A majority said that they think that a president should go through Congress before taking military action like he did in Venezuela, and almost 7 in 10 said that this idea of taking over Greenland is a bad one.SIMON: I have to ask. Thursday night, President Trump posted a racist meme of former President Obama and Michelle Obama. Republican Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, who is Black and chair of the Republican Senate campaign committee, said on X, it's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House. The president should remove it. Post was ultimately taken down, but it was up for 12 hours. And first, the White House press secretary called the criticism fake outrage. What does this say not just about American politics but America right now?MONTANARO: Well, you know, this was taken down after significant blowback, and Trump himself yesterday was asked about it and said he would not apologize. He said he, quote, \"didn't make a mistake\" because he only saw the beginning of the video. He was asked specifically about the depiction of the Obamas and whether he condemns it. He said, quote, \"of course, I do.\"You know, but most presidents would be mortified by something like this, profusely apologize if it would happen and, you know, hope it doesn't end their political careers if, in fact, it went the way that Trump is saying. But not Trump. You know, he shrugs these things off. His base points at those who are offended by this and dismisses them as too sensitive. You know, and this was what Trump's whole campaign was about a decade ago, essentially campaigning against the, quote, political correctness of polite society. And the fuel to Trump's politics has always been based on white grievance, so this is obviously not the first time that something like this has happened. Probably won't be the last, Scott.SIMON: Can we tell how potential voters feel?MONTANARO: Well, Republicans have shown that they're willing to stand by Trump no matter what, but his voting coalition has frayed significantly. You know, independents, Latinos and younger voters helped put Trump over the finish line in 2024. And our latest poll shows them moving heavily away from him on every issue, from foreign policy and the economy to immigration enforcement. You know, it's really just been a really bad month politically for Trump.SIMON: We heard a lot about the ballots being taken in Georgia a couple of weeks ago. What's the latest?MONTANARO: You know, it's remarkable to me that six years later, after all the lies that Trump has told about the 2020 election, that he's still obsessed with it, and I think we know why. Listen to what he had to say this week at, of all things, the National Prayer Breakfast.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They rigged the second election. I had to win it. Had to win it. I needed it for my own ego. I would've had a bad ego for the rest of my...(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: Now I really have a big ego, though.MONTANARO: Yeah - ego. He said it. You know, it's kind of what we've really known all along. He's needed an off-ramp from that loss, and he did lose. You know, audits, more than 60 court cases certainly prove that. So he's had to resort to chaos and confusion because he's still not over it, despite actually winning again in 2024. And we don't know what he's going to try to do with the Department of Justice in this 2026 midterm election. You know, we've heard him say that Republicans should take it over, that maybe it should be nationalized.SIMON: Yeah.MONTANARO: Of course, that's a really, really difficult thing to do because it's in the Constitution that the states run these elections, so that's not likely to happen. But what does he do with the Department of Justice, with immigration enforcement, potentially, in sending people to polling places, you know, potentially disenfranchising people? I think there's a lot of people really nervous about how this is all going to go down.SIMON: NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Thanks so much for being with us today.MONTANARO: You're welcome.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Scott Simon speaks to author Anne Applebaum about how the U.S. may be headed toward authoritarianism.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  Is the United States moving towards autocracy? Many people who study authoritarian regime say they see the seeds of that in President Trump's moves to control the Department of Justice and civil service, the deployment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents around the country and more. Anne Applebaum joins us now. She covered the fall of the Berlin Wall and communism across Eastern Europe and other shifts in history. She now writes for The Atlantic and hosts the podcast \"Autocracy In America\" and joins us now. Anne, thanks so much for being with us.ANNE APPLEBAUM: Oh, thanks for having me.SIMON: What do you think - what do you see happening in the United States today?APPLEBAUM: So I want to make it clear that the United States is not an authoritarian state right now. But what we see is a party in power that is seeking to end or curb the rule of law and to create a situation where we become, in effect, a one-party state. And the path that the Republican Party under Trump - and it's not really the Republican Party, it's the MAGA movement under Trump - is following is one that's very familiar and has been followed by other parties in other democracies, whether in Hungary or Turkey or Venezuela, in the past. And it starts, as you say, with firing civil service - civil servants, in our case, illegally, and replacing them with loyalists. So the Trump administration has asked Department of Justice officials and FBI officials to tell them as a form of knowing whether they can be promoted who won the 2020 election, and, of course, they're supposed to lie and say that Trump won. So they ask people - they put loyalty tests into the system.The control over universities, museums, the Kennedy Center, our cultural institutions, is a way of trying to redirect culture and change the way our understanding of history works. That's another classic move. The use of ICE and the creation of a kind of paramilitary that appears to be personally loyal to the president rather than subject to the rule of law. So they wear masks. They don't have to obey the law about searching and entering. They arrest people based on their race and not based on suspicion of having committed a crime. You know, the idea of a personalized, militarized force loyal only to the leader or to the ruling party.I mean, this is - these are signs that we know from other places. And then maybe the two most important are corruption, so the way in which the Trump administration, and especially people around Trump and his family, have accepted money from foreign governments and others in - seemingly in exchange for U.S. policy. So policies are now not being done in the name of Americans but in the name of the personal interests of people power. And then, of course, the elections, the conversation about nationalizing elections, the pressure on election officials and states. I mean, that seems to be the phase that we're in this year, and that will be the most important.SIMON: Is this just the government that Americans elected in 2024?APPLEBAUM: I don't know that all Americans voted for Donald Trump in order to end democracy. No. I mean, it seemed clear to me during the election campaign based on the kind of rhetoric that they were using and the way they talked about their political opponents that they saw themselves as a group who had a right to power and had no right to be challenged. But I don't know that everybody in America heard that or saw that. And our political system, our Constitution, does provide for opposition politics and different ideas, and I don't think most Americans are yet ready to end that.SIMON: There are still independent courts and only a slender majority in Congress that backs the president. Is that worth noting too?APPLEBAUM: Absolutely. No, no. Again - I state again, we're not talking about the U.S. being an authoritarian state. We're talking about a group in power who are pushing in that direction, who are following all - you know, it's following all - the path that others have taken in the past in order to establish a state. And I - you know, the purpose for them is to create a situation in which they can't lose an election, in which elections are a combination of the way elections are run and the way people are afraid of voting and the way civil service and government departments are oriented to do their bidding, that it just becomes very difficult...SIMON: Yeah.APPLEBAUM: ...For anybody else to win.SIMON: Isn't he - I mean, isn't that often the way of history? A party will come to power by winning an election, and then that's the last free election.APPLEBAUM: Very often, and very often in recent history. And it's not necessarily a right-wing or a left-wing phenomenon. As I said, Venezuela is a great example, you know, Viktor Orban's Hungary.SIMON: There's still plenty of public lampooning of the president. Isn't there still a free press, or do you have concerns about that too?APPLEBAUM: So clearly, there's still a free press 'cause you and I are having this conversation.SIMON: Yeah.APPLEBAUM: But, you know, there is enormous pressure on the press. There's pressure on the broadcasters, whose owners can be pressured by the government because of their different economic interests. We've just seen what happened to The Washington Post. There was a - you know, the owner of The Washington Post has big interests outside of the Post, and he's - he put pressure on the Post that has destroyed its reputation. And so you can see pressure on media - especially bigger media - happening. That doesn't mean, you know, we can't continue to speak. But it's important to look at what they're trying to do and the direction that they're going.SIMON: And I've left 30 seconds for this. Do you think the American people are grappling with this?APPLEBAUM: I think people are beginning to understand it, yes. I mean, I - I'm on the West Coast now. I was in - I was on the East Coast last week, and I hear - everywhere I go, I hear people expressing concern. I think the murders in Minnesota woke a lot of people up to the nature of this administration.SIMON: Anne Applebaum is a staff writer at The Atlantic and host of The Atlantic podcast \"Autocracy In America,\" which is out now. Thanks so much for being with us.APPLEBAUM: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Texas' U.S. Senate is grappling with how immigration enforcement should look like ahead of its primary elections.   \n\n    AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:  Minnesota has been the focus of immigration enforcement in the last few weeks. But for decades, Texas has been the epicenter for how the country addresses immigration. And as Texas gears up for its primary elections in less than a month, the debate over what immigration enforcement should look like is playing out in a big way in Texas' U.S. Senate race. Blaise Gainey of The Texas Newsroom joins me now. Good morning.BLAISE GAINEY, BYLINE: Good morning. Glad to be here.RASCOE: So what are you seeing in Texas when it comes to political messaging on immigration enforcement?GAINEY: Yeah. Well, like most political messaging, parties tend to relay and repeat what they are hearing from the top. For instance, here, Governor Greg Abbott has recently called for the Trump administration to recalibrate things when it comes to enforcement. And what he means by that is the White House needs to make sure respect for ICE is reinstilled and for them to recalibrate, to make sure they can continue deportation efforts without intervention from citizens. The wording on that is really important because he didn't condemn their actions. Rather, he said they essentially need people to give them respect.This was carried into the race for Texas' U.S. Senate seat by incumbent Senator John Cornyn, who said he thinks it's a good idea to de-escalate, but then went on to say that American citizens should not continue to cross the line from peacefully protesting to interfering with law enforcement activity. So they haven't necessarily shifted their message, but more so made an adjustment to call for peace while deportation efforts continue. On the Democratic side of the Senate race, both Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett and state Representative James Talarico have said they would abolish ICE if given the chance.RASCOE: And how are Texans responding to this adjustment?GAINEY: Yeah. Just last week, high school students across the state participated in a walkout over ICE's enforcement efforts. And there were also protests at the capitol building in Austin and other areas across the state. People are extremely upset and want to let it be known, and this is not fully a partisan issue. As we should remember, in 2024, Trump and the Republican Party as a whole got a lot of support from the Latino community for the promises they made on fixing the economy. Latinos say they haven't seen that and instead feel tricked by the fact deportation efforts haven't been solely centered on finding and removing hardened criminals.RASCOE: So how are Latino voters responding to what they're seeing on immigration enforcement right now?GAINEY: Yeah. I will say Latino voters are furious with the way immigration enforcement efforts have played out, not only in Minneapolis but around the country. I just spoke with Gloria Leal (ph), who lives in Austin, Texas.GLORIA LEAL: The recent issues with ICE enforcement and immigration laws throughout the country have, I believe, persuaded Latinos that Trump has gone too far in his immigration enforcement efforts.GAINEY: So as you can hear, it's having an impact. And as you see, they aren't forgetting the events that have taken place concerning ICE and Border Patrol over the past few years. And from everything I'm hearing, it doesn't seem like the Republican Party will have anything close to the support they had from Latinos last time around.RASCOE: Well, if Latinos aren't likely to vote for Republicans in large numbers, does a Democrat really have a chance against the Republican nominee in the Senate race? And which Democratic candidate is better positioned to pick up those voters?GAINEY: Listen. If I had a crystal ball, I promise I'd tell you exactly who, but it's up in the air right now. Both Democratic candidates, state Representative James Talarico and Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett, have very similar wants and priorities if elected. For voters, what is separating them from one another is their demeanor. I spoke with Gabriel Rosales, the Texas League of United Latin American Citizens director, and he explained why he's backing Crockett.GABRIEL ROSALES: She's just got a very powerful mannerisms about her. She's no hold bars, and she gets in their face. I think we need people like that that are going to fight, right? They're going to fight for you. They're going to fight. They're not going to look at color or race or gender.GAINEY: And as a reminder, Texas is still a red state, and no Democrat has won a statewide seat in three decades. So it'll be an uphill battle for the party, but they believe right now the energy and engagement is at a higher level than in the past, which is giving them hope that they can break the Republican streak.RASCOE: That's Blaise Gainey of The Texas Newsroom. Thank you so much for joining us.GAINEY: Yeah. Thanks for having me.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

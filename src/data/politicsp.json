    "body": "<div>\n      <p>NPR's Juana Summers speaks with Illinois Democrat Gov. JB Pritzker about President Trump's efforts to deploy the national guard in Chicago.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: </p><p> The clock is ticking for Chicago and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker. President Trump has deployed the National Guard to the country's third largest city, and he says they will begin operations no later than Wednesday. Pritzker, a Democrat, has called President Trump's efforts a, quote, \"invasion.\" And along with Chicago's Mayor Brandon Johnson, he is fighting the administration's efforts in the courts. Governor JB Pritzker joins me now. Welcome back to the program.</p><p>JB PRITZKER: Thank you very much, Juana.</p><p>SUMMERS: Thanks for being here. Governor, we're speaking on Tuesday morning, and the Trump administration has said that troops will be on the ground no later than tomorrow. You have filed suit against this move, but the judge declined to block the deployment. There will not be a hearing until Thursday morning. So I just want to start by asking you, how are you preparing for the fact that the National Guard could well be on the streets of Chicago as this lawsuit is playing out?</p><p>PRITZKER: Well, let me be clear. The judge is actually deciding this on Thursday and hasn't declined anything. She's literally reading the filings and demanded that the federal government submit something by Wednesday so that she could make a ruling potentially on Thursday. We don't know how she will rule, but certainly, based on the precedent of what occurred down in Oregon, we believe that we'll get the rule that we want.</p><p>Remember that we are seeing National Guard troops coming from Texas now. We have our own National Guard that have been federalized, and the Texas National Guard were already federalized, so that's why they were able to move quickly. And they've already started arriving, not in Chicago, but in Joliet, at a federal facility there. The federal judge, though, warned the federal lawyers that it wouldn't be a good idea for them to deploy them until there is a ruling.</p><p>SUMMERS: Your state's attorney general has argued that the deployment of the military to Illinois is unlawful, unconstitutional, no matter where these forces come from, but the Trump administration, for its part, says that it is deploying troops to assist federal agents with immigration enforcement. So have officers been able to carry out ICE enforcement duties without support of local law enforcement?</p><p>PRITZKER: They have. And they are carrying out those duties. I will say that they are doing them - they're carrying it out in an extremely aggressive fashion that borders on breaking the law - federal law and state law. But ICE agents and Customs and Border Patrol are on the ground, and they have been effectuating their plan. The thing is, they're using literally people's skin color as a way to determine whether they're going to stop people and ask them for their papers. Now, think about that. I don't walk around with papers to prove that I'm a U.S. citizen. I bet you don't either. Most people don't. But they're demanding that, if you happen to have, you know, something other than white skin, you better have something to prove it or you're going to get detained or arrested.</p><p>SUMMERS: Governor, President Trump said on Monday that at the moment, he hasn't planned to but that if governors like yourself and the courts do not cooperate with his administration's efforts, that he would consider invoking the Insurrection Act, which would give him broad latitude to use the guard or active-duty troops for law enforcement in Chicago not limited to protecting federal agents. How serious of a threat is that?</p><p>PRITZKER: Well, remember, the Insurrection Act has the name insurrection in it for a reason. It's only something that you can effectuate if there is an insurrection, a foreign invasion, a true national emergency. That doesn't exist here, and it doesn't exist in Portland. It didn't exist in Washington, D.C., or in Los Angeles. So I realize that President Trump, who does no reading and doesn't understand anything, you know, uses the words Insurrection Act like he understands it but he doesn't.</p><p>SUMMERS: The president might disagree with your characterization there. He has argued that it is emergency. He has described...</p><p>PRITZKER: Yeah, but...</p><p>SUMMERS: ...That there - it looks like war in some of these cities.</p><p>PRITZKER: Yeah, but he's the one that's causing that situation. That is to say, it's ICE and CBP that have been launching grenades with tear gas, that have been pelting people with, you know, plastic or rubber bullets. They're the ones that are creating mayhem on the ground, specifically because they want to claim that there's some sort of emergency. There isn't. This is occurring in a two-block area of a suburb of Chicago, Broadview.</p><p>So, you know, yes, they can take their own video of an incident that occurs, you know, in that two-block area and make it seem like that's all of Chicago. That's not even in the city of Chicago. In fact, our crime rate has been dropping and dropping - you know, half the homicide rate that it was a few years ago, double-digit declines each year now. Donald Trump just - he honestly doesn't read. He doesn't understand what's going on in the cities. He just has some notion in his head. There's some sort of dementia going on, and he just keeps repeating things from years gone by.</p><p>SUMMERS: Governor, as I listen to you talk about the Insurrection Act or the restraining order that your state has filed, it sounds to me like you're in many ways relying on how things have been in the past. And if there's one thing we've seen, it's that the courts have appeared quite willing to increase the power of the president. Are you concerned about where all of this could be going?</p><p>PRITZKER: Sure. And I think we have to rely on the courts and get rulings that are - you know, uphold the Constitution and the law. Unfortunately, we have a system in which the supremacy clause says that the federal government's laws essentially override state laws if they're in direct contravention and also there's immunity for federal agents from the federal government for much of their activity. So we don't do that on the ground. We don't hold everybody immune. Sometimes we do in certain things. But what we can't do is just sit idly by while these things are occurring.</p><p>And that's why we've called on people to take action, like creating evidence for our court cases by pulling out their iPhones and their Android phones and filming everything. We wouldn't even know about the alderman who was detained by ICE for simply standing and asking them questions. She was truly docile in the entire matter. It's on film. We wouldn't know about that if someone hadn't pulled out their phone to take video of it. And we need to find ways to hold them responsible - private organizations, private legal organizations, like the ACLU, are doing that now, and to the extent that states and local governments can do so, we are.</p><p>SUMMERS: Governor JB Pritzker, Democrat of Illinois, thank you so much for speaking with us.</p><p>PRITZKER: Thanks, Juana.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.

Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., called on Republicans and her fellow Democrats to find a way forward while warning of consequences for the nation's health care system.</p>   <p>President Trump on social media said earlier Monday<a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115329671584864920\" target=\"_blank\"><u> he's willing to work</u></a> with Democrats on health care, but only after the government reopens.</p>   <p>When asked on <em>Morning Edition</em> whether anyone from the administration had reached out to her directly, Shaheen said, \"No one from the administration.\" She added that she has been working behind the scenes with senators from both parties to \"find common ground.\"</p>   \n   <p>She framed the negotiations as a realistic effort to reopen the government without sacrificing consumer protections and access to care.</p>   <p>Shaheen is not seeking reelection in 2026. The veteran appropriator has long opposed shutdowns and helped broker past bipartisan deals. But negotiations have stalled, as Democrats and Republicans tussle over extending subsidies for the Affordable Care Act marketplaces that are due to expire at the end of the year. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that as many as four million people risk becoming uninsured if the credits are not renewed.</p>   <p>The current stakes are high. \"We ought to be able to reopen the government and make sure we're not kicking four million people off of their health insurance,\" she said, adding that this \"has real ramifications for the entire health care system.\"</p>   <p>With health insurers finalizing premiums in October and open enrollment starting Nov. 1, Shaheen warned that millions could \"lose their health insurance.\"</p>   <p>In her home state, she said four medical facilities face closure due to spending cuts in the sweeping tax and spending bill passed by Republicans and signed by Trump over the summer.</p>   <p>Shaheen called Trump's signature bill a \"big betrayal of the American people\" and said its impacts need to be addressed. The Democrats' proposal in the Senate includes provisions to reverse some of those spending cuts — a demand Republicans have not supported.</p>   \n   <p>She also pushed back sharply <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/03/nx-s1-5561131/government-shutdown-white-house-karoline-leavitt\" target=\"_blank\"><u>on administration arguments </u></a>that layoffs are inevitable during a shutdown, calling that narrative \"disingenuous.\"</p>   \n   <p>\"From Day One, this administration started firing federal employees,\" she said, and named the Food and Drug Administration and the Veterans Administration, which she says had to rehire staff.</p>   <p>\"It is totally inaccurate for this administration to claim that it's the shutdown that's causing them to fire people. It's the shutdown that's giving them more of an excuse, but this has been happening from Day One.\"</p>   <p>Despite tensions and mistrust between the two major parties, Shaheen remained resolute about seeking a bipartisan path forward.</p>   <p>\"We ought to all be able to agree that the people who need this help the most are the ones who ought to get it,\" she said. \"I think more and more people are recognizing that, yes, there is some real common ground that we should be able to find.\"</p>   <p>With the shutdown's effects mounting, she added, \"That's why we need to work together to get this open.\"</p>   <p><em>The digital version of this interview was edited by Obed Manuel, Jason Breslow and Luis Clemens.</em></p>\n</div>",

There are some people that really don't deserve to be taken care of, and we will take care of them in a different way.\"</p>   \n   <p>When pressed on the legality of such a move, Trump said, \"What the law says is correct, and I follow the law.\"</p>   \n   <p>Trump was responding to questions about a draft memo from the Office of Management and Budget, which was first reported by Axios and confirmed by a senior White House official not authorized to discuss the memo, which has not been publicly circulated.</p>   <p>The fight over federal worker pay is the latest salvo in the Trump administration's efforts to force Democrats to vote for a clean continuing resolution and drop their demands to extend health care subsidies for millions of Americans.</p>   <p>The memo's legal argument contradicts <a href=\"https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/reference-materials/special-instructions-for-agencies-affected-by-a-possible-lapse-in-appropriations-starting-on-10-1-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">guidance issued by the Office of Personnel Management</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/1341\" target=\"_blank\">wording of a 2019 law</a> signed by Trump during his first term that explicitly guarantees that federal workers \"shall be paid\" when a shutdown ends, whether they were furloughed or continued working.</p>   <p>The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, a bipartisan law enacted after the record 35-day shutdown in 2018, added language to the Antideficiency Act that automatically applies back pay to federal employees for \"any lapse in appropriations that begins on or after December 22, 2018.\"</p>   <p>Previously, Congress had to approve retroactive funding after a shutdown with new legislation.</p>   \n   <p>The White House memo notes a clause in the text that says workers shall be paid \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates, and subject to the enactment of appropriations Acts ending the lapse\" and argues that this means congressional action is required to enact back pay.</p>   \n   <p>Guidance published by the Office of Management and Budget on Sept. 30 did include a reference to the law's automatic restoration of pay.</p>   <p>\"The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-1) provides that upon enactment of appropriations to end a lapse, both furloughed and excepted employees will be paid retroactively as soon as possible after the lapse ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates,\" the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20251002174206/https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Frequently-Asked-Questions-During-a-Lapse-in-Appropriations.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Sept. 30 memo reads</a>. \"Additional guidance for agencies on implementing Public Law 116-1 and treatment of pay and leave is available from OPM.\"</p>   <p>A <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Frequently-Asked-Questions-During-a-Lapse-in-Appropriations.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">version updated on Oct. 3</a> removes those paragraphs.</p>   <p>The draft memo is the latest in a multipronged pressure campaign from the White House seeking to punish Democrats during the shutdown, including efforts to cancel grant funding for energy projects and hold up transportation funding in states that did not vote for Trump in 2024. The administration has also threatened widespread reduction-in-force efforts at federal agencies, which have so far not materialized.</p>   \n   <h3>Congress responds</h3>   <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters that while he isn't extensively familiar with the plan and hasn't discussed it with the White House, it is possible there may be a legal justification for the draft. </p>   <p>\"There are legal analysts who think that is not something the government should do,\" Johnson said. \"If that is true, that should turn up the urgency and the necessity of the Democrats doing the right thing here.\"</p>   <p>The top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., argued that any interpretation to withhold back pay was \"lawless.\" </p>   \n   <p>\"They're plotting to try and rob furloughed federal workers of back pay at the end of this shutdown,\" Murray said in remarks on the Senate floor. \"This flies in the face of the plain text of the law, which could not be more clear.\"</p>   <p>Loading...</p>\n   <p><em>Deepa Shivaram contributed to this report. </em></p>\n</div>",

Agents claimed the woman was armed and that she and other protestors were using cars to box in agents, WBEZ reports.</p>   <p>Raoul told NPR's Steve Inskeep that it is evident the Trump administration's actions against Chicago are \"political in nature.\" Trump has vowed for weeks to clean up crime in Chicago, though the city has experienced a decline in most major crime categories this year, <a href=\"https://www.wbez.org/criminal-justice/2025/07/25/chicagos-crime-decline-is-part-of-a-national-trend-researchers-say\" target=\"_blank\">according to WBEZ</a>.</p>   <p>Last month, Trump said he would \"love to have\" Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker call the White House <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/04/nx-s1-5527020/trump-national-guard-chicago-illinois-pritzker\" target=\"_blank\">to make a formal request for troops</a>. The president also <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/06/nx-s1-5532148/national-guard-chicago-baltimore-new-orleans\" target=\"_blank\">posted on Truth Social last month</a> that the city was going to find out \"why it's called the Department of WAR.\"</p>   <p>\"All of these communications coming from the president and members of his administration demonstrate that this is about political targeting, not about conditions on the ground in Chicago or anywhere in the state of Illinois,\" Raoul said.</p>   <p>In an emailed statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said \"Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities.\"</p>   \n   <p>A federal judge <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/06/nx-s1-5563882/illinois-and-chicago-sue-the-trump-administration-over-national-guard-deployment\" target=\"_blank\">did not immediately block the Trump administration from deploying troops</a> to Chicago as Illinois requested in its lawsuit — including the deployment of some troops from Texas and other states. Oral arguments in that suit are set for Thursday.</p>   <p>Richard Hayes, who served as former Illinois National Guard Adjutant General — its highest ranking member — <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/07/nx-s1-5563902/former-illinois-national-guard-official-on-efforts-to-deploy-troops-to-chicago\" target=\"_blank\">said in an interview with <em>Morning Edition</em></a> if and when troops are deployed, the public should know there are things soldiers are or aren't supposed to do.</p>   \n   <p>\"All soldiers — sailors, airmen, Marines, space guardians — they have a duty to follow legal orders just as much as they have a duty to not follow illegal ones. So you're duty-bound either direction,\" Hayes said.</p>   <p>But Raoul said troop deployment is still cause for alarm because these are not \"normal times.\"</p>   <p>\"I don't have any negative feelings about National Guardsmen when they're serving their country, but it's how they're being directed that I'm concerned about,\" Raoul said.</p>   <p>On the prospect of Illinois' lawsuit being appealed all the way to a Trump friendly Supreme Court and troops being deployed in Chicago, Raoul said \"that would be a very dangerous thing to occur.\"</p>   <p>\"It's un-American. This is not what we expect in our country, to be subject to military deploying in our streets to do civilian law enforcement work,\" Raoul continued \"It's not what we do in the United States of America.\"</p>   <p><em>This digital article was edited by Treye Green.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi faced questions about her leadership of the Justice Department at a Senate hearing.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: </p><p> Attorney General Pam Bondi was on Capitol Hill today testifying before Senate lawmakers. It was a combative hearing. Bondi defended her leadership at the Justice Department and she dismissed allegations that she has weaponized the DOJ to go after President Trump's perceived enemies. NPR justice correspondent Ryan Lucas was watching. He is with us now. Hi, Ryan.</p><p>RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Hi there.</p><p>KELLY: Start with the Democrats on the panel. What were they focused on today?</p><p>LUCAS: Well, they certainly had a lot of items to choose from, but they really did zero in on what they say - and many DOJ veterans and legal observers say - has been the department's weaponization under Bondi to target Trump's political foes. The top Democrat on the committee is Illinois' Dick Durbin. Here's how he kind of summed up the Democrats' view on her leadership.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>DICK DURBIN: The attorney general has systematically weaponized our nation's leading law enforcement agency to protect President Trump and his allies and attack his opponents and, sadly, the American people.</p><p>LUCAS: And as Exhibit A, Democrats point to the recent indictment of former FBI Director James Comey just days after the president demanded publicly that the DOJ prosecute Comey and other prominent Trump critics.</p><p>KELLY: Well, and Comey has been indicted, of course, and is not the only person the president has said should be prosecuted.</p><p>LUCAS: That's right. Two other people, notably, that the president publicly demanded by name in a social media post that the DOJ go after were New York Attorney General Letitia James and California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff, who's a member of the committee that Bondi was actually testifying for today.</p><p>KELLY: Which makes for some interesting dynamics, which I hope we're going to get to. But let me ask you first, this allegation that Bondi has weaponized the department, when that was put to her directly, how did she respond?</p><p>LUCAS: Well, look, she was specifically asked about a promise that she made at her confirmation hearing that she would maintain the Justice Department's traditional independence from the White House and keep politics out of investigations and prosecutions. Here's what she said.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>PAM BONDI: I absolutely have upheld that commitment, Senator. I pledged that I would end the weaponization, also, of the Justice Department and that America would once again have a one-tier system of justice for all. And that is what we are doing in this country.</p><p>LUCAS: Now, Democrats also tried to press her on her handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. They tried to press her on the firing of career prosecutors and FBI officials for working in Capitol riot cases or on investigations into Trump. They tried to get answers about the department's decision to drop an investigation into Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, for allegedly taking a $50,000 cash bribe from an undercover FBI agent. She refused to provide answers. In many cases, she tried to deflect, actually, by going after Democratic senators themselves. Here's an exchange with California's Adam Schiff, who said that Bondi was personally attacking Democrats instead of answering questions.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>BONDI: Personal attacks? You've been attacking...</p><p>ADAM SCHIFF: So...</p><p>BONDI: ...My FBI director.</p><p>SCHIFF: ...So - but...</p><p>BONDI: You've been attacking my office.</p><p>SCHIFF: ...But we...</p><p>BONDI: You've been attacking...</p><p>SCHIFF: But what we're interested in...</p><p>BONDI: ...Border czar.</p><p>SCHIFF: ...What we're interested in is the answer to these oversight questions.</p><p>BONDI: What you're...</p><p>SCHIFF: So you were asked...</p><p>BONDI: No. Oversight?</p><p>SCHIFF: ...You were asked by my colleague...</p><p>BONDI: You want your five minutes of fame...</p><p>SCHIFF: ...You were asked by my colleague...</p><p>BONDI: ...Attacking good people.</p><p>SCHIFF: Regular order, Madam Chair, so I can ask a question.</p><p>LUCAS: So this was a combative hearing at times, and that exchange gives you a bit of a taste of what it was like.</p><p>KELLY: It does, indeed. OK, so that's what Democrats had on their mind. What about Republican members of this committee?</p><p>LUCAS: Well, look, there was a huge partisan divide on this. It was like two entirely separate hearings. Republicans expressed their support for Bondi, the enormous change that she's brought to the Justice Department. They argue that the department was weaponized under the Biden administration to go after Trump and conservatives more broadly. That includes information made public this week by the panel's top Republican that the FBI, back in 2023, analyzed the phone records of more than a half dozen Republican lawmakers as part of the investigation into Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. They say Bondi is ending that weaponization.</p><p>So despite concerns from legal observers and department veterans about the direction that the department is taking, Bondi has the political sort (ph) of Republicans and the president to continue what she's doing.</p><p>KELLY: Thank you, Ryan.</p><p>LUCAS: Thank you.</p><p>KELLY: NPR's Ryan Lucas.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.

Some insurers and exchanges have delayed sending notices detailing premium rates for next year because they are waiting to see what unfolds in Washington. For example, Covered California, the state's insurance marketplace, is planning to mail out notices to more than a million enrollees later than usual this year, on Oct. 15.</p>   \n   <p>From her home in Richmond, Va., 31-year-old Natalie Tyer is anxiously awaiting the arrival of her notice. She checks the state's marketplace website daily to see if new rates for her insurance plan have posted.</p>   <p>Tyer has relied on marketplace coverage for over a year now while she works part time for a small, local video production company and pursues a master's degree to become a school counselor. The tax credits help cover $255 of her monthly premium, bringing it down to $53. Since she's generally healthy, if the credits expire and her premiums go up significantly, she might drop coverage altogether.</p>   <p>\"I very well might have to go without health insurance and may have to rely on hope,\" Tyer said.</p>   <p>Democrats' push to center the shutdown on health care affordability, though, runs up against many uncomfortable realities of the federal government's closure, which will leave millions of federal workers without paychecks, hamper some functions of public health agencies, and threaten food assistance payments for low-income mothers, among other effects.</p>   <h3>This isn't the first shutdown over health care</h3>   <p>The ACA, though, has been<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2011/03/24/134766561/happy-birthday-affordable-care-act\" target=\"_blank\"> a political flashpoint since 2010</a>, when Republicans fought against the passage of the landmark health care legislation. A wave of Republican congressional victories soon followed that fight and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/09/20/224422562/house-gop-votes-to-fund-government-kill-obamacare\" target=\"_blank\">spurred a government shutdown in 2013</a>, when the GOP tried to gut the program. Party leaders <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/12/13/570479181/why-do-so-many-people-hate-obamacare-so-much\" target=\"_blank\">again tried to repeal it in 2017</a> to follow through on a Trump campaign promise.</p>   \n   <p>The latest clash — over the billions of dollars in tax credits that Democrats issued during the COVID-19 pandemic to boost enrollment in the ACA — has been simmering for months. Democrats, who wrote the original legislation introducing and then extending them, set the enhanced tax credits to expire at the end of this year. Even some Republicans began warning this summer that letting those tax credits lapse could be detrimental, with Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward issuing a memo that cautioned an extension of the credits could make a difference in next year's midterm election.</p>   <p>Extending the ACA tax credits, which have reduced monthly premiums to as little as $0 or $10 for poorer enrollees and capped the amount middle-income Americans paid to just 8.5% of their income, is also a popular move among many Americans.</p>\n</div>",

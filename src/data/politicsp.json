On Wednesday, Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck E. Schumer sent a letter to their GOP counterparts, House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, urging them to reform ICE. It included a list of several guardrails for federal agents — such as prohibiting masks and requiring that immigration enforcement officers wear body cameras to hold them accountable for their interactions with the public.   \n   It is unlikely that Johnson and Thune will agree to every demand. Many republicans say they will support some changes — like ICE agents wearing body cameras. But some GOP members draw the line at getting rid of masks. Republicans haven't completely shut down the overall proposal, yet, but they will have a short amount of time to negotiate these terms.

The post was later deleted, and the White House blamed a staffer for \"erroneously\" posting it.   It was one of dozens of posts Trump shared in the middle of the night on his platform Truth Social and came at the end of a minute-long video promoting conspiracy theories about the 2020 election.   White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the clip before it was deleted, saying \"please stop the fake outrage.\"    \n   Leavitt said it was from an \"internet meme\" that depicted Trump as king of the jungle while Democrats were shown as characters from The Lion King. Trump's clip did not include any of the longer video Leavitt referred to, which also includes other Democrats, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani, depicted as animals.   The racist trope depicting Black people as apes or animals has historically been used to dehumanize Black people and to justify slavery.   Criticism of Trump and his post came swiftly, including from some otherwise allied with Trump.   South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a Republican, said he was \"praying it was fake.\"   \"It's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House. The President should remove it,\" said Scott, who is Black.   Trump has a history of making racist remarks toward Black people and other people of color.   For years he pushed the false narrative that Obama was not born in the U.S., and he has previously used derogatory language to describe African countries.   He also falsely claimed former Vice President Kamala Harris \"turned Black\" during the presidential campaign. Harris identifies as Black and Indian American.\n",

    "description": "\n      The latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll shows what Americans think of President Trump and his policies.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  A new NPR/PBS",
    "body": "\n      The latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll shows what Americans think of President Trump and his policies.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  A new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll out today shows Americans are largely opposed to the Trump administration's actions on everything from immigration enforcement to the economy and foreign policy. It's the latest of multiple polls that show similar results, putting President Trump and Republicans in a risky position for a midterm year. NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro is here in the studio to tell us about the results. Hi.DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey. Great to be with you.SUMMERS: Great to talk with you. Domenico, tell us, how bad exactly are these numbers for President Trump?MONTANARO: Well, just 39% say they approve of the job that Trump's doing overall, and it's been below 40% in our poll since November. I mean, just 36% approve of how he's handling foreign policy and the economy. It's a really difficult spot for any president.8And what really jumps out here, though, 51% say they strongly disapprove of the job that Trump is doing. That's tied for the worst score in the decade that Marist has been asking about strong approval and disapproval. The last time it was this high or this bad for Trump was in the days after the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.SUMMERS: And obviously, we've all seen the headlines dominated by immigration enforcement as well as the two U.S. citizens who were killed at the hands of federal agents. Do we know how much that might contribute to these numbers?MONTANARO: Yeah. I mean, it's obviously a big piece of this. Two-thirds in our survey say ICE has gone too far, which has jumped 11 points since last summer. But think about, you know, what's happened this past month. In addition to immigration enforcement, Trump unilaterally, without consulting Congress, had the military go into Venezuela and remove that country's president, Nicolás Maduro, from power. And he continually - Trump made threats about taking over Greenland - all of that very unpopular in our survey and lots of other surveys that we've seen as well.We saw a pretty clear political pattern emerge in this poll. Democrats and independents, heavily against all of those Trump moves. Only 30%, for example, of independents approve of the job that Trump's doing. Republicans, on the other hand, steadfastly sticking with him.SUMMERS: I'm going to focus on independents for a second. They were key to President Trump's reelection. So what does it mean for the president and his Republican Party to have independents seemingly sliding away from?MONTANARO: They're very important in swing districts, given how locked in members of both parties are. But Latinos and voters under 30 also voted for him in substantial numbers and were really big, important reasons for why he won, but he and his policies are really unpopular with them as well. So his voting coalition has really frayed here.Despite all that, we continue to see Republicans standing by Trump. Like I said, 85% of them approve of the job he's doing. Three-quarters of Republicans think ICE is making America safer. Even nearly 7 in 10 are in favor of taking over Greenland. And just to underscore, Republicans are the outlier here. It's really the opposite of what everyone else in the survey was telling us.SUMMERS: OK. Dig into that a little bit. What is going on there?MONTANARO: I asked our pollster from Marist, Lee Miringoff, about that, actually, and here's what he had to say.LEE MIRINGOFF: For those who are always thinking that, ah, this, you know, situation is really going to break loose the Republicans, his base is crumbling - reports of that tend to be overexaggerated based on very, very skimpy evidence.MONTANARO: Yeah. Lee thinks that what could move them is if Trump follows through on some of these big threats against Canada or moving into Greenland or if he doesn't back off of tariffs and prices skyrocket. You know, I guess that's possible, but we have to remember that it's a pretty high bar to move any of these voters. I mean, the economy was really never the reason Trump won in the first place. This really goes much deeper.I also spoke to Christopher Sebastian Parker. He's a political science professor at UC Santa Barbara. He's the author of a book about the Tea Party, \"Change They Can't Believe In.\" He went so far as to call Trump a, quote, \"messianic figure\" for many on the right who are upset over demographic change that's happening in the country.CHRISTOPHER SEBASTIAN PARKER: This is more about cultural - it's a perception of cultural threat. It's about him being the last thing standing between them and the rest of us. That's what this is about.MONTANARO: Yeah. It's been pretty clear for those of us who followed conservatives and the conservative movement leading up to Trump for a long time that it's always overwhelmingly been about culture.SUMMERS: Last thing, Domenico, what does this mean short term with the midterm elections coming up?MONTANARO: Yeah, Republicans are in a real bind. When Trump's not on the ballot, they have a hard time turning out conservatives. And with independents and Latinos being this heavily against Trump's policies right now, it puts them in a perilous position.SUMMERS: NPR's Domenico Montanaro, thanks so much.MONTANARO: You got it.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

It's not just Democrats who are concerned, but also independent voters who are expected to play a major role in the upcoming midterm elections.   \"The base loves it, but it's an issue for the independent voters who decide elections in this country,\" said Alex Conant, a veteran Republican strategist. \"Independents want a strong border and they want to deport criminals, but they're really uneasy with having masked federal agents going around in neighborhoods, deporting anyone that they see — as the Democrats are portraying it.\"   \n   After months of aggressive enforcement, Trump's signature issue that twice got him elected is now turning into a liability ahead of this year's midterm elections.   The outcry over what many saw as militant tactics hit a fever pitch after the second fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen by immigration officers in Minnesota.   A new NPR/Marist poll shows that six in 10 Americans disapprove of the job federal immigration agents are doing.   Even typically loyal Republican supporters have called on the Trump administration to make changes and rebuild trust with law enforcement.   \"They, being the White House, need to recalibrate on what needs to be done to make sure that that respect is going to be re-instilled,\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told conservative radio host Mark Davis.   Trump shook up the leadership of the Minneapolis operation, and directed his team to withdraw 700 federal officers.   \"I learned that, maybe we can use a little bit of a softer touch,\" Trump said in an interview with NBC's Tom Llamas. \"But you still have to be tough. We're dealing with really hard criminals.\"   It's a bit unclear what a \"softer touch\" actually means.     Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt largely defended the administration's enforcement efforts Thursday and pointed to different polling - from a Harvard/Harris survey - that she said showed support for their \"deportation agenda.\"   \n   \"Nearly eight in ten Americans say criminal illegal aliens should be deported,\" she said. \"A solid majority also support deporting all illegal aliens, regardless of additional crimes.\"   She also said the administration is now prioritizing criminals who are in the country illegally.   Theresa Cardinal Brown, who worked on immigration policy under two presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said there may be an \"operational pause\" as the administration retools its efforts, both from a policy standpoint and a public relations standpoint.   \"Operationally, you're not really thinking about politics as you're putting together an operation, said Brown, now a member of the Council on National Security and Immigration. \"But politics comes into everything, right?\"   She points to the announcement that body cameras would be deployed to federal immigration officers in Minneapolis, noting that while video can uncover when officers are doing something wrong, body cameras can also vindicate officers when they have done the right thing.   \"I do think that probably the administration is thinking, 'well, if we had body cam footage of our own, we could put our own perspective on it,' \" she said.   Trump has a big incentive to get a handle on this crisis — and to do so quickly.   Conant, who previously worked on Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign, said Trump has left an opening for Democrats to sound more reasonable on immigration ahead of the midterms.   \"If he loses the immigration issue as a political winner, it's a real political problem,\" Conant said, \"not just for Trump, but Republicans more broadly.\"\n",

But for the first time, America brought its top military commander in the Middle East to the table.   \n   The presence of U.S. Navy Adm. Brad Cooper, the head of the American military's Central Command, in his dress uniform at the talks in Muscat, the Omani capital, served as a reminder that the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and other warships were now off the coast of Iran in the Arabian Sea.   U.S. President Trump said the United States had \"very good\" talks on Iran and said more were planned for early next week. But he kept up the pressure, warning that if the country didn't make a deal over its nuclear program, \"the consequences are very steep.\"   \n   Trump has repeatedly threatened to use force to compel Iran to reach a deal on the program after earlier sending the carrier to the region over Tehran's bloody crackdown on nationwide protests that killed thousands and saw tens of thousands of others detained in the Islamic Republic.   Gulf Arab nations fear an attack could spark a regional war that would drag them in as well.   That threat is real — U.S. forces shot down an Iranian drone near the Lincoln and Iran attempted to stop a U.S.-flagged ship in the Strait of Hormuz just days before Friday's talks in this sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula.   \"We did note that nuclear talks and the resolution of the main issues must take place in a calm atmosphere, without tension and without threats,\" Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi later told journalists.   \"The prerequisite for any dialogue is refraining from threats and pressure,\" he added. \"We stated this point explicitly today as well, and we expect it to be observed so that the possibility of continuing the talks exists.\"   \n   The U.S., represented by U.S. Mideast special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, did not immediately comment on the talks. Araghchi said diplomats would return to their capitals, signaling this round of negotiations was over.   On Friday evening, in a display of force, the U.S. military published photos on X of the Lincoln carrier group sailing in the Arabian Sea with aircraft flying overhead, with the message \"Peace through Strength!\" The The carrier and accompanying warships arrived in the Middle East at the end of January as Trump threatened attacks on Iran over the killing of protesters.   \n   Iran's top diplomat offers a positive note   Araghchi offered cautious optimism as he spoke in a live interview from Muscat on Iranian state television. He described Friday's talks as taking place over multiple rounds and said that they were focused primarily on finding a framework for further negotiations.   \"We will hold consultations with our capitals regarding the next steps, and the results will be conveyed to Oman's foreign minister,\" Araghchi said.   \"The mistrust that has developed is a serious challenge facing the negotiations,\" Araghchi said. \"We must first address this issue, and then enter into the next level of negotiations.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                In this photo released by the Iranian Foreign Ministry, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi (center) heads to a venue for talks between Iran and the U.S., in Muscat, Oman, Friday.\n                \n                    Iranian Foreign Ministry/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Iranian Foreign Ministry/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who oversaw multiple rounds of negotiations before Israel launched its 12-day war on Iran in June, called the talks \"useful to clarify both the Iranian and American thinking and identify areas for possible progress.\"   Still, Oman described the talks as a means to find \"the requisite foundations for the resumption of both diplomatic and technical negotiations\" rather than a step toward reaching a nuclear deal or easing tensions.   The talks had initially been expected to take place in Turkey in a format that would have included regional countries as well, and would have included topics like Tehran's ballistic missile program — something Iran apparently rejected in favor of focusing only on its nuclear program.   Before the June war, Iran had been enriching uranium up to 60% purity, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. The U.N. nuclear watchdog — International Atomic Energy Agency — had said Iran was the only country in the world to enrich to that level that wasn't armed with the bomb.   Iran has been refusing requests by the IAEA to inspect the sites bombed in the June war, raising the concerns of nonproliferation experts. Even before that, Iran has restricted IAEA inspections since Trump's decision in 2018 to unilaterally withdraw America from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.   \n   Omani palace hosts talks   Friday's talks saw in-person meetings at a palace near Muscat's international airport, used by Oman in earlier talks Iran-U.S. talks in 2025. Associated Press journalists saw Iranian officials first at the palace and later returning to their hotel before the Americans came separately.   It remains unclear just what terms Iran is willing to negotiate at the talks. Tehran has maintained that these talks will only be on its nuclear program. However, the Al Jazeera satellite news network reported that diplomats from Egypt, Turkey and Qatar offered Iran a proposal in which Tehran would halt enrichment for three years, send its highly enriched uranium out of the country and pledge \"not initiate the use of ballistic missiles.\"   Russia had signaled it would take the uranium, but Iran has said ending the program or shipping out the uranium were nonstarters.   U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that the talks needed to include all those issues.   \"I'm not sure you can reach a deal with these guys, but we're going to try to find out,\" he said.   The U.S. slaps new sanctions on Iran's energy sector   Shortly after Friday's talks, the Treasury and the U.S. State Department announced a new round of sanctions on Iran targeting its energy sector, imposing penalties, including freezes on assets in U.S. jurisdictions, on 14 oil tankers in a so-called \"shadow fleet\" that the U.S. says are used to try to evade sanctions, as well as on 15 trading firms and two business executives.   \n   \"Time and time again, the Iranian government has prioritized its destabilizing behavior over the safety and security of its own citizens, as demonstrated by the regime's mass murder of peaceful protestors,\" the State Department said. \"The United States will continue to act against the network of shippers and traders involved in the transport and acquisition of Iranian crude oil, petroleum products, and petrochemical products, which constitutes the regime's primary source of income.\"   In the past month, the U.S. has sanctioned Iran's interior minister,the secretary of the Supreme Council for National Security, and several other leaders involved in Iran's deadly crackdown against last month's protests.\n",

Five and a half years later, that plan has come to fruition, despite vast public opposition.   Starting March 9, an unspecified number of federal employees could lose their current job protections and be converted into at-will employees at Trump's discretion. That's according to a final rule issued Friday by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the agency that handles many human resources functions for the federal government.   \n   Under current law, the civil service is meant to be apolitical, providing continuity for the government from one presidential administration to another. But over the past year, Trump has shown a willingness — and at times an eagerness — to fire those career federal employees whom he perceives as political opponents, such as rank-and-file Justice Department attorneys involved in Jan. 6 prosecutions.   The rule would make firing such staff much easier. Titled \"Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,\" it allows for the president to move federal employees in \"policy-influencing\" roles into a new category of employees called Schedule Policy/Career. OPM previously estimated some 50,000 positions could be reclassified.   The rule explains that while federal agencies will review their workforces and ask OPM to recommend positions be moved, the president will make the final call on which positions are reclassified.   OPM received more than 40,000 comments during the public comment period — 94% of which opposed the rule. The administration chalked up a lot of the opposition to misunderstandings — of existing federal laws and of the intentions of the rule.   The Trump administration has argued that the change is a necessary step to make the bureaucracy more efficient and accountable, citing the widely held sentiment that it's too hard for the government to fire poor performers, as well as reports of federal employees \"slow walking\" or otherwise obstructing Trump's directives.   \n   The president's critics say the rule further allows Trump — and any future president — to politicize the civil service, and they warn of consequences for the American people.   \"Our government needs serious improvements to make it more effective and accountable, but one thing that doesn't need changing is the notion that it exists to serve the American people and not any individual president,\" said Max Stier, president of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service in a statement. \"This new designation can be used to remove expert career federal employees who place the law and service to the public ahead of blind loyalty and replace them with political supporters who will unquestioningly do the president's bidding.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Max Stier is the president of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service.\n                \n                    Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Currently, around 4,000 political appointees within the federal government can be fired at will, a number Stier says is already far higher than in other democracies.   Unclear which positions or how many will be reclassified   It remains unclear which positions will be subject to reclassification. The rule applies to \"policy-influencing positions,\" which, according to the 255-page document, would include supervisors of individuals in such positions.   In the rule, OPM insists that \"the vast majority\" of those appointed under Schedule Policy/Career will still be protected from prohibited personnel practices including retaliation against whistleblowing. However, they will no longer be able to file complaints with the Merit Systems Protection Board, the federal agency that hears employee challenges to personnel actions. The Office of Special Counsel, which investigates whistleblower complaints, no longer operates independently since Trump's firing last year of the Senate-confirmed leader of that agency.   \n   While reclassified employees would theoretically retain the right to file discrimination complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the rule notes that the president himself is not subject to federal employment anti-discrimination laws.   Legal challenges ahead   The rule, which was first announced last year, already faces multiple lawsuits, including one filed by Democracy Forward. The legal organization has filed numerous lawsuits seeking to block the Trump administration's overhaul of the federal government.    \"This is a deliberate attempt to do through regulation what the law does not allow — strip public servants of their rights and make it easier to fire them for political reasons and harm the American people through doing so,\" said Skye Perryman, the group's president and CEO, in a statement. \"We have successfully fought this kind of power grab before, and we will fight this again.\"\n",

The agency is days away from running out of funding, but Democrats and Republicans remain far apart on changes to immigration enforcement.   \n\n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  The clock is ticking for the Department of Homeland Security, where one week from today, the agency is due to run out of baseline funding.STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Lawmakers have been talking about a new but, so far, elusive deal that would revamp the way federal immigration agents do their jobs. In a few minutes, we hear from one of the Democrats in those talks, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. We begin with the facts.FADEL: NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales has been following all this and joins us now. Good morning, Claudia.CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila.FADEL: OK. So Democrats have this new list expanding on specific reforms they want to see. What is new in these demands?GRISALES: Right. They released a 10-point plan for DHS immigration law enforcement agents in a letter to their GOP counterparts, part of a continuing response to the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis last month. And we heard Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries reiterate some of their past asks, such as the removal of masks for DHS immigration law enforcement agents, the mandatory use of body cameras and rules for the use of force. But now they also want these agents to wear identifying information, like their last name, and an end to what they call paramilitary police. And that is why they want standard uniforms and equipment, to bring them in line with civil enforcement. They also want expanded training, and they want officers removed from the job if they do use force for the duration of an investigation.FADEL: There's also big concerns about the warrants used in these deportation actions, right? What can you tell us about that?GRISALES: Yeah. They want to ensure that DHS officers are using judicial warrants instead of what's happening now, where DHS is using warrants written by agency officials. Democrats say judges should be signing off and that these administrative warrants risk violating people's Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures. They also want other basic rights protected, such as immediate access to legal representation for those who are taken into custody and charged. As part of all this, they want heightened oversight, such as allowing members to access detention facilities regardless of who funds them.FADEL: Are Republicans open to these demands?GRISALES: Well, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson are not clear they can get this done. There are some areas Republicans say they'll support - things like body cameras. But there are others that are flatly rejecting, for example, getting rid of masks. That's been a nonstarter for Republicans, who say that doing so would put agents at risk of being targeted. The Democrats argue this is how they're held accountable. So Republicans aren't shutting down the overall proposal as of yet, but there's still a lot of negotiating left to do and not a lot of time. And one option could be another stopgap bill that kicks the can down the road for a few more weeks.FADEL: OK. So it looks like there's openings for negotiation - not much time, like you said. But what if these talks end up breaking down entirely? What happens then?GRISALES: Well, as we know, Immigration and Customs Enforcement got a huge injection of cash last year with the partisan GOP plan they dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill. In fact, they got $75 billion, which makes them the government's largest law enforcement agency. So it wouldn't make much of a difference when it comes to ICE, which is the thing Democrats want to reform. But the rest of the agency would lose out. That includes the Coast Guard, the TSA, disaster response at FEMA. So both sides still, however, want to own this issue, and they want to take a winning message to voters in the midterms this year. So a lot of incentive there as well.FADEL: That's NPR's Claudia Grisales. Thanks, Claudia.GRISALES: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

It's led some Democrats who hope to win elections this year to bring back a slogan. The slogan is abolish ICE. Does that work politically? NPR's Ximena Bustillo reports that not all Democrats think it does.XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Melat Kiros is running to represent Colorado's 1st Congressional District. It's a seat currently held by Representative Diana DeGette, another Democrat. And Kiros told NPR she sees a key issue rising to the top.MELAT KIROS: I think abolishing ICE is certainly going to be the one that is really galvanizing a lot of folks.BUSTILLO: Kiros is among a crop of Democratic candidates calling for the abolishment of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. That's the federal agency tasked with carrying out President Trump's mass deportation agenda. It has sparked controversy for tactics like breaking car windows, wearing unidentifiable uniforms and the shooting of Minneapolis resident Renée Macklin Good.KIROS: This is not a training or reform issue. This is an issue where this agency is beyond reform. It has to be dismantled and stopped in its tracks before another innocent person's life is taken by them.BUSTILLO: Jonathan Cowan, president of the centrist think tank Third Way, says the message to abolish ICE may not work in districts where Democrats are trying to challenge Republicans.JONATHAN COWAN: The divide in the Democratic Party is not over rage, disgust and anger. The divide is, what are you going to do about it? How do you channel that rage in a way that actually changes policy?BUSTILLO: The debate over abolishing ICE is poised to be especially salient in Democratic primaries and in states that have faced increased enforcement, such as Minnesota, Illinois, California and New York. Justice Democrats is a progressive organization backing several candidates who want to abolish ICE. Here's spokesperson Usamah Andrabi.USAMAH ANDRABI: The bare minimum voters deserve is a choice.BUSTILLO: But even if it's not fully calling for the agency to be abolished, Democrats want to make immigration their issue. Some want more targeted reforms like body cameras for all ICE officers. Others have embraced terms like defund and reform. Back in Colorado, Kiros' opponent, DeGette, is calling for ICE to be dismantled. Democrats' efforts to reclaim the issue will be put to the test as the midterms draw closer.Ximena Bustillo, NPR News, Washington.INSKEEP: She co-reported that story with NPR's Elena Moore.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

The map comes in response to the redistricting push President Trump initiated trying to tilt the midterm elections toward Republicans.   Virginia's current delegation in the House of Representatives has six Democrats and five Republicans.   The map and accompanying legislation was posted on the legislature's website Thursday night and Democratic Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas confirmed it was the party's proposed map.   \"Donald Trump knows he's going to lose the midterms. He knows it. That's why he's started this mess in the first place,\" Lucas told reporters Thursday earlier. \"Today we are leveling the playing field. These are not ordinary times, and Virginia will not sit on the sidelines while it happens.\"   \n   But the proposal has more steps to go before it could be in place in time for the 2026 midterms. In addition to approval from the legislature, the redistricting also requires voter approval of an amendment to Virginia's constitution in a special election planned for April 21. Gov. Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat, has yet to approve the special election. She faces a deadline to act by 11:59 p.m. on Feb. 11.   Currently the state constitution gives redistricting power to a bipartisan commission. The amendment would let that commission be sidelined because other states have already redistricted for 2026 — outside the usual once-per-decade cycle.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Speaker of the Virginia House Don L. Scott listens to debate last month as lawmakers propose setting a special election on redistricting for April 21.\n                \n                    Shaban Athuman/VPM News\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Shaban Athuman/VPM News\n    \n\n   \n   The Democrats' redistricting effort is also facing a challenge in the courts. Last week, a circuit court judge in rural southwestern Virginia said the Democratic lawmakers had not followed the law in the amendment process.   Democrats appealed shortly thereafter claiming the Republicans were \"court shopping\" in finding a circuit judge who would rule their way. A Virginia appeals court asked the Supreme Court of Virginia to take up the case in a Wednesday filing.    Republican lawmakers have argued that Democrats' reasoning wasn't strong enough to justify changing the state constitution.   \"When I hear from my good friends on the other side of the aisle that, 'Hey, this is nothing but a little thing. We're just taking care of a little business because the guy across the river is a meanie,'\" Republican State Sen. Bill Stanley said as Democrats debated the legislation to set the referendum date. \"[When] we change the constitution, we do it very deliberately. And we do it for a reason because it requires it as we move forward for Virginia until the end of time.\"   \n   Republicans have a small edge so far in redistricting for 2026   Virginia is key in Democrats' effort to counter Trump's push to tip the scales in favor of Republicans in 2026.   Currently, the GOP has a majority in the U.S. House by just a few seats and holding onto that edge would be important for Trump's agenda and for staving off Democratic-led investigations into his administration for the last two years of his term.   Usually, states redistrict early in the decade after the census count comes in.   But in July, Trump got Texas Republicans to redistrict in a way that could net them five House seats now held by Democrats. Then California Democrats countered. Their map, approved by voters in a special election in November, could help them win five seats held by Republicans.   Missouri, Ohio, North Carolina have also redistricted in the GOP's favor. Florida Republicans plan to redistrict in April, which happens to be when Virginians could be at the polls to vote on the commonwealth's redistricting amendment.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Democratic Virginia Delegate Luke E. Torian, left, chats with Republican Delegate Terry L. Austin chat at a committee meeting recently where lawmakers advanced the proposal to hold a special election on redistricting April 21.\n                \n                    Shaban Athuman/VPM News\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Shaban Athuman/VPM News\n    \n\n   \n   Maryland Democrats are considering a map that would help flip that state's one Republican-held seat.   But in all so far, Republicans have tilted two or three seats more their way than Democrats have. Republicans have an edge, in part, because they control more state legislatures.   \n   If the Virginia plan reaches the ballot, voters will be asked if the state constitution should be amended \"to allow the General Assembly to temporarily adopt new congressional districts to restore fairness in the upcoming elections\" while reverting to the standard redistricting process after the 2030 census.

The posts will be internally archived but will no longer be on public view, the State Department confirmed to NPR. Staff members were told that anyone wanting to see older posts will have to file a Freedom of Information Act request, according to a State Department employee who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation by the Trump administration. That would differ from how the U.S. government typically handles archiving the public online footprint of previous administrations.   \n   The move comes as the Trump administration has removed wide swaths of information from government websites that conflict with the president's views, including environmental and health data and references to women, people of color and members of the LGBTQ+ community. The government has also taken down signs at national parks mentioning slavery and references to Trump's impeachments and presidency at the National Portrait Gallery.   The White House has also launched a revisionist history account of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and has replaced the government's coronavirus resource sites with a page titled \"Lab Leak: The True Origins of Covid-19.\"   \n   The removal of State Department X posts from public view appears to be less about ideological differences with past statements and more about control of future messaging. The directive will see the removal of posts from Trump's first term as well as those under then-Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama.   In response to NPR's questions about the removals, an unnamed State Department spokesperson said the goal \"is to limit confusion on U.S government policy and to speak with one voice to advance the President, Secretary, and Administration's goals and messaging. It will preserve history while promoting the present.\" The spokesperson said the department's X accounts \"are one of our most powerful tools for advancing the America First goals and messaging of the President, Secretary, and Administration, both to our fellow Americans and audiences around the world.\"   \n   The State Department did not respond to NPR's specific questions about whether content will also be removed from other social media sites or whether there will be ways for the public to access archived posts without filing a Freedom of Information Act request.   \"All archived content will be preserved in alignment with Federal Record Act requirements and Department policies,\" the spokesperson said.   Some current and former State Department employees as well as academics worry that it will make the historical record of the government's communications and actions harder to trace.   \"For all the many challenges, certainly, that social media has introduced into politics, it has also created this level of an imperfect but certainly some level of transparency,\" said Shannon McGregor, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who studies the role of social media in politics. \"Even if [the X posts are] still accessible in some kind of archive, it still puts up a greater barrier in terms of having access to that information.\"   In a similar but unrelated move this week, the CIA abruptly took down its World Factbook, a widely used reference manual seen as an authoritative source of information about countries, their economies, their demographics and more. The CIA's announcement said the publication, which has been published since 1962 and first went online in 1997, was being \"sunset\" and gave no further explanation for the decision.   Accounts for embassies, ambassadors, bureaus affected   The State Department directive applies to all the department's active official X accounts, including accounts for U.S. embassies and missions, ambassadors and department bureaus and programs, according to screenshots of internal guidance seen by NPR. The department has used its posts on X and other social media sites for years to share everything from policy announcements and speeches by the secretary of state and ambassadors, to fact sheets for travelers and images from around the world.   \n   \"These posts to be removed are not just press statements. They include our embassies' July 4 livestreams, photos of COVID vaccine donations to other nations, holiday greetings, condolences, cultural programming, and the day-to-day record of diplomacy. They show who the U.S. engaged with, when, and how—often the only public record of those moments,\" Orna Blum, a long-serving senior foreign service officer and public diplomacy specialist who retired last year, wrote in a LinkedIn post about the directive.   \"Once removed, there will be no easy public, searchable access to this history. [The Freedom of Information Act] is slow, discretionary, and often redacted. It's a backstop—not a substitute for open archives,\" Blum wrote.   Since Obama, the first president to use an official account on the social media site then called Twitter, left office in January 2017, handing over online accounts has been part of the transition process between administrations. Some content is archived, but those records typically remain in public view.   Federal agency accounts, including @StateDept on X, are passed along to the incoming administration intact, meaning that posts made under earlier administrations remain visible on their timelines. The State Department also has publicly available archived versions of its website under previous administrations dating back to President Bill Clinton.   Some high-profile accounts, including those of the president, vice president, first lady and White House, are handled differently. For example, the @POTUS handle on X is handed over from one president to the next with its existing roster of followers, but posts from the outgoing president are moved to a new archive account, such as @POTUS44 for Obama, @POTUS45 for the first Trump term and @POTUS46Archive for Biden.   The State Department guidance says the X removals do not apply to official accounts that are already dormant and marked as \"archived,\" like the @SecPompeo account used by Trump's first-term secretary of state, Mike Pompeo.   \n   New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani recently faced similar questions and concerns about transparency and preserving government records after his administration began to delete posts made by his predecessor, Eric Adams, under the @NYCMayor handle on X. However, Adams' posts can be found in a public archive maintained by the city.   As the State Department archives old posts, other agencies post extreme content   In isolation, the removal of State Department social media content is a minor change unrelated to larger overhauls of American diplomacy and foreign policy and the administration's widespread changes to the federal bureaucracy.   \n   But Trump's second-term messaging strategy has been defined by a mindset that social media content is governing and that governing is also achieved through content creation.   The Department of Homeland Security, the Labor Department and other federal government accounts have shared posts that contain white supremacist rhetoric and nods to conspiracy theories like QAnon. And Trump administration staffers frequently use X to spar with critics and post memes that support the president.   \n   On Friday, Trump faced uncharacteristic pushback from some fellow Republicans after sharing a video on his social media site that contained false claims of election fraud — and a short snippet of an unrelated video that contained a racist depiction of former President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama as apes.   That post was deleted, after the White House initially defended it as an \"internet meme.\"\n",

Various groups have protested in recent months following the discovery that thousands of flood defense projects across one of the world's most typhoon-prone countries were substandard, incomplete or simply did not exist.   Government engineers, public works officials and construction company executives have testified under oath in hearings by the Senate and a fact-finding commission that members of Congress and officials at the Department of Public Works and Highways took kickbacks from construction companies to help them win lucrative contracts and avoid accountability. Most denied the allegations.   \n   Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla said about 320,000 members of the Iglesia Ni Cristo, or Church of Christ, led the start of the three-day rally in Manila's Rizal Park, many wearing white and carrying anti-corruption placards. Hundreds, including retired generals, held a separate anti-corruption protest late Sunday at the \"People Power\" monument in suburban Quezon city.   Iglesia is an influential group that votes as a bloc and is courted by political candidates during elections.   The police, backed by the military, went on full alert and deployed thousands of personnel to secure the weekend rallies, although the government expects them to be peaceful, according to a confidential security assessment seen by The Associated Press.   During a Sept. 21 anti-corruption demonstration, a few hundred black-clad protesters threw rocks, bottles and firebombs at police near the presidential palace in Manila, injuring more than 100 officers. Criminal complaints have been filed against 97 protesters.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A member of the religious sect Iglesia Ni Cristo (Church of Christ) looks on during a three-day anti-corruption rally at Manila's Rizal Park, Philippines on Sunday, Nov. 16, 2025.\n                \n                    Mark Cristino/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mark Cristino/AP\n    \n\n   \n   The presidential palace went on security lockdown over the weekend, with major access roads barricaded by anti-riot police, cargo containers and barbed wires.   National police chief Lt. Gen. Jose Melencio Nartatez Jr. ordered law enforcement to exercise \"maximum tolerance\" in Sunday's rallies.   Marcos promises quick action as outrage over corruption grows   Flood control is an especially sensitive issue in the Philippines, one of Asian countries most prone to deadly typhoons, flooding and extreme weather. Two typhoons left at least 259 dead this month, mostly from flash floods and landslides, and affected millions of others.   \n   President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has been trying to quell public outrage and street protests sparked by the scandal, saying on Thursday that many of the powerful senators, members of Congress and wealthy businesspeople who were implicated would be in jail by Christmas.   Marcos said an independent fact-finding commission he created has already filed criminal complaints for graft and corruption and plunder against 37 suspects. Criminal complaints have also been filed against 86 construction company executives and nine government officials for allegedly evading nearly 9 billion pesos ($152 million) in taxes.   Among those accused are lawmakers opposed to and allied with Marcos, including former House of Representatives Speaker Martin Romualdez, the president's cousin and a key ally; and former Senate President Chiz Escudero. Both have denied any wrongdoing.   Sen. Bong Go, a key ally of former President Rodrigo Duterte, has also been accused of involvement in corruption in flood control and other infrastructure projects. He has denied the allegations.   Duterte, a harsh Marcos critic, was detained by the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands in March for alleged crimes against humanity over his brutal anti-drugs crackdowns.   His daughter, the current vice president, said Marcos should also be held accountable and jailed for approving the 2025 national budget, which appropriated billions for flood control projects.   There have been isolated calls, including by some pro-Duterte supporters, for the military to withdraw support from Marcos, but Armed Forces of the Philippines chief of staff Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. has repeatedly rejected those calls.   \"With full conviction, I assure the public that the armed forces will not engage in any action that violates the Constitution,\" Brawner said. \"Not today, not tomorrow and certainly not under my watch.\"\n",

Answering a question from an Associated Press journalist visiting Iran, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi offered the most direct response yet from the Iranian government regarding its nuclear program following Israel and the United States' bombing its enrichment sites in June.   \"There is no undeclared nuclear enrichment in Iran. All of our facilities are under the safeguards and monitoring\" of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Araghchi said. \"There is no enrichment right now because our facilities — our enrichment facilities — have been attacked.\"   \n   Asked what it would take for Iran to continue negotiations with the U.S. and others, Araghchi said that Iran's message on its nuclear program remains \"clear.\"   \"Iran's right for enrichment, for peaceful use of nuclear technology, including enrichment, is undeniable,\" the foreign minister continued. \"We have this right and we continue to exercise that and we hope that the international community, including the United States, recognize our rights and understand that this is an inalienable right of Iran and we would never give up our rights.\"   Iran's government issued a three-day visa for the AP reporter to attend a summit alongside other journalists from major British outlets and other media.   Iran's Institute for Political and International Studies, affiliated with the country's Foreign Ministry, hosted the summit. Titled \"International Law Under Assault: Aggression and Self-Defense,\" the conference included papers by Iranian political analysts offering Tehran's view of the 12-day war in June, many seizing on comments from German Chancellor Friedrich Merz praising Israel for having done the \"dirty work\" in launching its attack.   \"Iran's defensive response was remarkable, inspiring, historic and above all, pure,\" wrote Mohammad Kazem Sajjadpour, an international relations professor. \"How can one possibly compare Israel's dirty deeds to the noble and clean actions of the Iranian nation?\"   \n   Images of children killed by Israel during the war lined the walkway outside the summit, held inside the Martyr General Qassem Soleimani Building, named for the Revolutionary Guard expeditionary leader killed by a U.S. drone strike in 2020.   But Iran finds itself in a difficult moment after the war. Israel decimated the country's air defense systems, potentially leaving the door open to further airstrikes as tensions remain high over Tehran's nuclear program. Meanwhile, economic pressures and societal change continues to challenge Iran's Shiite theocracy, which so far has held off on making decisions on whether to enforce its mandatory hijab laws or raise the price of government-subsidized gasoline, both of which have sparked nationwide protests in the past.\n",

In a separate case, Trump issued a second pardon for a Jan. 6 defendant who had remained behind bars despite the sweeping grant of clemency for Capitol rioters because of a separate conviction for illegally possessing firearms.   It's the latest example of Trump's willingness to use his constitutional authority to help supporters who were scrutinized as part of the Biden administration's massive Jan. 6 investigation that led to charges against more than 1,500 defendants.   \n   Suzanne Ellen Kaye was released last year after serving an 18-month sentence in her threats case. After FBI contacted her in 2021 about a tip indicating she may have been at the Capitol on Jan. 6, she posted a video on social media citing her Second Amendment right to carry a gun and she threatened to shoot agents if they came to her house. In court papers, prosecutors said her words \"were part of the ubiquity of violent political rhetoric that causes serious harm to our communities.\"   An email seeking comment was sent to a lawyer for Kaye on Saturday. Kaye testified at trial that she didn't own any guns and didn't intend to threaten the FBI, according to court papers. She told authorities she was not at the Capitol on Jan. 6 and wasn't charged with any Capitol riot-related crimes.   A White House official said Kaye suffers from \"stress-induced seizures,\" and experienced one when the jury read its verdict. The White House said this is \"clearly a case of disfavored First Amendment political speech being prosecuted and an excessive sentence.\" The official requested anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss the case.   In a separate case, Trump pardoned Daniel Edwin Wilson of Louisville, Kentucky, who was under investigation for his role in the riot when authorities found six guns and roughly 4,800 rounds of ammunition in his home. Because of prior felony convictions, it was illegal for him to possess firearms.   \n   Wilson's case became part of a legal debate over whether Trump's sweeping pardons for Jan. 6 rioters in January applied to other crimes discovered during the sprawling federal dragnet that began after the attack on the Capitol. The Trump-appointed federal judge who oversaw Wilson's case criticized the Justice Department earlier this year for arguing that the president's Jan. 6 pardons applied to Wilson's gun offense.   Wilson, who had been scheduled to remain in prison until 2028, was released Friday evening following the pardon, his lawyer said on Saturday.   \"We are grateful that President Trump has recognized the injustice in my client's case and granted him this pardon,\" attorney George Pallas said in an email. \"Mr. Wilson can now reunite with his family and begin rebuilding his life.\"   The White House official said Saturday that \"because the search of Mr. Wilson's home was due to the events of January 6, and they should have never been there in the first place, President Trump is pardoning Mr. Wilson for the firearm issues.\"   \n   Wilson had been sentenced in 2024 to five years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiring to impede or injure police officers and illegally possessing firearms at his home.   Prosecutors had accused him of planning for the Jan. 6 riot for weeks and coming to Washington with the goal of stopping the peaceful transfer of power. Authorities said he communicated with members of the far-right Oath Keepers extremist group and adherents of the antigovernment Three Percenters movement as he marched to the Capitol.   Prosecutors cited messages they argued showed that Wilson's \"plans were for a broader American civil war.\" In one message on Nov. 9, 2020, he wrote: \"I'm willing to do whatever. Done made up my mind. I understand the tip of the spear will not be easy. I'm willing to sacrifice myself if necessary. Whether it means prison or death.\"   \n   Wilson said at his sentencing that he regretted entering the Capitol that day but \"got involved with good intentions.\"   The Justice Department had initially argued in February that Trump's pardons of the Jan. 6 rioters on his first day back in the White House didn't extend to Wilson's gun crime. The department later changed its position, saying it had received \"further clarity on the intent of the Presidential Pardon.\"   U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, criticized the department's evolving position and said it was \"extraordinary\" that prosecutors were seeking to argue that Trump's Jan. 6 pardons extended to illegal \"contraband\" found by investigators during searches related to the Jan. 6 cases.   Politico first reported Wilson's pardon on Saturday. Megerian reported from West Palm Beach, Fla.\n",

The administration over the summer demanded the University of California, Los Angeles pay $1.2 billion to restore frozen research funding and ensure eligibility for future funding after accusing the school of allowing antisemitism on campus. UCLA was the first public university to be targeted by the administration over allegations of civil rights violations.   \n   It has also frozen or paused federal funding over similar claims against private colleges, including Columbia University.   In her ruling, Lin said labor unions and other groups representing UC faculty, students and employees had provided \"overwhelming evidence\" that the Trump administration was \"engaged in a concerted campaign to purge 'woke,' 'left,' and 'socialist' viewpoints from our country's leading universities.\"   \"Agency officials, as well as the President and Vice President, have repeatedly and publicly announced a playbook of initiating civil rights investigations of preeminent universities to justify cutting off federal funding, with the goal of bringing universities to their knees and forcing them to change their ideological tune,\" Lin wrote.   She added, \"It is undisputed that this precise playbook is now being executed at the University of California.\"   At UC, which is facing a series of civil rights probes, she found the administration had engaged in \"coercive and retaliatory conduct in violation of the First Amendment and Tenth Amendment.\"   \n   Messages sent to the White House and the U.S. Department of Justice after hours Friday were not immediately returned. Lin's order will remain in effect indefinitely.   University of California President James B. Milliken has said the size of the UCLA fine would devastate the UC system, whose campuses are viewed as some of the top public colleges in the nation.   UC is in settlement talks with the administration and is not a party to the lawsuit before Lin, who was nominated to the bench by President Joe Biden, a Democrat. In a statement, the university system said it \"remains committed to protecting the mission, governance, and academic freedom of the University.\"   \n   The administration has demanded UCLA comply with its views on gender identity and establish a process to make sure foreign students are not admitted if they are likely to engage in anti-American, anti-Western or antisemitic \"disruptions or harassment,\" among other requirements outlined in a settlement proposal made public in October.   The administration has previously struck deals with Brown University for $50 million and Columbia University for $221 million.   Lin cited declarations by UC faculty and staff that the administration's moves were prompting them to stop teaching or researching topics they were \"afraid were too 'left' or 'woke.'\"   Her injunction also blocks the administration from \"conditioning the grant or continuance of federal funding on the UC's agreement to any measures that would violate the rights of Plaintiffs' members under the First Amendment.\"   \n   She cited efforts to force the UCs to screen international students based on \"'anti-Western\" or \"'anti-American'\" views, restrict research and teaching, or adopt specific definitions of \"male\" and \"female\" as examples of such measures.   President Donald Trump has decried elite colleges as overrun by liberalism and antisemitism.   His administration has launched investigations of dozens of universities, claiming they have failed to end the use of racial preferences in violation of civil rights law. The Republican administration says diversity, equity and inclusion efforts discriminate against white and Asian American students.\n",

The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday night passed a Senate-approved spending package, ending the congressional deadlock that led to the longest government shutdown in American history.\n                \n                    Hu Yousong/Xinhua via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Hu Yousong/Xinhua via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The government is back open.   It was the longest shutdown in U.S. history at 43 days.   There are lots of questions about what this means, how we got here and where we go from here. Let's answer some:   Why did it start?   The Democratic base has been urging its leaders to show more fight. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer caught tremendous blowback in March for doing an about-face and going along with Republicans to keep the government open despite what the left saw as an odious spending bill.   When the latest funding fight came up, Schumer this time showed a united front with House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries. Arm in arm, they refused to go along with continuing to fund the government, and made the key issue extending health care subsidies, which, if not extended, would mean tens of millions of Americans would see their health care costs increased.   \n   How did it end?   It ended without the health care extensions Democrats were fighting for. Eight moderate senators crossed the aisle and indicated Sunday night that they had struck a deal with Senate Republicans to reopen the government.   The reason they didn't hold out longer, this group said, was because it was obvious President Trump and congressional Republicans weren't going to negotiate, and too many people were suffering. The Trump administration — correctly — gambled that enough Democrats would not be able to stomach the amount of pain the administration was willing to inflict on the 42 million recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and more than 3 million federal workers.   So what does the bill do?   The bill passed by Congress and signed by Trump funds the government until Jan. 30 with carveouts for SNAP, benefits targeted at women, infants and children, or WIC, the Department of Veterans Affairs and Congress. Those will all be funded until the end of September 2026.   It notably also tries to rectify the firings and loss of pay to federal workers, although it's a leverage point the Trump administration could use again if the government were to shut down again after Jan. 30.   There is also money for increased security for members of Congress, executive branch officials, judges and Supreme Court justices. Several Republican members were outspoken about this after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.   \n   If the government is only funded until Jan. 30, does that mean there could be another shutdown soon?   It's possible. It depends on a few things. What lessons do Democrats take out of the shutdown? Does the fire within the base subside some between now and then? And is there an actual vote on health care subsidies?   OK, so what about those health care subsidies?   It's not clear yet, but the lack of a negotiation on them likely means they will expire unless enough moderate Republicans, feeling pressure in their districts, cross over to strike a deal with Democrat — and Republican leadership, including and especially Trump, go along with it.   But that seems highly improbable — and tens of millions of people would see their premiums go up.   If that's the case, what was the point of the shutdown?   That's a question a lot of people, especially those left of center, are asking. They see what moderate Democrats did as caving to Republicans.   The reality is, though, the 8 moderate senators, who caucus with Democrats and took this deal, didn't want to see regular people feel more unnecessary pain — and they saw no hope for Republicans to compromise after what became the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.   Democrats did accomplish something in this shutdown, though. They elevated the issue of health care, and if Republicans block the extension of subsidies, then they will likely own increased health care costs in voters' minds.   What does this mean for federal workers and flight delays?   Government workers will get back to work, and recent mass layoffs are to be reversed. Furloughed workers were missing paychecks.   As far as airports, there are already signs of easing, but it will likely be several days or more until everything will get back to normal. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy noted that more air traffic controllers are heading back to work, but in the very short term, flight reductions at some major airports will continue.   \n   Were there any surprises?   Yes, there were a few. First, there's drama around a provision slipped in the bill that would allow senators to sue the Justice Department for $500,000 each, if they were subject to subpoenas or had their phone records accessed as a result of DOJ's Jan. 6 investigation.   House Republicans pledged to pass a resolution repealing that provision, but there's no guarantee of that or that the Senate will go along.   There was also a clash about hemp regulation between two Republican senators from the same state. The disagreement between Kentucky Sens. Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul got pretty heated.   The bill also shines a light on how hundreds of local projects are funded — from the purchasing of equipment for a college in the Virgin Islands, the establishing of a veterinary doctorate program in Maryland, urban forest conservation in Texas and asbestos abatement in Alaska to funding for local hospitals, rural community facilities, youth centers, fire stations, and so, so much more. It's earmarks — funding not voted on or allocated through the formal appropriations process but tacked on in spending bills — that pay for all of these things.   One day, there will be a vet that will say he or she got a degree from the University of Maryland, Eastern Shore — and it'll all be because of the funding deal to reopen the government.   Ah, democracy.   Is there a guarantee on a health care vote?   No. The moderate Senate Democrats, who crossed over to open the government, thought so, but House Speaker Mike Johnson said shortly after the deal was reached that he wouldn't commit to a vote.   Whether the vote happens or not, if health care subsidies are not extended, it will be because of Republicans — and that will mean they will own higher health care costs heading into an election year.   \n   What does this mean for the Epstein files?   The end of the shutdown meant the swearing in of Adelita Grijalva, a Democrat, who won a special election in Arizona replacing her late father.   That's key because she signed onto a discharge petition trying to compel the Justice Department to release the files associated with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and her support gave a majority to those who want to see them released. Johnson, who is close to Trump, has argued compelling the release is not necessary — though the president has made clear he does not want them released in full and his Justice Department has not taken public steps to do so.   Even if it passes, though, it will largely likely be symbolic. The Senate is unlikely to get the required 60 votes. Trump would, of course, like it to fail in the House. Colorado Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert, one of three Republicans who have also signed the discharge petition, met in the White House Situation Room, apparently about Epstein. Boebert did not remove her name even after the meeting.   The day the shutdown ended, more investigative materials were released from the House Oversight Committee, including a leak from committee Democrats pointing specifically to emails from Epstein's estate, showing Epstein implying that Trump knew about the girls.   Any day Trump is talking about Epstein is not a good day for the White House.   Who winds up with the political advantage out of the shutdown?   Democrats really upset their base — again. Progressives continue to feel like they get rolled by party leaders. At the end of the day, though, Democrats are likely the ones who got the most out of the shutdown and will have the advantage in the midterm elections.   Consider that Democrats are coming off huge wins across the country earlier this month in the off-year elections. The central issue in those elections was affordability. And through the shutdown, they elevated the issue of health care.   \n   The party and its candidates will likely be able to campaign on both of those issues next year, and with Republicans in charge, that will help Democrats — if they can mend fences with their base, that is.\n",

Scott Applewhite/AP, Gregory Rec/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   AUGUSTA, Maine — This week's vote to end the federal government shutdown sharply divided Congress along partisan lines. Yet the bill to reopen the government was reliant upon Democratic lawmakers of both chambers who joined Republicans, exposing rifts within the Democratic Party.   That political divide was clearly evident in Maine's congressional delegation — and the public's reaction to how they voted.   \"Well, Angus really hurt us in Maine,\" said Donna Doucette who, like many folks in Maine, refers to Sen. Angus King by his first name. King — an independent who caucuses with Democrats — was among eight minority party senators who negotiated a deal with Republicans to reopen government.   \n   Doucette was one of about two dozen protesters holding signs along a busy street in Waterville on a recent cold and blustery November afternoon. The protesters, many of whom are part of the local Indivisible chapter, were opposed to the deal ending the government shutdown.   \"I've supported him from the beginning and I think he sold us out. Especially when I'm retired, still dealing with cancer — I don't need that now. Nor does my husband, who is even older than me,\" she said.   As part of the deal, Senate Republicans promised a future vote on extending subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.   But critics say they betrayed the Democratic cause by failing to secure an actual extension of the tax credits that roughly 20 million ACA users rely upon to lower their premiums. Without congressional action, the average premium is expected to more than double after December 31st.   Some protesters brought signs calling King a coward. Cindy Burke said he caved.   \"We held out for 40 days, I think, and I just feel that we got nothing from it,\" said Burke. \"And a promise to have a vote on the ACA, I don't believe that is going to happen. I don't trust the Republicans.\"   \n   A small delegation with a significant split    Maine's four-person congressional delegation is one of the smallest in the country. Yet their mixed votes on the bill to reopen the government reflect the national divide over the fraught issue.   Maine's Republican Sen. Susan Collins blamed the shutdown on Democrats and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. Yet as chairwoman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, Collins helped broker the compromise that funds the government through January 30 and fully funds some agencies through September 30.   \n   Maine Rep. Jared Golden, a Democrat, supported extending the ACA subsidies but blasted his party's shutdown strategy. He cast one of his party's six House votes to end the shutdown.   His fellow Maine Democrat, Congresswoman Chellie Pingree, views the compromise as a \"capitulation,\" particularly after the Democratic victories nationwide during the Nov. 4 election.   \"Many of us felt like there was a lot of momentum behind us,\" said Pingree. \"And the Republicans are feeling these concerns. They are losing court battles and they are getting the same calls that we are. We should move them to a decision, not the promise of a vote.\"   Angus King said in an interview with Maine Public Radio earlier this week that he's surprised by the ferocity of the backlash, although he understands the sentiment.   \"I understand because millions of people in this country are gravely worried and angry and frankly scared about the future of their country because of what Donald Trump is doing,\" King said. \"I'm with them. I've been to the 'No Kings' rallies here in Maine.\"   But King defended his decision, saying Republicans made clear they would not negotiate on the ACA until the government reopened. Government shutdowns rarely secure policy concessions for the minority party.   \n   Although he supports extending the subsidies, King said the shutdown harmed Americans — and empowered Trump. That's why King voted with Republicans more than a dozen times to avoid or end the shutdown.   \"And I get it: people want some place to stand up and they felt this was it,\" King said. \"But it's backfiring in a sense that it is hurting a lot of people without getting what we want.\"   Independents play a key role in upcoming elections   It's unclear how shutdown partisanship will impact next year's elections in Maine — a state where 30 percent of voters are independents. And Maine could play an outsized role in control of Congress after 2026.   \n   Golden isn't seeking reelection in a House district that Trump won twice, giving Republicans an opportunity to flip the seat. And the shutdown is already popping up in the heated Democratic primary to challenge Collins, one of the Senate's most vulnerable Republicans. Collins has not yet announced that she is running for reelection, although she is aggressively fundraising.   \"I want to reiterate my call for Leader Schumer to step down,\" said Democratic Senate candidate Graham Platner, a Marine Corps veteran and oysterman whose anti-establishment message has drawn huge crowds, despite recent controversy over past online comments and a tattoo widely recognized as a Nazi symbol. Platner has said he didn't realize the connection when he received the tattoo as a young infantryman and recently had it covered.   Platner denounced the shutdown deal, blaming Schumer — who opposed the deal but couldn't keep his party unified against it. But he also took a not-so-subtle jab at Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who was recruited by Schumer to run for the Senate.   \"The governor has Chuck Schumer's phone number. She should give him a call and have a chat about that.\"   For her part, Mills said this week that she strongly disagrees with the deal to end the shutdown.   \"I appreciate Senator King's efforts here, but it's not going to work,\" Mills said on MSNBC. \"The mere promise of taking it up, putting it on the calendar, talking about it in December . . . Maine people can't wait.\"   Back in Waterville, protest organizer Karen Heck said she's frustrated — with King, with her Democratic Party and with politicians, in general.   \"I just think that most people are tired of a government that doesn't work for them,\" Heck said. \"Whether that's a schism in the Democratic Party or not, I think that this old system, the old system is not working for us. And a lot of people are angry about that.\"   \n   Heck added that she thinks people will demand a change — possibly starting in next year's primaries.\n",

Now, he says he's so concerned about his family's safety because of the Trump administration's actions and rhetoric, that he trains weekly at a shooting range.\n                \n                    KT Kanazawich\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        KT Kanazawich\n    \n\n   \n   Charles says he worries that some of President Trump's supporters may feel emboldened someday to target minorities like him and his family.   \"He could dispatch citizens or the government,\" Charles says. \"I'm not saying that's what's going to happen. What I'm saying is none of this is out of the question any longer.\"   Changing face of American gun ownership   For decades, the image of gun ownership in America was white, rural and Republican, but that's been changing, according to gun clubs, trainers, Second Amendment advocates and academic researchers.   They say more liberals, people of color and LGBTQ folks have been buying guns for years and particularly since Trump's reelection in 2024. This story was based on more than 30 interviews. David Phillips is on the training team of the Liberal Gun Club, which has chapters in more than 30 states and provides a haven for liberals to train and learn about guns. He says club membership has grown from 2,700 in November to 4,500 today. Requests for training, he says, have quintupled.   \n   \"The concern is about the supporters of the right-wing who feel that they have been given permission to run roughshod at least, if not commit outright violence against people they don't like,\" Phillips says.   Asked about these concerns, the White House dismissed NPR's reporting.   \"Instead of covering Americans exercising their Second Amendment Right and trying to disingenuously blame President Trump, NPR should highlight the dangerous language from elected Democrats that has driven leftists to commit actual violence against Republicans – including the recent assassination of Charlie Kirk,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement.   Jackson said stories like this one are why NPR no longer receives federal funding. \"That's something we can all celebrate,\" she added.   Trump has also blamed what he calls \"the radical left\" for demonizing him and his supporters and inspiring political violence.   But many liberals who spoke for this story say it's the other way around. They say the president dehumanizes others with his rhetoric. For instance, Trump has said undocumented immigrants are \"poisoning the blood of our country.\" The president has also called his political opponents, \"radical left thugs that live like vermin.\"   Despite White House claims to the contrary, there is ample anecdotal evidence that more people are buying guns because some of the administration's policies frighten them.   \"Never seen a surge like this before\"   \"As everyone knows, there has been a huge surge in fear and panic since the election,\" said Tom Nguyen, speaking on YouTube to his LA Progressive Shooters gun club just a few weeks after Trump's inauguration. Nguyen said the club's Pistol 101 classes were already booked out for nine months.   \"I've never seen a surge like this before,\" said Thomas Boyer, spokesperson for the San Francisco Chapter of the Pink Pistols, whose motto is: \"Armed gays don't get bashed.\"   \n   Even traditional Second Amendment groups say more liberals are seeking gun training.   \"It's definitely common knowledge at this point,\" said Taylor Rhodes, communications director for the National Association for Gun Rights.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Charles's daughter, Charley, practices with her father. The day after President Trump's election, a man drove onto her college campus and hurled racial slurs at Black students.\n                \n                    KT Kanazawich\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        KT Kanazawich\n    \n\n   \n   There's no way to measure just how many people are buying guns because the political environment scares them, but the phrase \"How do I buy a gun?\" spiked a number of times in the past year, according to Google Trends.   Those spikes happened around the time of Trump's 2024 election, his inauguration, the first immigration enforcement blitz in January and the day when Trump held a military parade in Washington, D.C.   This recent surge in liberals buying guns is the latest in a years-long trend. For instance, a University of Chicago study found that gun ownership by Democrats or Democrat-leaning people rose by 7 percentage points between 2010 and 2022.   David Yamane, a professor of sociology at Wake Forest University in North Carolina, says the events of 2020 and early 2021 – the pandemic, the murder of George Floyd and the Jan. 6 Capitol riot – were particular drivers.   \"We do know that in that year that new gun owners were disproportionately African American (and) disproportionately female,\" Yamane said.   Only for self-protection   Like the vast majority of gun owners, those who spoke to NPR said they would use the weapons only for self-protection and would not engage law enforcement.   \"All the language that we use is absolutely not about rallying together to arm and go assault anyone,\" says MJ, a member of a liberal, self-defense group in the Midwest who asked NPR not to use his full name because he feared retribution. \"If anyone even talks like that, I or someone else would probably boot them out of the group.\"   Bill Sack, director of legal operations with the Second Amendment Foundation, which challenges gun control legislation, says he's glad to see more liberals exercising their right to self-defense – but he isn't happy about why.   \n   \"Is it a good thing that people are scared?\" he says. \"No, of course not.\"   Every new gun owner who spoke to NPR said they thought it was highly unlikely they would have to defend themselves because of civil unrest. But they also said that if they ever had to, they'd regret not having a gun.   \"As a man, as a father, as a husband, how remiss and derelict would it be for me to not be prepared?\" says Charles, the Maryland doctor.\n",

Ron, thanks for being with us.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.SIMON: And how does the White House respond to the release of these Epstein emails and the coming vote in the House to release more?ELVING: In a word - aggressively. It has been a hallmark of Trump's career that when threatened, he strikes back. When accused, he accuses someone else. And in this case, at Trump's instigation, the attorney general has announced an investigation of several former officials and Democratic donors who Trump alleges have something to hide with regard to Jeffrey Epstein. Now, the obvious way to deal with a lot of this shadow boxing and innuendo would be to release all the Epstein files. That's what candidate Trump promised a year ago, but President Trump has resisted that and driven other leaders in the Republican Party to do the same.SIMON: So far, do you think his response has been effective even among supporters?ELVING: In a sense and in the short-term, yes. Suddenly, we're seeing pictures of the people Trump wants investigated appear on television and in other media. That reduces the amount of time those media are focusing on Trump and all those videos of him with Epstein. But down the road, it doesn't change the nature of Trump's own involvement with Epstein. And it doesn't stop the calls for transparency that come from voters, including more than a few of Trump's on supporters.Now,  even Marjorie Taylor Greene, the familiar firebrand from Georgia - she is a Republican representative in Congress and a fierce defender of the president. In multiple interviews, she has called Trump misguided in fighting the release of the Epstein files. And that, of course, has drawn Trump's ire. In a long post on Truth Social last night, the president called Marjorie Taylor Greene, quote, \"wacky,\" unquote, and said he was withdrawing his support of her.SIMON: Democrats were unable to get an extension of the health care subsidies in the spending bill that just passed. But they say their message, quote, is \"the fight continues.\" How's that being received?ELVING: It's not enough for the hardcore Democratic voters, and that includes the hardcore Democrats who serve in the House. Most of them rejected the deal that reopened the government. They wanted to hold on to the leverage they got by blocking the stopgap funding bill. That's why we had a shutdown. It may not be much, but it's all the Democrats have right now with both chambers of Congress and the White House in Republican hands.Ultimately, though, there were just enough Democrats in the Senate who thought the pain of the shutdown had gone too far, gotten too intense and fallen hardest on recipients or former recipients of food assistance programs. That's not to dismiss the other effects of the shutdown, but only to say that those effects pale in comparison to hungry families. It simply wasn't clear when the hunger of those families was going to change the political calculus for the White House, which is still seeking to block some of the food assistance payments.SIMON: And, Ron, what are you watching for in these next few weeks?ELVING: We should be watching public reaction to all of this. That includes a spike that's coming in the cost of health care for Obamacare users and for many people on Medicaid. Their pain may be real, but will it be felt and shared by enough of the voting public that it changes some minds in Washington? And we've already had one round of elections this month that sent some strong political signals, but there won't be any other elections before the next round of health care showdown votes in December and in January.But there will be polls. And we know the Obamacare subsidy extensions poll exceptionally well. People want them extended. And we know Trump's own personal approval rating, in an average of all recognized national polls, is lower than it's been before in his second term. There is a sense that he is nervous about voter sentiment. He announced a list of foods - including beef and coffee - would be exempt from tariffs after all. And that might slow down inflation people are seeing in the grocery stores, but it's unclear if it will actually lower any of those prices. And with the midterm elections now just a year away, that is a strong indicator of what we might expect.SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving. Always good to speak with you.

But Congress did not address the expiring health care subsidies that were the central issue in the fight. What comes next for a Congress that has become so dysfunctional? NPR congressional correspondent Deirdre Walsh joins us. Deirdre, thanks for being with us.DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Hey, Scott.SIMON: House came in and voted for one day after they'd been gone for more than 50, but Speaker Mike Johnson says they're coming back full force. What does that mean?WALSH: Well, the speaker says there are going to be long days and long nights ahead. The big thing they have to deal with is the rest of the spending bills to fund federal agencies. Since the bill the president signed this week was just a stopgap measure, Congress faces another deadline at the end of January to fund federal agencies, or we could be looking at another shutdown. So Congress hasn't shown an ability to pass many yearlong funding bills, so we could see another stopgap bill at the end of January.SIMON: Of course, Republicans promise to vote on health care by mid-December. What exactly are they going to vote on?WALSH: Well, it's worth noting that Senate Republicans promised this vote. There were some informal bipartisan talks in the Senate during the shutdown about how to deal with these Affordable Care Act tax credits that are expiring at the end of this year. One framework this Senate group is talking about would potentially extend these credits for one year and then phase in some reforms, maybe limit who's eligible for the tax credits, put in some provisions to crack down on waste, fraud and abuse. I talked to New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen earlier this week. She is a Democrat who's helping lead these negotiations. She wants a bipartisan bill the president will sign. She says she supports some of the changes that Republicans want in these tax credits.JEANNE SHAHEEN: For example, a cap on income and who can benefit from the premium tax credits. I mean, that's legitimate.SIMON: Deirdre, bipartisanship in the Senate is one thing, but the politics for House Republicans certainly are different. Is Speaker Johnson planning a vote on health care?WALSH: Well, he certainly faces pressure from some of his swing-district Republicans who want some kind of extension, maybe one year on these tax credits. But the vast majority of House conservatives campaigned to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, and they don't want to help extend any part of it. Speaker Johnson is blaming Democrats for the rising costs of health care. He says when they put this system into place, he claims that House Republicans has what he says, volumes of ideas on reducing costs, but we haven't seen any actual details. And based on what he said this week, he doesn't sound like this is something the House is going to move quickly on.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE JOHNSON: The Republicans would demand a lot of reforms before anything like that was ever possible. And we have to go through that deliberative process.SIMON: And, of course, the speaker has other things to deal with. Preeminently right now, a vote to force the release of documents in the Jeffrey Epstein case. How do we expect that to play out?WALSH: Right. This issue was forced on the speaker, and we expected a vote in the House in early December. But with increasing calls from Republicans to get these files out, the speaker decided to move that up, and there's going to be a vote this week. The politics on this are really bad for the speaker and the Republican Party and the White House. The party's divided, and this bill is even picking up more and more Republican votes each day, even as top Trump officials were pressuring Republican lawmakers to even block a bill from coming up in the House. The speaker argues the House Oversight Committee has already been investigating Epstein. And we should say that the documents the committee released are from the Epstein estate. The legislation on the floor this week is requiring the release of the Justice Department's files. We expect this bill to pass easily. The big question is how big of a vote will it get in the House, and is that going to put pressure on Senate Majority Leader John Thune to take up this issue?SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh. Thanks so much.WALSH: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

House Speaker Mike Johnson called it a \"hate America rally.\"   This summer, droves of demonstrators protested on the Army's 250th anniversary, which coincided with President Trump's birthday. In celebration of the date, Trump insisted on a massive military parade that critics said was meant to honor Trump as much as the armed service.   Now, protesters say they are speaking out against what they say are injustices perpetrated against suspected undocumented immigrants, as well as a failing health care system, efforts to tilt elections and other grievances.   The organizers said on the No Kings website: \"The president thinks his rule is absolute. But in America, we don't have kings and we won't back down against chaos, corruption, and cruelty.\"   \n   White House responds: \"Who cares?\"   When asked about the planned protests and the accusations that Trump is behaving like a monarch, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson replied, \"Who cares?\" She had no further comment.   In June, organizers estimated that 5 million people participated in a day of No Kings protests around the country in more than 2,000 events.   They are projecting an even bigger turnout this weekend.   Harvard University sociologist and assistant professor of public policy Liz McKenna said that in the past, movements of this scale have succeeded in influencing social change, but that their efficacy has dropped significantly since the turn of the century.   \n   \"We are not even a year into the Trump administration, and so I think the strategy on the part of the organizers is to show that 'we're not backing down,'\" McKenna said.   \n   But, she added: \"We've seen more people take to the streets, not just in the United States but around the world, by the millions, and in many, if not most, of those cases, the protests have not achieved their stated aims.\"   McKenna cited recent large-scale protests like Black Lives Matter and the Women's March during Trump's first term, which were highly visible but did not necessarily result in lasting change.\n",

As legal challenges to President Trump's push to send military troopsÂ to Democratic-led cities make their way through several courts, the administration's appeal to the high court marks the first time the justices have been asked to weigh in on the issue.   In the appeal filed on Friday by the Department of Justice, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that troops are needed in the Chicago area to \"prevent ongoing and intolerable risks to the lives and safety\" of federal agents. The appeal comes a day after a federal judge denied Trump's bid to deploy troops in Illinois. Sauer argued that the judge's ruling \"improperly impinges on the President's authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property.\"   \n   Trump has been arguing that Chicago is lawless and in need of military intervention to quell protests and protect federal immigration facilities, and federalized the state National Guard against Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker's wishes earlier this month. Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott also sent several hundred of his state's troops to the Democratic-led state.   The Trump administration is \"going to litigate this as much as we can,\" Vice President JD Vance said in an interview with ABC's This Week on Sunday. \"We think that we have the authority to provide proper safety to our citizens all over the United States, but particularly in Chicago.\"   The Supreme Court has asked Illinois and Chicago officials to respond to the administration's arguments by Monday evening.   President Trump has carried out, or attempted to carry out, similar plans in other cities while claiming that federal intervention is needed to drive down crime rates. Leaders in several of those cities have said military force is unnecessary and have accused the president of exceeding his authority to carry out such deployments.   \n   The president is currently in a legal battle with the state of California, after he deployed about 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles to quell anti-ICE protests. California Attorney General Rob Bonta has argued that Trump broke the law by not consulting with Gov. Gavin Newsom.    Last month, Trump authorized National Guard troops to go to Memphis to handle what he said were \"tremendous levels\" of crime in the city. He is also in litigation with the city of Portland, Ore., after attempting to send troops there to safeguard ICE facilities that he said were being attacked. A judge has issued an order blocking the deployment.    \n   In August, Trump deployed National Guard Troops to Washington, D.C., after issuing a crime emergency that lasted about a month. Shortly before the emergency expired, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced the city had established the Safe and Beautiful Emergency Operations Center to manage and continue its relationship with federal law enforcement. The office is responsible, in part, for communicating D.C.'s requests to the federal agents, such as that they not wear masks and that they clearly identify themselves during arrests and interactions with the public.    Trump, eyeing future troop deployments, has said Baltimore, New York, New Orleans, St. Louis, Mo., Oakland and San Francisco are next. \n",

That includes more than 400 Department of Housing and Urban Development employees, 465 Education Department staff and 102 people with the Census Bureau, according to court filings released Friday.   Friday's court filing came amid a legal fight between the administration and two federal employee unions â the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees â which sued to block what they call \"politically driven RIFs,\" or reductions in force.   \n   On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in the Northern District of California granted the unions a temporary restraining order (TRO), halting some of the layoffs announced Oct. 10 and preventing new firings until she holds another hearing on Oct. 28 to consider an indefinite pause.   As part of her order, Illston also directed the government to provide the court with \"an accounting of all RIFs, actual or imminent, that are enjoined by this TRO.\"   \n   In more than 30 declarations filed by the defendant agencies Friday afternoon, Trump administration officials provided some details about the layoffs and repeatedly stated they would not proceed with RIFs blocked by the court order.    At the same time, the administration made clear it believes most of the employees who have already received layoff notices â or are expected to in the near future â are not covered by the court order, which only applies to programs or offices where the union plaintiffs have members or bargaining units.   In a status conference Friday evening, Illston said she didn't think agencies should be carrying out layoffs while the temporary restraining order was in effect and urged the government to \"err on the side of caution.\"   She described this moment as a terrible situation, adding \"We ought not make it worse.\"   \n   The government's attorney Elizabeth Hedges repeatedly told the judge that the government was doing everything it could to comply with her order.   The plaintiffs' attorney Danielle Leonard repeatedly said the government had taken too narrow an interpretation of the order.    In some cases, agencies indicated they believed the court order does not apply to their employees because their agency no longer has an obligation to bargain with the unions.   Earlier this year, President Trump issued an executive order ending collective bargaining rights for most federal workers citing national security concerns, including at agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Environmental Protection Agency.   \n   Thomas Nagy, a human resources official with HHS, referenced the executive order in his declaration to the court about the 982 RIFs at HHS announced since the shutdown.   \"HHS has not issued any RIF notices implicated by the Court's TRO,\" he wrote. \"Although CDC did previously have AFGE bargaining units, HHS terminated the relevant Collective Bargaining Agreements on August 26, 2025, pursuant to Executive Order 14251.\"   During the status hearing, the plaintiffs' attorney Leonard noted that the cancellation of collective bargaining rights at many agencies is under legal dispute. She asked the judge to clarify the wording of the temporary restraining order to ensure that employees of bargaining units affected by Trump's executive order are covered by the court order. Illston agreed to that change.    The plaintiffs also asked the court to add three more unions to the lawsuit and to the temporary restraining order, to broaden the number of employees who would be covered by the pause on RIFs.    Illston agreed to add the three unions to the temporary restraining order and said she would consider adding them as plaintiffs in the case at the next hearing.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump listens to other speakers after delivering remarks during an event in the White House's Oval Office on Oct. 16.\n                \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   At the hearing on Wednesday, Illston characterized the Trump administration's approach to the most recent RIFs as \"ready, fire, aim\" and said the administration was seeking to take advantage of the lapse in funding \"to assume that all bets are off, that the laws don't apply to them anymore, and that they can impose the structures that they like on a government situation that they don't like.\"   \n   In response, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called Illston \"another far left, partisan judge.\"   Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Leavitt added that the White House is confident their actions are legal and called the layoffs \"an unfortunate consequence\" of the government shutdown.   OMB Director Russ Vought said Wednesday close to 10,000 people could receive layoff notices during the shutdown, shortly before the judge blocked firing plans from taking effect.   While the White House promised \"substantial\" firings during the shutdown, the layoffs announced so far amount to only a fraction of the federal employees who have left the government since Trump returned to the White House in January.   \n   Back in August, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) said roughly 300,000 federal workers would be gone from the government by the end of the year. OPM director Scott Kupor told news outlets that 80% of those departures were voluntary.   That means even prior to the shutdown, roughly 60,000 federal workers faced involuntary separation, according to Kupor's estimates.   Another 154,000 workers took the Trump administration's \"Fork in the Road\" buyout offer, according to OPM. Many who took the buyout told NPR they feared they would be fired if they didn't leave.\n",

Details from the indictment filed in Maryland's district court charge Bolton with eight counts for the transmission of national defense information and 10 counts of unlawful retention of such information. Each count faces a maximum of 10 years in prison.   In a statement, the Justice Department said Bolton illegally transmitted classified information using a personal email and messaging applications, including U.S. \"intelligence about future attacks, foreign adversaries, and foreign-policy relations.\"   \n   \"There is one tier of justice for all Americans,\" Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. \"Anyone who abuses a position of power and jeopardizes our national security will be held accountable.\"   The charges come about two months after the FBI executed a search warrant at Bolton's suburban Washington home. Court papers said agents recovered documents marked as classified, including references to weapons of mass destruction.   Bolton served in Trump's first term in the White House for just over a year but has since become a sharp critic of the president. He has said he believed Trump would use the Department of Justice to enact a \"retribution presidency.\"   The investigation against Bolton dates back to before Trump's return to office. Bolton's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said the charges in the case were \"resolved years ago.\" He said the charges stem from documents tied to Bolton's personal diaries, and never included classified information.   \"Like many public officials throughout history, Amb. Bolton kept diaries â that is not a crime. We look forward to proving once again that Amb. Bolton did not unlawfully share or store any information,\" Lowell said in a statement.   \n   Bolton was one of the former administration officials whose security clearances Trump stripped when he returned to office. Trump also revoked Bolton's security detail, which was in place because of threats from Iran.   Bolton published The Room Where It HappenedÂ in 2020, a memoir about his time in the White House that was critical of Trump's approach to foreign policy and the presidency in general.   The Trump administration sued to try to block the book's publication, alleging that Bolton hadn't gone through the proper clearance process and that his manuscript contained classified information. A judge declined that request, but said Bolton's conduct raised national security concerns. The Biden administration dismissed the lawsuit, and prosecutors dropped a grand jury investigation the following year.   \n   The charges against Bolton follow two other recent indictments, including against former FBI Director James Comey, another Trump critic, on one count of making false statements and one count of obstruction of justice in connection with his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee nearly five years ago.   And a grand jury indicted New York Attorney General Letitia James last week on one count of bank fraud and one count of making a false statement to a financial institution. James, a Democrat, pledged to investigate Trump and won a case against him and his company for inflating the value of some of its properties.   \n   Trump had publicly called on the Justice Department to prosecute James and Comey in a social media post last month; Bolton wasn't included in that post.   The indictments came after the top federal prosecutor in Northern Virginia cast doubt on the evidence against both Comey and James, only to be forced out by the president andÂ replaced with one of Trump's former defense attorneys.\n",

More than two weeks into the shutdown, talks on Capitol Hill remain at an impasse.\n                \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   With the Trump administration staving off some of the most painful impacts of the government shutdown, and a federal court ruling pausing layoffs for thousands of federal workers, the sense of urgency on Capitol Hill for a way out of the stalemate may be gone â at least for right now.   In past shutdowns, Congress passed legislation to cover paychecks for the military, while headlines about things like closed national parks and shuttered agencies unable to provide services turned up the heat on both parties.   \n   With this shutdown, the dynamic is different. Day after day, top congressional leaders hold dueling press conferences, but there are no serious negotiations and the House hasn't voted in weeks. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., says he has no plans for the chamber to return until Senate Democrats break their opposition to a stopgap bill passed by the House to fund federal agencies through November 21.   After a 10th Senate vote to fund the government failed to advance on Thursday, Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt, said efforts to end the shutdown were \"nowhere.\" The Senate wrapped up business and went home, ensuring the shutdown will stretch into a fourth week.   One reason for the shift is that Congress has been sidelined from any effort to deal with the fallout as the Trump administration takes the lead.   \n   On Tuesday, the White House Office of Management and Budget said in a post on social media that it was \"making every preparation to batten down the hatches and ride out the Democrats' intransigence.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, speaks with reporters at the U.S. Capitol on July 15th. OMB said this week it was \"making every preparation to batten down the hatches and ride out the Democrats' intransigence.\"\n                \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Win McNamee/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The administration's efforts have taken several forms. The Pentagon shifted money around to cover the Oct. 15 paychecks of servicemembers. The administration tapped $300 million in tariff revenue to keep a nutrition program for low-income women and children operational. And on Thursday, it said it would ensure that 70,000 law enforcement officers across the Department of Homeland Security â including at TSA and ICE â would be paid \"for all hours worked during the shutdown period.\"   \n   OMB did not respond to a request for comment about additional plans to cover pay for law enforcement or other federal workers, or what kind of additional layoffs might be announced. President Trump has said \"Democrat programs\" would be cut and face permanent layoffs or closures, but no details have been released yet.   Predicting tough days ahead    Democrats broadly argue that the administration's moves are illegal, and that there's bipartisan support for bills to cover the costs of pay for soldiers and aid for low-income women and children.   And while the administration's efforts may have delayed some pain from the shutdown for targeted programs and agencies, Democrats say the moves are also prolonging the impasse by removing pressure points that served to push the parties to negotiate in the past.   The approach \"may or may not take some pressure off,\" according to Welch, but he said it's not sustainable.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Peter Welch D-Vt. questions witnesses during a hearing on Capitol Hill on July 16. Welch said efforts to end the government shutdown have gone \"nowhere.\"\n                \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Earlier this week House GOP Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., praised the president for ensuring soldiers did not miss their most recent paycheck. But more widespread impacts \"are just getting started,\" he warned.   \"Airports will be flooded with flight cancellations and delays amid the busiest time to travel all year, and the list goes on and on,\" Emmer said.   \n   Democrats are using their only point of leverage in the minority â denying the GOP enough votes to advance the stopgap funding bill passed by the House â as a way to force a debate about expiring health care subsidies. They believe the public is increasingly understanding that significant premium spikes are on the horizon if Congress doesn't act, and that could force the GOP to the table.   Rep. James Walkinshaw, D-Va., is among those who believe pressure on the GOP may soon grow. Walkinshaw represents a suburban district outside of Washington with a large number of federal workers.   \n   He says there is currently no legal mechanism to pay air traffic controllers, or a way to address what he described as the unpredictable markets facing farmers due to President Trump's tariff policies.   \"Every day that the shutdown continues, it's harder for the administration to try to play whack -a-mole and mitigate impacts.\"   November 1 could be a key date    November 1 is the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Most states will send notices laying out the cost of coverage without federal subsidies, and lawmakers on both sides openly admit the shutdown could extend for weeks. Democrats believe that could act as a mechanism to change things on Capitol Hill.   \n   \"What's so simple at the heart of this is should people who have health care in 2025 that's helped by the tax credits have access to that health care in 2026?\" Welch said in an interview. He said that in Vermont notices started going out on October 15, with some families facing increases of $25,000.    \"This is all about all our families, it's not a red state, blue state deal, or who you voted for,\" according to Welch.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., speaks during a news conference following a weekly Republican policy luncheon on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said he's happy to sit down with Democrats, but he has stressed that any health care deal \"happens after they open up the government.\" Thune says he has offered Democrats a vote on a proposal to address health care subsidies, but he cannot guarantee an outcome.   Referring to Senate Democrats, Thune said, \"these are not people who want to get things done. These are people who want to fight Trump and appease all the people who are coming into town this weekend,\" he told reporters, referring to a \"No Kings\" rally sponsored by progressive activists groups opposing the Trump administration's policies.   Democrats see Trump as the only person who can change the current dynamic. Many cite his love of a \"deal\" and the fact that voters in red states who backed him rely on the tax credits more than those in blue states.   \n   \"As soon as he gets engaged this thing can resolve within a day or two,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told reporters on Thursday.\n",

Chuck Schumer's real words about the government shutdown â but in an AI deepfake of the Democratic Senate Minority Leader.   The 30-second video posted on X and YouTube by the National Republican Senatorial Committee on Friday raised alarms among many observers who warned it crossed a new boundary in politics and could unleash a flood of AI-generated deepfake attack ads.   \n   Captioned on X \"Week 3 of the Schumer Shutdown: 'Every day gets better for us',\" the video shows an AI-generated version of Schumer repeatedly saying those words and grinning. The video concludes with Schumer smiling as a narrator says, \"The Schumer shutdown is making things worse across America and Democrats love it.\"   \"Every day gets better for us\" was part of a quote Schumer gave to the politics site Punchbowl News in an Oct. 9 article about the shutdown. He continued: \"It's because we've thought about this long in advance and we knew that health care would be the focal point on Sept. 30 and we prepared for it â¦ Their whole theory was â threaten us, bamboozle us, and we would submit in a day or two.\"   \n   However, the original story only included the text of Schumer's statement, not video or audio.   \n   An NRSC press release announcing the ad describes it as \"visualizing\" Schumer's comment and says it was \"created in-part using artificial intelligence software and includes an AI disclaimer.\"   The fake footage of Schumer includes a small transparent watermark of the NRSC logo and the words \"AI GENERATED\" in the bottom right-hand corner. On YouTube, the video carries an additional \"Altered or synthetic content\" label saying \"Sound or visuals were significantly edited or digitally generated.\"   \"These are Chuck Schumer's own words,\" NRSC Communications Director Joanna Rodriguez said in an email to NPR. \"We know Schumer wishes people didn't know he said this, but he did, and this video is a way for voters to see and hear how proud he is of his shutdown.\"   Schumer's office did not respond to a request for comment.   Even though the quote was something Schumer did in fact say, the use of AI to invent fake video footage crosses a line, said Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley who studies manipulated media.   \n   \"If they wanted to use the quote then they could have shown an image of Schumer and overlaid the quote, as is often done. It cannot reasonably be argued that creating a deepfake of Senator Schumer is the same thing,\" he said.   In addition, Farid said that the disclaimer on the lower right corner of the video \"is not a particularly clear or obvious disclosure, particularly when most users are doom scrolling through their social media posts.\"   The NRSC video was also criticized by journalists and other commenters on social media, including reporters at right-leaning publications.   \n   \"The Schumer bit is AI generated video â which is disclosed at bottom right corner â but we are at the doorstep of a terrifying new world,\" Jon Levine, a political reporter at the Washington Free Beacon, wrote on X.   \"NRSC has increasingly leaned into AI for its ads, but this is the first time I've seen them go so far as to use it for a fake video of an opponent. This is a slippery slope, even w/the tiny AI disclosure in the corner,\" Ramsey Touchberry, a congressional reporter at the Washington Examiner, posted on X.   Amid the criticism, the NRSC's Rodriguez wrote on her own X account: \"AI is here and not going anywhere. Adapt & win or pearl clutch & lose.\"   It's not the first time Republicans have used AI to impersonate Schumer and other Democrats. On the eve of the shutdown, President Trump posted on Truth Social an apparently AI-generated, profanity-laced video fabricating Schumer saying \"nobody likes Democrats anymore.\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is also shown in the video wearing a cartoonish sombrero and mustache.   But unlike the NRSC's video of Schumer, earlier examples were easy to spot as inauthentic.   \n   Farid warned that the growing prevalence of AI fakes in politics could have a corrosive effect.   \"While I don't think our leaders should be posting deceptive deepfakes, they also run the risk that when they post real content, there will be good reason for the public to question its authenticity,\" he said.\n",

Tim Kaine, D-Va., is leading a bipartisan effort to force a vote to stop President Trump from unilaterally declaring war on the South American nation.   Kaine, a longtime proponent of Congress' powers to declare war, filed the resolution late Thursday, a move that will force the Senate to take up the legislation after a 10-day waiting period. Sens. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Rand Paul, R-Ky., co-sponsored the plan.    Kaine said concerns about war in the Latin American region are growing.   \n   \"The pace of the announcements, the authorization of covert activities and the military planning makes me think there's some chance this could be imminent,\" Kaine told reporters.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., speaks to reporters outside the Senate chamber on Oct. 1.  Kaine is hoping to prevent President Trump from unilaterally waging war on Venezuela without approval from Congress.\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   This week, Trump said the U.S. had conducted another military strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean and announced that he had authorized CIA operations in Venezuela. He also said he was considering land operations in the country.     \"We've almost totally stopped it by sea. Now we'll stop it by land,\" Trump said from the Oval Office on Wednesday about alleged drug smuggling.    Last week, Kaine and Schiff forced a Senate vote to limit Trump's war powers in the Caribbean. While that vote failed 48-51, two Republicans, Paul and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, joined Democrats in support.   Paul has been a vocal critic of the new military strikes, saying they set a precedent for the U.S. to shoot first without asking questions.   \"The American people do not want to be dragged into endless war with Venezuela without public debate or a vote,\" Paul said in a statement. \"We ought to defend what the Constitution demands: deliberation before war.\"   Kaine, Paul and Schiff are hoping more Republican members will vote in favor of the new limits. Several Republicans have voted for other war powers and use of military force resolutions led by Kaine in the past.   \n   \"I think it's probably 10 or so [Republicans] who voted yes on at least one of them,\" he said. \"So we'll start to work that.\"   It remains unclear whether there are enough Republican votes for the measure to succeed.    Kaine said Congress continues to face a \"black hole\" of information related to action against Venezuela. Lawmakers say the administration still has not shared evidence to justify the boat strikes, which Kaine and others believe are illegal and unconstitutional.   Since September, Trump has ordered at least five U.S. military strikes on boats that the administration has claimed were smuggling illegal drugs. So far, at least 27 people have been reported killed, but their identities have yet to be shared.\n",

Trump made the announcement in a post on Truth Social on Friday, saying he had signed a commutation to release Santos from prison immediately.   \"George Santos was somewhat of a 'rogue,' but there are many rogues throughout our Country that aren't forced to serve seven years in prison,\" Trump wrote.   \n   Santos, a fierce supporter of Trump, pleaded guilty in 2024 to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Prosecutors said Santos was responsible for a \"mountain of lies, theft, and fraud\" aimed at enriching himself and deceiving campaign donors. He began his sentence in July of this year at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fairton, New Jersey.   Soon after Santos was elected in 2020, reports that he had fabricated numerous aspects of his identity began to trickle out. He later admitted to lying about his education, employment and his upbringing. Santos was still sworn into Congress in 2022 despite the inconsistencies raised about his background and campaign finances.   His falsehoods would catch up with him less than a year after his term began. In 2023, the House voted 311-114 to remove him from office. Almost every Democrat and more than 100 Republicans voted to expel Santos.   The vote made Santos just the sixth representative to ever be expelled from the chamber but the first to be expelled without being convicted of a crime. At the time of his expulsion, Santos was facing 23 criminal charges.   Trump compared Santos' crimes to claims made by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., more than 15 years ago about his military service. Blumenthal has previously admitted that he \"misspoke\" about serving in Vietnam. Blumenthal served six years in the Marine Reserve beginning in 1970, but none of that time was spent overseas.   \n   \"This is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\" Trump wrote.   So far during his second term, Trump has issued a slew of high-profile pardons and commutations. He issued a blanket pardon of more than 1,500 people charged with acts related to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich also received a pardon after he was convicted on a series of corruption-related crimes, including trying to sell a U.S. Senate seat vacated by former President Barack Obama. Trump commuted Blagojevich's 14-year prison sentence during his first term.\n",

    "body": "\n      All three candidates in New York City's mayoral race faced off Thursday night in their first general election debate, sparring over crime, affordable housing and Israel.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  New York City voters are soon to choose a new mayor. Three candidates debated last night, including the leaders, state lawmaker Zohran Mamdani and former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Their exchanges included this.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ANDREW CUOMO: He literally has never had a job. On his resume, it says he interned for his mother. This is not a job for a first-timer.ZOHRAN MAMDANI: What I don't have in experience, I make up for in integrity. And what you don't have in integrity, you could never make up for in experience.INSKEEP: NPR's Brian Mann was watching. Brian, good morning.BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve.INSKEEP: Reporter with integrity and experience, we'll just note.MANN: (Laughter).INSKEEP: What was the backdrop for that exchange?MANN: Well, the Democratic Party's huge generation gap was on full display, Steve. Mamdani, of course, the rising star, the newcomer. And he's led this race by double digits. Cuomo, who's 67, is running as an independent. He lost the Democratic primary. Of course, he resigned in scandal in 2021. Now he's trying to stage this comeback. These guys don't like each other, and things got fierce last night.INSKEEP: This has gotten a lot of national attention. Leila has interviewed Mamdani on this program. People are closely following this. He's a star on Fox News, we should note. And one of many things they talked about was the Israel-Hamas war. Why is that a big deal in a mayor's race?MANN: Yeah, well, New York is home to the largest Jewish community outside Israel. And Mamdani, who's Muslim, has been outspoken, calling for Palestinian rights, criticizing Israel's war in Gaza. This was one of Cuomo's lines of attack. Here he is speaking to Mamdani.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CUOMO: There are a lot of Jewish New Yorkers who support me because they think you're antisemitic.MANN: And here's Mamdani firing back.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MAMDANI: I have denounced Hamas again and again. And it will never be enough for Andrew Cuomo because what he is willing to say, even though not on this stage, is to call me, the first Muslim on the precipice of leading this city, a terrorist sympathizer.MANN: And Mamdani has been doing a lot of outreach to Jewish leaders in the city. He's won some key endorsements. So far, Steve, this tension hasn't seemed to slow his momentum.INSKEEP: And Donald Trump also was a big figure in this, a former New Yorker.MANN: Yeah, he's a big player in this. He's intervened in the city's politics repeatedly since returning to office, threatening to cancel major federal projects, including that $16 billion Hudson River tunnel. He's blasted Mamdani on social media, describing him falsely as a communist. And actually, one of Mamdani's attack lines against Cuomo last night was his claim that the former governor is too friendly with Trump. Cuomo responded by saying he would try to avoid battles with Trump.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CUOMO: I'd like to work with you. I think we can do good things together. But I will fight you every step of the way if you try to hurt New York.MANN: One interesting thing, Steve. All three of these candidates last night, including the Republican, Curtis Sliwa, opposed two of Trump's big policies. They called on ICE agents to stop arresting migrants who don't have criminal records. And they agreed there's no need for National Guard troops on the streets of New York City.INSKEEP: How big a factor was that third candidate, Curtis Sliwa, the Republican?MANN: Yeah, Sliwa was a big deal last night for one reason. His presence on that stage made it harder for Cuomo to stay dialed in on Mamdani. Sliwa kept attacking Cuomo.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CURTIS SLIWA: You think you're the toughest guy alive. You lost your own primary, right? You were rejected by your Democrats.MANN: And again, Cuomo faced a lot of criticism last night over that sexual misconduct scandal that forced him to resign. He again denied any wrongdoing.INSKEEP: Big debate last night. Just over two weeks ago. NPR's Brian Mann is following it all. Brian, thanks so much.MANN: Thank you, Steve.(SOUNDBITE OF GREG FOAT'S \"SNAKE PLANT SHUFFLE\")\n    Copyright Â© 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

He worries about inflated prices and is concerned about their family's financial future.\n                \n                    Kirsten Luce for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kirsten Luce for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Andrew Tait has a long workday. He bookends shifts as a warehouse supervisor for a nearby factory with early morning and late night chores on his family's small farm in rural Shenandoah Valley, Virginia.   He's quick to call himself lucky. But no matter how much the 36-year-old father of two young girls works, he says they barely scrape by â and the goalposts for success keep moving.   \"I have a mortgage, and it's paid every month. But the thought of my children's birthdays or holidays terrifies me,\" Tait said. \"What if the grocery bill goes up again? I mean, I'm on a shoestring.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Tait, his partner Hannah Coogan and their two daughters walk past sheep on their farm.\n                \n                    Kirsten Luce\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kirsten Luce\n    \n\n   \n   He's among a generation of young Americans confronting a daunting reality: one of inflated prices and growing concerns about their financial futures. It's an experience facing Gen Z and millennial voters throughout the U.S., each in their own unique ways. For those living in rural communities and small towns, it's left many feeling as if their hardships have gone unseen and unaddressed by politicians vying for their support.   \n   Over the summer, Tait decided to write an essay titled \"Living in the Shadow of the American Dream.\" In it, he shared that he and his partner have put off getting married because he worries that if they did, it would force her and their daughters off Medicaid, and his job's healthcare plan is too expensive for the whole family to afford.   \"I'm not ashamed of our life. It's honest work, and it's full of love,\" Tait wrote. \"However, I am ashamed that in a country as wealthy as ours, people like us are left out in the cold.\"   By the next presidential election, Gen Z and millennials are projected to make up more than half of the electorate. But many, including Tait, say they've grown dissatisfied with political leaders as they wrestle longstanding financial concerns.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Tait prepares to feed the family's sheep, one of several daily tasks he completes around the farm. He says he constantly worries about keeping his family afloat, and wants to one day \"not just survive, but prosper.\"\n                \n                    Kirsten Luce for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kirsten Luce for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"I'm really just tired of voting for who I hate least,\" said Tait, who declined to specify how he voted in the 2024 presidential election, but said politicians should focus on improving access to quality food, healthcare and education.   \"I want somebody to inspire me,\" he added. \"It doesn't matter if you're red or blue, whatever side of the aisle you're on, like, come on, guys, what do we want?\"   \n   It's a common feeling for many young people today, and partially why President Trump's economic message may have resonated with a greater share of young voters last year, says Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist University Institute for Public Opinion.   \"He's making connections with people who are very dissatisfied with the way things are. And therefore, being a candidate who's going to disrupt and change things is a major attraction for a hunk of the electorate that is feeling that economic stress,\" he said. \"That's perhaps most profound with younger people.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Tait collects eggs every day from the chickens, which help supplement the family's groceries.\n                \n                    Kirsten Luce for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kirsten Luce for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   But those economic pressures aren't new to many in rural areas, says Nicholas Jacobs, a professor of government at Colby College. These communities have faced such issues for decades, though now, he argues, the difference is that the politics have changed.   \n   \"What I believe to be true from my surveying of rural populations and young people in rural areas is they don't feel like they have two alternatives. They do not feel like the Democratic Party gives them a set of answers to those problems,\" he said. \"I don't think most rural people feel like the Democratic Party even thinks about these problems.\"   Doubting the American Dream   After growing up during periods of financial volatility and uncertainty, economic concerns have continued to loom large for Gen Z and millennial Americans.   Younger people collectively make up more than 60% of the labor force and are poised to surpass older generations in educational attainment.   However, many still worry about having successful lives. Seven in 10 Gen Zers say jobs are difficult to find right now, along with nearly 6 in 10 millennials, according to a Marist poll from April. An analysis from Pew Research Center last year also found that both generations are less likely to say the American dream is still possible, compared to the generations before them.   \n   Housing is a major worry, with home and rental prices increasing at a faster rate than wages over the last two decades. The median age of a first-time homebuyer has also drastically increased, going from 28 in 1991 to 38 last year, according to the National Association of Realtors.   This combination of concerns has pushed some young Americans toward more left-leaning, populist ideas and caused others to feel unsatisfied by today's political leaders.   \"I don't really think that there's any one person who really is addressing it,\" said Paul Staley, 35, who lives in a small town outside Birmingham, Alabama with his wife and kids.   He's one of more than a thousand young people who responded to an NPR callout about how economic concerns have shaped their lives.   Staley works as a field service engineer fixing medical equipment.  Raised in a blue-collar household, he can see clear differences between his life and that of his father.   \"He could afford a brand new Corvette as a butcher, but these days, me with a college degree and 10 years of experience, I couldn't hope to really afford a brand new car like that,\" he said. \"The difference is too great. You don't have that same type of opportunity.\"   Staley previously voted for Trump but says he has since gravitated more towards the political center, acknowledging that while he remains interested in the president's economic agenda and did benefit from his tax cut policy, he wants to see additional action on things like rising costs and worker protections.   Those two issues in particular have drawn him more recently to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Zohran Mamdani, the Democrats' nominee for mayor in New York.   \n   \"These issues are pushing people to their ideological â I don't want to say extremes â but to the end of the political spectrum â¦ I think the answer lies more somewhere in the middle,\" he said. \"Hard work needs to mean more.\"   Feeling left behindÂ    For others, what matters is opportunities, rather than politics.   Julie Hill, 22, lives in rural northwest Pennsylvania. She says politicians often overlook communities like hers.   \"It can be hard to kind of feel like we're being seen,\" said Hill, who identifies as an independent but voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris last year. \"It seems like rural areas get left behind sometimes.\"   \n   Hill is unemployed, currently part of an outpatient rehab program as she deals with mental health challenges, and she's also had to support herself financially after losing family in recent years.   Her dream is to own a home one day, with enough land to raise animals. She loves horses and is still pained by the memory of having to give up her own horse as a teenager when finances got tight.   \n   That said, Hill admits that homeownership is far away for her, recalling that all the homeowners she knows either inherited land or bought decades earlier when prices were lower.   \"They kind of had that support upfront. They had a place to kind of start out, I guess, whereas I'm starting from complete scratch,\" she said. \"It seems like even just an acre around here is as much as a house was like probably 30, 40 years ago.\"   Hill wants to have hope that her American dream can become a reality, but says it doesn't feel possible right now.   \"The story of Sisyphus and the rock, that's kind of what it feels like. You're just pushing that rock up every day just to have it roll back down again,\" she said. \"I've felt like that for a long time, so be nice to be able to get the rock up top and then be able to start building.\"\n",

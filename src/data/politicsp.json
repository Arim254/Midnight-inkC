I think we can get it done.\"\n                \n                    Heather Diehl/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Heather Diehl/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The Department of Homeland Security, which houses agencies focused on immigration, disaster response and cybersecurity, is on track to shut down Saturday as lawmakers leave town without a funding agreement or a deal that Democrats hope will rein in the conduct of federal immigration officers.   After two U.S. citizens were shot dead by immigration officers in Minneapolis, Democrats laid out 10 demands to restrict agents' aggressive tactics as a condition for funding DHS. Democrats produced proposed legislative text over the weekend, and the White House responded with a counteroffer Wednesday night, though lawmakers declined to detail its contents.   \n   Senate Democrats blocked two Republican-backed measures Thursday to keep the department open, including a short-term funding extension for two weeks as negotiations continue.   \"Today's strong vote was a shot across the bow to Republicans,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. \"Democrats will not support a blank check for chaos. This vote today asked a simple question: Will you rein in ICE's abuses or will you vote to extend the chaos. Republicans chose chaos. The Democrats, we refused.\"   House and Senate Republican leadership declined to cancel the upcoming weeklong recess. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said lawmakers have been told to be ready to return if a deal is reached, though he indicated that would be unlikely.   \"I just think at the moment we're not close,\" Thune told reporters.   Democrats and Republicans have already started trading blame for the failure to avert a shutdown. Republicans say Democrats were slow to make an initial offer and then balked at anything short of their full slate of demands. Democrats accuse the White House of delivering a counterproposal that was \"insufficient and incomplete.\"   But leaders in both parties have still signaled they think a deal is possible.   \"That deal space is there,\" Thune said. \"I think this can get done.\"   \n   Immigration enforcement will continue while other programs pause   The shutdown is likely to have minimal impact on pay for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers and funding for their enforcement operations since both agencies received an infusion of cash from Congress last summer. During the government shutdown last fall, officers and agents conducting arrests continued to do so and also continued to be paid.   According to DHS's contingency plan, last updated in September, 22,862 agency workers not in ICE or CBP could be furloughed, meaning they would not work and not be paid until the end of the shut down. Other workers may be instructed to continue working but without pay, and there could be pauses to other programs.   The leadership of ICE, CBP and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services told lawmakers this week that a shut down would have minimal impact on their employees. Still, some programs could be on hold.   For example, during the 43-day shutdown in the fall, the Office of Detention Oversight, which investigates immigration detention conditions and deaths, was not working.   USCIS Director Joseph Edlow reminded House lawmakers that his agency is funded primarily by the fees people pay when they submit various forms and applications, so his employees would still get paid.   ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons said the shutdown could affect DHS's work on transnational crime, but he did not note any impact to immigration operations. And CBP Commissioner Rodney Scott also didn't detail how the shutdown would affect personnel, just saying: \"I agree America becomes less safe.\"   Shutdown impacts will likely be limited   Republican lawmakers have warned that the shutdown could affect DHS agencies like the Transportation Security Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.   \"By not allowing us time to continue these conversations, real people are paying the price,\" Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., who chairs the appropriations subcommittee on homeland security.   \n   But most Americans may not feel severe impacts of the partial shutdown unless it is prolonged.   FEMA has millions of dollars on hand to continue responding to emergencies during the shutdown. FEMA Associate Administrator Gregg Phillips told Congress Wednesday that the fund \"has sufficient balances to continue emergency response activities for the foreseeable future.\" If the shutdown lasts several weeks, paychecks in March could be paused.   During the previous shutdown, DHS tapped into funding authorized by Congress last summer to continue paying active-duty Coast Guard and U.S. Secret Service members. Those funds could be made available again to stave off shutdown effects.   TSA agents are not expected to miss a paycheck until mid-March.   \"I am hopeful that these discussions will continue,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., Britt's Democratic counterpart in charge of homeland security funding. \"But frankly we had plenty of time to get a deal in the last two weeks. We want to fund the Department of Homeland Security, but only a department that is obeying the law.\"   This will be the third shutdown in a matter of months. Last fall, the entire federal government shut down for a record-long 43 days as Democrats tried and ultimately failed to extend expiring health insurance subsidies.   Funding briefly lapsed for part of the government earlier this month as Democrats withheld their votes for funding DHS through September as they tried to extract policy changes after the second deadly shooting in Minneapolis.

That allows more immigration detentions to occur at jails rather than in operations on the street.  He also said local law enforcement agencies are responding more quickly and consistently to protests.    \n   \"This surge operation and our work here with state and local officials to improve coordination and achieve mutual goals, as well as our efforts to address issues of concern here on the ground, have yielded the successful results we have came here for,\" Homan said. \"We are leaving Minnesota safer.\"    Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who from the outset fiercely opposed the Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation, declared victory.    \"They thought they could break us, but a love for our neighbors and a resolve to endure can outlast an occupation,\" Frey posted on X.  \"These patriots of Minneapolis are showing that it's not just about resistance — standing with our neighbors is deeply American.\"   Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said the state can now move forward.   \"The long road to recovery starts now,\" Walz posted on X after Homan's news conference. \"The impact on our economy, our schools, and people's lives won't be reversed overnight. That work starts today.\"   In a news conference Thursday morning, Walz acknowledged it will take time for many Minnesota residents to feel safe enough to leave their homes without fear of apprehension by federal immigration agents.    \"It's going to be a long road,\" he said. \"Our sense of normalcy was shook to the core. The trauma that's been inflicted, certainly across an immigrant community, but to every single Minnesotan, is unlike anything we've witnessed.\"   \n   Walz said nothing has changed about the way Minnesota is addressing immigration enforcement. The state supports targeted enforcement, he said. When asked what has changed, Walz said border czar Tom Homan's arrival in Minnesota last week kicked off conversations with state and local officials.   Walz criticized other Trump administration officials, including Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol commander who previously led operations on the ground in Minnesota, saying they had not engaged in talks — a move Walz characterized as \"arrogance.\"     Walz also said Homan's earlier remark that the two leaders disagree on a lot of things was \"an understatement.\"   The governor's take on today's announcement is that the Trump administration knew it needed to withdraw federal agents, particularly after the killings of Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti, \"but in very Trumpian fashion, they needed to save face,\" Walz said.   In January, federal immigration agents shot and killed Pretti and Macklin Good, two U.S. citizens. The Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division is investigating Pretti's death but not the killing of Macklin Good.   Homan notably did not mention the names of Pretti or Macklin Good during Thursday's news conference.   \"I don't want to see any more bloodshed,\" he said. \"I pray every night for the safety of our law enforcement personnel and the safety of those in the community, whether you're here legally or illegally. I don't want to see anybody harmed. If you break the law, we're going to arrest you.\"   Earlier this week, Walz suggested the end of the crackdown was imminent, following recent talks with White House officials.   On Feb. 4, Homan announced plans to withdraw 700 of the roughly 3,000 agents sent to Minnesota. Further reductions, he said then, would be contingent on more cooperation from local officials. That  included giving federal officials greater access to local jails to pick up undocumented people set to be released. In Thursday's briefing, Homan said those agreements have been strengthened.   \n   \"Under President Trump's direction, we have obtained an unprecedented level of coordination with law enforcement officials that is focused on promoting public safety across the entire state,\" he said. \"While I don't agree with Gov. Walz and Attorney General [Keith] Ellison on everything, I appreciate the support the governor gives the state agencies, who coordinate with us in a manner intended to promote public safety. And I appreciate the AG having an open dialogue with me.\"   Homan said a \"small footprint of personnel\" will remain to close out the operation and \"transition full command and control back to the field office.\" Homan will remain in Minneapolis to oversee the drawdown.    During his briefing Thursday, Homan spent several minutes defending the work of ICE agents and touting thousands of arrests of undocumented people he called criminals.  He reported a \"notable decrease\" in activity from what he called unlawful agitators.\n",

    "body": "\n      Attorney General Pam Bondi clashed with Democratic lawmakers who questioned her about the Epstein files and the weaponization of the Justice Department at an oversight hearing Wednesday.   \n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  Attorney General Pam Bondi's appearance before Congress on Wednesday turned into a shouting match with lawmakers.STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  The hearing, in theory, was going to focus on oversight of the Justice Department. Instead, Bondi insulted lawmakers and ducked questions about documents relating to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In a moment, we'll speak with one of the Democratic lawmakers, Pramila Jayapal. First, we get the facts.MARTÍNEZ: NPR's Carrie Johnson followed the hearing. Carrie, I mean, even for Congress, this one was a doozy.CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Definitely not business as usual. There was a lot of hostility. Pam Bondi came into this House judiciary hearing prepared to attack Democrats on the panel when they tried to ask her about the messy rollout of the Epstein files and other controversies at the Justice Department. Congressman Jerry Nadler, a Democrat from New York, he wanted to know whether anyone else who worked with Jeffrey Epstein would be prosecuted. Here's a taste of how that went.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PAM BONDI: I find it...JERRY NADLER: How many have you indicted?BONDI: Excuse me. I'm going to answer the question.NADLER: Answer my question.BONDI: No. I'm going to answer the question the way I want to answer the question.NADLER: No.BONDI: Your theatrics are ridiculous.NADLER: You're going to answer the question the way I asked it.BONDI: Chairman...JOHNSON: The congressman never got an answer about whether anyone else might be under investigation. And the attorney general called other lawmakers on the panel washed-up and bad lawyers, and on it went for hours.MARTÍNEZ: Yeah, it sure did. Several Epstein survivors, though, who had been trafficked by him were in the hearing room. Did the attorney general react to them or acknowledge them in any way?JOHNSON: At one point, Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington asked Pam Bondi to turn around and apologize to some of the victims in the room for how they were treated by the Justice Department. In its release of some 3 million pages, some of those people's identities and nude images appeared in public on the DOJ website. Bondi responded by accusing the congresswoman who asked the question of engaging in gutter politics, and she also defended her record in law enforcement.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BONDI: I have spent my entire career fighting for victims, and I will continue to do so. I am deeply sorry for what any victim - any victim - has been through, especially as a result of that monster.MARTÍNEZ: All right. What about Republicans on the panel when they had their chance to interact with the attorney general?JOHNSON: They asked Pam Bondi about the enormous drop in violent crime across the country. They praised the Trump administration for tough immigration enforcement, and they gave her some time to respond to some of the harsher questions from Democrats. The only Republican on the panel who pushed back on the attorney general is Thomas Massie of Kentucky. He sponsored that law to release the Epstein files, and he says the DOJ effort has been a massive failure because it seems like prosecutors continue to black out the names of men who behaved badly. Massie told the AG this is a cover-up that spans decades, and she's responsible for part of it.MARTÍNEZ: You know, the DOJ is really at the center of so many different controversies, including a lot of efforts to prosecute President Trump's political foes. I'm wondering if that came up at all in the hearing.JOHNSON: It really did. Congressman Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, he sees a pattern here. Here's Raskin at the hearing.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JAMIE RASKIN: You've turned the people's Department of Justice into Trump's instrument of revenge. Trump orders up prosecutions like pizza, and you deliver every time.JOHNSON: Remember, just this week, prosecutors tried and failed to get a grand jury to indict Democratic lawmakers who made a video telling American service members to follow their oaths and the law. DOJ has also brought cases against the former FBI director Jim Comey and New York Attorney General Tish James. Both those cases have been dismissed, but DOJ continues to investigate Trump's perceived political foes.MARTÍNEZ: That's NPR's Carrie Johnson. Carrie, thanks.JOHNSON: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Of those, 18 are closed and 19 are still pending or referred for further investigation, he said. Lyons did not say whether any investigations have resulted in terminations.   The investigations affect a tiny fraction of an ICE workforce. DHS has said they have been successful in nearly doubling their ranks in recent months to 22,000 people, not all of whom conduct arrests.   \n   Lyons' comments come after immigration officers shot and killed two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis last month, intensifying questions about immigration officers' tactics, training and use of force. It also raised further questions about the integrity of the department's internal oversight mechanisms.   Lyons shared the details about investigations during a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing on Thursday featuring top immigration enforcement officials. GOP Sen. Rand Paul, Ky., called the hearing after federal immigration officers in Minneapolis killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti, a U.S. citizen.   The Department of Homeland Security rarely shares information about its internal misconduct investigations, though several have come to light in recent months.   \n   For example, ICE briefly put on administrative leave Victor Mojica in New York, who roughly pushed a woman in an immigration court hallway. Also put on administrative leave were Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who shot U.S. citizen Renee Macklin Good, two Border Patrol agents involved in Pretti's shooting, and Border Patrol agent Charles Exum, who shot at U.S. citizen Mariamar Martinez.   Lyons' comments on investigations only concerned ICE; it is unclear how many Customs and Border Protection officers are under review for misconduct; lawmakers at the hearing didn't ask the commissioner of CBP, Rodney Scott, about his agency's investigations.   \n   Questions about training   Some of the agents involved in the recent incidents had been with their agencies for several years. But critics of surging enforcement have also raised concerns about the training provided for 12,000 new ICE employees.   In response to questions on the training timeline from Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., on Thursday, Lyons said the curriculum at the federal law enforcement training center in Georgia was truncated from 75 days to 42 days for new recruits – and that there was instead a longer time for \"on-the-job training. He said that after the academy, agents get \"real-world training like when [a] local police officer comes out of the academy.\"   Lyons said it was possible that a new recruit could go from having never held a weapon to being on the ground in a state like Minnesota after those 42 days of training.   \n   He had previously said that those who are former law enforcement officers and special agents attended a shorter training module at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Georgia, focused on just topics like the Immigration and Nationality Act. It's unclear how long that would be.   \"I am glad you're doing investigations, to be clear — but the fact that there are consistent mishandling of weapons, use of escalation of force that is above what is necessary, and there have not been any command decisions about how to fix — this is concerning,\" Gallego said in response to Lyons' comments.   \n   Questions about internal oversight   Critics of the administration, and former ICE personnel, have told NPR they worry the lack of transparency about DHS's disciplinary practices is further eroding trust in federal law enforcement.   The Department of Homeland Security has cut jobs in the oversight divisions focused on civil rights, as part of a broader reduction in force across the federal government. That includes jobs in the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, which could be involved in any investigation into fatal incidents.   \n   The administration has been quick to defend officers after violent incidents become public.   \n   Initially, for example, Trump administration officials labeled Good and Pretti as \"domestic terrorists,\" after they were shot by immigration officers.   A preliminary government review later contradicted the Trump administration's initial narrative about Pretti's shooting, as did multiple bystander videos and witness testimony.   DHS officials testifying in Congress notably declined to back up those early assertions from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, among others.   \"Any comments made publicly, privately, text, Instagram, is going to put a bias on the investigation,\" Lyons said on Thursday.\n",

NPR observed two online focus groups on Tuesday night, with 14 voters from Arizona who supported Joe Biden in 2020 and then swung to Trump in 2024. Four voters identified themselves as Democrats, three as Republicans and seven as independents.   Twelve of the 14 participants said they felt Immigration and Customs Enforcement \"has gone too far\" in carrying out its operations. And nine participants said they know someone who has changed their daily life out of concern for a possible interaction with ICE. Some said ICE's presence in the border state had begun to directly affect them, as well.   \n   Reflecting on recent immigration enforcement in Minneapolis, where two U.S. citizens have been fatally shot by federal agents, various focus group participants described ICE actions as \"aggressive,\" \"out of control\" and said they worried the country was becoming a \"police state.\"   Rich Thau, who moderated the focus groups, said the economy remains a top concern for these swing voters, but immigration has become \"a more pressing and more urgent concern.\"   \"They want ICE to protect them, but they don't want ICE to be doing it the way they're doing it now,\" he said, \"which is way too present in their lives, way too present in their family and friends' lives.\"   The focus groups were part of the Swing Voter Project conducted by Thau's Engagious and market research firm Sago. NPR is a partner on the project.   \n   \"People shouldn't have to live like that\"   While focus groups don't provide statistically significant results like a poll does, the participants' reflections match survey data, as immigration has become a growing liability for Trump.   Esmerita S. — who identifies as a Democrat — said she was born and raised in the United States and is Hispanic. She said an ICE detention center was built close by, which has made her nervous to walk around. (Participants agreed to be part of the focus groups on condition that they be identified by their first names and last initials only.)   \n   \"I don't want to go to Starbucks just down the street from there because I'm like, 'What if they're there and I look like I'm Hispanic?' \" she said. \"That's scary. People shouldn't have to live like that.\"   Carolyn B. — also a Democrat — said ICE agents were recently in her neighborhood intimidating older residents.   \"They were going door to door knocking, asking the people — and I live in a 55, an older community — and they were trying to find Asian people so that they could deport them,\" she said. \"The show of force and power. And they don't follow any rules and they do whatever they want. It's just too much.\"   Stephanie O., an independent voter originally from Nigeria, said she's observed members of her community wrongfully detained, and it's made her worry about ending up in the same situation.   \"And so it's like you have to almost carry your passports just in case I look like someone who is here illegally,\" she said.   \n   While many of the focus group participants said overall they support Trump's efforts to decrease illegal immigration in the country, they have serious worries about how that work is being done.   \"It just escalates a situation where if [federal agents] came in in proper attire and acted properly, I think a lot of people are tired of the immigration problem and would be OK with it,\" said Nancy P., an independent voter. \"It's just the whole way they're doing it.\"   Support for ICE — but with reforms   The voters expressed support for a range of proposed immigration enforcement reforms currently before Congress. Many of these reforms are backed primarily by Democrats.   Requiring independent investigations after incidents take place and requiring that agents wear body cameras had unanimous support among focus group participants. Prohibiting the use of face coverings was among the least popular proposals.   \n   No one supported abolishing ICE altogether.   \n   \"You can't have a country without borders, and someone needs to enforce that,\" said Scott G., a self-described independent.   Thau said the lesson Republicans should draw from these conversations is that they need to \"rein in\" ICE. However, Democrats, he said, should be wary of embracing calls to eliminate the agency altogether — a stance the party has not embraced.   Economic anxiety, and other takeaways   Most voters said they have more anxiety about the economy now, as compared with a year ago. While several people mentioned Trump's tariffs as worsening the cost of living and layoffs across different sectors, others were reluctant to blame the president for the economy.   Most voters said they disapprove of Trump's job performance.   Democrats, though, weren't popular, with respondents using words like \"disjointed\" and \"disappointing\" to describe the party.\n",

    "body": "\n      Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., offers her assessment of Attorney General Pam Bondi's testimony before the House Judiciary Committee.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Elsewhere in today's program, we hear from Republican lawmaker Nancy Mace, who had a look at the unredacted Epstein files yesterday. Mace described going into a room at the Justice Department where it appeared the administration monitored her searches on a computer.NANCY MACE: There is a tech person who logs you into the computer. They log you into the computer because they're giving you your own identification. They are tracking all of the documents that members of Congress open, and they're tracking everything that you do in that room.INSKEEP: This description of Justice Department surveillance becomes all the more interesting when you see an image from yesterday's congressional hearing. A Reuters photographer captured Attorney General Pam Bondi holding a document labeled, quote, \"Jayapal Pramila search history\" - last name first there. The document had a list of what appeared to be individual Epstein file searches. She had it in hand while sidestepping questions from Representative Pramila Jayapal, who is our next guest. Good morning.PRAMILA JAYAPAL: Good morning.INSKEEP: What are your thoughts about that paper with your search history in the attorney general's hand?JAYAPAL: Well, I think it's completely against the separation of powers. We are supposed to be able to, as lawmakers, go in, review the files, take whatever we want from there, not be surveilled and spied on by the Department of Justice. And it's - that was my search history. It was much more extensive than that, but that was the first page. And she clearly came in prepared with that information. In fact, I think she probably opened it up to us on Monday, two days before the hearing, so she could see what we were going to search and ask her about. Totally unacceptable. And we've asked for, immediately, a change in the process so that the DOJ is not spying on us.INSKEEP: House Speaker Mike Johnson was asked about this. He said, I know nothing about it. Not going to comment on it. But if it happened, it's inappropriate. Are you getting any support from Republicans on that?JAYAPAL: Yeah. I actually spoke to Mike last night about this, and I do think that there is bipartisan agreement that we should be able to review those files without the Department of Justice surveilling us. And that's exactly what she was doing, and I think she was doing it in preparation for the hearing. But also, I think they want to know what we're going to - what we're pulling up so that they can use it in some way. That was in her Burn Book. That's what we call that binder with all the opposition research against us that she kept trying to insult different members of Congress with. And I think that she - you know, I think there is bipartisan support to say this cannot continue to happen, and we need a whole new process for how we review these files and who tracks, you know, any of this.INSKEEP: Just so I understand - and he'll speak for himself - but did you understand Speaker Johnson to be on board with taking some kind of action here?JAYAPAL: Well, I think I'll just - I won't say what he said to me, but I'll just say what he said in the public quote. And I showed him and told him exactly what had happened and that the search was my search, and it clearly was surveilling.INSKEEP: Now, you raised in the hearing the failure to redact the names of victims and then the redaction of other people who are in the files, one of them a man named Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem. As far as I could tell, you didn't get an answer about that particular case, but you brought it up in any case. What draws that particular redaction to your attention?JAYAPAL: Well, the point I was trying to make is that the Transparency Act that we passed in Congress specifically said you have to redact the private information of survivors and you have to not redact the private information, the personal information of any potential predators or co-conspirators. And that's clearly what that email indicated, is that there was a powerful person who was being protected. He happened to - as I mentioned in my remarks, he happened to also be somebody with financial ties to Donald Trump and personal ties to Steve Bannon. And so I wanted to get her answer about why she was violating - allowing the violation of the law in both these instances, the nonredaction of that personal information of survivors and then the redaction of powerful people that she seemed to be protecting. She didn't want to answer that question.The most important thing to me was getting her to turn around to the survivors and apologize to them because the harm is irreparable. That information is out there now. Nude photographs are out there. Even if the Department of Justice redacts that, that does not bring justice to the survivors. And, you know, it was just stunning to me that she refused to turn to them and take responsibility for what her Department of Justice had done to re-traumatize these survivors.INSKEEP: In the absence of an answer from the Justice Department, I want to understand what you suppose happened here, what you suspect or surmise happened here. Are you saying that you think Justice Department lawyers or somebody else went through the Epstein files looking for names that might be sensitive for the president and tried to redact them?JAYAPAL: Yes. I am absolutely saying that because it - there were too many instances where you saw that happen. It was a pattern of redactions. And on the other side, it was a pattern of not redacting victims' names that I think was meant to intimidate survivors who did try to come forward, because there was a list of 32 survivors. You could have said that that was a mistake - that everything was not redacted - except that there was one name on that list that was redacted. And the title of the email was Epstein Survivors - Victims List. Epstein Victims List.INSKEEP: So somebody clearly got a look at that. It's not like they didn't...JAYAPAL: That's right.INSKEEP: ...Look at the document.JAYAPAL: Exactly.INSKEEP: I want to put you in conversation in a sense with Nancy Mace, who we heard from elsewhere. She clearly agrees with you that she was surveilled in some way, or she thinks so. But she also would push back, perhaps, on some of what you're saying. She alleged in the interview - she alleges in the interview here on NPR that this matter has been politicized, that she feels Trump specifically was exonerated by the files that we have seen so far and that the left, as she puts it, is just wanting to score political points. Do you?JAYAPAL: No. I think that what we want is a full investigation of everyone. Trump is certainly in the files a lot. He clearly had close associations with Epstein. But listen. I think that every single person in here, Democrat or Republican, should be investigated, because there's a lot. I mean, there - this was a big ring of people, and I don't think it was limited to one party. But I do think that Donald Trump tried to use this as a political issue in his campaign, and then found out that he was all over the files and has fought us every step of the way. Had he just at the beginning said, yes, let's release the files - let's go after these people - but that is not what happened.INSKEEP: In about 20 seconds, did you ultimately gain anything, learn anything from that hearing yesterday?JAYAPAL: I mean, I think what I learned is how much Pam Bondi was playing to an audience of one, and that was Donald Trump. She's not the people's lawyer. She's still acting as Trump's personal attorney and turning the Department of Justice into a revenge unit rather than being the lawyer for the people. And I think that was important for the country to see.INSKEEP: Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington State. Thanks very much, as always.JAYAPAL: Thank you, Steve.INSKEEP: She is on the House Judiciary Committee, the top Democrat on the Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

Thursday's oversight hearing by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security began with a rebuke by Chairman Rand Paul, R-Ky., who asked leaders from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to watch frame-by-frame video of the events leading up to the death of 37-year-old Alex Pretti.    \n   Paul then asked the officials if the use of force on display in the video — from women being shoved, the close use of pepper spray, to the ultimate shots fired at Pretti by Border Patrol — were justified tactics. And he asked if any of the actions were \"deescalatory.\"   \"It's clearly evident that the public trust has been lost. To restore trust in ICE and Border Patrol, they must admit their mistakes, be honest and forthright with their rules of engagement and pledge to reform,\" Paul said in his opening remarks.   \"It's terrible police work, but there has to ultimately be repercussions. I think he [Pretti] is retreating at every moment,\" Paul said. \"He's trying to get away, and he's being sprayed in the face. I don't think that's de-escalatory. That's an escalatory thing.\"   Sitting at the witness table were ICE acting Director Todd Lyons, CBP Commissioner Rodney Scott and Joseph Edlow, director of USCIS. Lyons testified that 37 ICE officers had been investigated in the last year for use of force and detailed the changes to new officer training as the agency onboarded 12,000 new recruits. But in response to questions about Pretti's death, they declined to provide specifics on the ongoing investigation but noted that body camera footage would eventually be released.   \n   The three DHS officials appeared before the committee as their department is one day away from a potential shutdown and as the Trump administration has vowed to continue reducing its immigration enforcement presence in Minneapolis.    On the issue of use of force, the committee's top two leaders were largely in agreement Thursday that the actions of officials in Minnesota went too far. Consensus beyond that, however, was harder to find.    Democrats, several of which successfully advocated last month to strip DHS from a broader government funding deal, focused on use of force, engagement with U.S. citizens and training.   Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, urged Paul and Democrats to not jump to conclusions over the actions of the agents involved in the Pretti shooting.   \"I find it outrageous that we are going into a path where watching a video on social media is enough to indict people,\" Moreno said.   Sens. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and James Lankford, R-Okla., focused on the threats law enforcement officials face amid an increasing spotlight on their operations.   Several Democrats on the committee were quick to call for DHS' funding to be separated after two U.S. citizens, including Pretti, were killed in Minneapolis. They have since laid out a list of demands that includes mandating the use of body cameras and judicial warrants, banning the use of masks and arrests in hospitals, schools and churches.   Immigration officials sidestepped questions on Noem's claims   The three officials were testifying for the second time this week — they also appeared before the House Homeland Security Committee on Tuesday.   And for the second time this week, the officials declined to support the claims made by Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem in the immediate aftermath of Pretti's death — namely her accusation that he was a domestic terrorist.   When asked if he, or anyone under his command, had provided information to lead to that conclusion, CBP Commissioner Scott said no. Both Scott and Lyons said they could not \"speculate on what someone else would say\" or why Noem thought that at the time.   \n   When pressed on similar comments made by top White House officials, Lyons said, \"any comments that are made publicly, privately, text, email, or Instagram posts, whatever is going to put a bias on the investigation.\"   Senators heard from top Minnesota officials first   During the hearing there was also testimony from Keith Ellison, the attorney general of Minnesota, and Paul Schnell, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Corrections. They faced questions about local law enforcement collaboration with federal immigration officers and the protests against the surge that continued for weeks.   \"I want to be clear that there is a legitimate need for immigration enforcement and for addressing those people who represent, in particular, a threat to public safety,\" Schnell said. \"But I think what we want is to return to the days where there is close collaboration ... where we can focus on key issues of community and public safety across our country.\"   As their testimony began, White House Border Czar Tom Homan announced from Minnesota that President Trump has agreed that the immigration surge in the state will conclude.   DHS budget negotiations remain in limbo   Last month, the Senate stripped funding for the Department of Homeland Security from a broader federal spending package. With the agency's baseline funding due to expire Friday at midnight, lawmakers are now considering potential changes to immigration enforcement at the behest of Democrats, who have refused to fund the agency without reforms.   Democrats produced legislative text over the weekend encapsulating their key demands. The White House responded with a counteroffer that top Democrats have described as \"incomplete and insufficient.\"   Republicans have shown scattered support for some proposals, such as body cameras. But the parties remain deeply divided around other potential reforms and negotiations have been faltering.   Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has described the talks as making progress, though he has acknowledged that they are all but certain to not bear fruit before the Friday deadline, when funding runs out and members in both chambers are set to leave for a week-long recess.   \n   But most Democrats, even a number of them who continued voting with Republicans last fall to end the government shutdown, say they will not support another short-term DHS funding measure even if it means a lapse in funding for the department.   \"We are asking our colleagues and the White House to work with us,\" Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., told reporters on Tuesday. \"Unfortunately we're not seeing that.\"   If lawmakers don't reach a deal this week, another stopgap bill to fund DHS in the short term would be needed. A lapse in funding would affect agencies inside DHS, like the Transportation Security Administration and Federal Emergency Management Agency — potentially affecting air travel and disaster response.   During Tuesday's hearing, all three agency leaders hedged in response to questions about whether their operations would be affected if DHS shuts down on Friday. Edlow of USCIS reminded lawmakers that his agency is funded primarily by the fees people pay when they submit various forms and applications, so his employees would still get paid.   ICE and CBP both got a huge infusion of cash from Congress in Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill Act last summer — making ICE the highest-funded U.S. law enforcement agency. That funding could allow the agencies to continue working with pay as they did during the last shutdown in the fall.\n",

Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., takes his seat during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on January 15.\n                \n                    Tom Brenner/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Tom Brenner/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has granted Sen. Mark Kelly's request for a preliminary injunction against Pete Hegseth, in a lawsuit filed by the Arizona Democrat accusing the defense secretary of trying to punish him for his political speech.   Kelly, a former Navy Captain, sued Hegseth in January, one week after the defense secretary moved to formally censure him for participating in a video where he and several Democratic lawmakers told U.S. servicemembers they can refuse illegal orders.   \"Our rules are clear. You can refuse illegal orders,\" Kelly says in the video.   \n   Hegseth has labeled Kelly's statements as \"seditious\" and announced a review of his retirement grade, which could lead to a demotion in rank and reduction in retirement pay.   Thursday's ruling temporarily blocks the Pentagon from taking steps to discipline Kelly. It was issued by Judge Richard Leon, a George W. Bush appointee on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.   \"This Court has all it needs to conclude that Defendants have trampled on Senator Kelly's First Amendment freedoms and threatened the constitutional liberties of millions of military retirees,\" Leon wrote in his opinion. \"After all, as Bob Dylan famously said, 'You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.'\"    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrives on Capitol Hill for a classified briefing with senators on the situation in Venezuela on January 7.\n                \n                    J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n    \n\n   \n   In his lawsuit, Kelly's lawyers argued that the Pentagon review was both \"unconstitutional and legally baseless.\"   \"The First Amendment forbids the government and its officials from punishing disfavored expression or retaliating against protected speech,\" the suit reads. \"That prohibition applies with particular force to legislators speaking on matters of public policy.\"   In a statement following the court's ruling, Kelly said the case was bigger than him.    \"This administration was sending a message to millions of retired veterans that they too can be censured or demoted just for speaking out. That's why I couldn't let this stand.\"    \n   \"I appreciate the judge's careful consideration of this case, and the clarity of his ruling,\" he continued. \"But I also know that this might not be over yet, because this President and this administration do not know how to admit when they're wrong.\"    Hegseth responded to the ruling in a post on X, saying the judge's decision would be \"immediately appealed.\"   \"Sedition is sedition, 'Captain,'\" he added.   Kelly was one of six Democratic lawmakers to participate in the video, which was released on social media in November amid concerns from Democrats in Congress about the legality of U.S. military strikes on alleged narco-trafficking boats in the Caribbean.    The video drew a furious response from President Trump, who in a post on social media called it \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!\" Trump also said the lawmakers — all with military or intelligence backgrounds — \"should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL.\"    Federal prosecutors attempted to indict the lawmakers, but a grand jury in Washington, D.C., ultimately rejected the effort, according to a source familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly.    It is not clear what charges prosecutors attempted to bring against the lawmakers. Previously the Justice Department had declined to \"confirm or deny the existence of an investigation\" into either Democrat.\n",

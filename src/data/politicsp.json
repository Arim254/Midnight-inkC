    "body": "\n      President Trump is meeting with Ukrainian Pres. Volodymyr Zelenskyy today and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tomorrow.   \n\n    DANIEL ESTRIN, HOST:  Two world leaders involved in two major conflicts are meeting President Trump this week. In a few minutes, we'll hear about what the Israeli prime minister may have planned for the president tomorrow. Today, Trump meets Ukraine's leader, and this time, not in the Oval Office. NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben joins us now. Good morning, Danielle.DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Good morning, Daniel.ESTRIN: So this afternoon, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is scheduled to meet President Trump in Florida. That's where Trump is spending the holidays. And Russian President Vladimir Putin set the stage this weekend - didn't he? - with missile and drone attacks on Kyiv this weekend.KURTZLEBEN: That's absolutely right. So the meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump is scheduled for 1 p.m. Eastern today at Trump's club, Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach. And there's been some real movement here since that infamous bitter Oval Office meeting you alluded to, featuring Zelenskyy, Trump and Vice President Vance earlier this year. Now, earlier this week, Zelenskyy released a 20-point plan to end the war, which, according to multiple outlets, it described security guarantees and a demilitarized zone between Russia and Ukraine, which would be one way to try to deal with that sticking point of territory disputes between the two countries. Zelenskyy also told Axios this week that he's willing to bring that plan up for a referendum in Ukraine, but only if Russia agrees to a 60-day ceasefire. Now, that's a big if, because, as you said, Russia bombarded Kyiv yesterday, and they may not be inclined to stop attacking.ESTRIN: Yeah. And meanwhile, Trump ordered missile strikes on targets in northern Nigeria on Christmas Day, and he's also keeping up the pressure on Venezuela and President Nicolas Maduro. So what exactly is Trump's aim in these two very different parts of the globe?KURTZLEBEN: Well, let's start with Nigeria here. Trump announced in a Christmas night social media post that the U.S. had launched strikes against ISIS in northwestern Nigeria. And we should add here that the Nigerian government says they gave the green light to this. Well, Trump implied that this was retaliation for armed militants attacking Christians, though experts have disputed claims of Christian persecution in that country, as the AP found earlier this year, militants there have killed Muslims and Christians alike. As far as the aim beyond what Trump said here, it may be to please his Christian base. For one thing, this topic is getting louder. Rapper Nicki Minaj, who has become friendly to MAGA, has been talking about this alleged Christian persecution.But then there's Venezuela, which you mentioned, where the administration has been striking boats that they say are carrying drugs and killing people in the process. Well, the endgame there has been in question for months now. For example, does Trump want regime change in Venezuela? Now, all of this certainly fits with how the Trump administration likes to talk about itself, being tough on terrorists and tough on drugs, but you're right that it raises that question of why is Trump taking all these actions all over the world? Because that question of why has created strife within his own party. You have former Trump ally, Marjorie Taylor Greene, a congresswoman from Georgia, who has asked, for example, if Trump is still America First.ESTRIN: And speaking of strife in the Republican Party, let's talk about the cultural battles happening on the right. These past few weeks in this country, the hot topic used to be antisemitism, and now there's a new controversy over what it means to be American.KURTZLEBEN: Yeah. This got more attention in particular after Ohio GOP gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, in recent days, he pushed back against this idea of heritage Americans, which is a concept among some on the far right, that there are people in the U.S. whose lineage can be traced far back in the U.S.' history, and therefore, they are heritage Americans, that your lineage determines your Americanness, which, of course, means race is central to this conversation. And so therefore, we've seen this topic inflame existing tensions, for example, between people like Ramaswamy and the white nationalist streamer Nick Fuentes.Now, all of this is important, not just in and of itself, because it's another intra-party faultline in the GOP. There's this question about what America First means, like I mentioned. Then here's this divide between outright racists like Fuentes, who has a large following, and other MAGA leaders. And then, like you mentioned, there's that fight over what constitutes antisemitism and how to reject that. So there's a real chance that these often really ugly divides are a major storyline in 2026 as the midterms approach and as the GOP grapples with its post-Trump future.ESTRIN: NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben.

Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee.   Abrego Garcia has denied the allegations, and argued that prosecutors are vindictively and selectively targeting him. Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw, Jr. wrote in Tuesday's order that Abrego Garcia had enough evidence to hold a hearing on the topic, which Crenshaw scheduled for Jan. 28.   \n   At that hearing, prosecutors will have to explain their reasoning for charging Abrego Garcia, Crenshaw wrote, and if they fail in that, the charges could be dismissed.   When Abrego Garcia was pulled over in 2022, there were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was eventually allowed to continue driving with only a warning.   A Department of Homeland Security agent previously testified that he did not begin investigating the traffic stop until after the U.S. Supreme Court said in April that the Trump administration had to work to bring Abrego Garcia from El Salvador, where he was deported.   \n   Years earlier, Abrego Garcia had been granted protection from deportation to his home country after a judge found he faced danger there from a gang that targeted his family. That order allowed Abrego Garcia, who has an American wife and child, to live and work in the U.S. under Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervision.   Members of President Donald Trump's administration have accused Abrego Garcia of being a member of the MS-13 gang, but he has vehemently denied the accusations and has no criminal record.   Abrego Garcia's defense attorney and the U.S. attorney's office in Nashville did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",

    "body": "\n      President Trump began the year with huge plans and a GOP in lockstep, but heading into 2026 there are cracks in his support that could affect how much his administration gets done.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  Of course, 2026 is just days away - a time to look backward at the year that was and forward to the year to come. NPR senior contributor Ron Elving has been thinking about the state of U.S. politics since President Donald Trump returned to power. And, of course, Ron is completely up to the task of looking both backward and forward. Ron, thanks so much for being with us.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.SIMON: I asked you last year what you were watching for in 2025, and you advised, buckle up. You some kind of psychic?ELVING: If I were Scott, maybe I could find my cellphone more easily. But you didn't need paranormal powers to see Trump's second term would be anything but normal, even by the standards of his first term when he got impeached twice and indicted on both state and federal charges. Yet he came back, and despite all that. And there's little chance he's going to be cowed by threats of consequences this time around.The balance between Trump's impulses and the restraints on his power was more conventional the first time around. He was finding his way for a while, relying more on people who knew the Washington way or were well established on their own in government or in the Republican Party. This time around, we have a Cabinet and White House staff dominated by dedicated enablers, willing to carry out orders the way Trump has always thought all his employees should.SIMON: But there are cracks in what have been the president's support in his own party - over Ukraine, the economy, the Epstein files. Do you see those divisions widening?ELVING: The conventional wisdom says the closer we get to the midterms, the more we will see vulnerable Republicans distance themselves from Trump on health care, on food prices or various other issues. That happens to any president who is down in the polls halfway through a term. Of course, there could be events, as there were in other midterm years, such as 2002 or 1998. Those reversed the usual dynamic.But the elections coming in '26 are not the only source of stress in Trump's movement. There are tremendous divisions among some of his reporters who are not officeholders, especially among the cultural activists and people in the media - the podcasters and online influencers, the ones who have provided so much of the heat around Trump. They're at odds with each other over Israel, over Epstein, over Venezuela, and they're battling over who gets the MAGA megaphone when Trump begins to fade.SIMON: One of the defining features of the second Trump administration is how it regards or disregards the rule of law. What are your thoughts?ELVING: This term has featured serious policy shifts, like the Trump tariffs and the deportation drive and the military strikes, without congressional approval. We also see a lot of personal retribution against Trump's political enemies and provocative displays of will, such as the partial demolition of the White House and the Trump rebranding of the Kennedy Cultural Arts Center and the Institute of Peace.In all of this, we see a willingness to test the boundaries, try the locks on the doors, see what's open, see what happens and ultimately to see who will step up to enforce the law. In the year to come, we can expect these confrontations to continue and quite possibly escalate.SIMON: What will you be looking at especially closely next year?ELVING: Once again, this year, the focus will be on Trump, not just what he does and what he says and what he spreads online. The focus will also be on how he looks and acts and behaves in highly personal ways. We've already seen a lot of this attention, especially in the visual and social media. The president turns 80 on June 14. He's planning a lot of high-profile events around his birthday, but he would not need those events to bring attention to his age. Are people going to be asking, is this the same Trump? Does he still have his famous mojo? And when the midterms have passed, the spotlight must inevitably shift to the question of succession.SIMON: NPR senior contributor, Ron Elving. Thanks so much, my friend.

    "body": "\n      Morning Edition host Leila Fadel asks GOP strategist Alex Conant about the future of the Republican party in 2026 and beyond.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  So what's ahead for the Republican Party in 2026? To get into that, we're joined by Republican strategist Alex Conant. Good morning, and a belated Merry Christmas.ALEX CONANT: Good morning. Merry Christmas.FADEL: So some pretty grim records there - longest government shutdown, least bills passed, most House members leaving. This is a Republican-controlled Congress. Given this record, how is the party thinking about messaging and appealing to Americans going into 2026 and the midterms?CONANT: Well, right now, the big focus is going to be on selling the tax cuts that the president and Congress passed last summer, which, Republicans argue, have already had a measurable, positive impact on the economy. You look at the GDP numbers that were released earlier this week that showed really high third-quarter growth. The White House feels confident that is just the beginning of what's going to be a banner year in 2026. And if the economy is strong and people start perceiving that it is strong, Republicans should be fine in the midterms.FADEL: And that's - but that's the challenge, right? I mean, Americans aren't perceiving that right now. They don't feel good about the economy, and a lot of them put that blame on the party in power.CONANT: Of course. I mean, I think the president always owns the economy. And look, Americans still remember when - what prices were like before the inflation that we've had over the last three or four years. But inflation is basically over. The White House and the Fed, I think, have done a good job of getting a handle on it. We've seen very low inflation to the point where the Fed is now cutting interest rates. That, coupled with strong GDP growth, continued low unemployment - the hope is that by next November, Americans are feeling much better about the economy, and Republicans will benefit from that at the polls.FADEL: Interesting. So this now-weakness may turn into a strength in the new year. You know, we're going into 2026, and that means another deadline that could lead to a government shutdown. If that were to happen - you know, last time we saw the Republican approach, which was to wait it out and blame the Democrats for the situation, which kind of worked. If Congress faces another government shutdown at the end of January, how do you expect House Speaker Mike Johnson to approach messaging for his party and for the public?CONANT: Well, as you said, the last time the government shut down for 40-plus days, Democrats suffered the most, and they ended up caving completely to reopen it. I'm not sure Democrats want to repeat that and shut down the government again, and I know Congress is working very hard to pass bipartisan...FADEL: Right. But I think both parties suffered - right? - when it came to perception with the American public. People were angry at Washington. So would simply blaming the Democrats again be as effective?CONANT: Well, it takes two parties to shut down the government, right? And so I don't think Republicans are interested in shutting it down. I don't know that Democrats are interested in shutting it down, but I think you're right, there is going to be a big funding deadline at the end of January. I think right now, both parties see value in not shutting down the government. But if it does shut down, of course, parties are going to - people are going to blame both parties. It's also, I think, why you're seeing so many - both Republicans and Democrats - I think there's 40-plus, 50-plus members of Congress who are not returning next year. You might see more retirements if we shut down the government, simply because it's not a fun place to be.FADEL: I want to talk about the fissures we've been seeing in the party. I mean, we saw that Mike Johnson really didn't have full control of his caucus in the last few months. I mean, do you expect him to remain speaker in the year ahead?CONANT: I do expect him to remain speaker simply because nobody else wants the job. It's got to be one of the worst jobs in America, especially with a majority as slim as his. But you're right. You're seeing, you know, just a lot of unhappiness, I think, within Congress, and especially within the Republican conference. And you're also starting to see some of the battles over the future of the Republican Party that have been under the surface for the last few years. They're starting to come up as we get closer to President Trump being a truly lame duck president.FADEL: What happens to the party when President Trump's no longer at the top of the ballot? Is there a clear leader of the future of this party?CONANT: There's not. I mean, I think a lot of people would look to JD Vance, but President Trump's political support has never been transferable. It's why we've lost every election that he hasn't been at the top of the ballot in the last decade. So I think it's an open question as to who will be our next leader, and what does that coalition look like? It could be JD Vance, but I think there's a lot of others that are considering running as well.FADEL: Republican strategist Alex Conant. Thank you so much for your time.CONANT: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

House Speaker Mike Johnson put it this way in his first address to his chamber this year.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE JOHNSON: In spite of our great challenges, and even our disagreements and our healthy debates, this extraordinary institution - the people's House - will still be standing strong.FADEL: But 12 months later, Congress has ceded much of its power to President Trump and has passed a record-low number of bills. NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales has been following this and joins us now. Hi, Claudia.CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Hey, Leila.FADEL: OK. So congressional Republicans started the year with these ambitious plans to pass bills, to strengthen the economy, address the border crisis, boost the military. Did any of that happen?GRISALES: Not exactly, unless you look at their marquee tax and spending plan they called the One Big Beautiful Bill, which became law. They would argue that is the key legislation that passed, but the jury's still out if this is going to have the advertised impact on the economy. And it was the exception to the rule. Congress ceded a lot of its power to the president this year. That included dismantling large sections of the federal government, taking over the power of the purse during the government shutdown by directing spending that was prohibited at that time and triggering the clawback of billions of spending that had been approved by Congress. And as you mentioned, we heard from public affairs network C-SPAN. They reported the number of laws enacted this year are at that all-time low.FADEL: Now, Republicans are the majority in both the House and Senate, but that is very narrow. How did leaders fare in 2025?GRISALES: Yeah. It definitely made it more difficult for them. In the House, we saw Speaker Mike Johnson lose more control of his conference. By year-end, he faced a rare series of successful discharge petitions. These are bipartisan efforts by rank-and-file members to bypass the speaker and pass law. And none was more noteworthy than the one securing the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. He also saw Republican pushback when he virtually closed the house down during the 43-day government shutdown. He's facing a record number of House retirements. That includes nearly 30 Republicans.FADEL: OK, so some division within his own party. What about the Senate? How did Majority Leader John Thune fare in comparison?GRISALES: Well, he didn't end the year with the same level of animosity, but he saw challenges, too. I asked him about lessons learned. Here's what he told me.JOHN THUNE: You know, I mean, sometimes you get frustrated that you don't get the things done you want to get done. But you got to keep trying there.GRISALES: Ultimately, the Senate approved a majority of Trump's nominees for the administration and federal courts. But not until recently did we see more Senate Republicans push back publicly on the president with some issues, such as the strikes on alleged drug traffickers at sea. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told me these challenges and the chaos we've seen with the federal government, the economy, Trump's tariff policies have all created an opening for Democrats.FADEL: Now, Congress will face even greater challenges next year with the midterms on tap. What do you expect to see?GRISALES: Well, lawmakers have their eye on exactly those midterms in November. Even with Republicans redistricting to add seats in the House, it's still not clear they're going to keep their majority. They face the prospect of another government shutdown threat in January, and that's in addition to calls for Washington to address an affordability crisis that we expect will dominate on the campaign trail. And there's also those spiking premiums for health insurance after Congress failed to extend subsidies for Obamacare plans. This is going to likely add fuel to the fire that Congress is not addressing a lot of urgent issues for American families come November.FADEL: That's NPR's Claudia Grisales.

    "body": "\n      In his first year back in office, President Trump has made clear that America First is far from isolationist, instead it means aggressive use of the country's unilateral power around the world.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  In a few minutes, we'll hear what a career diplomat thinks about President Trump's approach to foreign policy in his first year. Before we do that, though, we look at the facts. The president recently ordered a blockade on all oil tankers into and out of Venezuela that are on U.S. sanctions lists - a dramatic escalation of his pressure campaign against the government of President Nicolas Maduro. It's just one of the latest examples of Trump's aggressive use of power in the region and around the world as he seeks to reshape the global order to U.S. preferences, or at least his own preferences.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I've restored American strength, settled eight wars in 10 months, destroyed the Iran nuclear threat and ended the war in Gaza, bringing, for the first time in 3,000 years, peace to the Middle East.FADEL: Now, that's a lot of exaggeration, but it has been a busy year on the foreign policy front, and here to talk about this is NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez. Hi, Franco.FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: Hey, Leila.FADEL: Trump campaigned in this idea of ending forever wars, America First, and he's seen as more transactional, having a limited view of when the U.S. needs to engage globally. But in his second term, there's been a lot of focus overseas, right?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, since taking office, he's used tariffs as a weapon against allies, declared war on drug cartels, secured the release of hostages in Gaza, and also cozied up to Russian president Vladimir Putin. He's painted European partners as weak and disdains alliances. Stewart Patrick, who served in the George W. Bush State Department and is now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, he told me that Trump has taken aim at the post-Cold War order of economic institutions and alliances and basically redefined it through an America First lens.STEWART PATRICK: The way I have sometimes described is on the eve of America's 250th anniversary, Trump has launched a second American Revolution. He's declared independence from the world that the United States created.ORDOÑEZ: Now, the White House told me that Trump's acting on his promises to advance American interests, delivering fair-trade deals, pushing allies to increase their defense spending, killing narco terrorists - that's their words - while ending global conflicts around the world to make the world safer.FADEL: At the same time, you see in his moves and his statements how Trump really seems to be wanting to divide the world between major powers.ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, he really does see the world through spheres of influence. I mean, Trump's even cited the Monroe Doctrine in saying that he wants to reassert U.S. dominance in the Western Hemisphere. And that's a big break from past administrations that's prioritized other regions while also confronting the big powers like Russia and China. Trump's instead sought to curry favor with Russia, as we've reported, in a bid to try to end the war in Ukraine.FADEL: Is this where his actions in Venezuela play a role - not only the oil tankers, but these deadly and very controversial drug boat strikes?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, and also on immigration and the military buildup in the Caribbean, also the controversial $20 billion bailout of Argentina, Trump's made very clear that he wants the U.S. to be the most influential power in the hemisphere and not China or Russia.FADEL: But isn't China already playing a big role in the hemisphere?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, very much so. Benjamin Gedan, who handled the South America portfolio in the Obama White House, told me that Beijing has been eating America's lunch for decades, and they do this through trade and investment, trying to be an appealing partner.BENJAMIN GEDAN: Latin America has a lot of problems right now, and the United States really could help. But the policy prescription right now is just bad medicine. It's bringing a military-first approach to a region that needs investment, it needs trade and it needs help for its law enforcement agencies to be able to fight organized crime. None of those are tasks for an aircraft carrier.ORDOÑEZ: Now, Gedan says the U.S. could instead be building bridges, working to be a partner of choice and not the partner who is feared, which it is now.FADEL: That's White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez. Thank you, Franco.ORDOÑEZ: Thank you, Leila.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that Trump has championed has mostly held, but progress has slowed recently. Both sides accuse one another of violations, and divisions have emerged among the U.S., Israel and Arab countries about the path forward.   \n   The truce's first phase began in October, days after the two-year anniversary of the initial Hamas-led attack on Israel that killed around 1,200 people. All but one of the 251 hostages taken then have been released, alive or dead.   Now comes the next, far more complicated part. Trump's 20-point plan — which was approved by the U.N. Security Council — lays out an ambitious vision for ending Hamas' rule of Gaza.   The two leaders also could discuss non-Gaza topics, including Iran, whose nuclear capabilities Trump continues to insist were \"completely and fully obliterated\" following U.S. strikes on its nuclear sites in June.   There are many key facets of the ceasefire's second phase that Israel's leader doesn't support or has even openly opposed, said Mona Yacoubian, director and senior adviser of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.   \"This is going to be a really tall order, I think, for President Trump to get Netanyahu to agree,\" she said.   \"How he does that, what kind of pressure he puts on Netanyahu, I think, is going to be important to watch for,\" said Yacoubian, who also said the two could exhibit \"a broader clash of approaches to the region.\"   \n   Next phase is complex   If successful, the second phase would see the rebuilding of a demilitarized Gaza under international supervision by a group chaired by Trump and known as the Board of Peace. The Palestinians would form a \"technocratic, apolitical\" committee to run daily affairs in Gaza, under Board of Peace supervision.   It further calls for normalized relations between Israel and the Arab world, and a possible pathway to Palestinian independence. Then there are thorny logistical and humanitarian questions, including rebuilding war-ravaged Gaza, disarming Hamas and creating a security apparatus called the International Stabilization Force.   The Board of Peace would oversee Gaza's reconstruction under a two-year, renewable U.N. mandate. Its members had been expected to be named by the end of the year and might even be revealed following Monday's meeting, but the announcement could be pushed into next month.   Netanyahu was the first foreign leader to meet Trump at the White House in his second term, but this will be their first in-person meeting since Trump went to Israel in October to mark the start of the ceasefire's initial phase. Netanyahu has been to Mar-a-Lago before, including in July 2024 when Trump was still seeking reelection.   Much remains unsettled   Their latest meeting comes after U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and the president's son in law, Jared Kushner, recently huddled in Florida with officials from Egypt, Qatar and Turkey, which have been mediating the ceasefire.   Two main challenges have complicated moving to the second phase, according to an official who was briefed on those meetings. Israeli officials have been taking a lot of time to vet and approve members of the Palestinian technocratic committee from a list given to them by the mediators, and Israel continues its military strikes.   Trump's plan also calls for the International Stabilization Force, proposed as a multinational body, to maintain security. But it, too, has yet to be formed. Whether details will be forthcoming after Monday's meeting is unclear.   \n   A Western diplomat said there is a \"huge gulf\" between the U.S.-Israeli understanding of the International Stabilization Force's mandate and that of other major countries in the region, as well as European governments.   All spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details that haven't been made public.   The U.S. and Israel want the force to have a \"commanding role\" in security duties, including disarming Hamas and other militant groups. But countries being courted to contribute troops fear that mandate will make it an \"occupation force,\" the diplomat said.   Hamas has said it is ready to discuss \"freezing or storing\" its arsenal of weapons, but insists it has a right to armed resistance as long as Israel occupies Palestinian territory. One U.S. official said a potential plan might be to offer cash incentives in exchange for weapons, echoing a \"buy-back\" program Witkoff has previously floated.   Questions about Gaza reconstruction   Israeli bombardment and ground operations have transformed neighborhoods in several Gaza cities into rubble-strewn wastelands, with blackened shells of buildings and mounds of debris stretching in all directions.   \n   Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey are pressing for a negotiated deal on disarming Hamas, and on an additional Israeli withdrawal from Gaza before moving to next elements of the plan. Those include deployment of the international security force and reconstruction, three Arab officials told The Associated Press.   That appears to run against ideas floated by U.S. officials to quickly start building temporary housing for Palestinians in parts of southern Gaza still controlled by Israeli troops. Three officials said the United Arab Emirates has agreed to fund reconstruction in Gaza, including new communities, although they said discussions are ongoing and plans remain unsettled.   A proposed map created by the U.S. and obtained by the AP shows an area labelled \"UAE Temporary Emirates housing complex\" inside an Israeli-controlled area of Gaza. The map shows a \"U.S. planned community area\" surrounding the UAE area.   \n   An Arab official said he was aware of the map, but said it was a suggestion from the U.S. and Israel that was put to the Emiratis and other countries.   The UAE did not respond to multiple requests for comment about whether it has agreed to the plans or to fund the communities. It is not known if the money would be contingent on gestures from Israel and Hamas, such as a commitment to Palestinian statehood or disarmament.\n",

The Associated Press first reported that Redd pulled out of the show days after President Trump's name was added to the exterior of the performing arts center in Washington, D.C.   In an email to NPR on Saturday, Kennedy Center spokesperson Roma Daravi said Redd's decision is a disservice to the arts.   \n   \"Any artist cancelling their show at the Trump Kennedy Center over political differences isn't courageous or principled—they are selfish, intolerant, and have failed to meet the basic duty of a public artist: to perform for all people,\" she said.   Redd, an international performer on drums and vibraphone, hosted the center's Christmas Jazz Jam for many years. NPR's messages to Redd were not returned Saturday morning.   \"When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,\" he told the AP.   Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell sent a scathing letter to Redd on Friday, criticizing him and calling the cancellation a political stunt. The center shared the letter with NPR.   \n   \"Regrettably, your action surrenders to the sad bullying tactics employed by certain elements on the left, who have sought to intimidate artists into boycotting performances at our national cultural center,\" it reads.   In a post on X on Friday, Grenell wrote: \"The left is boycotting the Arts because Trump is supporting the Arts. But we will not let them cancel shows without consequences. The Arts are for everyone - and the Left is mad about it.\"   Several artists have pulled out of performances and cut ties with the Kennedy Center since Trump replaced the board and was elected chairman. In March, Hamilton canceled its 2026 run at the Kennedy Center. Actor and producer Issa Rae also called off her appearance. Folk musician Rhiannon Giddens moved her concert to a different venue in the city.   \n   Trump's name was added to the Kennedy Center building last week, after the Board of Trustees voted to rename it. The exterior's iconic lettering now reads \"The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.\"   \n   The name change has prompted outcry from Democratic lawmakers. Ohio Rep. Joyce Beatty, an ex-officio member of the Kennedy Center Board, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Monday. Beatty argues changing the name of the memorial that is in honor of President John F. Kennedy requires an act of Congress. She's asking the court to declare the board's vote null and void.   According to a Kennedy Center online biography, Redd has been involved with The Smithsonian for more than two decades, serving as artist-in residence at The Smithsonian Jazz Café from 2004-2008. The Kennedy Center is part of the Smithsonian Institution.   \n   \"Art is a shared cultural experience meant to unite, not exclude,\" said the statement from Daravi. \"The Trump Kennedy Center is a true bipartisan institution that welcomes artists and patrons from all backgrounds—great art transcends politics, and America's cultural center remains committed to presenting popular programming that inspires and resonates with all audiences.\"   The Kennedy Center says it will file the lawsuit against Redd after the holidays.\n",

Trump insisted he believed Putin still wants peace, even as Russia launched another round of attacks on Ukraine while Zelenskyy flew to the United States for the latest round of negotiations.   \n   \"Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed,\" Trump said during a late afternoon news conference following a meeting with Zelenskyy, whom he repeatedly praised as \"brave.\"   \n   Trump and Zelenskyy both acknowledged thorny issues remain, including whether Russia can keep Ukrainian territory it controls. After their discussion they called a wide group of European leaders, including Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, and the leaders of Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain and Poland.   Zelenskyy thanked Trump for his work. \"Ukraine is ready for peace,\" he said.   Trump and Putin will speak again   Trump said he'd follow the meeting with another call to Putin. Earlier Sunday, Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said the Trump-Putin call was initiated by the U.S. side, lasted over an hour, and was \"friendly, benevolent and businesslike.\" Ushakov said Trump and Putin agreed to speak again \"promptly\" after Trump's meeting with Zelenskyy.   But Ushakov added that a \"bold, responsible, political decision is needed from Kyiv\" on the fiercely contested Donbas region in eastern Ukraine and other matters in dispute for there to be a \"complete cessation\" of hostilities.   In overnight developments, three guided aerial bombs launched by Russia struck private homes in the eastern city of Sloviansk, according to the head of the local military administration, Vadym Lakh. Three people were injured and one man died, Lakh said in a post on the Telegram messenger app.   \n   The strike came the day after Russia attacked Ukraine's capital with ballistic missiles and drones on Saturday, killing at least one person and wounding 27, Ukrainian authorities said. Explosions boomed across Kyiv as the attack began in the early morning and continued for hours.   Trump said, however, that he still believes Putin is \"very serious\" about ending the war.   \"I believe Ukraine has made some very strong attacks also,\" Trump told reporters as Zelenskyy stood by his side. \"And I don't say that negatively. I think, you probably have to. I don't say that negatively. But I think, he hasn't told me that, but there have been some explosions in various parts of Russia. It looks to me, like, I don't know. I don't think it came from the Congo.\"   \n   Trump noted that it was possible that the negotiations will fall apart. \"In a few weeks, we will know one way or the other, I think. ... But it could also go poorly.\"   The face-to-face sit-down between Trump and Zelenskyy underscored the apparent progress made by Trump's top negotiators in recent weeks as the sides traded draft peace plans and continued to shape a proposal to end the fighting. Zelenskyy told reporters Friday that the 20-point draft proposal negotiators have discussed is \"about 90% ready\" — echoing a figure, and the optimism, that U.S. officials conveyed when Trump's chief negotiators met with Zelenskyy in Berlin earlier this month.   During the recent talks, the U.S. agreed to offer certain security guarantees to Ukraine similar to those offered to other members of NATO. The proposal came as Zelenskyy said he was prepared to drop his country's bid to join the security alliance if Ukraine received NATO-like protection that would be designed to safeguard it against future Russian attacks.   'Intensive' weeks ahead   Zelenskyy also spoke on Christmas Day with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law. The Ukrainian leader said they discussed \"certain substantive details\" and cautioned \"there is still work to be done on sensitive issues\" and \"the weeks ahead may also be intensive.\"   \n   The U.S. president has been working to end the war in Ukraine for much of his first year back in office, showing irritation with both Zelenskyy and Putin while publicly acknowledging the difficulty of ending the conflict. Long gone are the days when, as a candidate in 2024, he boasted that he could resolve the fighting in a day.   \n   After hosting Zelenskyy at the White House in October, Trump demanded that both Russia and Ukraine halt fighting and \"stop at the battle line,\" implying that Moscow should be able to keep the territory it has seized from Ukraine.   Zelenskyy said last week that he would be willing to withdraw troops from Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland as part of a plan to end the war, if Russia also pulls back and the area becomes a demilitarized zone monitored by international forces.   Putin wants Russian gains kept, and more   Putin has publicly said he wants all the areas in four key regions that have been captured by his forces, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory. He also has insisted that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in eastern Ukraine that Moscow's forces haven't captured. Kyiv has publicly rejected all those demands.   The Kremlin also wants Ukraine to abandon its bid to join NATO. It warned that it wouldn't accept the deployment of any troops from members of the military alliance and would view them as a \"legitimate target.\"   \n   Putin also has said Ukraine must limit the size of its army and give official status to the Russian language, demands he has made from the outset of the conflict.   Ushakov told the business daily Kommersant this month that Russian police and national guard would stay in parts of Donetsk -– one of the two major areas, along with Luhansk, that make up the Donbas region — even if they become a demilitarized zone under a prospective peace plan.   Ushakov cautioned that trying to reach a compromise could take a long time. He said U.S. proposals that took into account Russian demands had been \"worsened\" by alterations proposed by Ukraine and its European allies.   \n   Trump has been somewhat receptive to Putin's demands, making the case that the Russian president can be persuaded to end the war if Kyiv agrees to cede Ukrainian land in the Donbas region and if Western powers offer economic incentives to bring Russia back into the global economy.\n",

    "body": "\n      Wendy Sherman, a former ambassador who has served under three presidential administrations, analyzes President Trump's approach to foreign policy this year.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Throughout the year, the Trump administration has argued that it was bringing a dealmaker's mindset to foreign policy, that everything is a transaction. So does that approach to foreign policy work? We're going to discuss this with someone who has a long career of negotiating for the U.S. Ambassador Wendy Sherman is the former U.S. deputy secretary of state and has served three presidents throughout her career. Thank you for joining us.WENDY SHERMAN: I'm delighted to be with you all.FADEL: So, Ambassador, this president's approach to foreign policy, as we said, has been repeatedly called transactional - to fulfill his America First agenda. As you look at this past year, is what you saw illustrative of a transactional foreign policy? And is that the right approach?SHERMAN: I think it is probably a good description of what we have seen. Transactional is not always a bad thing.FADEL: Yeah.SHERMAN: Of course, in any negotiation, you're trying to understand everybody's interests and what they need, what you can give and what you can get. But what is different in this administration is a very go-it-alone, bilateral approach - not one that uses all of the elements of American power, all of the alliances and points of leverage that we have, but rather approaching this as if one's trying to build a building and get an agreement from the zoning authority. And that doesn't work so well in diplomacy.FADEL: You know, we've watched this president sometimes treat allies like enemies, publicly threatening, publicly bullying if he doesn't get what he wants. But he's gotten some things done - a Gaza deal that hasn't exactly brought peace, but has ended the worst of the violence. He touts a slew of other peace deals between feuding countries - Armenia and Azerbaijan, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Is this approach of transactional deal-making working?SHERMAN: Well, I think the issue is whether any deal is sustainable. We've already seen the Rwanda and Democratic Republic of Congo break down. Yes, I'm very glad that there is, in essence, a ceasefire in terms of Gaza. But we are seeing the building of more settlements in the West Bank. We're seeing...FADEL: And people are still being killed pretty much every day in Gaza.SHERMAN: Yes, indeed. So, yes, there have been some at least short-term successes, and we all want peace. But is it sustainable? And if we get in trouble, will we have burnt all of our relationships with our allies so that they won't come to our defense?FADEL: Ambassador, I mean, you've negotiated some of the most consequential U.S. deals, including the Iran nuclear deal under President Obama, which the Trump administration actually described as being transactional and then, during his first administration, pulled out of it. But I'm wondering, as somebody who has been involved in these delicate negotiations with foes, what is the line between maximizing leverage and eroding trust?SHERMAN: Well, look. The Iran nuclear deal was not about, actually, a negotiation among equals in the sense that we and our European colleagues and Russia and China were all working to make sure that Iran never got a nuclear weapon. So it really had to take into account what everyone was trying to get done and ensure that Iran would never get a nuclear weapon. Well, so this is why it is a complex process.And so far, we've seen - let's take the Ukraine example. Ukraine was illegally and horrifically invaded by Russia, and the president sent a friend and a dealmaker to meet with the Russians and to meet with the Ukrainians. But in fact, we know from a recent Wall Street Journal article that Putin, who is a well-versed KGB prior agent, really focused on Witkoff because he thought that he could manage him and manipulate him. And it appears that has been the case. Witkoff and Kushner, the president's son-in-law, are saying that they've had constructive meetings with Russia. But Russia is singing a different tune, and our intelligence community is affirming that, in fact, Putin still wants all of Ukraine. So we're not at that deal that the president said he could get...FADEL: Yeah.SHERMAN: ...Done in Day 1 because he needs a team to do it and not just a couple of guys who think they know best.FADEL: So if you were advising the president on this issue, what would you say to him?SHERMAN: I would say to Witkoff and Kushner, take that intelligence briefing so you really know what you're up against. Use the team that's been put together for you to support you. Listen to them. Talk to your partners. I'm glad to hear that the president spoke with the prime minister of the U.K. recently, that he's been on the phone with the president of France, because, in fact, we all are going to have to deal with the consequences and are dealing with the consequences of what is happening or won't happen here. And for the administration to always remember this is not about a negotiation among equals. Yes, Putin has a lot of power. But this is about someone who illegally invaded a sovereign country.FADEL: Ambassador Wendy Sherman is the former U.S. deputy secretary of state. Thank you so much for your time.SHERMAN: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Tim Kaine, D-Va., is leading a bipartisan effort to force a vote to stop President Trump from unilaterally declaring war on the South American nation.   Kaine, a longtime proponent of Congress' powers to declare war, filed the resolution late Thursday, a move that will force the Senate to take up the legislation after a 10-day waiting period. Sens. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Rand Paul, R-Ky., co-sponsored the plan.    Kaine said concerns about war in the Latin American region are growing.   \n   \"The pace of the announcements, the authorization of covert activities and the military planning makes me think there's some chance this could be imminent,\" Kaine told reporters.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., speaks to reporters outside the Senate chamber on Oct. 1.  Kaine is hoping to prevent President Trump from unilaterally waging war on Venezuela without approval from Congress.\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   This week, Trump said the U.S. had conducted another military strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean and announced that he had authorized CIA operations in Venezuela. He also said he was considering land operations in the country.     \"We've almost totally stopped it by sea. Now we'll stop it by land,\" Trump said from the Oval Office on Wednesday about alleged drug smuggling.    Last week, Kaine and Schiff forced a Senate vote to limit Trump's war powers in the Caribbean. While that vote failed 48-51, two Republicans, Paul and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, joined Democrats in support.   Paul has been a vocal critic of the new military strikes, saying they set a precedent for the U.S. to shoot first without asking questions.   \"The American people do not want to be dragged into endless war with Venezuela without public debate or a vote,\" Paul said in a statement. \"We ought to defend what the Constitution demands: deliberation before war.\"   Kaine, Paul and Schiff are hoping more Republican members will vote in favor of the new limits. Several Republicans have voted for other war powers and use of military force resolutions led by Kaine in the past.   \n   \"I think it's probably 10 or so [Republicans] who voted yes on at least one of them,\" he said. \"So we'll start to work that.\"   It remains unclear whether there are enough Republican votes for the measure to succeed.    Kaine said Congress continues to face a \"black hole\" of information related to action against Venezuela. Lawmakers say the administration still has not shared evidence to justify the boat strikes, which Kaine and others believe are illegal and unconstitutional.   Since September, Trump has ordered at least five U.S. military strikes on boats that the administration has claimed were smuggling illegal drugs. So far, at least 27 people have been reported killed, but their identities have yet to be shared.\n",

The call came just one day before Trump is to host Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House. And many Ukraine watchers were hoping that this would be a time when Trump would turn up the heat on Russia. NPR's Michele Kelemen reports.MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: It was less than eight months ago when President Trump berated the Ukrainian president in front of cameras at the White House.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Your country is...PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY: Can I...TRUMP: ...In big...ZELENSKYY: Can I...TRUMP: ...Trouble.ZELENSKYY: Can...TRUMP: Wait a minute.ZELENSKYY: ...I answer?TRUMP: No, no. You've done a lot of talking. Your country is in big trouble.ZELENSKYY: I know.TRUMP: You're not winning.ZELENSKYY: I know.TRUMP: You're not winning this.KELEMEN: Retired diplomat Daniel Fried calls it a low point.DANIEL FRIED: But it also reflected what was a major stream of opinion within the administration. The U.S. has no strategic interests in Ukraine whatsoever, that it is a waste of resources. And there are people in the administration who maintain this position.KELEMEN: But Trump himself is evolving, says Fried, a former assistant secretary of state for Europe, now with the Atlantic Council, a think tank that promotes relations with Europe. The U.S. has gotten NATO to buy U.S. weapons for Ukraine. The Trump administration has resumed intelligence sharing, and Fried says Ukraine has been successful in striking energy infrastructure in Russia.FRIED: President Trump was impressed by Ukrainian successes in deep strikes on Russia and realized that if he's going to back Putin, he's not backing a winner. He's backing somebody who's a potential loser and deceitful.KELEMEN: Trump has repeatedly said he's been disappointed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. He's called Russia a paper tiger. And earlier this week, before his phone call with Putin, Trump said Russia is not only taking big losses on the battlefield, but its economy is suffering too.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: And I'd like to see him do well. I mean, I had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin. But he just doesn't want to end that war, and I think it's making him look very bad. He could end it. He could end it quickly.KELEMEN: Ukraine supporters in the Washington foreign policy establishment say it's time for Trump to impose more sanctions on Russia and give Ukraine the weapons and air defenses it needs. Retired naval officer Mark Montgomery is with the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies (ph). He says President Trump has given Putin the chance to negotiate an end to the war.MARK MONTGOMERY: Sometimes pushing hard for peace means understanding who is the victim and who's the aggressor. Putin is the aggressor. Russia is the aggressor. Russia will not stop unless someone bigger and tougher than them punches them in the nose. That country - for better or worse - that country is the United States.KELEMEN: And President Trump, he says, is in a position to change the course of this conflict. Daniel Fried says Ukraine could offer the U.S. something, too, not just rare earth minerals, as they've been discussing, but also drone technology.FRIED: American capital and Ukrainian know-how combined would help arm the Americans for the new wars of the 21st century, including with China. And that's something Zelenskyy can say. That is a material interest, and cooperation would benefit both sides.KELEMEN: It's a pitch that Zelenskyy made the last time he was in the U.S. at the United Nations General Assembly. At that time, Trump posted on social media that he now thinks Ukraine could take back all of its territory with help from Europe. That was a big change from February when he told Zelenskyy in that fraught Oval Office meeting that the Ukrainians didn't hold any cards.

The group chat conversations, which NPR has not independently verified, included slurs against gay people and Black people, as well as references to Nazi and white supremacist ideology. Zane Irwin of the Kansas News Service is here to talk about the reactions in his state. Hi, Zane.ZANE IRWIN, BYLINE: Hello.CHANG: So let's just start with the Republican Party leaders in Kansas. What have they said in response to all of this?IRWIN: Well, Kansas GOP leaders were really quick to condemn the comments. They said they don't reflect the beliefs of the Republican Party. As of Tuesday, also the Kansas chapter of the Young Republicans National Federation is inactive. And one of its members has actually been fired from the Kansas attorney general's office over this. I will say another wrinkle in the reaction in Kansas was from Democratic Governor Laura Kelly. She says the state Republican Party kind of set a poor example on this for its young members. For example, the party posted edited photos of her on Facebook in a mustache and a sombrero, with a caption that says she wants to give food assistance to immigrants who lack full legal status. So this report is already stirring up broader conversations in Kansas.CHANG: Clearly. OK, so we are hearing explicit criticism from Kansas Republicans of these group chat messages. But I am wondering, how does that response compare to reaction from Republicans outside of Kansas?IRWIN: You know, for the most part, it's been the same - condemnation. The national Young Republicans group called on those involved to resign. But there's one notable exception. Vice President JD Vance went on \"The Charlie Kirk Show\" to kind of downplay how serious these revelations were. Here's him talking about it.(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE CHARLIE KIRK SHOW\")JD VANCE: The reality is that kids do stupid things, especially young boys. They tell edgy, offensive jokes. Like, that's what kids do. And I really don't want us to grow up in a country where a kid telling a stupid joke - telling a very offensive stupid joke - is cause to ruin their lives.IRWIN: Vance is referring to kids in that clip...CHANG: Yeah.IRWIN: ...But I want to be clear - remember, these are adult men in their mid- to late 20s, and they hold positions of power in state and local government.CHANG: So we're talking about adults. OK, so what do you think all of this says - this whole episode? What do you think it says about what's considered acceptable speech in politics today?IRWIN: You know, there's been a lot of whataboutism (ph) kind of going around in this regard. Republicans have cited this counter example where a Democratic candidate for Virginia attorney general sent texts three years ago that promoted political violence against then-Virginia Republican House Speaker Todd Gilbert and his children. But this kind of rhetoric doesn't come from nowhere. I think some of the ideas in the chat echoed what some national Republican figures have said also. Early in the second Trump administration, for example, when a member of DOGE was found to have made racist remarks, Vance defended him then, too. He said, quote, \"I don't think stupid social media activity should ruin a kid's life.\" And President Trump backed him up on that.CHANG: That is Zane Irwin of the Kansas News Service. Thank you very much, Zane.IRWIN: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The disclosure came amid a legal fight between the administration and two federal employee unions — the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees — which sued to block what they call \"politically driven RIFs,\" or reductions in force.   \n   In a declaration filed with the court late Thursday, the plaintiffs' attorney Danielle Leonard wrote that \"multiple credible sources\" said that the Interior Department was actively preparing to lay off thousands of employees starting Monday.   \"This immediately raised concerns regarding compliance with this Court's order,\" Leonard wrote in a declaration. When the plaintiffs asked government lawyers about the claim Thursday afternoon, a Justice Department attorney responded that \"consistent with the Court's order, we will produce the required information tomorrow.\"   In response, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston agreed to move up the deadline she had imposed on the government to provide the court with \"an accounting of all RIFs, actual or imminent, that are enjoined by this [temporary restraining order].\"   \n   Illston has now asked the government to provide, by 2 p.m. ET Friday, details on the number of employees affected and a description of the programs and activities targeted for cuts.   Earlier this week, the Trump administration had informed the court that federal agencies had begun the RIF process at eight different agencies, affecting just over 4,000 people. The slight downward revision from what the administration had provided last Friday included the disclosure that roughly 800 employees within the Department of Health and Human Services were erroneously issued layoff notices.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Donald Trump listens to other speakers after delivering remarks during an event in the Oval Office of the White House on October 16.\n                \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The declaration, from Office of Management and Budget senior advisor Stephen Billy, emphasized that \"the situation… is fluid and rapidly evolving.\"   After a hearing on Wednesday, Illston granted the unions a temporary restraining order, halting the Oct. 10 layoff notices and preventing new firings until a hearing on a permanent injunction, scheduled for Oct. 28.    Illston characterized the Trump administration's approach to the RIFs as \"ready, fire, aim\" in the Wednesday hearing and said the administration was seeking to take advantage of the lapse in funding \"to assume that that all bets are off, that the laws don't apply to them anymore, and that they can impose the structures that they like on a government situation that they don't like.\"   \n   In response, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called Illston \"another far left, partisan judge.\"   Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Leavitt added that the White House is confident their actions are legal and called the layoffs \"an unfortunate consequence\" of the government shutdown.   While the White House promised \"substantial\" firings during the shutdown, the layoffs announced so far amount to only a fraction of the federal employees who have left the government since Trump returned to the White House in January.   \n   Back in August, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) said roughly 300,000 federal workers would be gone from the government by the end of the year. OPM director Scott Kupor told news outlets that 80% of those departures were voluntary.    That means even prior to the shutdown, roughly 60,000 federal workers faced involuntary separation.   Another 154,000 workers took the Trump administration's \"Fork in the Road\" buyout offer, according to OPM. Many who took the buyout told NPR they feared they would be fired if they didn't leave.   OMB Director Russ Vought said Wednesday close to 10,000 people could receive layoff notices during the shutdown, shortly before the judge blocked firing plans from taking effect.\n",

House Speaker Mike Johnson called it a \"hate America rally.\"   This summer, droves of demonstrators protested on the Army's 250th anniversary, which coincided with President Trump's birthday. In celebration of the date, Trump insisted on a massive military parade that critics said was meant to honor Trump as much as the armed service.   Now, protesters say they are speaking out against what they say are injustices perpetrated against suspected undocumented immigrants, as well as a failing health care system, efforts to tilt elections and other grievances.   The organizers said on the No Kings website: \"The president thinks his rule is absolute. But in America, we don't have kings and we won't back down against chaos, corruption, and cruelty.\"   \n   White House responds: \"Who cares?\"   When asked about the planned protests and the accusations that Trump is behaving like a monarch, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson replied, \"Who cares?\" She had no further comment.   In June, organizers estimated that 5 million people participated in a day of No Kings protests around the country in more than 2,000 events.   They are projecting an even bigger turnout this weekend.   Harvard University sociologist and assistant professor of public policy Liz McKenna said that in the past, movements of this scale have succeeded in influencing social change, but that their efficacy has dropped significantly since the turn of the century.   \n   \"We are not even a year into the Trump administration, and so I think the strategy on the part of the organizers is to show that 'we're not backing down,'\" McKenna said.   \n   But, she added: \"We've seen more people take to the streets, not just in the United States but around the world, by the millions, and in many, if not most, of those cases, the protests have not achieved their stated aims.\"   McKenna cited recent large-scale protests like Black Lives Matter and the Women's March during Trump's first term, which were highly visible but did not necessarily result in lasting change.\n",

Scott Applewhite/AP\n    \n\n   \n   More than three weeks after winning her congressional race, Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva never imagined her fight to get sworn into office would take this long.    The Arizona Democrat has keys to her office, but not much else.     \"I have no staff ... The phones don't work. There's no computer,\" Grijalva says from her sparsely furnished office on Capitol Hill. \"We don't have a government email.\"   That bumpy start to Grijalva's new political career in Washington is courtesy of the same intense, partisan tensions that have come to dominate the 119th Congress.    House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., says he won't swear in Grijalva until the government shutdown is over.    \n   \"This is the process of the House, we'll do it as soon as we get back to business,\" he said.    It's a departure for Johnson, who has previously sworn in new members from both parties within days of winning their races.    The speaker had previously said he would swear in the winner of the Arizona race as soon as they wanted. He later said the winner should enjoy the \"pomp and circumstance\" that's part of the ceremony, but only available when the government is open.    As a result, Johnson is facing accusations from both sides of the aisle that he's trying to avoid a vote to compel the release of files from the Justice Department's investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.    Grijalva won her seat on Sept. 23 in a special election to represent the state's 7th Congressional District — a border district that includes parts of Tucson.    On the campaign trail, Grijalva promised to sign onto a bipartisan petition to force a vote in the House to release the Epstein files. Hers would mark the decisive 218th signature to trigger that vote — an effort that's been led by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif.    \"I remember on election night, someone came up to me and said, 'I don't think they're going to swear you in because of those Epstein files,'\" Grijalva says. \"And I thought, 'oh my gosh, that's very much a conspiracy theory. Like that's not going to happen.' And here we are.\"   \n   Johnson has called claims that he's trying to delay Grijalva's swearing in a \"partisan manufactured thing.\"   He says Republicans are already working on releasing records as part of an investigation being led by the GOP-led House Oversight Committee.   \"The bulldogs in Congress are on that committee, and they're all joined together in a bipartisan fashion digging through and releasing documents,\" Johnson told reporters earlier this week.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., arrives to talk to reporters about the government shutdown on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.\n                \n                    J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Johnson's explanations have infuriated Grijalva's supporters. Democrats have taken to the House floor to call for her to be seated. On Tuesday, a group of lawmakers marched to Johnson's office chanting, \"Swear her in.\"    The delay has also angered those hoping for a vote on the Epstein files. Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., has accused Johnson of \"protecting pedophiles,\" and during a tense exchange outside of the speaker's office last week, said Johnson was delaying the swearing in because he does not want Grijalva to sign the discharge petition. Johnson called the allegation \"totally absurd,\" saying Democrats are \"experts at red herrings.\"     The standoff could be inching its way toward the courts. On Tuesday, after the state certified Grijalva's election results, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes threatened legal action to try to force the oath of office.    Grijalva is the daughter of her predecessor — the late Rep. Raúl Grijalva, who held the seat for more than 20 years until his death from lung cancer in March.    Grijalva says her dad set a high bar in office with his constituents, one she hopes to follow once she's finally seated.    She tears up when she considers what he would make of her fight to get seated.   \"I think he would just be kinda laughing,\" she said, \"scratching his head at like, my kid is, you know, making a splash.\"   Colorado Public Radio's Caitlyn Kim contributed to this report.\n",

More than two weeks into the shutdown, talks on Capitol Hill remain at an impasse.\n                \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   With the Trump administration staving off some of the most painful impacts of the government shutdown, and a federal court ruling pausing layoffs for thousands of federal workers, the sense of urgency on Capitol Hill for a way out of the stalemate may be gone — at least for right now.   In past shutdowns, Congress passed legislation to cover paychecks for the military, while headlines about things like closed national parks and shuttered agencies unable to provide services turned up the heat on both parties.   \n   With this shutdown, the dynamic is different. Day after day, top congressional leaders hold dueling press conferences, but there are no serious negotiations and the House hasn't voted in weeks. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., says he has no plans for the chamber to return until Senate Democrats break their opposition to a stopgap bill passed by the House to fund federal agencies through November 21.   After a 10th Senate vote to fund the government failed to advance on Thursday, Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt, said efforts to end the shutdown were \"nowhere.\" The Senate wrapped up business and went home, ensuring the shutdown will stretch into a fourth week.   One reason for the shift is that Congress has been sidelined from any effort to deal with the fallout as the Trump administration takes the lead.   \n   On Tuesday, the White House Office of Management and Budget said in a post on social media that it was \"making every preparation to batten down the hatches and ride out the Democrats' intransigence.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, speaks with reporters at the U.S. Capitol on July 15th. OMB said this week it was \"making every preparation to batten down the hatches and ride out the Democrats' intransigence.\"\n                \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Win McNamee/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The administration's efforts have taken several forms. The Pentagon shifted money around to cover the Oct. 15 paychecks of servicemembers. The administration tapped $300 million in tariff revenue to keep a nutrition program for low-income women and children operational. And on Thursday, it said it would ensure that 70,000 law enforcement officers across the Department of Homeland Security — including at TSA and ICE — would be paid \"for all hours worked during the shutdown period.\"   \n   OMB did not respond to a request for comment about additional plans to cover pay for law enforcement or other federal workers, or what kind of additional layoffs might be announced. President Trump has said \"Democrat programs\" would be cut and face permanent layoffs or closures, but no details have been released yet.   Predicting tough days ahead    Democrats broadly argue that the administration's moves are illegal, and that there's bipartisan support for bills to cover the costs of pay for soldiers and aid for low-income women and children.   And while the administration's efforts may have delayed some pain from the shutdown for targeted programs and agencies, Democrats say the moves are also prolonging the impasse by removing pressure points that served to push the parties to negotiate in the past.   The approach \"may or may not take some pressure off,\" according to Welch, but he said it's not sustainable.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Peter Welch D-Vt. questions witnesses during a hearing on Capitol Hill on July 16. Welch said efforts to end the government shutdown have gone \"nowhere.\"\n                \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Earlier this week House GOP Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., praised the president for ensuring soldiers did not miss their most recent paycheck. But more widespread impacts \"are just getting started,\" he warned.   \"Airports will be flooded with flight cancellations and delays amid the busiest time to travel all year, and the list goes on and on,\" Emmer said.   \n   Democrats are using their only point of leverage in the minority — denying the GOP enough votes to advance the stopgap funding bill passed by the House — as a way to force a debate about expiring health care subsidies. They believe the public is increasingly understanding that significant premium spikes are on the horizon if Congress doesn't act, and that could force the GOP to the table.   Rep. James Walkinshaw, D-Va., is among those who believe pressure on the GOP may soon grow. Walkinshaw represents a suburban district outside of Washington with a large number of federal workers.   \n   He says there is currently no legal mechanism to pay air traffic controllers, or a way to address what he described as the unpredictable markets facing farmers due to President Trump's tariff policies.   \"Every day that the shutdown continues, it's harder for the administration to try to play whack -a-mole and mitigate impacts.\"   November 1 could be a key date    November 1 is the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Most states will send notices laying out the cost of coverage without federal subsidies, and lawmakers on both sides openly admit the shutdown could extend for weeks. Democrats believe that could act as a mechanism to change things on Capitol Hill.   \n   \"What's so simple at the heart of this is should people who have health care in 2025 that's helped by the tax credits have access to that health care in 2026?\" Welch said in an interview. He said that in Vermont notices started going out on October 15, with some families facing increases of $25,000.    \"This is all about all our families, it's not a red state, blue state deal, or who you voted for,\" according to Welch.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., speaks during a news conference following a weekly Republican policy luncheon on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said he's happy to sit down with Democrats, but he has stressed that any health care deal \"happens after they open up the government.\" Thune says he has offered Democrats a vote on a proposal to address health care subsidies, but he cannot guarantee an outcome.   Referring to Senate Democrats, Thune said, \"these are not people who want to get things done. These are people who want to fight Trump and appease all the people who are coming into town this weekend,\" he told reporters, referring to a \"No Kings\" rally sponsored by progressive activists groups opposing the Trump administration's policies.   Democrats see Trump as the only person who can change the current dynamic. Many cite his love of a \"deal\" and the fact that voters in red states who backed him rely on the tax credits more than those in blue states.   \n   \"As soon as he gets engaged this thing can resolve within a day or two,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told reporters on Thursday.\n",

    "body": "\n      All three candidates in New York City's mayoral race faced off Thursday night in their first general election debate, sparring over crime, affordable housing and Israel.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  New York City voters are soon to choose a new mayor. Three candidates debated last night, including the leaders, state lawmaker Zohran Mamdani and former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Their exchanges included this.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ANDREW CUOMO: He literally has never had a job. On his resume, it says he interned for his mother. This is not a job for a first-timer.ZOHRAN MAMDANI: What I don't have in experience, I make up for in integrity. And what you don't have in integrity, you could never make up for in experience.INSKEEP: NPR's Brian Mann was watching. Brian, good morning.BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve.INSKEEP: Reporter with integrity and experience, we'll just note.MANN: (Laughter).INSKEEP: What was the backdrop for that exchange?MANN: Well, the Democratic Party's huge generation gap was on full display, Steve. Mamdani, of course, the rising star, the newcomer. And he's led this race by double digits. Cuomo, who's 67, is running as an independent. He lost the Democratic primary. Of course, he resigned in scandal in 2021. Now he's trying to stage this comeback. These guys don't like each other, and things got fierce last night.INSKEEP: This has gotten a lot of national attention. Leila has interviewed Mamdani on this program. People are closely following this. He's a star on Fox News, we should note. And one of many things they talked about was the Israel-Hamas war. Why is that a big deal in a mayor's race?MANN: Yeah, well, New York is home to the largest Jewish community outside Israel. And Mamdani, who's Muslim, has been outspoken, calling for Palestinian rights, criticizing Israel's war in Gaza. This was one of Cuomo's lines of attack. Here he is speaking to Mamdani.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CUOMO: There are a lot of Jewish New Yorkers who support me because they think you're antisemitic.MANN: And here's Mamdani firing back.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MAMDANI: I have denounced Hamas again and again. And it will never be enough for Andrew Cuomo because what he is willing to say, even though not on this stage, is to call me, the first Muslim on the precipice of leading this city, a terrorist sympathizer.MANN: And Mamdani has been doing a lot of outreach to Jewish leaders in the city. He's won some key endorsements. So far, Steve, this tension hasn't seemed to slow his momentum.INSKEEP: And Donald Trump also was a big figure in this, a former New Yorker.MANN: Yeah, he's a big player in this. He's intervened in the city's politics repeatedly since returning to office, threatening to cancel major federal projects, including that $16 billion Hudson River tunnel. He's blasted Mamdani on social media, describing him falsely as a communist. And actually, one of Mamdani's attack lines against Cuomo last night was his claim that the former governor is too friendly with Trump. Cuomo responded by saying he would try to avoid battles with Trump.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CUOMO: I'd like to work with you. I think we can do good things together. But I will fight you every step of the way if you try to hurt New York.MANN: One interesting thing, Steve. All three of these candidates last night, including the Republican, Curtis Sliwa, opposed two of Trump's big policies. They called on ICE agents to stop arresting migrants who don't have criminal records. And they agreed there's no need for National Guard troops on the streets of New York City.INSKEEP: How big a factor was that third candidate, Curtis Sliwa, the Republican?MANN: Yeah, Sliwa was a big deal last night for one reason. His presence on that stage made it harder for Cuomo to stay dialed in on Mamdani. Sliwa kept attacking Cuomo.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CURTIS SLIWA: You think you're the toughest guy alive. You lost your own primary, right? You were rejected by your Democrats.MANN: And again, Cuomo faced a lot of criticism last night over that sexual misconduct scandal that forced him to resign. He again denied any wrongdoing.INSKEEP: Big debate last night. Just over two weeks ago. NPR's Brian Mann is following it all. Brian, thanks so much.MANN: Thank you, Steve.(SOUNDBITE OF GREG FOAT'S \"SNAKE PLANT SHUFFLE\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Details from the indictment filed in Maryland's district court charge Bolton with eight counts for the transmission of national defense information and 10 counts of unlawful retention of such information. Each count faces a maximum of 10 years in prison.   In a statement, the Justice Department said Bolton illegally transmitted classified information using a personal email and messaging applications, including U.S. \"intelligence about future attacks, foreign adversaries, and foreign-policy relations.\"   \n   \"There is one tier of justice for all Americans,\" Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. \"Anyone who abuses a position of power and jeopardizes our national security will be held accountable.\"   The charges come about two months after the FBI executed a search warrant at Bolton's suburban Washington home. Court papers said agents recovered documents marked as classified, including references to weapons of mass destruction.   Bolton served in Trump's first term in the White House for just over a year but has since become a sharp critic of the president. He has said he believed Trump would use the Department of Justice to enact a \"retribution presidency.\"   The investigation against Bolton dates back to before Trump's return to office. Bolton's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said the charges in the case were \"resolved years ago.\" He said the charges stem from documents tied to Bolton's personal diaries, and never included classified information.   \"Like many public officials throughout history, Amb. Bolton kept diaries — that is not a crime. We look forward to proving once again that Amb. Bolton did not unlawfully share or store any information,\" Lowell said in a statement.   \n   Bolton was one of the former administration officials whose security clearances Trump stripped when he returned to office. Trump also revoked Bolton's security detail, which was in place because of threats from Iran.   Bolton published The Room Where It Happened in 2020, a memoir about his time in the White House that was critical of Trump's approach to foreign policy and the presidency in general.   The Trump administration sued to try to block the book's publication, alleging that Bolton hadn't gone through the proper clearance process and that his manuscript contained classified information. A judge declined that request, but said Bolton's conduct raised national security concerns. The Biden administration dismissed the lawsuit, and prosecutors dropped a grand jury investigation the following year.   \n   The charges against Bolton follow two other recent indictments, including against former FBI Director James Comey, another Trump critic, on one count of making false statements and one count of obstruction of justice in connection with his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee nearly five years ago.   And a grand jury indicted New York Attorney General Letitia James last week on one count of bank fraud and one count of making a false statement to a financial institution. James, a Democrat, pledged to investigate Trump and won a case against him and his company for inflating the value of some of its properties.   \n   Trump had publicly called on the Justice Department to prosecute James and Comey in a social media post last month; Bolton wasn't included in that post.   The indictments came after the top federal prosecutor in Northern Virginia cast doubt on the evidence against both Comey and James, only to be forced out by the president and replaced with one of Trump's former defense attorneys.\n",

He bookends shifts as a warehouse supervisor for a nearby factory with early morning and late night chores on his family's small farm in rural Shenandoah Valley, Virginia.   He's quick to call himself lucky. But no matter how much the 36-year-old father of two young girls works, he says they barely scrape by — and the goalposts for success keep moving.   \"I have a mortgage, and it's paid every month. But the thought of my children's birthdays or holidays terrifies me,\" Tait said. \"What if the grocery bill goes up again? I mean, I'm on a shoestring.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Tait, his partner Hannah Coogan and their two daughters walk past sheep on their farm.\n                \n                    Kirsten Luce\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kirsten Luce\n    \n\n   \n   He's among a generation of young Americans confronting a daunting reality: one of inflated prices and growing concerns about their financial futures. It's an experience facing Gen Z and millennial voters throughout the U.S., each in their own unique ways. For those living in rural communities and small towns, it's left many feeling as if their hardships have gone unseen and unaddressed by politicians vying for their support.   \n   Over the summer, Tait decided to write an essay titled \"Living in the Shadow of the American Dream.\" In it, he shared that he and his partner have put off getting married because he worries that if they did, it would force her and their daughters off Medicaid, and his job's healthcare plan is too expensive for the whole family to afford.   \"I'm not ashamed of our life. It's honest work, and it's full of love,\" Tait wrote. \"However, I am ashamed that in a country as wealthy as ours, people like us are left out in the cold.\"   By the next presidential election, Gen Z and millennials are projected to make up more than half of the electorate. But many, including Tait, say they've grown dissatisfied with political leaders as they wrestle longstanding financial concerns.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Tait prepares to feed the family's sheep, one of several daily tasks he completes around the farm. He says he constantly worries about keeping his family afloat, and wants to one day \"not just survive, but prosper.\"\n                \n                    Kirsten Luce for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kirsten Luce for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"I'm really just tired of voting for who I hate least,\" said Tait, who declined to specify how he voted in the 2024 presidential election, but said politicians should focus on improving access to quality food, healthcare and education.   \"I want somebody to inspire me,\" he added. \"It doesn't matter if you're red or blue, whatever side of the aisle you're on, like, come on, guys, what do we want?\"   \n   It's a common feeling for many young people today, and partially why President Trump's economic message may have resonated with a greater share of young voters last year, says Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist University Institute for Public Opinion.   \"He's making connections with people who are very dissatisfied with the way things are. And therefore, being a candidate who's going to disrupt and change things is a major attraction for a hunk of the electorate that is feeling that economic stress,\" he said. \"That's perhaps most profound with younger people.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Tait collects eggs every day from the chickens, which help supplement the family's groceries.\n                \n                    Kirsten Luce for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kirsten Luce for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   But those economic pressures aren't new to many in rural areas, says Nicholas Jacobs, a professor of government at Colby College. These communities have faced such issues for decades, though now, he argues, the difference is that the politics have changed.   \n   \"What I believe to be true from my surveying of rural populations and young people in rural areas is they don't feel like they have two alternatives. They do not feel like the Democratic Party gives them a set of answers to those problems,\" he said. \"I don't think most rural people feel like the Democratic Party even thinks about these problems.\"   Doubting the American Dream   After growing up during periods of financial volatility and uncertainty, economic concerns have continued to loom large for Gen Z and millennial Americans.   Younger people collectively make up more than 60% of the labor force and are poised to surpass older generations in educational attainment.   However, many still worry about having successful lives. Seven in 10 Gen Zers say jobs are difficult to find right now, along with nearly 6 in 10 millennials, according to a Marist poll from April. An analysis from Pew Research Center last year also found that both generations are less likely to say the American dream is still possible, compared to the generations before them.   \n   Housing is a major worry, with home and rental prices increasing at a faster rate than wages over the last two decades. The median age of a first-time homebuyer has also drastically increased, going from 28 in 1991 to 38 last year, according to the National Association of Realtors.   This combination of concerns has pushed some young Americans toward more left-leaning, populist ideas and caused others to feel unsatisfied by today's political leaders.   \"I don't really think that there's any one person who really is addressing it,\" said Paul Staley, 35, who lives in a small town outside Birmingham, Alabama with his wife and kids.   He's one of more than a thousand young people who responded to an NPR callout about how economic concerns have shaped their lives.   Staley works as a field service engineer fixing medical equipment.  Raised in a blue-collar household, he can see clear differences between his life and that of his father.   \"He could afford a brand new Corvette as a butcher, but these days, me with a college degree and 10 years of experience, I couldn't hope to really afford a brand new car like that,\" he said. \"The difference is too great. You don't have that same type of opportunity.\"   Staley previously voted for Trump but says he has since gravitated more towards the political center, acknowledging that while he remains interested in the president's economic agenda and did benefit from his tax cut policy, he wants to see additional action on things like rising costs and worker protections.   Those two issues in particular have drawn him more recently to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Zohran Mamdani, the Democrats' nominee for mayor in New York.   \n   \"These issues are pushing people to their ideological — I don't want to say extremes — but to the end of the political spectrum … I think the answer lies more somewhere in the middle,\" he said. \"Hard work needs to mean more.\"   Feeling left behind    For others, what matters is opportunities, rather than politics.   Julie Hill, 22, lives in rural northwest Pennsylvania. She says politicians often overlook communities like hers.   \"It can be hard to kind of feel like we're being seen,\" said Hill, who identifies as an independent but voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris last year. \"It seems like rural areas get left behind sometimes.\"   \n   Hill is unemployed, currently part of an outpatient rehab program as she deals with mental health challenges, and she's also had to support herself financially after losing family in recent years.   Her dream is to own a home one day, with enough land to raise animals. She loves horses and is still pained by the memory of having to give up her own horse as a teenager when finances got tight.   \n   That said, Hill admits that homeownership is far away for her, recalling that all the homeowners she knows either inherited land or bought decades earlier when prices were lower.   \"They kind of had that support upfront. They had a place to kind of start out, I guess, whereas I'm starting from complete scratch,\" she said. \"It seems like even just an acre around here is as much as a house was like probably 30, 40 years ago.\"   Hill wants to have hope that her American dream can become a reality, but says it doesn't feel possible right now.   \"The story of Sisyphus and the rock, that's kind of what it feels like. You're just pushing that rock up every day just to have it roll back down again,\" she said. \"I've felt like that for a long time, so be nice to be able to get the rock up top and then be able to start building.\"\n",

PAUL, Minn. — Sen. Amy Klobuchar announced her run for Minnesota governor early Thursday with a video posted on X, following Gov. Tim Walz's recent announcement that he was ending his bid for a third term in the role.   \"Minnesotans, we've been through a lot,\" Klobuchar said in the video, going on to recount several tragedies the state has faced in recent months, including the separate shootings of two American citizens by ICE agents.   \"We cannot sugarcoat how hard this is,\" she said. \"But in these moments of enormous difficulty, we find strength in our Minnesota values of hard work, freedom and simple decency and goodwill.\"    \n   \"I believe we will stand up for what's right and fix what's wrong,\" Klobuchar added before making it official. \"That's why, today, I'm announcing my candidacy for governor of Minnesota.\"   \n            Minnesotans, we’ve been through a lot.And I believe this moment calls for grit, resilience, and faith in each other. I believe we must stand up for what’s right. And fix what’s wrong. Today, I’m announcing my candidacy for Governor. pic.twitter.com/yVnbvmMyxO— Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) January 29, 2026\n   \n   Klobuchar, who won a fourth Senate term in 2024, has racked up double-digit wins in each of her races. In 2020, she ran an unsuccessful presidential campaign among a crowded field of Democratic candidates.   When Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz announced that he would drop his bid for reelection, the idea of Klobuchar entering the race began to emerge.   \"I like my job very much,\" Klobuchar told Minnesota Public Radio on Wednesday, ahead of Thursday's announcement. \"And Minnesota has given me this honor of serving them in the Senate. But I love my state more.\"   Walz faced criticism from state Republicans to President Trump for allegations of rampant social-services fraud on his watch. There is no evidence that Walz took part in the fraud or committed any other crimes, but his political opponents say that he failed to stop the wholesale theft of taxpayer funds during his time in office.   As a sitting governor, Walz was not facing any competition from other Democratic hopefuls. Yet more than a dozen Republicans are in the governor's race, including House Speaker Lisa Demuth, the state's top Republican, businessman Kendall Qualls, state Rep. Kristin Robbins and My Pillow founder and CEO Mike Lindell.   \n   Klobuchar's entrance could upend that GOP field as well, as some of the candidates reassess their chances of defeating a durable statewide official instead of the politically wounded Walz.   Last week, when Klobuchar filed initial paperwork to run for governor, the Minnesota Republican Party called on her to resign from the Senate while she campaigns for another office.   \"Minnesota needs a governor who is all in — not a Washington insider running a gutless political audition,\" Minnesota Republican Party Chair Alex Plechash said in a statement. \"If Klobuchar can't even choose which job she wants, Minnesotans can be confident she won't have the backbone to fix the problems Democrats created.\"   Former Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty is among those who have said Republicans' chances at winning the governor's seat for the first time in 20 years would weaken if Klobuchar joined the race.   \"That's going to fundamentally change the governor's race in Minnesota,\" Pawlenty told MPR News. \"She would be a very, very formidable candidate in that race and so it changes everything.\"\n",

And it is a lot more than the administration has signaled it wants to spend. NPR's Fatma Tanis reports.FATMA TANIS, BYLINE: Congress is allocating $50 billion for foreign aid in the spending package. It includes some military aid to Egypt and Israel and funding for initiatives aimed at supporting democracy and health programs around the world. Last year, the administration dismantled much of America's foreign aid systems and sent back billions of dollars that Congress had earmarked for foreign aid in 2025. Those moves were largely approved by a Republican-led Congress, but this bill appears to signal a change of heart, says foreign aid expert Jonathan Katz.JONATHAN KATZ: The surprising factor is that you see Congress saying, we want to fund foreign assistance, from global health to food security to even democracy support.TANIS: Katz is with the Brookings Institution. He worked in foreign aid during the Obama administration. He says there's been concern from both sides of the aisle over how the reduction in funding last year impacted global health and humanitarian assistance. Many people lost access to clinics and medicine and food. And, Katz says, there's fear that this reduction in American aid could also lead to the U.S. losing influence around the world.KATZ: I think there's a bit of buyer's remorse when it comes to U.S. engagement globally - meaning the soft power withdrawal of the United States that President Trump's policies have been leading to.TANIS: But others in the foreign aid community wanted to see a Congress that's more aligned with the administration on foreign aid. The State Department's new strategy focuses on making one-on-one deals with low-income countries, investing in their health ministries and requiring those governments to chip in too. Max Primorac is an analyst with The Heritage Foundation. He previously held senior roles at USAID and thinks Congress has allocated too much overall.MAX PRIMORAC: It's always the problem of overfunding.TANIS: Primorac says he approves the lack of funding in the bill for programs that support gender equality, LGBTQ issues and climate solutions, which are in line with the Trump administration's views. But, he says, there was one surprise - $9.4 billion for programs aimed at curbing diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria and addressing maternal and child health and other issues. The global health bucket is largely similar to funding levels from previous years.PRIMORAC: It's too much money, and keeping alive an industry, quite frankly, that has been living off of the taxpayer money for far too long.TANIS: He says aid groups spend too much taxpayer money on overhead costs rather than actual health issues. Instead, he says, the administration's new strategy encourages self-sufficiency in low-income countries.PRIMORAC: My concern there is that it could actually upend the reforms of this administration by creating disincentives for these African states to take more financial ownership and therefore more responsibility if they see that this money has to be spent anyway.TANIS: The package is expected to be signed if and when it lands on the president's desk, but both Katz and Primorac agree that the administration could ask Congress to take back the funds like it did last year.Fatma Tanis, NPR News.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

Melania, a big-budget movie about first lady Melania Trump, premieres today with a splashy event at the newly renamed Trump Kennedy Center in Washington, DC. It is set to open on 1,500 screens in the U.S. this weekend, a highly unconventional rollout compared to other films of this type.   Amazon acquired the film for $40 million and is spending another $35 million on marketing, according to a source with direct knowledge who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media.   \"It's just hard to imagine why this number is justified for 'Melania,'\" said Jason Spingarn-Koff, a professor of journalism at UC Berkeley.   \n   Spingarn-Koff is a former Netflix executive who has worked on hundreds of documentaries. He says the market for documentary films these days is depressed, and even Oscar-nominated documentaries aren't getting shown on as many screens, if any.   Questions about how much the first lady is personally making from the film and whether its outsized budget could have been an effort to curry favor with the president were not answered by the White House or Mrs. Trump's personal office.   The film follows Mrs. Trump for 20 days in January as she prepares to re-enter the White House as first lady.   \"Here we go again,\" she says, looking directly at a camera as she enters the U.S. Capitol for her husband's second inauguration. It is one of several quick cuts in a trailer that features dramatic music, glamorous visuals, and an intriguing moment of spousal interaction, in which she calls him \"Mr. President.\"   \n   \"Did you watch it?\" he asks, though the trailer doesn't reveal what \"it\" is.   \"I did not, yeah, I will see it on the news,\" Mrs. Trump says as the music swells again.   In an interview earlier this week on Fox and Friends, Trump was asked about the decision to include that scene. She said she was \"very involved in leading the production and choosing the trailer.\"   \"I want to show the people that they will see the communications and private communications between me and my husband,\" said Mrs. Trump, further teasing her film.   \n   Amazon did not release an advance screener to journalists and reviewers as is typically done to promote a film, and all scheduled Thursday screenings in theaters were cancelled. Ticket sales had been anemic and were getting mocked on social media and by late-night talk show hosts.   On its surface, this would seem to be a documentary, but the first lady is also an executive producer.   \"In these situations, you could only have one take, so whatever we got it, we got it,\" Mrs. Trump said in her \"Fox and Friends\" interview. \"And I had a great team around me and a very talented director.\"   That director is Brett Ratner, known for the Rush Hour action films and for being ostracized in 2017 after accusations of sexual misconduct. He denies wrongdoing. He is not a documentary filmmaker. Mrs. Trump said in another Fox News interview that she chose him because he would execute her vision of a cinematic film.   \"Once the subject of the film is a producer or has … editorial input or even editorial control, then I really think we are in the realm of public relations or in this case it seems to be a work of myth making,\" said Spingarn-Koff.   The first lady has a very carefully cultivated and controlled image, which has created an air of mystery around her, one she is capitalizing on with this film.   Kate Bennett, who wrote a book about Melania Trump and covered her for years at CNN, says people are always looking for clues about what Melania Trump is really thinking or who she really is.   \"I don't think the public will ever really know the deep inner thoughts and behind-the-scenes moments of Melania Trump, by design,\" said Bennett. \"She is a private person in her DNA.\"   And, Bennett says, she is also at her core a Trump, a marketer, who rarely appeared during the campaign without getting a financial cut.   \n   \"There's something really interesting to the fact that we're seeing her the most during this presidency on a screen, in a theater,\" said Bennett. \"That's unlike anything we've seen in traditional politics.\"   Editor's note: Amazon is among NPR's recent financial supporters and pays to distribute some NPR content.\n",

The Jan. 29, 2025, directive targeted antisemitism on campus and launched investigations at five schools — later widened to 60.   But within weeks of the executive order, federal agencies started withholding billions of dollars in contracts and grants from several high-profile schools and pressuring them to align their policies more closely with Trump's on a range of issues that extended beyond antisemitism.   \n   Elite universities soon began reaching settlements, starting with the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University in July. Harvard University was a notable exception, challenging the administration's actions in court. In September, a federal judge ruled in Harvard's favor that the government illegally froze more than $2 billion in federal grants and contracts, a decision the government is appealing. Despite Harvard's victory, more schools agreed to deals.    Some universities paid the government millions of dollars; others paid nothing but agreed to policy or personnel changes. But a common theme has emerged over the past year: The administration is seeking to alter the culture at these powerful institutions, barring them, for instance, from supporting programs aimed at diversity, equity and inclusion.   \n   Loading...\n   What is the administration's goal? And can it do that?    Universities have stressed that reaching a settlement doesn't mean they admit to any wrongdoing. But the deals have called for colleges to agree to policy changes, like adopting definitions of gender as laid out by the president's executive orders, affecting everything from campus housing to athletic programs.   \"In just a year, President Trump has completely transformed American higher education by restoring merit, enforcing civil rights, and eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse,\" White House spokesperson Liz Huston told NPR in an email. Huston said the Trump administration \"will keep holding even more [higher education institutions] accountable over the next three years — to promote academic excellence and maintain America's advantage for generations to come.\"   \n   But Trump's use of federal funds to force changes has raised questions from constitutional scholars about whether his tactics violate the law.   \"What I find striking and disturbing about what's happened here,\" says Thomas Berry, the director of constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, \"is that the federal government started by simply pausing all of this funding\" without proving its allegations.   Berry says that Cato doesn't love the idea of private universities being dependent on federal funds. But he also says the government shouldn't use that relationship to meddle in how schools would normally operate.   \n   \"To me, it's a blatant violation of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine of the First Amendment,\" says Berry.   The idea behind that doctrine is that a government can't say someone has to give up a constitutional right such as free speech or they won't get a benefit — like federal money.   Echoing Berry's point, Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors, says, \"Six or seven [Supreme Court] rulings from 1920 onwards all held that the federal government cannot use purse strings to control speech.\"   \n   The government has formal processes to enforce civil rights statutes and court rulings, but Berry says the Trump administration isn't using those tools. Instead, he says, the administration seems to be channeling Trump's history of filing lawsuits to accomplish his business and personal goals.   \"Trump has such a long history as a private citizen of suing individual people or individual entities and dealing with them one at a time,\" he says. \"But it's concerning when it's from the federal government.\"   \n   The American Association of University Professors has sued the Trump administration in several venues over its withholding of funds and grants. Its president, Wolfson, is blunt in characterizing the settlements.   \"It was extortion.\"   He also says the government's actions are unconstitutional and undermine academic freedoms, while endangering research projects that can benefit the American public.   Still, the government secured significant payments and concessions from a slate of well-regarded universities in 2025:   Northwestern University:    The Illinois school agreed in late November to pay $75 million to the government over three years to unlock some $790 million in frozen federal money and end civil rights investigations by several agencies.The Trump administration had accused Northwestern of allowing antisemitism to spread on campus, related to protests against Israel's attacks on Gaza.Northwestern's interim president, Henry Bienen, said that the university had been paying some $40 million every month to maintain research and that the deal was \"the best and most certain method\" to restore federal funding. A legal battle would likely have lasted for years, he said.Policy changes that Northwestern agreed to included terminating the Deering Meadow Agreement, a 2024 pact with demonstrators under which the university had, among other things, provided temporary space for two Middle Eastern and Muslim student groups.   \n   Cornell University:    Faced with losing more than $250 million in federal funds, Cornell announced a deal with the government on Nov. 7. The government closed civil rights investigations that focused on Cornell's compliance with antidiscrimination laws in its admissions procedures.Cornell will pay a total of $60 million over three years: $30 million to the government and $30 million for \"research to strengthen U.S. agriculture,\" according to the university's president, Michael Kotlikoff.Cornell also agreed to use guidance from the Justice Department \"as a training resource to faculty and staff.\" That July 2025 memo from Attorney General Pam Bondi equates DEI programs to \"discriminatory practices.\"   University of Virginia:    UVA's interim president, Paul Mahoney, signed a deal with the Justice Department on Oct. 22, months after then-President Jim Ryan resigned. Ryan had said the federal government threatened to gut funding if he remained. The university received more than $400 million in federal research funds in the 2024 financial year. The Justice Department had opened seven investigations into UVA in nine weeks, many of them related to the school's response to Trump's order to end diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.UVA isn't required to pay a fine or set up an external monitor of its practices. The school affirmed it will follow civil rights laws, and it also agreed to adopt Bondi's guidance on what constitutes discrimination.   Brown University:    On July 30, Brown University agreed to pay $50 million over 10 years to local workforce development organizations. The deal emerged after the White House said it would freeze $510 million of federal funding due to allegations of antisemitism on Brown's campus and the school's diversity, equity and inclusion work.Under the deal, Brown also pledged to adopt definitions of \"male\" and \"female\" as laid out in a Trump executive order, and to not consider race in its admissions and programming.   Columbia University:    In late July, the White House and Columbia University said the university would pay some $221 million to resolve several investigations, as NPR reported. The school previously said the government suspended \"the majority\" of $1.3 billion in federal research funding.The settlement calls for Columbia to pay $200 million over three years related to the administration's allegations of discriminatory practices, and $21 million to settle an investigation into workplace harassment related to the college's Jewish employees.Among other measures, the settlement stipulates that Columbia won't consider race in admissions, programming or hiring, will provide a demographic and academics breakdown of all rejected and admitted students, and will review its international admissions process.   \n   University of Pennsylvania:    On July 1, the school, Trump's alma mater, reached an agreement that included revising records related to a transgender swimmer's results, as well as its policies on transgender athletes, after the Trump administration froze $175 million of federal funding. In 2022, Lia Thomas, a transgender athlete at Penn, won high-profile swimming titles at the women's Ivy League championships.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Juana Summers speaks with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., on recent developments around the federal immigration enforcement surge in her home state.   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED for NPR News. I'm Mary Louise Kelly in Washington.JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  And I'm Juana Summers in Minneapolis, where a memorial has sprung up for Alex Pretti, the 37-year-old protester killed by federal immigration agents on Saturday.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Vocalizing)SUMMERS: Last night, with temperatures around zero, people stood in an oval surrounding it, some offering cups of tea or hand warmers. There were flowers, candles and signs. One reads, you can't break us. Another reads, ICE will melt - spring will come. Pretti's killing and the shooting death of Renee Macklin Good by ICE officers have shocked the city and the country.The Trump administration has replaced the leadership of its Minneapolis operation with border czar Tom Homan. But criticism of the federal government's immigration enforcement surge, which continue over the objections of state and local authorities, has hardly stopped. For more, we've reached Senator Amy Klobuchar. She's one of two Democrats who represent Minnesota in the U.S. Senate. Welcome back to the program.AMY KLOBUCHAR: Thank you, Juana. It's wonderful to be on again.SUMMERS: It's great to talk with you. And there's a lot I want to get to, but I do want to start with this. There was an incident that happened last night in Minneapolis where your colleague, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, was rushed by a man during a town hall event Tuesday night and sprayed with liquid via syringe. She's posted on her social media and said that she's OK. I wonder, what's your reaction to this? And does it raise security concerns for you?KLOBUCHAR: My first reaction was, is Ilhan OK? And I actually talked to her about an hour after the town hall ended. And she was in good spirits, as good as she can be. And I think one of the things that was kind of extraordinary is she continued on with the town hall. The security was there. They had used wanding to make sure there were no weapons when people had come into the meeting. So under most accounts, for most members, you would think that was good enough. One of the things that happened here, which doesn't always happen, is there was widespread condemnation of this, including from the Republican Party of Minnesota that said these attacks had no place in our politics. And, of course, the Democratic Party.SUMMERS: Shifting gears a bit. Your state's governor, Tim Walz, and Minneapolis' mayor, Jacob Frey, have each met now with Tom Homan, who President Trump has dispatched to aid ICE operations here in Minnesota. And for his part, Mayor Frey characterized this as a productive conversation. But in a social media post, he did add that his main goal was for the federal government to end the operation here as quickly as possible. Senator, have you been in touch with Tom Homan or the White House recently about the operation here?KLOBUCHAR: Well, I will be talking with him soon. But I've been mainly focused on working with the White House, really over the last few weeks. I actually last week told them, high-ranking officials there, that someone else would be killed because of this operation. There are 3,000 ICE officers still in our state. And I am glad that the Border Patrol people have been pulled out, or at least a big chunk of them. But there are still ICE officers there. And you just can't have a situation where you have ICE officers that are overwhelming local police. Eleven hundred sworn police officers - Minneapolis, St. Paul, - 3,000 ICE officers. It's even more than the 10 metropolitan police offices combined. That means all these suburbs.And our police chiefs have been clear statewide, nationally that this isn't making Minnesota or other states safer. It's making them less safe. I believe that they need to get ICE out of Minnesota. The original idea that they were going to assist with fraud investigations? Great. But this has gone way beyond that. That they would be focused on apprehending violent offenders, that's worthy.SUMMERS: I just - if I can, Senator.KLOBUCHAR: Go ahead.SUMMERS: I want to put to you what President Trump said yesterday. He signaled that he wanted to de-escalate the crackdown in your state. But later on, he described people arrested by ICE in Minnesota here as, quote, \"hardened, vicious, horrible criminals.\" What is your response to his rhetoric?KLOBUCHAR: We know from reporting from The Wall Street Journal that about 4% of people that have been arrested nationally are what they call the worst of the worst. But what we've seen - and I'm sure there are some in Minnesota. I know there are, and that's fine, but that's not what's going on here. In fact, they've been picking up 2-year-olds, sending them to Texas. My office had to work on this case and got a successful result. And then we got this 2-year-old back to her mom.Hmong elders who are pulled out of their house by mistake in their underwear, 5-year-olds, schoolkids, teachers being chased in parking lots, legal citizens repeatedly. Our office is handling over 400 cases. So that is why right now in Congress, we are focused on getting this agency overhauled. They already have way too much money. They were given $75 billion from the Republican bill. They're bigger than the FBI.SUMMERS: That's in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.KLOBUCHAR: Yes.SUMMERS: So I have a question there about this funding issue, though. Given the fact that a huge increase in ICE funding that you mentioned already passed in that bill, what would limiting these appropriations actually effectively do to put pressure on DHS in the near term? I understand that Friday is the deadline to avoid another partial government shutdown.KLOBUCHAR: I am opposed, as are so many of my Democratic colleagues, to this budget that has been proposed for ICE. There is also a major effort underway to use the power of our votes to overhaul ICE. And I'll just give you some ideas. Stopping the surge, getting ICE out of Minnesota and other places. The training that has been reduced to 47 days, for the 47th president, when it should be months and months of training. Getting rid of these masks, and in fact, requiring mandatory body cameras.Ending the bounty system, which has resulted in them picking people up, sending them to detention and releasing them because they still get a bounty. Breaking into someone's home without a judicial warrant. Changing the leadership. I mean, that's just a few ideas here, because we all know your eyes don't lie when you see the video of the killing of Alex. You see what actually happened. So I think, having talked to Alex's parents, the rhetoric used by the administration calling him a domestic terrorist, calling him a would-be assassin has been the most hurtful thing to their family.SUMMERS: I just want to press you again on this issue of funding.KLOBUCHAR: Sure.SUMMERS: Are you and your fellow Senate Democrats willing to shut down the government over the issue of funding for the Department of Homeland Security?KLOBUCHAR: So here's what we want to see happen. There's a number of bills, five bills that have strong bipartisan support for different agencies that can be approved. Separate out Homeland Security, which includes ICE, and then make these necessary forms to ICE. So we are united on that. And I think the better question is, are Republicans willing to come to the table for once to actually talk about the changes that they know in their heart need to be made. If they believe in liberty and the Constitution - if they believe in the First Amendment right to assembly, the Fourth Amendment protection against search and seizure, the Second Amendment right to bear arms, the Fifth Amendment right to due process - then they should be standing with us.SUMMERS: Senator, have you heard that willingness from your Republican colleagues? Do they seem prepared to come to the table on this issue of reforming ICE, as you say, or to stop funding for ICE?KLOBUCHAR: They have been talking with us in small groups, one on one. And I think there is some interest. And so they're going to have to understand that Democrats are insisting on this. And that's what's happening right now.SUMMERS: Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat from Minnesota. Thank you so much.KLOBUCHAR: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

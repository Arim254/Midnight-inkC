But the stunning military action comes at a time when Trump has also freed or pardoned other convicted drug dealers and people accused of ties to drug gangs and cartels - notably the former president of Honduras.     Targeting a 'campaign of deadly narco-terrorism'   Venezuela's Maduro and Flores face charges of \"drug trafficking and narco-terrorism conspiracies,\" according to an indictment made public by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.  \"They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,\" Bondi said in a post on social media.   \n   The Justice Department charged Maduro in March 2020, during Trump's first administration, in connection with alleged narcoterrorism and drug smuggling into the United States.   That indictment alleged Maduro was the leader of the Cartel de los Soles, and that he and other defendants took part in a narco-terrorism conspiracy with the Colombian guerrilla group known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).   During a Saturday news conference, Trump acknowledged other motives that led him to order the attack, including his desire to seize control of Venezuela's oil fields.  But he pointed to drug trafficking as a key factor, accusing Maduro of a \"campaign of deadly narco-terrorism against the United States and its citizens.\"   \n            Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, have been indicted in the Southern District of New York.  Nicolas Maduro has been charged with Narco-Terrorism Conspiracy, Cocaine Importation Conspiracy, Possession of Machineguns and Destructive Devices, and Conspiracy to Possess…— Attorney General Pamela Bondi (@AGPamBondi) January 3, 2026\n   \n   Since taking office, Trump has rapidly shifted the fight against drug overdose deaths in the U.S. from a public health response to aggressive interdiction efforts led in unprecedented ways by the U.S. military.     Trump has designated a growing number of drug cartels as terrorist organizations, ordered the U.S. Navy to target alleged drug boats in a series of deadly strikes, and designated the street opioid fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction.     The shift, and Saturday's military action, has drawn praise from conservative supporters.     \n   \"[Maduro's capture]  is a massive improvement over what we've had, which is a narco-dictatorship, which has been weaponizing drugs and mass migration against the United States,\" said Andrés Martínez-Fernández, an expert on Latin America at the Heritage Foundation, in a statement posted on social media.   \n   But despite Trump's tough rhetoric and actions, he also has sparked controversy by some of his recent pardons.   'Using the drug war as an excuse'   Last month, Trump freed former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who had been convicted in the U.S. of helping smuggle more than 400 tons of cocaine into the U.S.     Jeffrey Singer, a drug policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, said given Trump's pattern of leniency for some alleged drug criminals, he's skeptical that narcotics interdiction was a serious goal of Saturday's operation in Venezuela.    \"If this is what's motivating [Trump], if it's stopping drug trafficking, why is he pardoning the Honduran president who was convicted of cocaine trafficking?  It's never been about that,\" he said.   According to Singer, it's dangerous for the U.S. government to use criminal drug charges as justification for the military invasion of another country, and seizure of a foreign leader, without first getting authorization from Congress. \"They're basically using the drug war as an excuse,\" he added.   \n   During his news conference on Saturday, Trump said his decision to pardon Honduras's former president reflected his belief that Hernandez was prosecuted unfairly by the Biden administration.    \"This was a man who was persecuted very unfairly,\" he said, without offering evidence.  \"That man was treated very badly and unfairly, that's why I gave him a pardon.\"   Tough talk, yet some drug criminals go free   But Hernandez isn't an isolated case.  During his second term, Trump has pardoned and released a significant number of other figures involved in drug trafficking, including Ross Ulbricht who was serving a life sentence for creating a \"dark web\" site known as Silk Road, used by drug traffickers.     \n   \"Ulbricht deliberately operated Silk Road as an online criminal marketplace intended to enable its users to buy and sell drugs and other illegal goods,\" said the DOJ in a 2015 statement.   Trump also granted clemency to Larry Hoover, 74, who was serving multiple life sentences in federal prison for crimes, including drug trafficking, linked to his role leading the Chicago-based Gangster Disciples.   In August, Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia raised \"serious concern\" after the Trump administration freed and deported to El Salvador a man named Cesar Humberto Lopez-Lario, accused by the DOJ of being \"a high-ranking leader\" of the drug gang MS-13.   \"Such a decision not only undercuts ongoing federal investigations but also threatens U.S. national security,\" Garcia wrote.   Previously, during his first term in the White House, Trump's administration also freed Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda, Mexico's former Secretary of National Defense in 2020.  Cienfuegos faced accusations in the U.S. of partnering closely with drug cartels that funneled vast amounts of drugs into the U.S.     \"There's a lot of mixed messages and mixed signals [from the White House] which creates sort of chaos and uncertainty,\" said Singer at the Cato Institute, in a May interview with NPR. \"On the one hand you're threatening even tougher penalties on people who deal in drugs, while on the other hand you're releasing drug dealers from prisons.\"   -Portions of this developing story were published in a previous NPR news report on May 31, 2025.\n",

Flores and other senior Venezuelan officials, including Maduro's son, are also facing charges.    Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a post on X, wrote that Maduro and his wife \"will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts.\"    \n   \n            Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, have been indicted in the Southern District of New York.  Nicolas Maduro has been charged with Narco-Terrorism Conspiracy, Cocaine Importation Conspiracy, Possession of Machineguns and Destructive Devices, and Conspiracy to Possess…— Attorney General Pamela Bondi (@AGPamBondi) January 3, 2026\n   \n   According to the indictment, for more than 25 years Venezuela's leaders \"have abused their positions of public trust and corrupted once-legitimate institutions to import tons of cocaine into the United States.\"   It alleges that starting as early as 1999, Maduro and his co-defendants have partnered with international drug trafficking organizations — including Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel and the Zetas, Colombian narco-terrorist groups and the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua — to ship illicit drugs into the U.S.    \n   Venezuela's political and military elite enriched themselves while providing protection and logistical support to the drug traffickers, according to the indictment.    It also details specific actions that Maduro allegedly took as part of the conspiracy. It says, for example, that between 2006 and 2008 when he served as foreign minister that Maduro sold Venezuelan diplomatic passports to known drug traffickers \"in order to assist traffickers seeking to move drug proceeds form Mexico to Venezuela under diplomatic cover.\"   He also allegedly facilitated the flights of private planes under diplomatic cover to bring drug proceeds back from Mexico to Venezuela.    Prosecutors allege that Maduro and Flores worked together for years to traffic cocaine that had previously been seized by Venezuelan law enforcement. They say the Maduros had their own state-sponsored gangs to protect their operation, and that they ordered \"kidnappings, beating and murders against those who owed them drug money or otherwise undermined their drug trafficking operation.\"   \n   The new indictment adds to charges against Maduro and other Venezuelan officials that were announced in March 2020 during the first Trump administration.    \n   Maduro denied those initial charges and called for dialogue with the U.S., before being captured.   The current Trump administration has ramped up the pressure on Maduro over the past year. The U.S. raised the bounty for Maduro's arrest to $50 million, and designated the Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization.    Separately, the International Criminal Court has been investigating the Venezuelan government for alleged torture, sexual violence and arbitrary detentions.   This is a developing story, which may be updated.\n",

President Trump announced early Saturday morning that Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores are on a U.S. Navy ship en route to New York, where they will face trial on drug, arms and conspiracy charges. Trump said the U.S. will \"run\" Venezuela until there is a \"safe, proper and judicious transition.\"   \n   The White House briefed some Congressional leadership after the operation began, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters, adding that Congress could not be notified in advance because it would have endangered the mission.   \n   \"Congress has a tendency to leak,\" Trump told reporters on Saturday. \"This would not be good.\"   Trump is scheduled to meet with all House Republicans on Tuesday at the Kennedy Center, according to a source familiar with the planning who was not authorized to speak on the record. Lawmakers from both parties have called for broader meetings and briefings.   Top Congressional Republicans praised Trump, even as they said some say they still have questions about how the operation unfolded and what will happen next.   \"President Trump's decisive action to disrupt the unacceptable status quo and apprehend Maduro, through the execution of a valid Department of Justice warrant, is an important first step to bring him to justice for the drug crimes for which he has been indicted in the United States,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune wrote in a statement.   \"I spoke to Secretary Rubio early this morning, and I look forward to receiving further briefings from the administration on this operation as part of its comprehensive counternarcotics strategy when the Senate returns to Washington next week,\" Thune wrote.   \n   Republicans respond   In recent months, some Congressional Republicans have expressed reservations about the Trump Administration's actions in Latin America. The Administration has carried out 35 strikes on alleged drug boats, killing at least 115 people since early September.   Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.), a member of the House Armed Services Committee, wrote in a statement that the operation will be positive for Venezuelans and the region.   \"My main concern now is that Russia will use this to justify their illegal and barbaric military actions against Ukraine, or China to justify an invasion of Taiwan,\" Bacon wrote. \"Freedom and rule of law were defended last night, but dictators will try to exploit this to rationalize their selfish objectives.\"   Early this morning, Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) initially expressed questions about the constitution justifications of acting without a declaration of war or authorization of force from Congress.   But Lee later said he spoke to Rubio who told him that, \"the kinetic action we saw tonight was deployed to protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant.\"   \"This action likely falls within the president's inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack,\" Lee wrote.   Democrats demand briefings and justification   But Congressional Democrats redoubled criticism of the Trump Administration's actions and questions about the legal authority to intervene without Congressional approval.   House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-NY, released a statement on Saturday calling for the House and Senate to be briefed \"immediately\" with \"compelling evidence to explain and justify this unauthorized use of military force should be presented forthwith.\"   \n   Jeffries called Maduro \"a criminal and authoritarian dictator\" and said he \"is not the legitimate head of government\" but said Trump had a constitutional responsibility to follow the law and \"has not sought congressional authorization for the use of military force and has failed to properly notify Congress in advance of the operation in Venezuela.\"   \"Pursuant to the Constitution, the framers gave Congress the sole power to declare war as the branch of government closest to the American people,\" Jeffries said.   \n   Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told NPR the strikes make clear that it is time for Congress to step in and exercise the branch's constitutional duties.   \"I think these strikes are clearly illegal,\" Kaine said Saturday in an interview on NPR's Weekend Edition. \"They have not been authorized by Congress. And the Constitution is clear that the U.S. doesn't engage in military action or war without a vote of Congress except in cases of imminent self-defense. The Constitution is absolutely clear on that.\"   Kaine also said he will call for a vote this week on his bipartisan resolution barring intervention in Venezuela without Congressional approval. A similar Senate resolution previously failed to attract enough Republican votes.   \"We can't, with a straight face, make the argument that we support the sovereignty of nations if we're willing to engage in a unilateral, presidentially declared war against Venezuela,\" Kaine said. \"And thus he is really undercutting US moral and stance for an international rule of law where nations can invade each other willy nilly just because a president decides it's a good idea to do so.\"\n",

But the invasion also faces significant skepticism, questions about legality, and full-throated opposition from some elected officials across the political spectrum.     Here's a survey.   Some Republicans condemn, or question, Trump's invasion   While most conservative lawmakers voiced support for Trump's action, a small group of Republican House members and GOP Senators described the move as unlawful or misguided.   \n   \"If the President believes military action against Venezuela is needed, he should make the case and Congress should vote before American lives and treasure are spent on regime change in South America,\" said Rep. Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, speaking on the House floor.  \"Do we truly believe that Nicolás Maduro will be replaced by a modern-day George Washington?  How did that work out in Cuba, Libya, Iraq or Syria?\"   \n   Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., posting on social media, voiced skepticism that the true goal of Trump's invasion was to stop the flow of drugs into the United States. She also described the military action as a violation of conservative \"America First\" principles.   \"Americans disgust with our own government's never ending military aggression and support of foreign wars is justified because we are forced to pay for it and both parties, Republicans and Democrats, always keep the Washington military machine funded and going,\" Greene posted on X.  \"This is what many in MAGA thought they voted to end. Boy were we wrong.\"   Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., a retired U.S. Air Force Brigadier General, generally praised the military operation, but he also said the precedent of U.S. military intervention could embolden more aggressive action by authoritarian regimes in China and Russia.    \n   \"Freedom and rule of law were defended last night,\" Bacon said on X, referring to the invasion of Venezuela, \"but dictators will try to exploit this to rationalize their selfish objectives.\"   At least three Republican Senators also voiced concern or skepticism about the invasion and its legal justification, while also celebrating the fall of Maduro.    \"In this case, a leader who monopolized central power is removed in an action that monopolizes central power,\" Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul wrote on the platform X.  \"Best though, not to forget, that our founders limited the executive's power to go to war without Congressional authorization for a reason—to limit the horror of war and limit war to acts of defense.\"    GOP Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, both of Alaska, said Maduro's ouster would make the United States and the world safer, but suggested the operation could turn into a quagmire for U.S. troops.    \"Late last year, I voted to proceed to debate on two resolutions that would have terminated the escalation of U.S. military operations against Venezuela absent explicit authorization from Congress,\" Murkowski wrote on the platform X.  She added that she expects further briefings from Trump officials on the \"legal basis for these operations.\"   \"The lessons learned from what took place after the United States deposed another Latin American indicted drug lord—Panama's Manuel Noriega in 1989—could prove useful, as could the painful and difficult lessons learned after the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003,\" Sullivan wrote on X.   \n   Most Democrats condemn the invasion   Most Democratic lawmakers and elected officials also described Maduro as a dictator, but they generally condemned Trump's action. At a press conference Saturday, New York City's new Mayor Zohran Mamdani told reporters he phoned Trump and voiced opposition to the invasion.   \"I called the President and spoke with him directly to register my opposition to this act and to make clear that it was an opposition based on being opposed to a pursuit of regime change, to the violation of federal and international law,\" Mamdani said.   \n   Democratic minority leader Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York accused Trump of acting in bad faith and violating the U.S. Constitution. \"The idea that Trump plans to now run Venezuela should strike fear in the hearts of all Americans,\" Schumer said in a post on X. \"The American people have seen this before and paid the devastating price.\"   According to Schumer, the Trump administration assured him \"three separate times that it was not pursuing regime change or or military action without congressional authorization.\"    California's Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff, a frequent Trump critic, posted a series of comments on X describing Saturday's military action and Trump's proposed U.S. occupation of Venezuela as potentially disastrous.     \"Acting without Congressional approval or the buy-in of the public, Trump risks plunging a hemisphere into chaos and has broken his promise to end wars instead of starting them,\" Schiff wrote.   \"Donald Trump has once again shown his contempt for the Constitution and the rule of law,\" said Vermont's Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, in a video posted on social media, where he described the U.S. invasion as \"imperialism.\"     \"This is the horrific logic of force that Putin used to justify his brutal attack on Ukraine,\" Sanders said.   \n            Trump campaigned on an “America First” platform. Now he wants to \"run\" Venezuela?60% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Health care is collapsing. Housing is unaffordable.Trump should address these major crises at home and end his illegal military adventurism abroad. pic.twitter.com/vyoNpEcn4a— Sen. Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) January 3, 2026\n   \n   Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, also spoke harshly of the military strike, describing it as an effort by Trump to distract attention from domestic troubles in the United States.   \n   \"It's not about drugs. If it was, Trump wouldn't have pardoned one of the largest narco traffickers in the world last month,\" Ocasio-Cortez said, referring to Trump's decision to free former Honduran President Orlando Hernandez, who had been convicted in the U.S. of helping smuggle more than 400 tons of cocaine into the U.S.   \"It's about oil and regime change. And they need a trial now to pretend that it isn't. Especially to distract from Epstein + skyrocketing healthcare costs,\" Ocasio-Cortez added on X.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Daniel Estrin discusses with Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.   \n\n    DANIEL ESTRIN, HOST:  Before last night's dramatic operations in Venezuela, which saw U.S. forces capturing the country's president, Nicolas Maduro, and his wife, President Trump, as well as members of his cabinet, downplayed talk of regime change. However, that very possibility dominated the conversation, and for months, U.S. operations against Venezuela have been escalating without any congressional oversight.Senator Jeanne Shaheen is a ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. She's a Democrat representing New Hampshire, and she joins us now. Good afternoon, Senator.JEANNE SHAHEEN: Good afternoon.ESTRIN: We've seen reports of some lawmakers being briefed on the overnight attack in Venezuela. We also heard the president say this morning that he was worried about Congress leaking it. The question is, were you briefed? And if so, were you informed of the plans?SHAHEEN: I was not informed. And my understanding is that no one else was informed in advance, either, both Republican and Democrat. And worse than that, what we have heard from the administration in response to direct questions from both Republicans and Democrats for months has been that their intent was not regime change. Now, of course, those of us who were watching the region understood that there had to be some reason for putting 15,000 U.S. troops in the Caribbean region and all of the firepower that we were bringing to that region. But the fact that they not only refused to brief Congress, but also did not tell us the truth about what the intentions were, and what the president and others acknowledged in this press conference was that they've been planning this operation for months.And there's no doubt that the military behaved brilliantly, but now they're talking about nation-building. And the president's press conference raised more questions than it answered because he said that the United States is going to run the country of Venezuela, but what we're hearing from the vice president, who he claims has been sworn in now as president, what we're hearing from the finance minister, what we're hearing from other quarters, is that there's going to be a battle for control of Venezuela. And there's no guarantee who's going to wind up in control there or to what extent the drug cartels are still going to have a role.ESTRIN: And since the attack this morning, have you or your colleagues been informed by U.S. officials on what's next?SHAHEEN: No. No. And again, the president was not at all clear in his press conference, as he has not been for months, about what the real goal is in Venezuela. He talked about the effort to prohibit drugs from coming into the United States, which I think all Americans support. But what they have done, while it's addressed drugs coming in by boat from Venezuela, hasn't addressed drugs coming in from other areas. And he also talked about oil, the need to get back oil for the United States. He talked about the activities from criminals who are - were being pushed into the United States by Maduro. But these are all contradictory statements, and he's still not clear about what the real motive here is in Venezuela and the threat that the country posed to the United States.ESTRIN: You know, the president also spoke about sending U.S. oil companies to Venezuela. Was that ever discussed? Because it seemed off the stated mission of fighting drug traffickers and restoring democracy.SHAHEEN: I have not had any conversations with anyone in the oil industry about what they might be willing to invest in Venezuela. And again, just as with nation-building, we have a very mixed record in terms of restoring the oil industry. That was the explanation for why the war in Iraq wasn't going to cost us anything, because they had such oil reserves, and we know that that didn't turn out to be true. So whether - the extent to which the United States is going to be able to take over the oil reserves of Venezuela, I think, still is not clear. And what we're seeing already is our adversaries coming to the defense of Maduro and Venezuela, and our allies not taking a firm stand on what the president is doing. So I don't think this has contributed to America's national security interests. And what we're seeing is Russia and China talking about continuing to support the interests in Venezuela that they've been supporting for years now.ESTRIN: Senator, Congress has been frankly unable to stop President Trump in the last several months from all of the military action that's been taken against Venezuela, from the deadly strikes on boats to now regime change. Do you think there will now be enough buy-in among your colleagues for a War Powers Resolution?SHAHEEN: Well, I think that remains to be seen. I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will raise questions about what's really going on here in Venezuela and why we're - you know, this is a president who said he was for America first, and yet what he's talking about is potentially another land war in Latin America. So I think - hopefully we will see...ESTRIN: OK.SHAHEEN: ...People be willing to question the president.ESTRIN: Senator Jeanne Shaheen, thank you so much.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

On Saturday evening, a plane carrying Maduro landed at New York's Stewart Air National Guard Base. A video posted on X by the White House's rapid response account later appeared to show Maduro in the Drug Enforcement Administration headquarters in Manhattan. He was expected to be detained while awaiting trial at a federal jail in Brooklyn.   Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, whom she described as \"alleged international narco traffickers,\" had been indicted in the Southern District of New York.   \n   \"They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,\" she added.   \n   Meanwhile, Trump said Venezuela's Vice President, Delcy Rodríguez, was \"sworn in\" as president on Saturday afternoon. Rodríguez, whose location remains unknown, said Saturday that Maduro was her country's only president, adding Venezuela was ready to defend its natural resources.   Questions are swirling about the legality of the U.S.' actions in Venezuela and what it means for both countries.   Here's what we know so far.   The strikes happened in the middle of the night   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A person walks near a burnt missile interceptor vehicle at La Carlota air base in Caracas on Saturday.\n                \n                    Juan Barreto/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Juan Barreto/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   A series of explosions went off in Venezuela around 2 a.m. local time (1 a.m. ET), according to Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.   Vanessa Silva, a journalist in Caracas, told NPR's Carrie Kahn that she woke up to two explosions at La Carlota military airbase near her home. Silva saw two fires on the runway that were quickly put out, and reported hearing similar detonations and planes flying low over Caracas for at least an hour.   The Venezuelan government says that military targets in the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira were also hit.   Venezuela's Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López said strikes also hit civilian neighborhoods, and that a tally of injuries and deaths was underway. Separately, Venezuela's vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, said both civilians and service members had been killed, but did not give a number.   \n   Trump told Fox and Friends on Saturday morning that there were some U.S. injuries suffered during the operation, but no fatalities. He also said the U.S. was prepared with a second wave of troops that was not ultimately needed.   Trump posted a picture on Truth Social that he said was Maduro aboard the U.S.S. Iwo Jima en route to New York. The photo shows Maduro in a grey tracksuit, handcuffed and blindfolded.   The Trump administration accuses Maduro of running a cartel, stealing U.S. oil   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Maduro greets supporters upon his arrival at a rally in Caracas on December 10.\n                \n                    Federico Parra/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Federico Parra/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The U.S. is one of many Western countries who see Maduro's government as illegitimate, citing widespread fraud in the 2024 election.   \n   The Trump administration has long accused Maduro of running a criminal narco-trafficking organization called Cartel de los Soles, which experts say is shorthand for a system of corruption rather than a single hierarchical group. The U.S. declared it a foreign terrorist organization in November.   On Saturday, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Maduro, Flores, and senior Venezuelan officials face charges related to alleged \"drug trafficking and narco-terrorism conspiracies,\" according to an unsealed indictment Bondi posted on X.   The indictment alleges that, starting in 1999, Maduro and others partnered with international drug trafficking organizations to transport thousands of tons of cocaine into the United States.   Maduro has repeatedly denied accusations against him and pointed the finger at the U.S., accusing the country of attempting to remove him from power in order to gain access to Venezuela's vast oil reserves.   \"They invented an accusation that the United States knows is as false as that accusation of weapons of mass destruction, which led them to an eternal war,\" Maduro said in an interview that aired on state TV on Thursday, adding that he was open to U.S. talks on drug trafficking.   The Trump administration claims that Venezuela \"stole\" oil and assets from the U.S., after its government nationalized them in the late 1990s, which Maduro's government denies.   \n   Last month, Trump ordered a blockade against Venezuelan oil and sanctioned tankers. And on Saturday morning, Vice President JD Vance tweeted that Trump had been clear to Maduro: \"the drug trafficking must stop, and the stolen oil must be returned to the United States.\"   The U.S. has been ramping up pressure on Maduro's government in recent months, conducting military strikes on dozens of small boats in the Caribbean and Pacific that it claims were transporting drugs toward the U.S. And the U.S. — specifically the CIA— conducted a drone strike last week at a docking area believed to be used by Venezuelan drug cartels, marking its first direct operation on Venezuelan soil since the strikes began in September.   \n   U.S. oil companies are going to head to Venezuela and operate in their oil reserves, Trump said Saturday. The president did not say which oil companies and it is unclear if any U.S. oil companies have made plans to do so.   \"We're going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,\" Trump said.  \"The biggest beneficiary are going to be the people of Venezuela.\"   Who will lead Venezuela down the line?   Despite Trump's announcement that Vice President Rodríguez has been sworn in, it's unclear who will take over Maduro's duties long term.   \"I'm not sure there's going to be a power vacuum, because so many of his cronies apparently were left behind,\" Todd Robinson, former acting U.S. ambassador to Venezuela during President Trump's first term, told NPR.   \"There are a lot of questions about what exactly is left behind now, and what more the United States is willing to do to ensure that a potential legitimate person takes over,\" Robinson added.   \n   Trump on Saturday did not outline a clear plan on next steps but said that the U.S. will run Venezuela until a \"proper transition can take place.\"   \"We're going to run the country right. It's going to be run very  judiciously, very fairly,\" he said during Saturday's press conference after Maduro was captured.    It's also not clear whether Maduro loyalists will stay behind and try to defend the country, or similarly flee.   Other contenders include opposition leaders who are also living outside the country's borders for their safety.   \n   In a letter posted on social media, Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who was recently awarded the Nobel Peace Price, said that Edmundo Gonzalez, who is widely regarded as the legitimate winner of the 2024 Venezuelan elections, should assume the presidency. Gonzalez is currently living in exile in Spain.   \"Venezuelans, the HOUR OF FREEDOM has arrived!\" she wrote on X, reacting to Maduro's removal.   As for Machado's own political ambitions, Trump said it would be \"very tough for her to be the leader.\"   \n   \"She doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country. She's a very nice woman, but she doesn't have the respect,\" he said during the press conference.   The president also said Rubio spoke with Rodríguez, who Trump said indicated to the US secretary of state that she is \"willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\"   \"I think she was quite gracious, but she really doesn't have a choice,\" Trump said.   World reactions are mixed    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Venezuelans living in Chile celebrate Maduro's capture in Santiago on Saturday.\n                \n                    Javier Torres/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Javier Torres/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Leaders — both in the U.S. and across the world — are alternately praising and denouncing the administration's actions in Venezuela.   Several Democrats in Congress are calling it illegal, saying Trump did not get Congressional authorization ahead of time.   \"The Constitution is clear that the U.S. doesn't engage in military action or war without a vote of Congress except in cases of imminent self-defense,\" Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va, told NPR Sunday.   \"Maduro is a disaster and he's been disastrous for the country. And we could say the same thing, about 150 leaders of countries around the world. But our Constitution is very, very clear that we don't order servicemen and women into harm's way, risking their lives unless there is a congressional debate and vote about whether the war is in the national interest here.\"   \n   \"Trump rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war,\" Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., wrote on X.   But many Congressional Republicans are praising Trump's actions, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who says he expects senators to be briefed when Congress returns from its two-week recess on Monday.   Many Latin American leaders have expressed concern about the attack and what it could mean for stability in the region — including those of Cuba, Chile, Mexico and Colombia, which is mobilizing troops to its border with Venezuela over concerns about an influx of refugees fleeing.   \n   But Argentina's President Javier Milei, a Trump ally, has publicly praised the operation.   Elsewhere, the reaction has been more cautious.   Kaja Kallas, the vice president of the European Commission, reiterated the EU's view that \"Maduro lacks legitimacy\" but also called for restraint and the respect of \"principles of international law.\" U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Britain was not involved and expressed his support for upholding international law.\n",

The capture of Maduro and Trump's comments comes at a time when even a country like Venezuela — with one of the biggest oil resources in the world — isn't a sure bet for attracting major oil companies.   \n   Many oil companies have been bruised by their past experiences operating in the country. The global oil market is currently facing an oversupply. Oil prices are below $60 a barrel, and long-term projections for oil demand are unclear as the world shifts to more electric vehicles.   Trump promises to \"run the country\" and make way for U.S. oil companies in Venezuela. However, there's a long history of U.S. interventions in Latin America and the Middle East not going well, oil experts tell NPR.   Here's what you need to know about Venezuela's oil.   Venezuela has huge oil reserves, but now produces a fraction of what it used to   Venezuela was once one of the biggest global oil producers and was one of the main founders of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), a group of some of the world's biggest oil producers, whose decisions help determine global oil prices. Venezuela has the largest proven reserves of oil in the world, according to OPEC.   But while the country was producing more than 3 million barrels a day a few decades ago, today Venezuela produces only about a million barrels a day, or roughly 1% of global oil output. The U.S. produces about 13 million barrels a day.   \n   Much of Venezuela's oil went to refineries in the U.S. Now much of it goes to China.   Not all crude oil is the same — some oil is physically lighter and easier for refineries to process. Venezuela's oil is heavy and dense, and requires special refineries. Burning any type of oil contributes to climate change, but Venezuela's oil is \"among the dirtiest oils in the world to produce when it comes to global warming,\" says Paasha Mahdavi, associate professor of political science at the University of California, Santa Barbara.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The El Palito refinery rises above Puerto Cabello, Venezuela, Sunday, Dec. 21, 2025.\n                \n                    Matias Delacroix/AP Photo\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Matias Delacroix/AP Photo\n    \n\n   \n   Venezuela owes some U.S. oil companies billions   U.S. oil companies like Chevron began drilling in Venezuela about one hundred years ago and played a key role in developing the country's oil sector.   But around 2004 to 2007, then-President Hugo Chávez \"basically forcefully renegotiated contracts\" with international oil companies, says Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin America Energy Program at the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University.   ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips left the country in 2007 and then took the Venezuelan government to international arbitration courts. The courts ordered Venezuela to pay ConocoPhillips over $10 billion and ExxonMobil over $1 billion. Venezuela has only paid a fraction of those sums to ExxonMobil and to ConocoPhillips.   Chevron, however, stayed in Venezuela — although \" they didn't like it,\" says Gerald Kepes, president of Competitive Energy Strategies, an energy consultancy in Washington, D.C.   Chevron today produces about a quarter of Venezuela's oil.   In response to the news of Maduro's capture, Chevron spokesperson Bill Turenne said in an email, \"Chevron remains focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets. We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\"   Trump has said that Venezuela has \"stolen\" U.S. investment in the country's energy sector.   Will U.S. oil companies return?   Venezuela is what the oil industry calls a \"brownfield\" — meaning it's well established, and oil companies have a fairly good idea of what they will find when they drill. For companies like ConocoPhillips, returning to Venezuela could be an opportunity to recoup some of the billions owed to them by the government, Monaldi says.   \n   In an email, ConocoPhillips spokesperson Dennis Nuss wrote, \"ConocoPhillips is monitoring developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability. It would be premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\"   ExxonMobil did not respond to a request for comment.   Still, this isn't the best time to add to the global oil supply, Monaldi says. There's currently a worldwide glut of oil. Also, because Venezuela's oil is particularly bad for the climate, that makes it less attractive for European oil companies with climate goals, Monaldi says.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Aerial view of a ship at the Demerara river in Georgetown, Guyana on August 29, 2025.\n                \n                    JOAQUIN SARMIENTO/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        JOAQUIN SARMIENTO/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Venezuela's neighbor is a rising oil star   Next door to Venezuela is Guyana — a country that recently discovered over 10 billion barrels of oil and is a key emerging player in the international oil industry.   Guyana's oil is lighter than Venezuela's, less polluting, and has lower taxes than Venezuela, Monaldi says. There's also no national oil company in Guyana, as there is in Venezuela.   \"All that makes for Guyana to be one of the most attractive oil places in the world,\" Monaldi says.   While ExxonMobil is no longer in Venezuela, it is a major player in Guyana.   For years, Venezuela and Guyana have had a territorial dispute that has also been related to oil rights. Last March, Venezuelan vessels entered Guyanese territorial waters approaching offshore oil vessels belonging to ExxonMobil.   \"Without a doubt, with a changing regime, Guyana should feel more secure,\" Monaldi says.   Lack of political stability could be a deal breaker    Some increase in Venezuela's oil production could happen fairly quickly with more financial support and improved management, according to an analysis by Wood Mackenzie, an energy consultancy.   But Mahdavi says the Trump administration's plans to jumpstart the industry will be difficult. He notes that it took nearly two decades to revitalize Iraq's oil industry after the U.S. invasion, though corruption and mismanagement remain pervasive.   \n   And ultimately, notes Kepes, if it's unclear who is in charge in Venezuela, oil companies will have concerns about the long-term viability of their contracts. \"No one's going to start investing on the ground in a place where there's no legal contract and viable permission to operate or if there's concerns about political stability and violence,\" he says.\n",

Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who recently won the Nobel Peace Prize, has called for Edmundo González, to be recognized as the rightful leader of the nation. He was widely seen as the legitimate winner of the 2024 presidential election in the country.   \n   Who is Machado?   Machado rose to global prominence last year with her win of the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize.   She has been an outspoken critic of Maduro's party, the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), since it first won power under founder Hugo Chávez in the presidential election of 1998. The Nobel committee recognized Machado for \"her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.\"   Her full-throated criticisms of Maduro's authoritarian regime has earned her the moniker \"Iron Lady\" among her supporters.   \n   Machado has praised President Trump as his administration carries out deadly strikes in the Caribbean Sea against Venezuelan boats he has accused of trafficking drugs.   She dedicated her Nobel Prize to the American president and has repeatedly expressed her support for the United States' pressure campaign against Maduro, citing crumbling political and economic systems within Venezuela that have forced 20% of its residents to flee the country.   \n   Despite her popularity among many Venezuelans, Trump said on Saturday he had not been in contact with Machado since the military strikes in Caracas and that he did not see her as a viable candidate to steer the country.   \"I think it would be very tough for her to be the leader. She doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country,\" he told reporters during a press conference. \"She's a very nice woman, but she doesn't have the respect to be a leader.\"   Trump said the United States would \"run\" Venezuela until a \"proper transition can take place.\"   Machado on Saturday praised Maduro's capture, writing in a statement that he faces \"international justice for the atrocious crimes committed against Venezuelans and against citizens of many other nations.\"   \"Faced with his refusal to accept a negotiated exit, the United States government has fulfilled its promise to uphold the law,\" she wrote.   \n   Machado continued: \"We have fought for years, we have given everything, and it has been worth it. What had to happen is happening.\"   Venezuela held a closely watched presidential election in 2024. Machado was barred by the Maduro regime from running in the race, but she threw her backing behind fellow opposition member González.   International election watchdogs, including the United States, say Maduro manipulated the ballot results in order to steal a third term in office and continue his dictatorial reign.   \n   On Saturday, Machado called for Venezuelans to coalesce around González and recognize him as the legitimate president of the beleaguered nation.   \"Today we are prepared to enforce our mandate and take power. Let us remain vigilant, active, and organized until the Democratic Transition is finalized. A transition that needs ALL of us.\"   Though Machado has dedicated Venezuelan supporters, the former Venezuelan National Assembly legislator has been banned by Maduro's government from running for office and was forced into hiding until a recent escape — aided by U.S. military veterans — successfully extracted her to Europe.\n",

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>A government shutdown is looming as Republicans and Democrats continue to search for middle ground on a variety of issues. Newt Gingrich shares his perspective on this most recent shutdown fight.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>SCOTT DETROW, HOST: </p><p> The federal government is likely headed toward a shutdown. Democrats in Congress are withholding support for a short-term spending bill over demands to protect federal health care coverage. They want to extend health care subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year and reverse GOP-led cuts to programs like Medicaid. President Trump and Republican lawmakers are not budging, and the White House is threatening to fire government employees if a shutdown takes place.</p><p>Our next guest is no stranger to a shutdown fight. Newt Gingrich was speaker of the House when Republicans shut down the government twice during the Clinton administration in the mid-'90s. And he recently wrote an op-ed in The New York Times titled \"There's Only One Way To Win A Shutdown. Democrats Don't Have What It Takes.\" Speaker Gingrich, welcome back to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.</p><p>NEWT GINGRICH: I'm glad to be with you.</p><p>DETROW: So in your op-ed, you argue Democrats would regret this shutdown. Why is that?</p><p>GINGRICH: Well, at America's (ph) Renewal Project, which we run, which has been - does polling, it's very clear that there are two things that seemingly are in contradiction. The one is that the American people do not want an increase in spending by an overwhelming majority. The other is that they don't want their government to shut. Now, what's amazing to me about the position that we're now in, which is really different, Schumer has basically taken the position that he is willing to shut the government, which is unpopular, in order to increase spending, which is unpopular. And that's sort of a double negative you don't get very often.</p><p>DETROW: Well, isn't the flip side of that, though, subsidies for health care? Like, making health care more affordable is, by and large, bipartisan...</p><p>GINGRICH: Well, sure. They...</p><p>DETROW: ...Popular, right?</p><p>GINGRICH: Yeah. That would be, except you have John Thune saying oh, we agree, and there are plenty of time between now and December to do it. We're just not going to do it while you hold the government hostage. So I think the Republicans have pretty successfully cluttered the argument. I mean, there's a new survey that just came out that shows that the Republicans now have a six-point advantage, 47-41 on the generic ballot. And Gallup came out the other day and said that the Democrats favorability is now the lowest it has been since they've been taking that poll, which is 34%. So...</p><p>DETROW: Well, can I ask about that?</p><p>GINGRICH: Yeah. Yeah.</p><p>DETROW: Because when you look into those polls, a lot of the reasons that Democrats are sagging in popularity is because their base is frustrated to them. You know what happens when your base gets mad at you, right? That's a constant problem...</p><p>GINGRICH: Yeah.</p><p>DETROW: ...For Republicans in Congress over the years. What would you do if you were a Democratic leader and you're being pressured to pressure the Trump administration with truly the only point of leverage that you have right now?</p><p>GINGRICH: Well, look, I managed to help lead, when I was the speaker, two shutdowns, and they were successful. I mean, the news media said we'd suffered terrible losses, but in fact, we became the first reelected majority of Republicans since 1928 because people thought we were doing the right thing. But here's the difference. If you shut the government down for something people really want, then they'll say, yes, I'm glad you have the guts to do it. The Democrat problem is they're going to yell, health care. And the Republicans are going to say, terrific. We're for doing it in November, but not in this bill.</p><p>DETROW: But...</p><p>GINGRICH: So it's not like the Republicans are going to jump up and down and say, no, we want to make sure people don't get any - don't get their - and basically this is a fight over...</p><p>DETROW: Sure.</p><p>GINGRICH: ...The Obamacare subsidy.</p><p>DETROW: As partisan, though, as the things were in the first Trump administration, by and large, the Trump White House did negotiate with Senate Democrats on spending bills. It seems like that has been a nonstarter this time around. Democrats are arguing, we are not welcome at the table at any other point except this moment. Is that a point that they have?</p><p>GINGRICH: Yeah, look, historically, sure. Does it work politically? No.</p><p>DETROW: Yeah.</p><p>GINGRICH: I mean, nobody in most of America sits around and worries about the maneuvers of politicians. And it's just, you know, life's too short, and there are too many things to worry about.</p><p>DETROW: (Laughter).</p><p>GINGRICH: So you've got to find a thematic. This is the great lesson from Reagan and from Lincoln and, frankly, from Trump. You have to find a thematic that resonates where people look up and say, yeah, that really matters.</p><p>DETROW: Well...</p><p>GINGRICH: And frankly, if the Republicans, who have become significantly less dumb than they were for a while - if the Republicans stick to, yes, we're willing to try to solve that but not in this bill and this is a clean bill, and you are closing the government, I think they have probably a pretty powerful winning position.</p><p>DETROW: When it comes to things that cut through and don't cut through, you know, the same pattern often plays itself out where the White House is not blamed, and it's the minority party in Congress that is blamed. At the same time, though, you have President Trump threatening mass firings - not furloughs, firings - of possibly thousands of federal employees. Do you see any political risk to that?</p><p>GINGRICH: Well, I think they picked up on the Rahm Emanuel theory that you should never let a crisis go to waste.</p><p>DETROW: And that these are...</p><p>GINGRICH: And I think...</p><p>DETROW: ...Furloughs they would want...</p><p>GINGRICH: ...This...</p><p>DETROW: ...To make anyway, firings they would want to make anyway.</p><p>GINGRICH: Sure. Look, I think what you have here, that people have not really dug into enough, is that when Trump was forced into the wilderness for four years, the entire team at America First Policy Institute was about 400 experienced people from the Trump administration. And they had four years to sit down and think through, what is it we have to do to really dramatically change the system? And I think that - and Russ Vought, who's now the head of OMB, Office of Management and Budget, I think thought this through. They all knew a government shutdown was possible. They had been talking about it for four years. This is not a surprise to them. And I think they had decided early on that you're only going to get the scale of change they want if you're very tough and very determined and every chance you get, you take the opportunity.</p><p>DETROW: Taking a step back, you have direct experience with this, but you've also written and studied history. This has now become the norm since the mid-1990s. Every few years, there's a possible or a government shutdown. The government lists are long on short-term funding.</p><p>GINGRICH: Yep.</p><p>DETROW: Do you see long-term damage to that?</p><p>GINGRICH: Yeah. Look, I don't think it's a good idea. I think it's particularly destructive in the Defense Department, where you just stretch out things that make them dramatically harder to get done. But it's really a symptom of a deeper problem, which is that - and this is why we founded America's New Majority Project. We are currently or have been - I think it's breaking loose now. We have been, for a very long time, in a deeply divided nation in which the balance of power is so narrow that each side thinks that it has to screw up the other side. And if you think historically, that's not abnormal. It happens, you know, when you're going through this scale of change.</p><p>One side or the other, has to win by a big enough margin to have real control. And, of course, the Senate is the real crux of that because the Senate requires 60 votes, not 51. And so you either have to have a huge majority or you have to pick issues so popular that the other side can't vote against you. When we did, for example, welfare reform, we literally split the Democrats 93 to 93, because half of them couldn't go home and explain why they were going to vote no.</p><p>DETROW: Yeah. That is former house speaker Newt Gingrich, giving us his insights on this possible government shutdown. Thank you so much for talking to us.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF BADBADNOTGOOD SONG, \"MARKING MY TIME\")</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>President Trump defended the use of troops in U.S. cities while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told military commanders about new physical fitness and grooming requirements for uniformed personnel.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>SCOTT DETROW, HOST: </p><p> President Trump and his defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, both addressed hundreds of senior generals and admirals at a base outside of Washington, D.C., today. The meeting itself was highly unusual as military gatherings go, but the message was usual for the Trump administration. President Trump berated his predecessors, like President Joe Biden, tried to get generals and admirals who have pledged to be nonpartisan to applaud, and again called for the military to be deployed to Democratic-run cities. And Secretary Hegseth announced more policies aiming to develop what he calls a warrior ethos and eliminate what he calls woke elements in the military. For reaction, we have reached U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat who's on the Senate Armed Services Committee and who also flew Army helicopters in combat missions during the Iraq War. Senator, thanks for coming on.</p><p>TAMMY DUCKWORTH: It's my pleasure. Thanks for having me.</p><p>DETROW: I want to walk through several specific things Secretary Hegseth said today because they all get to these broader themes of his Pentagon leadership. First off, he said the purpose of his department would be exclusively war fighting. He went on to challenge U.S. adversaries with the term FAFO, which is an acronym you and I both know the meaning to but I'm told I cannot say on the radio, basically, daring other countries to challenge the U.S. What do you make of that general message and that framing of it?</p><p>DUCKWORTH: Well, I think it shows how weak he is as a secretary of defense, right? This is the kind of bluster you see. The people in the military who are truly deadly are the ones who are the most quiet. And what you've got here is a secretary of defense who failed as an Army officer. I mean, he's the least-qualified secretary of defense in history. We've got a five-time draft dodger for a president. This whole thing was an ego stroke for them to be able to stand up in front of a bunch of flag officers. And at the end of the day, it did nothing to improve the readiness of our military. And if anything, it wasted millions of taxpayer dollars by flying all of these flag officers into Washington, D.C., when they should have been out training and preparing their troops for battle.</p><p>DETROW: I'm curious. To you, is that just a more colorful way of saying peace through strength, which is something that you've heard across administrations for decades? Do you have any specific worries that the secretary seems overly eager to get into a conflict?</p><p>DUCKWORTH: Yeah, I mean, both Trump and Hegseth want to get into conflict, and obviously Trump is all about getting into a conflict that he doesn't have to fight. He wants to use military men and women as his little toy soldiers. None of this keeps Americans safe around the world. If anything, it is really provoking the rest of the world to try to engage in a fight with the United States.</p><p>DETROW: I mentioned before something I think a lot of listeners know, that you flew helicopters in combat. I was curious to get your response to another big section of the speech.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>PETE HEGSETH: Today, at my direction, each service will ensure that every requirement for every combat MOS, for every designated combat arms position, returns to the highest male standard only.</p><p>DUCKWORTH: I mean, I think it's ironic that the least-qualified person for his job is questioning the qualifications of women who actually have met the standards for their jobs. It's interesting that he left out age. You know, the male standard for an 18-year-old man is not the same as what the standard is for a 45-year-old. So it just shows a lack of understanding on his part. He's trying to erase the valor shown by women, people of color and many others who've served in uniform, and it makes a mockery of our veterans, you know? He can do all the PT in the world, but he couldn't fly a helicopter.</p><p>DETROW: Can you say more about what you're seeing that makes you say that you think that they're trying to push people of color out of combat roles?</p><p>DUCKWORTH: Well, at the end of his speech, he issued a whole bunch of memorandums to the military going after diversity. Diversity in the military is good for our military's readiness - the fact that we have troops who can speak various languages around the world. We have troops who can blend in with the local population when they go places. If anything, what they're trying to do is going to make our military less able to fight the wars.</p><p>DETROW: One other moment that got a lot of attention was some new directives issued to higher-ranking officers. Here's a moment from that speech.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>HEGSETH: It's tiring to look out at combat formations or really any formation and see fat troops. Likewise, it's completely unacceptable to see fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon and leading commands around the country and the world. It's a bad look.</p><p>DETROW: I guess, Senator, is this a concern you share? What was your response to this message from the secretary?</p><p>DUCKWORTH: Listen, the military already has weight standards and physical fitness standards for all of our troops. And if Pete Hegseth is worried about the weight and fitness of our troops, maybe he should also apply them to the commander in chief.</p><p>DETROW: That is Senator Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat and an Iraq war veteran. Thanks so much for talking to us.</p><p>DUCKWORTH: Thank you.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The tool was originally created to only provide information on the foreign-born population, but after these changes, it can now produce information about U.S.-born citizens.</p>   <p>NPR was the first news organization to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/29/nx-s1-5409608/citizenship-trump-privacy-voting-database\" target=\"_blank\">report on that change</a> in June.</p>   <p>The lawsuit alleges that the federal government failed to take steps required by federal privacy laws when it made these changes to SAVE, and did so \"in secret, without the notice required by law and comment from the public or Congress, and without assessing the privacy implications or risks of error posed by repurposing the data in this way.\"</p>   <p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/10/nx-s1-5477367/save-election-citizenship-data-trump\" target=\"_blank\">NPR reported</a> that a number of Republican-led states had started to run their entire state voter rolls through SAVE to check for noncitizens, and more than 33 million voters had been run through so far.</p>   \n   <p>The suit argues that use of the overhauled SAVE by states could mislabel U.S. citizens who are eligible to vote as noncitizens and could lead to their disenfranchisement or make them targets of wrongful criminal investigations for lawfully voting.</p>   <p>The lawsuit also alleges that the federal government unlawfully pooled Americans' sensitive records into what is known as a \"data lake\" housed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), including Social Security numbers, biometric data, tax information, wage and employment records, medical and disability records, among others.</p>   <p>The suit calls the federal government's compilation of personal data a \"bullseye for hackers.\"</p>   <p>In recent months there have been a number of reports about data security issues as DOGE has taken steps to aggregate government data in novel ways. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/26/nx-s1-5517977/social-security-doge-privacy\" target=\"_blank\">In August, the Social Security Administration chief data officer</a> at the time reported that a DOGE member had made a live copy of the Social Security records of over 300 million Americans and put it in the agency's private cloud where it was accessible to other employees and was vulnerable to identity thieves.</p>   <p>The suit is asking a judge to order the federal government to stop using the new data tools.</p>   <p>DHS, the Social Security Administration and the Department of Justice, along with their agency heads, are named defendants in the lawsuit. The Justice Department declined to comment.</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>The government shuts down at midnight and the two parties remain far apart on a solution to prevent it.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>AILSA CHANG, HOST: </p><p> Well, the hours are ticking down until the government shuts down at midnight. And in Washington, both sides are digging in. Here's Senate Majority Leader John Thune speaking to reporters at the Capitol today.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>JOHN THUNE: If the government shuts down, it is on the Senate Democrats.</p><p>CHANG: Well, and the Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, who spoke in the exact same spot a few moments later, said this about Republicans.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>CHUCK SCHUMER: It's in their court to solve it. It's their shutdown.</p><p>CHANG: The Senate is expected to vote today on two different partisan options to fund the government, at least temporarily. Both are currently expected to fail. NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt has been covering all of this and joins us now from the Capitol. Hi, Barbara.</p><p>BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa.</p><p>CHANG: OK. So I know that Democrats and Republicans met at the White House yesterday, and in theory, their goal was to find a way out of a shutdown. It's been 24 hours, right? Have they made...</p><p>SPRUNT: Yeah.</p><p>CHANG: ...Any progress?</p><p>SPRUNT: No. In fact, things seem to be getting worse. You heard congressional leadership there. I wouldn't call that particularly promising. And there have been a few signs from the White House after that meeting yesterday that also don't point to progress. One, the president was antagonizing Democrats on social media last night with a racist AI-generated video of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer - not exactly the thing you post when you're trying to broker a deal at the 11th hour. And then today, the president said this.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them and irreversible by them, like cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like.</p><p>CHANG: OK. And how have Democrats responded to that?</p><p>SPRUNT: Well, Schumer addressed it directly today.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>SCHUMER: Trump admitted himself that he is using Americans as political pawns. He is admitting that he is doing the firing of people if, God forbid, it happens.</p><p>SPRUNT: And that really stood out to me, Ailsa. If a shutdown happens, which looks very likely, we are going to see a really public blame game. And, you know, it can feel like us talking about politics is just, like, palace intrigue. But for a shutdown, the messaging and the public blame actually does matter. The perception of who is to blame is going to impact how we get out of a shutdown because someone eventually has to give in in order for this to end.</p><p>CHANG: Exactly. And we see this movie over and over again. OK. So...</p><p>SPRUNT: Exactly.</p><p>CHANG: ...Republicans need at least seven Democrats to vote with them on what's called a continuing resolution. This would fund the government temporarily and avoid a shutdown. What are they asking for in exchange for their support?</p><p>SPRUNT: Well, Senate Democrats want to repeal cuts to health care programs that were enacted by the GOP's major tax and spending bill that they passed earlier this summer. And they also want to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year.</p><p>CHANG: And Senate Majority Leader John Thune has signaled some openness to negotiating on this front, right?</p><p>SPRUNT: Yeah, that's right. But not when a shutdown is still on the table, he says. And also, it's not as simple, I think, as will they make these subsidies permanent or not in any sort of future negotiation. This is a COVID-era policy that boosted up these tax credits. It would be very costly to extend them, certainly very costly to make them permanent, as some Democrats want, so much so that it will be a nonstarter for some House Republicans. And other Republicans may be open to extending them but with significant changes. Leader Thune has already talked about wanting to address what he calls waste, fraud and abuse within that system.</p><p>CHANG: OK. Well, assuming there is a shutdown, is there any sense of how long it would last?</p><p>SPRUNT: I - you know, this feels like it could be a long one. It's just hard to see how either party makes the first move to negotiate here. They're so dug in, and the messaging around this has already started.</p><p>CHANG: That is NPR's Barbara Sprunt.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts</strong></h3>   <p>The Kennedy Center receives federal funding for some employee salaries and the upkeep of its building, a living memorial to President John F. Kennedy. Events and performances are supported by private dollars. In an email to NPR, spokesperson Roma Daravi said, \"The Center's programming will not be impacted by a shutdown. Federal employees like plumbers will not be impacted either, thanks to the OBBB.\" President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill, passed by Congress, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/13/nx-s1-5395839/the-white-house-is-pushing-a-big-budget-increase-for-the-kennedy-center\" target=\"_blank\">included</a> $257 million for the Kennedy Center for repairs, restoration and other building maintenance.</p>   <h3><strong>Ford's Theatre</strong></h3>   <p>The historic <a href=\"https://fords.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Ford's Theatre</a> is a public-private partnership with the National Park Service.

The second bill was also defeated nearly along party lines. Democrats refused to join Republicans to approve a short-term measure passed by the House that would keep the government funded at current levels through Nov. 21. Both measures needed 60 votes to pass.</p>   \n   <p>Democrats have insisted that they will not vote for a spending measure unless Republicans agree to extend the subsidies for health insurance plans purchased through the Affordable Care Act. That did not happen.</p>   <p>Shortly after the failed votes, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought instructed affected federal agencies to \"execute their plans for an orderly shutdown.\"</p>   <p>It is unclear exactly how far-reaching the impact of a shutdown will be or how long the suspensions of funding will last. Critical services, including Social Security, VA benefits and Medicare and Medicaid payments, will continue, but people who need those resources could face delays.</p>   \n   <p>Federal jobs labeled as nonessential will <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/30/g-s1-90732/government-shut-down\" target=\"_blank\"><u>experience more direct impacts</u></a>, meaning there could be slowdowns in some government services and many federal employees will be left unpaid.</p>   <p>The Congressional Budget Office estimates about 750,000 federal employees may be furloughed daily.</p>   <p>President Donald Trump has also indicated he may take additional action to reshape the government. On Tuesday afternoon, he alluded to possibly carrying out mass firings of federal workers and eliminating programs in the event of a shutdown.</p>   <p>\"We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday. \"We can cut large numbers of people. We don't want to do that, but we don't want fraud, waste and abuse.\"</p>   \n   <p>Some impacts will be immediate, while others will only kick in if a shutdown drags on.<br /></p>   <ul><li>Hundreds of thousands of federal workers and active-duty service members may miss paychecks starting in mid-October.</li></ul><ul><li>Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration employees are considered essential employees, but some have called off sick during past shutdowns when they were asked to work without pay.</li></ul><ul><li>The Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children commonly known as WIC may soon run out of money. </li></ul><ul><li>It is unclear whether National Parks will remain open. During the last shutdown, parks remained open even though they went unstaffed.</li></ul><h3>Ahead of the funding deadline, Democrats and Republicans dug in</h3>   <p>As the funding deadline neared, lawmakers ratcheted up the finger-pointing over the impending shutdown.</p>   <p>Democrats continue to argue that they are fighting to protect Americans' health care, as they push to extend the insurance subsidies and also attempt to repeal cuts to health care programs that were enacted by the GOP's tax and spending bill passed earlier this summer.</p>   <p>\"We see now Republicans are plunging America into a shutdown, rejecting bipartisan talks, pushing a partisan bill and risking America's health care,\" Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday night.</p>   \n   <p>But, Republicans have accused Democrats of taking the federal budget hostage to advance their policy goals.</p>   <p>\"Senate Democrats have sacrificed the American people to Democrats' partisan interests,\" Majority Leader John Thune said shortly before the government shut down.</p>   <h3>How long will the shut down last?</h3>   <p>Republican leaders say they plan to continue holding votes on their stopgap funding measure, hoping they can peel off more Democrats to join them as a shutdown wears on.</p>   <p>\"When we had a vote on our proposal to keep the government open right before the recess, we had one Democrat vote,\" Republican Whip John Barrasso said Tuesday night. \"Tonight, we had three. So the cracks are beginning to show.\"</p>   \n   <p>Two Democrats, Sens. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, and Catherine Cortez-Masto of Nevada and one independent, Angus King of Maine—who caucuses with Democrats—voted for the Republican bill on Tuesday. </p>   \n   <p>\"We need a bipartisan solution to address this impending health care crisis, but we should not be swapping the pain of one group of Americans for another,\" Cortez-Masto said.</p>   <p>But six Democrats who voted yes on the continuing resolution when it first came for a vote in March declined to support the measure this time around. And like Thune, Schumer also said he believes some members on the other side may eventually find their position untenable.</p>   <p>Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was the lone Republican to oppose the measure Tuesday.</p>   <p>The last government shutdown, from December 2018 to January 2019, lasted 35 days and was the longest in U.S. history.</p>   <p>With Republicans and Democrats both signaling they are unwilling to budge, there is no clarity about the path out of the shutdown – or how long it will last.</p>\n</div>"

If Congressional Democrats maintain their current posture and refuse to pass a clean Continuing Resolution to keep the government funded before midnight on September 30, 2025, federal appropriated funding will lapse.\"</p>   <p>The message continues: \"The agency has contingency plans in place for executing an orderly shutdown of activities that would be affected by any lapse in appropriations forced by Congressional Democrats.\"</p>   <p>Similar messages were received by staff at the Departments of the Interior, Commerce, Labor, State, Treasury, Justice, Agriculture and Health and Human Services, the Social Security Administration, the General Services Administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Office of Personnel Management and the National Labor Relations Board, according to screenshots shared with NPR.</p>   <p>Republicans control both chambers of Congress but <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/30/g-s1-91217/government-shutdown-midnight\" target=\"_blank\">need Democratic support</a> in the Senate to approve any government funding deal.</p>   <p>A statement from the Department of Veterans Affairs also used sharply partisan language, saying \"radical liberals in Congress\" would be to blame for services not being available during a shutdown, such as career counseling activities and the closure of regional benefits offices. </p>   \n   <p>\"Radical liberals in Congress are trying to shut down the government to achieve their crazy fantasy of open borders, 'transgender' for everybody and men competing in women's sports,\" VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz said in a statement sent to the media. \"If they succeed, they will stop critical Veterans care and assistance programs.\"</p>   <p>Health care for veterans will not be affected and the <a href=\"https://department.va.gov/contingency-planning/human-capital-contingency-plan/\" target=\"_blank\">VA's contingency plan</a> notes that about 97% of its employees will not be furloughed.</p>   \n   <h3>Alarm bells for ethics experts</h3>   <p>The inclusion of overtly political messages in federal agency communications raised immediate alarm bells for some federal workers and ethics experts. They said it could violate the <a href=\"https://osc.gov/Services/pages/hatchact.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Hatch Act</a>, which prohibits civil servants in the executive branch from engaging in most political activity inside federal buildings or while on duty.</p>   <p>\"This correspondence from Federal Government Officials could be considered a violation of the Hatch Act,\" Michael Fallings, a partner at Tully Rinckey, an employment law firm, said in a statement. \"The Hatch Act prohibits engaging in political activity while in an official capacity, including communication that contains advocacy in opposition to a political party. Here, while the reference to Democrats alone likely does not constitute a violation, the explicit blaming of the Democratic Party for the shutdown and 'reference to radical left' may constitute a violation.\"</p>   <p>\"The code of ethics requires that federal employees serve the American public impartially, without regard to their political views. This message may not technically violate the Hatch Act--since it does not advocate for particular candidates or weigh in on elections, but it certainly violates the spirit of that law,\" said Donald Sherman, executive director and chief counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal nonprofit ethics watchdog group.</p>   <p>\"A shutdown will cause stress for the public regardless of political affiliation. Agency leadership's job in this moment is to provide nonpartisan service to their constituents, not politicize the situation and blame political enemies,\" Sherman said.</p>   \n   <p>\"We just all accept that the Hatch Act is null and void,\" one federal worker, who requested anonymity because they fear retaliation from the Trump administration for speaking out, told NPR. \"Nothing matters.\"</p>   <h3>Sent at the behest of the White House</h3>   <p>The highly partisan language from the Trump administration also differs from that used by other administrations during previous shutdowns.</p>   <p>Ahead of a government shutdown that lasted more than two weeks in 2013, then-President Obama <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2013/10/01/president-obamas-letter-federal-employees-shutdown-government\" target=\"_blank\">penned a letter to federal employees</a> that thanked them for their service and chided a Congress that \"has failed to meet its responsibility\" to approve a spending plan, without mentioning Republicans.</p>   <p>\"This shutdown was completely preventable,\" he wrote. \"It should not have happened. And the House of Representatives can end it as soon as it follows the Senate's lead, and funds your work in the United States Government without trying to attach highly controversial and partisan measures in the process.\"</p>   <p>\"This type of email informing us of a potential shutdown is not new, but the tone and blaming one political party is definitely unusual,\" said a Office of Personnel Management staffer who requested anonymity due to fear of reprisal.</p>   <p>Tuesday's messages were sent by agency leadership, but in several cases made clear that they were sent at the behest of the White House.</p>   <p>\"The Office of Management and Budget has requested that we send the attached message to you regarding a potential lapse in funding,\" the email to NLRB staff read. The National Labor Relations Board declined to comment.</p>   <p>\"This message was issued under the guidance of the Office of Management and Budget and in alignment with their protocols,\" an Interior Department spokesperson said in a statement to NPR.</p>   <p>\"The reality is that the Trump Administration wants to keep the government open so HHS, including the CDC, can fully safeguard the public's health and well-being. By contrast, Congressional Democrats are threatening a shutdown that would impact care to millions of Americans. We will refer you to OMB for additional comment,\" HHS communications director Andrew Nixon said in a statement.</p>   \n   <p>The Office of Management and Budget didn't respond to a request for comment.</p>   \n   <p>The message to Labor Department employees was unsigned by leadership and was sent from a generic department email address that doesn't accept replies, said one department employee who requested anonymity due to fear of reprisal.</p>   <p>At the Social Security Administration, the email came from Commissioner Frank Bisignano, according to a staffer who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation.</p>   <p>\"It basically read like a campaign email,\" the staffer said.</p>   <p>The Departments of Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Commerce, Justice, Agriculture and Treasury, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Social Security Administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the General Services Administration and the Office of Personnel Management did not respond to requests for comment. The Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment.</p>   <p>Federal employees are on edge amid this week's funding negotiation, as the White House has <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/24/nx-s1-5552789/trump-government-shutdown-plan-memo\" target=\"_blank\">threatened to fire some federal workers</a> during a shutdown rather than temporarily furloughing workers as is usually done.</p>      <p><em>NPR's Quil Lawrence and Tamara Keith contributed reporting.</em></p>   <p><em>Have information you want to share about the shutdown or other restructuring changes across the federal government?

The meeting, which also included Vice President JD Vance, was a last-minute attempt to resolve a weeks-long standoff between the parties over spending. Vance made it clear that the GOP wouldn't agree to Democrats' demands to attach health care provisions to a spending bill.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune is expected to bring up two proposals for votes today: one for the House-passed bill that extends current funding levels through Nov. 21 and another for the Democrats' alternative plan that attaches health care changes. Both are expected to fail.</li></ul>   \n   <p><strong>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's meeting with top U.S. military leaders today in Quantico, Va., just got even more notable </strong>with the president announcing he will attend. Trump informed NBC News that it will be a \"very nice meeting talking about how well we're doing militarily, talking about being in great shape.\" These details are currently the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/30/nx-s1-5557232/hegseth-generals-trump\" target=\"_blank\">most public yet to emerge about the gathering</a>, which Hegseth ordered hundreds of generals and admirals to attend. <br /></p>   <ul><li>🎧 <strong>The meeting is unique because of the wide geographic spread of the people expected to attend</strong>, as well as the logistics and security around bringing them together, says NPR's Quil Lawrence. Trump's message that the event is a pep talk has caused some military analysts and former officers to flip as they find it <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5557858:x\" target=\"_blank\">troubling that flag officers would be pulled away</a> to be told how to do their jobs by Hegseth, who was not seen as a defense heavyweight until being appointed to his role. The meeting has also led to speculation that Hegseth is looking to fire some military leaders.</li></ul>   <p><strong>Trump announced a plan to end the war in Gaza after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> yesterday at the White House. This marks the first time Trump has outlined both an end to the war and a potential future for the two million Palestinians living in the region, nearly two years after the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on Israel. Here are <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/30/g-s1-91244/5-takeaways-from-the-u-s-ceasefire-proposal-for-israel-and-hamas\" target=\"_blank\">five takeaways from the plan</a>. <br /></p>   \n   <ul><li>🎧<strong> The plan includes releasing all Israeli hostages held in Gaza, along with allowing hundreds of trucks of humanitarian aid to enter Gaza daily</strong>, aimed at reversing the man-made famine. Israel would also release approximately 2,000 male detainees and all women and children in Israeli prisons since the Oct. 7 attack. NPR's Aya Batrawy says this isn't the ultimate victory over Hamas that Netanyahu desired, as it doesn't allow for the full occupation of Gaza and the continuation of war. However, Netanyahu is <a href=\"https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5557858:x\" target=\"_blank\">attempting to sell this as a major win</a>. The plan allows Israel to keep its boots on the ground in much of Gaza for the foreseeable future, which raises uncertainty about how Hamas might react.</li></ul>   <h3>Today's listen</h3>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/png\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2804x1577+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2Fbe%2Fae1c9dba4a6c9ad48ae1dcf82b1a%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-26-at-11-15-07-am.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-09-26 at 11.15.07 AM.png\" />\n        </picture>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <p><span>\n        Olivia Dean/Youtube/Screenshot by NPR\n    </span>\n</p></div>\n   </div>\n   <p>Olivia Dean, the 26-year-old English singer, is rising to the top of the charts with songs from her second studio album, <em>The Art of Loving</em>. She has reached the ranks of Adele, becoming the first British artist since her to have three simultaneous Top 10 hits on the U.K. charts. Her song \"Man I Need,\" which can be heard all over social media, is her <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/29/g-s1-90670/olivia-dean-man-i-need\" target=\"_blank\">first song to chart on Billboard's Hot 100</a>. She is now making her way across the U.S., sharing her music as the opener for Sabrina Carpenter's tour. Her songs discuss not only romantic love, but self-love and platonic love as well.

This transition can lead to your mood dimming. Approximately 1 in 20 adults have seasonal affective disorder, which is seasonal depression. And millions more experience a milder form of \"winter blues.\" One way to combat these feelings is by using light therapy, with the help of a light box, starting in the fall. Here's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/29/nx-s1-5546611/seasonal-depression-light-therapy-mental-health\" target=\"_blank\">what you should know about light therapy</a> and how it works: <br /></p>   \n   <ul><li>💡 Typically, people sit in front of a light box every morning for about 30 minutes, making it part of their morning routine.</li><li>💡 Light therapy is as effective as standard antidepressant medication in alleviating symptoms, according to a study referenced by Dr. Dorothy Sit, a psychiatrist and associate professor at Northwestern University. Studies indicate that improvements in symptoms can be observed within one week of starting the therapy.</li><li>💡 If interested in buying a light box, you should get one that emits 10,000 lux of light, and larger screens are better.</li><li>💡 Remember, lack of light isn't the only trigger of a low mood. If it's cold and snowy outside, people go out less, which can cause social isolation. Reach out to friends and family and stay engaged in activities that keep you in contact with people.</li></ul>   <h3>3 things to know before you go</h3>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4500x2530+0+218/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7e%2Fb6%2F8668f4a9403993ed69b1867d6654%2F831stories-authortalk-kc-27-edit.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4500x2530+0+218/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7e%2Fb6%2F8668f4a9403993ed69b1867d6654%2F831stories-authortalk-kc-27-edit.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4500x2530+0+218/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7e%2Fb6%2F8668f4a9403993ed69b1867d6654%2F831stories-authortalk-kc-27-edit.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4500x2530+0+218/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7e%2Fb6%2F8668f4a9403993ed69b1867d6654%2F831stories-authortalk-kc-27-edit.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4500x2530+0+218/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7e%2Fb6%2F8668f4a9403993ed69b1867d6654%2F831stories-authortalk-kc-27-edit.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4500x2530+0+218/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7e%2Fb6%2F8668f4a9403993ed69b1867d6654%2F831stories-authortalk-kc-27-edit.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4500x2530+0+218/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7e%2Fb6%2F8668f4a9403993ed69b1867d6654%2F831stories-authortalk-kc-27-edit.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw -

He said 11 suspected members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua were killed, but the administration has not provided any evidence to support its assertions.</p>   <p>After the second strike, Trump was asked by reporters about providing evidence that the boat was indeed carrying drugs and posed a threat to the U.S.</p>   <p>\"We have proof. All you have to do is look at the cargo, it's spattered all over the ocean. Big bags of cocaine and fentanyl all over the place,\" he said.</p>   \n   <p>He added that the government also \"recorded evidence\" but he did not elaborate.</p>   <p>The administration has said the president took action under his Article 2 powers as commander in chief and in self-defense.</p>   \n   <h3>Questions about threats to U.S.</h3>   <p>But experts and some lawmakers have condemned the strikes on civilian narcotraffickers as illegal, extrajudicial killings.</p>   <p>Luca Trenta, a professor at Swansea University in Britain who studies U.S. foreign policy and covert action, said the administration's military strikes in the Caribbean represent a massive escalation in the use of force, and suggest the president can target whomever he wants, whenever he wants.</p>   <p>\"It's a really bad thing if the president of the United States can decide that a group of civilians that might pose some kind of remote threat can be killed without any form of due process because who is to say what group will be targeted next?\" Trenta said.</p>   <p>During the global war on terror, the U.S. targeted al-Qaida and other Islamic extremist groups under the legal authority passed by Congress after the 9/11 terror attacks.</p>   \n   <p>The U.S. conducted military strikes in active conflict zones but administrations also stretched that authority to target groups outside such areas if a particular group was deemed a military threat to the U.S., Trenta said.</p>   <p>\"None of this would apply to the current situation due to the nature of the target and the lack of a threat that the target was posing,\" he said.</p>   <p>In the case of the Trump administration's first strike in the Caribbean, an individual briefed on the attack told NPR the boat had turned around and was returning to shore when it was hit, raising further questions about how it could have posed a direct threat to the U.S.</p>   <p>The individual spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.</p>   \n   <h3>Loss of intelligence</h3>   <p>There are also questions about whether the war on terrorism blueprint would be effective against drug cartels.</p>   <p>\"Certainly, the lethal strikes off Venezuela are an unprecedented change in U.S. actions,\" said Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \"The U.S. has had a lot of interdiction in the Caribbean across many decades, and that interdiction has focused on arresting people, manning the boats and seizing cargo. This has generated intelligence.\"</p>   <p>\"The thing that's different now is not that there is interdiction, but that the interdiction seeks to kill people, not arrest them,\" she said.</p>   \n   <p>Felbab-Brown is skeptical about the Trump administration's claims that the military strikes will stop the flow of drugs or create a deterrent effect, preventing people from joining drug trafficking organizations or running drugs to the U.S.</p>   \n   <p>She said lethal strikes in the post-9/11 war on terror didn't deter people from joining those terrorist groups, and in places like Pakistan and Somalia, she said, the strikes drove some to join extremist groups.</p>   <p>As for drug traffickers, \"they face a tremendous amount of risk already,\" she said, including arrest and imprisonment, as well as the chance of death at sea.</p>   <p>For years, the U.S. has interdicted suspected drug vessels in the Caribbean, seizing cargo, arresting crew members and interrogating them for information on their networks, bosses and political patrons.</p>   <p>In the case of Trump administration's first drug boat strike, officials have said publicly the U.S. could have intercepted the vessel but decided to blow it up instead.</p>   <p>Losing the intelligence gained from those arrests, Felbab-Brown said, is a \"real downside\" to the lethal strikes.</p>   <h3>Ripple effects down the line</h3>   <p>During the war on terror, the U.S. generally conducted drone strikes on terrorist targets because the local government would not or could not arrest the suspected terrorists, or because sending in U.S. forces was deemed too politically or militarily risky, said Daniel Byman from the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p>   <p>But lethal strikes were always pitched as an alternative to arresting people, he said, \"because when you arrest someone, you could question them, gather information and in so doing, you could stop the next attack or find the next leader.\"</p>   <p>Still, American intelligence and military officials generally view the lethal strikes on terrorist groups like al-Qaida as effective for a range of reasons, he said.</p>   <p>\"They weakened the leadership, they created disorganization within the group, they forced it to hide,\" Byman said. \"And as a result, there were far fewer attacks.\"</p>   \n   <p>In the case of the Trump administration's anti-cartel campaign, he said, there was the option, at least in the first strike, of boarding the vessel.</p>   <p>\"You could try to arrest the people and try to get information — but it seems that killing them, rather than being the last resort, was the first resort,\" he said.</p>   <p>There's also a slew of possible ripple effects from the administration's use of force.</p>   <p>Felbab-Brown says criminal groups could shift to land-based smuggling routes, but such changes have sparked turf wars.</p>   \n   <p>\"Traditionally, any kind of changes to smuggling routes in Latin America or in the Americas more broadly have been accompanied by high levels of violence,\" she said. </p>   <p>There's also the possibility of public backlash if U.S. strikes kill innocent civilians, as happened during the war on terror.</p>   <p>\"There were innocent people who died,\" Byman said. \"Even when intelligence was pretty good, which i think it was in most of the counterterrorism era, it's never perfect.\" </p>   <p>He added that no country likes being bombed, and U.S. strikes could trigger a nationalist backlash. He also points out that in Latin America there is a lot of sensitivity to U.S. military force because of the long history of American interventions in the region. <br /></p>\n</div>"

Lawmakers in both chambers were shown video of the boat strike behind closed doors in briefings with Navy Admiral Frank M. Bradley, the Special Operations commander who oversaw the operation. After those briefings, leading Democrats expressed shock at what they saw, with the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee calling it \"one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service.\"   \n   \"You have two individuals in clear distress, without any means of locomotion, with a destroyed vessel, who were killed by the United States,\" said Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn. \"Under the D.O.D. manual for abiding by the laws of armed conflict, the specific example given of an impermissible action is attacking a shipwreck,\" he said. \"Any American who sees the video that I saw will see the United States military attacking shipwrecked sailors.\"   Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., told reporters the video showed \"two survivors trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for the United States, back over so they could stay in the fight.\" Cotton, who sits on the Armed Services Committee, described multiple strikes taking place \"minutes apart,\" but said he did not see \"anything disturbing about it.\" He called the strikes \"entirely lawful.\"   The briefings appeared to offer new specifics on an attack that has raised questions from lawmakers and military experts over whether the strikes broke U.S. law or if they constituted a war crime under the administration's assertion that the U.S. is at war with narco traffickers.   \n   When asked about it during a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, President Trump said he didn't know about the second strike.   \"I didn't know anything about people,\" Trump added, referring to the survivors. \"I wasn't involved in it.\"   Hegseth said he did not make the call for any subsequent boat strikes after authorizing the initial strike, but defended sinking the boat and Bradley's decision-making.   \"I watched that first strike live,\" Hegseth said. \"As you can imagine, the Department of War, we got a lot of things to do. So I moved on to my next meeting.\"   \n   During Thursday's briefings, Bradley told lawmakers that he was under no order to kill everyone on board, according to both Cotton and Himes.    \n   But lawmakers are still demanding additional transparency from the White House. After meeting with Bradley, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Jack Reed of Rhode Island, said he still had \"serious questions about the legality of all the strikes\" in the Caribbean.    \"If we don't insist upon strict observation of the rules of war, we can't expect our opponents to do it, and as a result we're jeopardizing the lives of young men and women in our armed services,\" he said in an interview with All Things Considered.     Reed is among several Democrats who have called on the administration to release the full video of the strike. Trump told reporters on Wednesday that he would be willing to release video from the strike, but added that he wasn't aware what footage was captured. He went on to broadly justify the administration's campaign, arguing that by stopping the flow of drugs into the U.S., it benefits the American people.   \"Every boat we knock out, we save 25,000 American lives,\" Trump said.   Watchdog report on Signalgate released   The focus on the boat strike was one of two high-profile operations under focus on Thursday. As Bradley was on Capitol Hill, a Pentagon watchdog released a report finding that Hegseth violated agency policy by using the Signal messaging app to discuss U.S. airstrikes in Yemen earlier this year.   The investigation's findings were the culmination of a months-long probe led by Pentagon Inspector General Steven Stebbins, following a request from the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. It was started after a journalist for The Atlantic reported in March that he had been added to a Signal group chat where a handful of top officials discussed plans to strike Houthi rebels in Yemen.   \n   The 84-page report concludes that Hegseth's decision to share highly sensitive military plans on the commercially available encrypted messaging app, using his personal cell phone, could have jeopardized the safety of American servicemembers and the mission.   \n   \"The Secretary sent nonpublic DoD information identifying the quantity and strike times of manned U.S. aircraft over hostile territory over an unapproved, unsecure network approximately 2 to 4 hours before the execution of those strikes,\" according to the report.   \"Using a personal cell phone to conduct official business and send nonpublic DoD information through Signal risks potential compromise of sensitive DoD information, which could cause harm to DoD personnel and mission objectives,\" it added.   \n   Hegseth declined to be interviewed for Stebbins' investigation and instead provided only a written statement where he argued that the information he shared in the Signal chat did not require classification.   In a statement issued ahead of the report's public release, Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said the findings showed Hegseth did nothing wrong.   \"The Inspector General review is a TOTAL exoneration of Secretary Hegseth and proves what we knew all along — no classified information was shared. This matter is resolved, and the case is closed,\" Parnell said.      NPR disclosure: Katherine Maher, the CEO of NPR, chairs the board of the Signal Foundation.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Juana Summers talks with Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, after his meeting with Adm. Frank Bradley about the military strike off the coast of Venezuela.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  Democrat Jack Reed, ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, launched the bipartisan Senate investigation into the strike off the coast of Venezuela. Admiral Frank Bradley, who leads U.S. Special Operations Command, recently briefed leadership behind closed doors. Senator Reed, welcome back to the program.JACK REED: Thank you very much.SUMMERS: Thanks for being here. So after a separate briefing today, Democratic Congressman Jim Himes called video that he saw of this episode \"deeply, deeply troubling.\" I'm quoting here. Did your committee also see that video?REED: We did see the video, and it was disturbing. As I said last night in a speech on the floor of the Senate, I believe the administration should release the entire video, what we saw, and also release numerous other reports so that there can be a factual discussion of what happened. Did it follow the law? Was it necessary and effective? All those questions have to be answered. And as I said last evening, the best way to start is to get the information to the public.SUMMERS: Understanding that this briefing was classified, is there anything else you can tell us about what you learned from Admiral Bradley?REED: Not really because, again, we asked a series of questions. We were, I think, all of us, including my two colleagues in the House, Mike Rogers and Adam Smith and my chairman Roger Wicker, were all deeply engaged in questioning. We probed as much as we could. And so much of it turns on legal opinions and legal judgments together with, you know, the facts of the situation on the ground. It was, I think, the beginning, I hope, of a fruitful discussion. I don't think we've reached a conclusion yet.SUMMERS: What questions do you still have after hearing from Admiral Bradley?REED: Well, the question I have is, to what extent the secretary of defense influenced the operation and that influence contributed to the outcome. Again, Secretary Hegseth was not shy about proclaiming, after the fact, publicly, that we had destroyed a vessel containing cocaine and killing all personnel aboard the vessel. That should be probed, I think, to determine whether that was to - overrode any other conditions or legal requirements.SUMMERS: Did you get a sense from Admiral Bradley's testimony whether Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth did give that kill-them-all order? Did that come up?REED: Well, again, that's a detail I think would be inappropriate because of the nature of the hearing.SUMMERS: I mean, I used to cover defense committees on Capitol Hill, and I know that the Armed Services committees, they have a long history of bipartisanship. But that said, your Republican colleagues are facing a lot of pressure from President Trump in general. And specifically, he has been supportive of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in these actions. How confident are you, Senator, that your committee will be able to investigate thoroughly and that its conclusions will be taken seriously?REED: Well, I must commend Senator Wicker. We both asked for the hearing. We both have asked for all the materials that are still not being provided. We've tried to be collaborative, and we had. And he's, as you point out, under more pressure than most people in terms of raising these questions. And I think Chairman Rogers in the House and Adam Smith are both very committed, and they see their obligation to the country and also to the men and women of the armed services. I mean, one of the problems we have here is, if we don't insist upon strict observation of the rules of law, we can't expect our opponents to do it. And as a result, we're jeopardizing...SUMMERS: Right.REED: ...The lives of young men and women in our armed services. And that has to be foremost in our deliberations.SUMMERS: You have now heard from the admiral. You yourself graduated from West Point. You served as an Army Ranger. Where do you stand, taking stock of all of this? Was this strike a legal military operation?REED: Well, I have serious questions about the legality of all the strikes. The president has created a whole term of art (ph), a terrorist denominator organization, et cetera, and that has no legislative standing. He is using the military in what has been a traditional law enforcement operation. The Coast Guard, which is a law enforcement agency, has conducted interdiction in the Caribbean for years and years and years. That's the proper way to do it. This is a departure from what has been traditionally seen as the best way to interdict narcotics coming into the United States. And so I have serious serious questions about the overall legal validity of the operation and also individual operations, individual strikes.SUMMERS: And Senator, I do want to ask you quickly, Secretary Hegseth has also been under scrutiny for sharing sensitive military operation over the free messaging app Signal. And I'll note that NPR CEO Katherine Maher chairs the Signal Foundation Board. The Pentagon's inspector general concluded that the secretary violated Pentagon policies. Some of your Republican colleagues acknowledged that sharing classified information on this app was a problem. Will you call for Hegseth to be dismissed?REED: Well, I opposed his nomination, so I think I was a little bit ahead of my...SUMMERS: And I understand that, but he was confirmed. So what should happen now?REED: Well, these are very serious charges. I don't think they're being treated by the administration as serious as they are. One of the conclusions in the report was that he jeopardized the life and safety of American pilots going into combat action. That's something that no secretary of defense should do. So I think he has made a series of miscues that confirm my original judgment that he lacks the temperament, the experience and the character to be secretary of defense.SUMMERS: Senator Jack Reed, Democrat from Rhode Island and ranking member on the Armed Services Committee, thanks for your time.REED: Thank you very much.SUMMERS: I'll note that in response to the IG report on the use of Signal, the White House has said no classified information was leaked and operational security was not compromised. And Secretary Hegseth has denied a Washington Post report that said he gave orders to kill everybody on the vessel that the U.S. bombed in the Caribbean in early September.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

The directive, sent in an internal memo on Tuesday, is focused on applicants for H-1B visas for highly skilled workers, which are frequently used by tech companies, among other sectors. The memo was first reported by Reuters; NPR also obtained a copy.   \n   \"If you uncover evidence an applicant was responsible for, or complicit in, censorship or attempted censorship of protected expression in the United States, you should pursue a finding that the applicant is ineligible\" for a visa, the memo says. It refers to a policy announced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio in May restricting visas from being issued to \"foreign officials and persons who are complicit in censoring Americans.\"   The Trump administration has been highly critical of tech companies' efforts to police what people are allowed to post on their platforms and of the broader field of trust and safety, the tech industry's term for teams that focus on preventing abuse, fraud, illegal content, and other harmful behavior online.   \n   President Trump was banned from multiple social media platforms in the aftermath of his supporters' attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. While those bans have since been lifted, the president and members of his administration frequently cite that experience as evidence for their claims that tech companies unfairly target conservatives — even as many tech leaders have eased their policies in the face of that backlash.   \n   Tuesday's memo calls out H-1B visa applicants in particular \"as many work in or have worked in the tech sector, including in social media or financial services companies involved in the suppression of protected expression.\"   It directs consular officers to \"thoroughly explore\" the work histories of applicants, both new and returning, by reviewing their resumes, LinkedIn profiles, and appearances in media articles for activities including combatting misinformation, disinformation or false narratives, fact-checking, content moderation, compliance, and trust and safety.   \n   \"I'm alarmed that trust and safety work is being conflated with 'censorship',\" said Alice Goguen Hunsberger, who has worked in trust and safety at tech companies including OpenAI and Grindr.   \"Trust and safety is a broad practice which includes critical and life-saving work to protect children and stop CSAM [child sexual abuse material], as well as preventing fraud, scams, and sextortion. T&S workers are focused on making the internet a safer and better place, not censoring just for the sake of it,\" she said. \"Bad actors that target Americans come from all over the world and it's so important to have people who understand different languages and cultures on trust and safety teams — having global workers at tech companies in [trust and safety] absolutely keeps Americans safer.\"   \n   In a statement, a State Department spokesperson who declined to give their name said the department does not comment on \"allegedly leaked documents,\" but added: \"the Administration has made clear that it defends Americans' freedom of expression against foreigners who wish to censor them. We do not support aliens coming to the United States to work as censors muzzling Americans.\"   The statement continued: \"In the past, the President himself was the victim of this kind of abuse when social media companies locked his accounts. He does not want other Americans to suffer this way. Allowing foreigners to lead this type of censorship would both insult and injure the American people.\"   First Amendment experts criticized the memo's guidance as itself a potential violation of free speech rights.   \"People who study misinformation and work on content-moderation teams aren't engaged in 'censorship'— they're engaged in activities that the First Amendment was designed to protect. This policy is incoherent and unconstitutional,\" said Carrie DeCell, senior staff attorney and legislative advisor at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, in a statement.   Even as the administration has targeted those it claims are engaged in censoring Americans, it has also tightened its own scrutiny of visa applicants' online speech.   On Wednesday, the State Department announced it would require H-1B visa applicants and their dependents to set their social media profiles to \"public\" so they can be reviewed by U.S. officials.

Think Hollywood on the Potomac.   Every year, an astonishing number of A-listers come to Washington, D.C., to pay tribute to the honorees with performances and speeches. Think Beyoncé performing for Tina Turner, Audrey Hepburn rhapsodizing about Cary Grant, Rob Reiner praising Norman Lear, Aretha Franklin singing for Carol King, Sidney Poitier honoring Harry Belafonte or James Taylor and John Williams playing for Yo-Yo Ma.   \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n                    YouTube\n                \n        \n   This year's Kennedy Center honorees are Sylvester Stallone, George Strait, the rock band KISS, Gloria Gaynor and English actor and singer Michael Crawford.   As in years past, Sunday night's gala will be turned into a broadcast special that will air on CBS and Paramount+ on Dec. 23.   But, after months of upheaval at the Kennedy Center, the 48th Honors will be different. In February, President Trump abruptly ousted the Kennedy Center president, Deborah Rutter, and board chair David Rubenstein. Staff who worked on the ceremony and broadcast have also recently resigned.   \n   Here's what else has changed.   The selection process   In the past, honorees were chosen in a months-long, bipartisan undertaking by members of the Kennedy Center board with input from the general public and past honorees. Ultimately recipients were selected by executive members of the board and a couple of other senior staff members, with consultation from past honorees such as Julie Andrews, Lionel Richie and John Williams.   This year, President Trump said he was \"about 98%\" involved in the selection process. He also broke with tradition by personally announcing the names at a press conference at the Kennedy Center last August. Previously, the announcement was made on the center's website and in press releases.   \n   The host   \n   Previous hosts of the Kennedy Center Honors have included Walter Cronkite, Stephen Colbert, Gloria Estefan and Queen Latifah. Trump will host this year, a first for a U.S. president. At the August press conference, Trump said he's hosting because he was asked (he didn't say by whom), and said he was told \"You'll get much higher ratings.\" He continued, \"I used to host The Apprentice finales and we did rather well with that. So I think we're going to do very well because we have some great honorees.\"   Neither Trump nor first lady Melania Trump attended Honors events during his first term.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Actor and singer Queen Latifah, Jill Biden and former President Joe Biden attend the 46th Kennedy Center Honors in 2023.\n                \n                    Kent Nishimura/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kent Nishimura/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   One of the time-honored perks of being chosen is getting to sit with the president and first lady in the Box Tier of the Kennedy Center Opera House. It's unclear how Trump's hosting duties will affect his presence in the box.   \n   The iconic rainbow medallion is no more    In the past, Kennedy Center Honorees were each presented with a vibrant, multicolored satin ribbon adorned with a gold plate inscribed with the honoree's name at a State Department dinner the evening before the gala. Past honorees including Quincy Jones and Rita Moreno would attend subsequent galas proudly wearing their own medallions.   For the first time since 1978, the medallions will not be made by the same family of artists, as first reported by The Washington Post. The new design is by Tiffany & Co. and features a blue ribbon instead of the rainbow one, with rainbow stripes on the medallion itself.    Who will show?   In keeping with tradition, the Kennedy Center is not revealing the names of the performers who will pay tribute to this year's honorees. The surprise on honorees' faces when they see who has come to pay their respects has made for some fun, poignant TV moments.   \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n                    YouTube\n                \n        \n   The upheaval at the Kennedy Center has led to questions about who will be there this year. Historically, even when artists have disagreed with past administrations, they've in large part showed up. Some make it a point to come every year.   \n   This year could be different. Former honoree Herbie Hancock, who has attended many past Honors and consulted during the selection process, will not attend. His spokesperson told NPR he will be on a tour of Asia. Bonnie Raitt, one of last year's honorees who has also been a tribute performer, will not attend either.   Over the decades, the Kennedy Center forged strong relationships with leading performing artists from around the world. At the press conference in August, Trump boasted that he and the center's new leadership \"ended the woke political programming.\" Words that might push some artists away.\n",

The decision released Thursday boosts the GOP's chances of preserving its slim majority in the House of Representatives amid an unprecedented gerrymandering fight launched by President Trump, who has been pushing Texas and other GOP-led states to redraw their congressional districts to benefit Republicans.   The high court's unsigned order follows Texas' emergency request for the justices to pause a three-judge panel's ruling blocking the state's recently redrawn map.   \n   After holding a nine-day hearing in October, that panel found challengers of the new map are likely to prove in a trial that the map violates the Constitution by discriminating against voters based on race.   \n   In its majority opinion — authored by a Trump nominee — the panel cited a letter from the Department of Justice and multiple public statements by key Republican state lawmakers that suggested their map-drawer manipulated the racial demographics of voting districts to eliminate existing districts where Black and Latino voters together make up the majority. For the next year's midterms, the panel ordered Texas to keep using the congressional districts the state's GOP-controlled legislature drew in 2021.   But in Texas' filing to the Supreme Court, the state claimed the lawmakers were not motivated by race and were focused instead on drawing new districts that are more likely to elect Republicans.   What the Supreme Court said    In its Thursday decision to side with Texas, the Supreme Court said the panel \"failed to honor the presumption of legislative good faith by construing ambiguous direct and circumstantial evidence against the legislature.\"   The high court also found that, given the release of the panel's ruling in the middle of Texas' candidate filing period, the lower court had \"improperly inserted itself into an active primary campaign, causing much confusion and upsetting the delicate federal-state balance in elections.\"   \n   In a dissenting opinion, however, Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan criticized the court's majority for reversing the panel's decision after a \"perusal, over a holiday weekend, of a cold paper record.\"   The high court's decision \"ensures that many Texas citizens, for no good reason, will be placed in electoral districts because of their race,\" wrote Kagan, who was joined by the court's two other liberals, Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson. \"And that result, as this Court has pronounced year in and year out, is a violation of the Constitution.\"   \n   In November, after the panel blocked the new map, Justice Samuel Alito allowed Texas to temporarily reinstate it while the Supreme Court reviewed the state's emergency request.   Texas state Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, cheered the Supreme Court's ruling on Thursday, saying in a statement that the GOP-drawn map \"reflects the political climate of our state and is a massive win for Texas and every conservative who is tired of watching the left try to upend the political system with bogus lawsuits.\"   Democrats criticized the high court. In a statement, U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in a statement that the \"people of Texas don't want this map, but it was put in place at the behest of national Republicans who are desperate to cling to their majority in the House of Representatives by decimating minority voting opportunity.\"   Texas kicked off a redistricting fight   The mid-decade redistricting plan Texas Republicans passed in August sparked a counter response by Democratic leaders in California, where voters in a special election in November approved a new congressional map that could help Democrats gain five additional House seats. A court hearing for a legal challenge to that map is set for Dec. 15.   \n   The rest of the redistricting landscape remains unsettled as well. Lawsuits are challenging new gerrymanders in places like Missouri, where there is also a contested referendum effort. And other states, including Florida, Indiana and Virginia, may also pursue new districts prior to the midterms.   Last week, a federal court ruled to allow North Carolina's midterm election to be held under a recently redrawn map that could give Republicans an additional seat.   Another wave of congressional redistricting may be coming soon depending on what — and when — the Supreme Court decides in a voting rights case about Louisiana's congressional map. After the court held a rare rehearing for that case in October, some states are watching for a potential earlier-than-usual ruling that may allow Republican-led states to draw more GOP-friendly districts in time for the 2026 midterms.   \n   Edited by Benjamin Swasey\n",

Newspapers across Europe ran analyses and commentaries about it, and left-wing politicians in Europe took heart from the success of the 34-year-old American democratic socialist.   \n   \"Echoes of hope\" beyond the U.S.   Claire Lejeune, a member of parliament from France's left-wing France Unbowed party, tells NPR Mamdani's victory was a \"beacon of hope.\"   \"Its message echoes not only in the U.S., but also for us in France,\" Lejeune says. Her party sent members to New York to study Mamdani's winning ways on the campaign trail.   In the United Kingdom, Mamdani's victory is even influencing a mayoral race in the seaside region of Sussex and Brighton. The election has now been postponed until May 2028. But a recent a campaign leaflet for the Green Party features two faces — that of the local party candidate, Rachel Millward, and another of New York City's mayor-elect — with the words \"Hope can win.\"   \n   \n            New York just elected @ZohranKMamdani, who offers real hope, over billionaire funded opponents.

Lowering bills, taxing billionaires. For Zohran, it's about affordable rents, universal childcare,\" Polanski says. \"The message that he's sending ultimately about the inequality that exists in New York, I want to take that whole message and spread it across an entire country.\"   It's a message, he says, which is resonating with voters in towns and cities across England, as it did with New Yorkers.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Heidi Reichinnek, a German lawmaker with the Left party, speaks at a news conference before a meeting on the upcoming budget, Nov. 24.\n                \n                    Kay Nietfeld/picture alliance via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kay Nietfeld/picture alliance via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Heidi Reichinnek, co-leader of Germany's democratic-socialist Left Party, tells NPR her party also plans to focus on affordability and the cost of living in upcoming local elections.   \n   \"The [Mamdani] campaign was focusing on rent freeze, free and fast buses, free childcare, everything to make life better for the majority,\" Reichinnek says. \"When you listen to people and make their problems your agenda, that resonates with them.\"   Reichinnek says she was also heartened by Mamdani's inclusive message.   \"He never threw anyone under the bus to gain the approval of right-wing voters. He stood behind immigrants, queer people, unemployed people and never wavered. The best solution against right-wing propaganda is a strong leftist stand.\"   \n   Mamdani's campaign and message have also drawn criticism, with some claiming it was a gift to President Trump. \"The election of the left-wing extremist Mamdani as mayor of New York benefits Trump,\" far-right Alternative for Germany lawmaker Maximilian Krah wrote on X. \"He can now hold the entire Democratic Party jointly responsible for the foreseeable disaster in New York.\"   \n   And Mamdani has been attacked for his support for Palestinians and criticism of Israel, with French far-right politician Marion Maréchal suggesting New York could turn into a \"pro-Hamas\" zone. \"No country, no city is now safe from a takeover by the woke and Islamist left,\" she wrote on social media.   Mamdani, who is New York City's first Muslim mayor-elect, has called attacks about his faith and comparisons to extremists \"racist and baseless.\"   Europe's leftists hope to learn from Mamdani's winning ways   But progressive politicians are taking notes. U.K. Green Party leader Polanski tells NPR his video team is meeting some of Mamdani's videographers to pick up some tips.   \"It's exciting to see that cross-exchange happen,\" Polanski says, adding he hopes there will be more to come.   \n   In France, Lejeune hopes a Mamdani-inspired approach will help her party make gains in both local and presidential elections in the next couple of years.   \"If we want to stop the far right from getting into power in the next local elections then we've got to show the French people that we don't have to adopt the same kind of policies again and again that deteriorate the quality of life for everyone.\"   In Britain, national parliamentary elections are four years away. But the political landscape is changing, with a system once dominated by Labour and the Conservatives making way for others, including the far-right Reform U.K. and the Greens.   \n   Polanski sees in this an opportunity for his own leftist politics.   \"I can't tell you whether we're going to fall to the right and to fascism or whether we're going to go to the left, to a more progressive politics that cares about people and planet. I'm obviously hoping it's the latter, and I intend to do everything I can to make sure it's the latter.\"   Reichinnek, from Germany's Left Party, says her movement hopes to emulate the Mamdani campaign in upcoming elections in Germany, by \"going from door to door, talking to people, explaining that we can change something for the better.\"   \n   For now, Mamdani has given politicians on the left in Europe new momentum.   For Reichinnek, he's shown that success is possible.   \"We can face the billionaires, the right-wing extremists and win,\" she says.\n",

If you're not caught up, here's a quick rundown. On September 2, the U.S. military attacked a boat in the Caribbean it claims was carrying drugs. A second strike was ordered, killing two people who survived the first one. The officer who oversaw that strike is briefing lawmakers on Capitol Hill today. Now, President Trump and his team have repeatedly dismissed accusations of war crimes. It is clear they're aware of some kind of potential fallout, and they are working to contain it. For more on that, we turn to NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez. Hey there, Franco.FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: Hey, Mary Louise.KELLY: Hey. So Admiral Frank Bradley - this is the admiral who led the operation. He's the guy who's on the Hill today getting asked all kinds of questions about this. How does he fit into the picture?ORDOÑEZ: Well, Bradley is the admiral who was named first by the press secretary in a carefully worded statement, by the way, and then by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth as the one who specifically ordered that second strike that killed the survivors. And now he is the one, as you noted, the one facing scrutiny from lawmakers, and he's basically delivering just the latest version of how these strikes happened. And look, put aside questions about whether this is legal and whether this can be legally called a war at all. The administration has been putting out all kinds of different kinds of explanations about the strikes that have really just led to more confusion and legal uncertainty.KELLY: Right. I mean, we do know President Trump says he wasn't involved, wasn't aware. Pete Hegseth has said he was not in the room. What do we make of all of these shifts?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, I think it goes to the heart of what I expect and we all expect members of Congress are really drilling down on today because it has caused so much confusion. Now, I spoke last night with Leon Panetta, the former chief of staff to Bill Clinton and defense secretary for Barack Obama. And he told me that, in operations like this, the buck stops with the president and the defense secretary. But it is clear, in this case, he says, that neither wants to take responsibility.LEON PANETTA: So what they're doing is basically trying to play Whac-A-Mole with the different theories in the hope that people will accept what I think is a distorted series of excuses that doesn't address just exactly what happened.ORDOÑEZ: And Panetta says that when he was defense secretary, that they would have exhaustive meetings ahead of an operation like this to plan for any kind of contingency, including what to do if there are survivors.KELLY: All right. And whether something like that happened in this case is among the many things we don't know. Let me ask you, Franco, about consequences - how likely it is for either Secretary Hegseth or Admiral Bradley. How likely are they to face any kind of punishment, consequences, as more details come out?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. Trump was asked about that yesterday, and he didn't directly answer. But I think it does go back to the carefully written statement that the press secretary read earlier this week at a briefing that was kind of tacked on at the last minute, by the way. It was very choreographed. And I was speaking with Tevi Troy, who's a presidential historian and former White House aide to George W. Bush. He sees a clear effort to protect the president and the presidency.TEVI TROY: When a press secretary who usually speaks off the cuff reads a very carefully written statement, it usually suggests that the lawyers were involved.ORDOÑEZ: Now, Troy says Trump is likely to continue to support his Cabinet secretary until he doesn't. And he's not going to protect Hegseth - Trump, that is - if it is a detriment to himself.KELLY: NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez, thank you.ORDOÑEZ: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

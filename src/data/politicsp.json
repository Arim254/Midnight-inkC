Thirty-four Australian citizens from 11 families departed the camp.\n                \n                    Baderkhan Ahmad/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Baderkhan Ahmad/AP\n    \n\n   \n   MELBOURNE, Australia — The Australian government will not repatriate from Syria a group of 34 women and children with alleged ties to the Islamic State group, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Tuesday.   The women and children from 11 families were supposed to fly from the Syrian capital Damascus to Australia but Syrian authorities on Monday turned them back to Roj camp in northeast Syria because of procedural problems, officials said.   Only two groups of Australians have been repatriated with government help from Syrian camps since the fall of the Islamic State group in 2019. Other Australians have also returned without government assistance.   \n   Albanese would not comment on a report that the latest women and children had Australian passports.   \"We're providing absolutely no support and we are not repatriating people,\" Albanese told Australian Broadcasting Corp. in Melbourne.   \"We have no sympathy, frankly, for people who traveled overseas in order to participate in what was an attempt to establish a caliphate to undermine, destroy, our way of life. And so, as my mother would say, 'You make your bed, you lie in it,'\" Albanese added.   Albanese noted that the child welfare-focused international charity Save the Children had failed to establish in Australia's courts that the Australian government had a responsibility to repatriate citizens from Syrian camps.   After the federal court ruled in the government's favor in 2024, Save the Children Australia chief executive Mat Tinkler argued the government had a moral, if not legal, obligation to repatriate families.   Albanese said if the latest group made their way to Australia without government help, they could be charged.   It was an offense under Australian law to travel to the former Islamic State stronghold of al-Raqqa province without a legitimate reason from 2014 to 2017. The maximum penalty was 10 years in prison.   \"It's unfortunate that children are impacted by this as well, but we are not providing any support. And if anyone does manage to find their way back to Australia, then they'll face the full force of the law, if any laws have been broken,\" Albanese added.   \n   The last group of Australians to be repatriated from Syrian camps arrived in Sydney in October 2022.   They were four mothers, former partners of Islamic State supporters, and 13 children.   Australian officials had assessed the group as the most vulnerable among 60 Australian women and children held in Roj camp, the government said at the time.   Eight offspring of two slain Australian Islamic State fighters were repatriated from Syria in 2019 by the conservative government that preceded Albanese's center-left Labor Party administration.   The issue of Islamic State supporters resurfaced in Australia after the killings of 15 people at a Jewish festival at Bondi Beach on Dec. 14. The attackers were allegedly inspired by IS.\n",

    "body": "\n      The shutdown at the Department of Homeland Security is the latest example of bipartisan negotiations unraveling in the wake of a crisis that captures national attention.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  The third partial shutdown of the U.S. government in three months is having less obvious effects than the others.LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Funding ran out for the Department of Homeland Security, though key employees like airport security remain on the job. Coming up, we'll speak with a former FEMA administrator about the shutdown's impact on operations at the disaster relief agency. First, let's take a closer look at how missed funding deadlines are becoming routine and how that's making it harder for the government to think ahead.INSKEEP: NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas was listening to lawmakers as they didn't work things out over the past several days. Sam, good morning.SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: Hey, Steve.INSKEEP: Why does this keep happening?GRINGLAS: Yeah. So this latest effort seems to be following, I guess, a familiar cycle. A crisis captures national attention - in this case, the deadly shootings of two U.S. citizens by immigration agents in Minneapolis or, recently, health subsidies expiring and spiking premiums. A number of Democrats and Republicans suggest that they will respond, like when Republican Senator Bernie Moreno said last month that a bipartisan deal to save the subsidies was in the red zone only for talks to fizzle, leaving both sides pointing fingers.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BERNIE MORENO: Shouldn't we be here trying to figure out how to solve problems rather than trying to figure out how to score political points for the purposes of the next election?INSKEEP: Well, is that a fair assessment that Congress can't get anything done?GRINGLAS: Yeah. Some lawmakers would push back, like Republican Senator Susan Collins. I asked her why bipartisan talks seemed to keep crumbling. And she rejected that idea, pointing to all the spending bills that Congress has agreed to.SUSAN COLLINS: I don't know how you could possibly describe that as crumbling. That's Congress reasserting its power of the purse.INSKEEP: OK. That's an interesting argument. Congress has been very, very obedient over the last year, and she's saying, actually, no, now we're pushing back and funding things the way we want to. But why is it difficult for Congress to act on these hot-button issues that get a lot of public interest?GRINGLAS: I put that question to former Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp, and she told me that once the shock of a crisis wears off, lawmakers go back to their corners, and while bipartisan deals have always been delicate, many lawmakers today see less incentive as politics becomes more tribal.HEIDI HEITKAMP: The base on both sides, their willingness to reward compromise is greatly diminished.GRINGLAS: And Democratic Senator Tim Kaine says that on some issues, finding consensus is just really hard.TIM KAINE: On health care, on immigration, the parties are in fundamentally very, very different places.INSKEEP: OK. So let's circle back to this DHS shutdown, the partial shutdown. Any progress toward an agreement over the weekend?GRINGLAS: The White House and Democrats have been trading offers, but Democrats have described Republican proposals so far as insufficient, and Republicans are calling Democrats' demands unreasonable, like requiring judicial warrants for some enforcement operations. And judging by how fast lawmakers left D.C. last Thursday for a weeklong recess, the two sides are still far apart.INSKEEP: Could this shutdown last long enough that we could feel some effects?GRINGLAS: Members have been told to be ready to come back this week if there's a deal. Meanwhile, immigration enforcement will continue. Congress already gave ICE billions of dollars last year. Disaster response has money to work with for a while, and TSA agents won't miss a paycheck for a few weeks. So most Americans may not notice this shutdown unless it drags on.INSKEEP: OK. We'll see what happens in days to come. NPR Sam Gringlas. Thanks so much.GRINGLAS: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

And with that bar set about as low as it can be, Rubio cleared it — barely. A year ago, Vance attacked Europe for allowing what he saw as out-of-control migration.   \n   But Rubio took a different approach: He said that immigration had become a challenge in the U.S. as well. And he said that together, the U.S. and Europe in the postwar era had \"a dangerous delusion\" that they had entered \"the end of history\" and that \"every nation would now be a liberal democracy, that the ties formed by trade and by commerce alone would now replace nationhood.\" But the end result was that \"an unprecedented wave of mass migration that threatens the cohesion of our societies, the continuity of our culture, and the future of our people.\"   \n   Throughout his speech, Rubio drew Europeans closer to the destiny of the United States, outlining the contributions from European countries to the construction of the New World. \"Our frontiers were shaped by Scots-Irish, that proud Hardy clan from the hills of Ulster,\" Rubio said. \"That gave us Davy Crockett and Mark Twain. And Teddy Roosevelt and Neil Armstrong. Our great Midwestern heartland was built by German farmers and craftsmen who transformed empty plains into a global agricultural powerhouse.\"   \n   Rubio also cited the contributions of the Italians, French and Spanish to the formation of the United States, but he neglected to mention the Native Americans who many of these groups left devastated. He didn't mention how these groups exploited African slaves, or the Chinese who helped build the railway in the American West, or the contributions of so many other cultures who have made the United States what it is today.   \n   And when Rubio was finished, the European leaders assembled inside the Hotel Bayerischer Hof rewarded him with a standing ovation. Conference organizer Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to the U.S., took to the stage and said Europe was \"breathing a sigh of relief,\" referring to the leaders present, whose countries have long depended on American security guarantees and trade, and who were painfully accepting they were being pulled away.    One official not impressed with Rubio's cherry-picked history of the early United States was European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, who wore a look of horror and was one of the few people in the room who did not immediately stand during the applause.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas gives a speech at the 62nd Munich Security Conference on Feb. 15.\n                \n                    Thomas Kienzle/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Thomas Kienzle/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"Contrary to what some may say, woke, decadent Europe is not facing civilizational erasure,\" she said on stage on the final day of the conference.   \n   Kallas was not alone in her reluctance to be reassured by a member of the Trump administration. One of the most consequential speeches of the three-day conference came from a leader who typically is not known for rousing, unifying oratory: German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.    Merz's no-nonsense speech, delivered on Friday, the opening day of the conference, noted that the theme of this year's conference, titled \"Under Destruction,\" was a grim outlook on an international rules-based order.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                German Chancellor Friedrich Merz speaks with Wolfgang Ischinger (not pictured), chairman of the Munich Security Conference, after delivering his speech at the conference on Feb. 13.\n                \n                    Johannes Simon/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Johannes Simon/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"But I'm afraid that we have to put it in even harsher terms: This order, as flawed as it has been in its heyday, no longer exists,\" he said.   Merz blasted the bullying nature of \"big power politics\" waged by the U.S. under President Trump, China and Russia. \"Great power politics turns away from a world in which increasing connectivity translates into the rule of law and peaceful relations between states,\" said Merz. \"Natural resources, technologies and supply chains are becoming bargaining tools in the zero-sum game of the major powers. This is a dangerous game.\"   Merz told conference attendees that Germany and the rest of Europe had learned the lessons from World War II about \"big power\" governance and he urged European countries to unite their resources to resist these big powers, and to build a new European economy that will rival these big powers but maintain democratic values.    \"Russia's GDP is currently about 2 trillion euros, but that of the European Union is almost 10 times as high,\" said Merz, \"but still Europe is not 10 times as strong. Our military, political, economic and technological potential is huge, but we haven't tapped into this potential for a very long time, so the most important thing is to turn the switch in our minds now.\"   Merz acknowledged that the current geopolitical climate has forced Germany to implement changes to how it funds its military so that it is able to operate at \"full speed,\" but he said harnessing that pressure to create something new and good is now all of Europe's responsibility.   \n   And while European leaders may give visiting Trump administration officials standing ovations when they hear a rekindling of hope for the trans-Atlantic relationship, the tenor of this year's Munich Security Conference showed that these displays of appreciation are just that.    Europe is moving on.\n",

McLaughlin has become the public face and voice defending the Trump administration's mass deportation policy and immigration tactics over the past year.   \"McLaughlin started planning to leave in December but pushed back her departure amid the aftermath of the shootings of U.S. citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal immigration officers, according to the people briefed on her exit,\" DHS said in a statement to NPR.   POLITICO first reported her departure. It is not clear where she is going next, or who will become the agency's next spokesperson.   \n   McLaughlin's exit comes at a tumultuous time for the agency. DHS is currently shut down after lawmakers failed to pass a budget to fund it through the end of the fiscal year in September.   And high-ranking immigration officials, including DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, have been summoned to Capitol Hill to testify on the immigration crackdown after immigration agents shot and killed Good and Pretti in Minneapolis.   McLaughlin has been among the most public-facing agency spokespeople, participating in several network interviews. Beyond speaking on DHS' immigration initiatives, McLaughlin also fielded interviews and questions about Noem's handling of national disaster relief and resources, and other parts of the sprawling agency.   Noem praised McLaughlin's work in a statement online, saying she \"served with exceptional dedication, tenacity, and professionalism.\"   \"While we are sad to see her leave, we are grateful for her service and wish Tricia nothing but success,\" she wrote on the social platform X.   \n   Immigration has been the largest part of McLaughlin's portfolio. She often took to network shows and to social media to promote immigration arrests made by the administration, defend actions by DHS agents, and encouraged immigrants to \"self-deport.\"   House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries praised news of her departure online; \"Another MAGA extremist forced out of DHS. Noem next,\" he posted on X.   Most recently, McLaughlin defended Noem's description of Pretti as a \"domestic terrorist\" after Customs and Border Protection officers shot and killed him — claims that eventually drew sharp scrutiny from lawmakers, including some Republicans.   \n   \"Initial statements were made after reports from CBP on the ground. It was a very chaotic scene,\" McLaughlin told Fox Business late last month. \"The early statements that were released were based on the chaotic scene on the ground and we really need to have true, accurate information to come to light.\"   During last week's congressional hearings, the heads of Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement both denied that they, or anyone under their chains of command, had given Noem information to substantiate that claim that Pretti was a domestic terrorist.   An NPR analysis published in January showed that DHS has made unproven or incorrect claims on social media or in press releases when describing immigrants targeted for deportation or U.S. citizens arrested during protests.\n",

Now, after weeks of a federal immigration enforcement surge that led to two deaths, major disruptions and thousands of arrests, Minnesota Democrats are blaming their Republican colleagues for the ordeal. Minnesota Public Radio's Dana Ferguson reports.DANA FERGUSON, BYLINE: It was in December when a YouTube content creator with his phone in hand knocked on the doors of Minneapolis day care centers. Nick Shirley was looking for children, trying to prove that Somali American-run day cares were inflating enrollment to get more money from the state.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NICK SHIRLEY: Answer the question.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: You're not talking to the right person.SHIRLEY: Are there children?UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Leave.SHIRLEY: There's no children inside this building.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Leave. You don't know who you...SHIRLEY: Potentially...FERGUSON: The claims, some false, some already under investigation, got a lot of attention. And some Minnesota Republicans said they helped bring it about, including Harry Niska, the party's floor leader in the state House.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HARRY NISKA: This has been something that we have been ready and willing to provide information to anyone who wants to pursue this, including some of the information that ended up in that video.FERGUSON: Fraud has been a problem in some state-funded programs. Scores of people had already been convicted in a years-long investigation. But Shirley's video went from Minnesota to the White House. Within days, Democratic Governor Tim Walz dropped his bid for reelection to focus on the problem, pleasing Republicans who had called for his resignation. It was just the start of a traumatic ordeal for the state. Thousands of federal agents arrived, detained immigrants and some citizens. One of them killed Renee Macklin Good. Protests rippled across the city.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: Say her name.UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: Renee Good.UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: Say her name.UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: Renee Good.FERGUSON: The Trump administration announced a federal surge, including immigration agents, and pointed to fraud. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KAROLINE LEAVITT: The Trump administration has activated thousands of federal agents, doubled the number of U.S. attorneys in the DOJ office in Minneapolis and surged resources to hold fraudsters accountable and demand justice...FERGUSON: Minnesota Democrats blame their Republican colleagues for what followed.ERIN MURPHY: The pretext was caused by the action of the Republicans.FERGUSON: That's state Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy last week.MURPHY: I think the fraud issue is a pretext for this president to do what have - we have seen now as fairly lawless, violent and, in cases, reckless actions against the people of Minnesota.FERGUSON: Now, the spotlight has shifted.KATHRYN PEARSON: Immigration definitely overshadows fraud.FERGUSON: Kathryn Pearson is a political science professor at the University of Minnesota.PEARSON: It has backfired on Minnesota Republicans, I think, in several ways, in terms of sort of voters' attitude in terms of which party is better able to handle immigration.FERGUSON: House Democratic Leader Zack Stephenson says antifraud efforts have actually been undermined as some of the federal prosecutors working on it have resigned in the wake of the ICE surge.ZACK STEPHENSON: This has crippled our fraud response, and Minnesotans should be outraged by that.FERGUSON: But Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, a Republican who's running for governor, says the fraud issue and immigration are not connected.LISA DEMUTH: So if it took a YouTuber, an independent YouTuber, to get the word out and get Minnesotans to know what was actually going on and then the national attention, that is good for Minnesota because it was our tax dollars that were stolen.FERGUSON: While they're still disputing who's to blame for the last two months, state lawmakers are starting a legislative session this week where fraud and immigration will top the agenda.

What followed was a weeks-long federal immigration enforcement surge that led to upheaval in and around Minneapolis, thousands of arrests and the deaths of two U.S. citizens.   Minnesota Democrats have blamed Republicans for the turmoil, but Republicans say a national spotlight was necessary to take on fraud claims in Minnesota's government programs.   \"Much of the information that one of the gentlemen in that video was providing was due to information he got from the House Republican staff,\" Minnesota Rep. Harry Niska, the party's floor leader, told reporters in December. \"We have been ready and willing to provide information to anyone who wants to pursue this.\"   \n   GOP candidates in the state could face repercussions ahead of the midterm elections.   \"Immigration definitely overshadows fraud,\" said Kathryn Pearson, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota. \"It has backfired on Minnesota Republicans, I think, in several ways.\"   Pearson said Democrats will likely have the upper hand when it comes to voters' attitudes on which party is better able to handle immigration and which candidates have the better message on the issue. And in Minnesota, Democrats are leaning in.   \"I think the fraud issue is a pretext for this president to do what we have seen, which is fairly lawless, violent and, in cases, reckless actions against the people of Minnesota,\" Democratic Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy said last week.   \"I also think the pretext was caused by the action of the Republicans to invite Nick Shirley, a YouTuber, into town.\"   Viral video prompts Minneapolis surge   In December, Shirley posted a video of himself holding up his phone, knocking on the doors of several Minneapolis child care centers. He alleged the Somali-American-run daycares were inflating enrollment to get more money from the state.   The claims – some false, some already under investigation – got a lot of attention. Fraud has been a subject of ongoing reporting and federal investigations in Minnesota for years.   \n   The most well-known scheme took place during the COVID pandemic, involving a child nutrition program that was defrauded of more than $250 million. Dozens were convicted in connection with that scheme. The majority were Somali American, though not the leader.   \n   Shirley's video gained the attention of the White House. Vice President JD Vance reposted it on social media. Days later, on Jan. 5, Democratic Gov. Tim Walz dropped his bid for reelection to focus on the problem. That pleased Republicans who had called for his resignation.   The White House doubled down on the emphasis on fraud.   \"The Trump administration has activated thousands of federal agents, doubled the number of U.S. attorneys in the DOJ office in Minneapolis and surged resources to hold fraudsters accountable and demand justice for law-abiding American taxpayers and citizens across our country,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said.   Soon, thousands of federal agents arrived in and around Minneapolis. They detained immigrants and some citizens. On Jan. 7, one agent shot and killed Renee Macklin Good. Protests over her death rippled across the city.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A demonstrator carries a sign honoring the life of Renee Macklin Good on Jan. 9 in Minneapolis.\n                \n                    Ben Hovland/MPR News\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Ben Hovland/MPR News\n    \n\n   \n   Jan. 9, the Trump administration announced the creation of a division for National Fraud Enforcement and said they would send more immigration agents to the state.   But those anti-fraud efforts have been undermined as some federal prosecutors, including the lead prosecutor, working on them resigned in the wake of the ICE surge, said Minnesota House Democratic Leader Zack Stephenson.   \"This has crippled our fraud response, and Minnesotans should be outraged by that, and it was all done in the name of supposedly addressing fraud,\" he said. \"Republicans are more interested in distracting and pursuing their other partisan agendas and getting retribution. That's what the president said this is all about.\"   By Jan. 24, agents had killed Alex Pretti, another U.S. citizen.   Minnesota Republicans say fraud spotlight is key   But Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, a Republican who is running for governor, said the fraud issue and immigration are not connected. And she defended efforts to spotlight fraud in order to root it out.   \n   \"So if it took a YouTuber, an independent YouTuber, to get the word out and get Minnesotans to know what was actually going on, and then the national attention – that is good for Minnesota,\" Demuth said, \"because it was our tax dollars that were stolen.\"   Another Republican candidate for governor, businessman Kendall Qualls, agreed that it shouldn't matter how the issue of fraud came to light — just that it's getting addressed.   \"The cases don't go away. The problem doesn't go away,\" Qualls said. \"There's still $9 billion that was last reported that Minnesotans were on the hook for that, that were taken away. So that is a problem under the watch of our leaders in St Paul.\"   While they dispute who's to blame for the last two months, state lawmakers begin a legislative session Tuesday where fraud and immigration will top the agenda.\n",

The officer was accompanied by a police dog named Petey.   As they approached the car, Petey began barking. Something about this car was clearly strange. Sure enough, they discovered that the vehicle had about 66 pounds of cocaine stashed in a hidden compartment.   \"Drugs off the street, smuggler went to jail, and our good boy got a steak,\" the Upland Police Department posted about the drug bust on social media.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Upland Police Department\n    \n\n   \n   Drug busts like these are mounting around the nation, but they are just a small fraction of what's estimated to be a record-breaking surge in the supply of cocaine. In their most recent annual World Report, the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime found that, after a decade of rapid growth, \"Global cocaine production has hit an all-time high once again, accompanied by significant increases in cocaine seizures, cocaine users and – most tragically – cocaine-related deaths in many countries.\"   \n   So what's behind this surge? And how is it affecting us in the United States? A new working paper from economists Xinming Du, Benjamin Hansen, Shan Zhang, and Eric Zou — \"Coca's Return and the American Overdose Fallout\" — has some answers.   Why cocaine supply is surging   A decade ago, it seemed like the heyday of the cocaine market was mostly behind us. The drug was still popular in certain places, but it was also something of a relic, associated more with discos in the 1970s and Wall Street in the 1980s.   Du and the other economists suggest that at least part of cocaine's decline was the result of fierce supply-side interventions in Colombia. With significant U.S. involvement, Colombia \"waged an aggressive campaign against the plantation of coca, the raw plant used to make cocaine,\" they write. As a result, \"Colombia's coca fields shrank from about 168,000 hectares in 2000 to just 48,000 by 2013, and cocaine became much less available in the United States.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                TOPSHOT - A Colombian police officer hugs a dog during an operation to eradicate illicit crops in Tumaco, Narino Department, Colombia on December 30, 2020.\n                \n                    JUAN BARRETO/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        JUAN BARRETO/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   But around 2015, the economists write, a couple of policy changes \"created a perfect storm for coca's resurgence.\" First, the Colombian government ended its U.S.-supported aerial fumigation program on public health grounds. Many feared that the chemical they sprayed (glyphosate) was carcinogenic. Then, in late 2016, the Colombian government signed a historic peace deal with the Marxist revolutionary guerilla group FARC. For decades, FARC had tried to overthrow the Colombian government, and to finance their war, they got heavily involved in the cocaine trade.   \n   \"For years, the FARC had tightly controlled and taxed coca production in the areas it dominated,\" the economists write. \"When the rebels demobilized, a power vacuum formed in remote coca-growing regions. A variety of other armed groups ranging from dissident FARC factions to cartels rushed in to seize these territories. These new traffickers actively encouraged local farmers to plant more coca as they consolidated control.\"   Also, in a classic case of unintended consequences, the Colombian government introduced \"a coca crop substitution program that promised stipends and development aid to farmers who eradicated their coca,\" but that plan backfired because farmers \"quickly realized they needed to have coca plants in the ground to qualify for compensation, which led many to start new coca plots or expand existing ones in hopes of securing the promised subsidies.\" (Side Note: Check out a recent Planet Money episode about a U.S. effort to get Peruvian coca farmers to grow blueberries).   Because of these and other factors, the program to eradicate coca farming in Colombia failed, and production exploded. \"By 2022, Colombia's coca cultivation area and potential cocaine output were more than three times their 2015 levels,\" the economists write.   Much of this cocaine came to the United States (as well as Europe, which has also been seeing a historic cocaine boom). Data from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) shows that, after 2015, \"the average size of cocaine seizures jumped markedly, while seizures of other drugs did not follow the same pattern.\"   And, hello classic supply and demand, with a surge in cocaine production and distribution, prices fell, helping to stoke a demand boom.   Ben Hansen, an economist at the University of Oregon who co-authored this study, says cocaine is an \"experience good,\" meaning it's a kind of product users have to experience to stimulate demand. \"Because cocaine is an experience good, if you have a big supply shock, that leads to more people potentially using it and therefore experiencing it, and liking it,\" Hansen says. \"And then they want it again.\" In this way, a flood of new supply generates a surge in new demand.   \n   Cocaine has many negative side effects, but the scariest one is overdoses. Following a long period of \"stable cocaine-related mortality,\" the economists write, cocaine-related overdose fatalities began surging in the United States by the late 2010s.   The fallout from the cocaine surge   Du, Hansen, Zhang, and Zou estimate what this surge of cocaine supply has meant for American overdoses. The economists calculate that had the post-2015 Colombian cocaine explosion never happened, there would be around 1,500 fewer overdose deaths in the United States every year.   For context, in 2023, the last year with complete data, there were about 30,000 overdose deaths involving cocaine, according to the CDC. That was about 28% of all overdose deaths.   That's significantly less than overdose deaths from synthetic opioids (primarily fentanyl), which were involved in nearly 73,000 deaths, or about 69% of the total.   Hansen, who has also studied the opioid market, says they were particularly sensitive to the reality that, at the same time as this cocaine surge, there was also a fentanyl surge, and sometimes people overdosed after ingesting both drugs (sometimes unintentionally because the cocaine was cut with fentanyl). \" And when we restrict to overdose deaths that were only involving cocaine, we still continue to find this relationship, suggesting that this is not just a fentanyl correlation that we're accidentally picking up here,\" Hansen says.   The United States, of course, isn't the only nation to experience negative effects from the dramatic expansion of cocaine production and distribution. Another new working paper by economists Gianmarco Daniele, Adam Soliman, and Juan Vargas, \"Cocaine Goes Bananas: Global Spillovers from an Illicit Supply Shock,\" documents that this post-2015 cocaine surge \"coincided with a sharp increase in homicide rates of about one-third, with substantially larger effects in port areas\" in Colombia. They also find that violence from the cocaine trade spilled over to Ecuador, which is one major transit hub for cocaine, and that contributed to a \"nearly five-fold increase in homicide rates\" in that nation. The economists also link the explosion of cocaine supply to an explosion of use in Europe, which likely has had negative effects similar to ones seen in the United States.   \n   Policymakers are paying attention. For instance, the Colombian cocaine surge has been one big reason for a fraying of relations between the U.S. and Colombia under President Trump. Earlier this month, President Trump and the President of Columbia, Gustavo Petro, met and fighting the cocaine trade was at the top of their agenda.   One clear implication of this new study from Du, Hansen, Zhang, and Zou is that supply-side interventions can work to reduce cocaine use, particularly at the source where cocaine is coming from.   Hansen compared drug traffickers to multinational corporations. Like corporations, \"They're going to respond to the bottom line,\" Hansen says. \"And if you make it a lot harder to produce things, well, they're gonna probably scale back production, just like when we regulate other companies or raise their taxes.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      In a rare move, the White House took down a racist post last week from one of President Trump's social media accounts. But extremism researchers say it fits a pattern of mainstreaming extremist ideas.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  Former President Barack Obama commented over the weekend about a racist post that the White House took down from one of President Trump's social media accounts. The post included an image of Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes. The former president said many Americans, quote, \"find this behavior deeply troubling.\" But it fits into a larger and ongoing pattern of extremist rhetoric and imagery coming from the Trump administration. NPR's domestic extremism correspondent Odette Yousef joins us now to discuss. Hey, Odette.ODETTE YOUSEF, BYLINE: Hey, Scott.DETROW: So look, this is not the first time the president has said or posted something that is really outside the bounds of acceptable public discourse. Put all this into context for us.YOUSEF: Yeah, I spoke with Eric Ward about this. He heads the civil rights organization Race Forward, and here's how he framed it.ERIC WARD: If this were just one racist image or one bad post, it wouldn't matter much. What matters is that, over the last year, the Trump administration has increasingly learned to speak in the emotional language of white nationalism. And once a government starts talking that way, it quietly changes who the country is for.YOUSEF: And Scott, you know, Ward and others have seen this not just out of the White House, but also the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department and the Department of Labor, you know, where language, visual style and some of the musical choices are reflective of what historically was contained within fringe extremist movements. Now, Trump has said he did not see that part of the post that depicted the Obamas. He said an aide was responsible for it. But the racism of that post was not necessarily surprising to people who've been tracking extremist themes in public messaging from this administration. You know, Scott, what was notable to them was its overtness, you know, in contrast with the dog whistles or insider references of other messaging that, you know, only people familiar with the white nationalist movement would readily recognize.DETROW: Can you give us a few examples of some of those dog whistles?YOUSEF: There have been so many examples. You know, one of the most notable was a social media post from DHS to recruit ICE agents, and the post said - which way, American man? This was largely taken as a reworking of the title of a racist antisemitic book called \"Which Way Western Man?\" That book is part of the neo-Nazi white nationalist canon. Another example, we've discussed on this show before, Scott, the concept of remigration that DHS and the State Department have publicly endorsed. That concept was largely popularized by far-right ultranationalists in Europe. You know, NPR asked DHS about the pattern of public messaging that resembles white nationalist propaganda, and a spokesperson wrote back, quote, \"by NPR's standards, every American who posts patriotic imagery on the Fourth of July should be canceled and labeled a Nazi - not everything you dislike is Nazi propaganda,\" end quote.DETROW: What is the point of this kind of messaging, though? I mean, I think it's fair to say that most Americans are not supportive of white nationalism or extremism.YOUSEF: That's absolutely right. I mean, white nationalists comprise a very small proportion of the American public. You know, people I've been speaking to think this is really about training the public's reflexes to associate certain ideas with each other. For example, associating immigrants with crime, associating America with whiteness. But, you know, Scott, for me, it's troubling that covering domestic extremism is now not just about tracking fringe groups, but tracking federal government - you know, federal government messaging.You know, one person who explains how all of this fits together is J.M. Berger. He's a scholar at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies. And he defines extremism not simply as movements that are out there. He says extremism actually is the belief that your community can only be successful or secure if it's engaged in harmful action against another community. And that belief can be promoted by a government itself. Berger calls this lawful extremism, where the apparatus of the state is used to enforce those systems of supremacy and harm. And Scott, I think it's a term we might think about as we look at how this administration has embraced language premising the safety and success of some Americans on the removal of certain immigrants.DETROW: Lawful extremism, interesting.

On Jan. 21, federal immigration authorities from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) launched a new enforcement operation in Maine called Operation Catch of the Day, aimed at identifying and arresting undocumented immigrants.\n                \n                    Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   As the only Republican senator up for reelection in a state that didn't back Donald Trump in 2024, Maine Sen. Susan Collins was already considered one of the GOP's most vulnerable incumbents headed into the midterms.   Then came an immigration enforcement surge last month targeting some of Maine's largest and most diverse communities.   Department of Homeland Security officials said the surge — dubbed Operation Catch of the Day in an apparent pun on Maine's fishing heritage —  would target \"the worst of the worst.\" But eyewitness reports, cellphone videos and news reports suggested the masked, heavily armed agents were taking a much broader reach.   \n   A civil engineer and recent University of Maine graduate from Colombia with a work permit was arrested during his morning commute. Two asylum-seekers legally working at county jails were detained. A month-old baby was showered by glass after agents broke a car window to snag his father, an immigrant with no criminal record.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, enters the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 27. Collins announced her plan to run for a sixth term on Feb. 10.\n                \n                    Heather Diehl/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Heather Diehl/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   In stepped Collins.   \"I called Secretary [Kristi] Noem because I was very concerned about what I was hearing from constituents and seeing in news reports and ... it also struck me that the term that was being used, 'Catch of the Day,' was highly offensive,\" Collins told Maine Public Radio last week. \"I told her that I felt that ICE officials had gone too far — that they were not focusing on people who are here illegally and had criminal records.\"   A nearly 30-year Senate veteran, Collins holds arguably one of the most influential positions in Congress as chair of the budget-writing Senate Appropriations Committee. In that role, Collins tried last month to negotiate a funding deal for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement.   At that time, Collins said, she \"kept pushing [Noem] to suspend and cease the enhanced operations in the state of Maine — and she agreed to do so in response to my request.\"   \n   Although immigration agents continue to operate in the border state, the highly visible enforcement surge appeared to subside after Collins spoke with Noem. But the senator's critics back home aren't giving her the credit.   \"Susan Collins didn't make that happen,\" said Graham Platner, an oysterman, Marine Corps veteran and Democrat whose progressive Senate campaign has attracted huge crowds since the summer.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                U.S. senatorial candidate Graham Platner of Maine speaks at a town hall on Oct. 22, 2025, in Ogunquit, Maine. Platner, a Marine Corps veteran, oyster farmer and Democrat, is running for the seat held by Republican Sen. Susan Collins.\n                \n                    Sophie Park/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Sophie Park/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Platner argued that the real reason ICE and DHS reduced their presence in Maine is communities organized against them. In fact, Platner blamed Collins for the current situation because, he said, she could have used her influence over federal funding to force the Trump administration to change its tactics.   \"I mean, she's done absolutely nothing to stop ICE,\" Platner said. \"She has done absolutely nothing to try to rein in the behavior of the Trump administration over the last year. \"   Platner's chief opponent in the June Democratic primary, two-term Gov. Janet Mills, has also made ICE and the immigration crackdown a key campaign issue.   During her State of the State address, delivered several days into the enforcement surge, Mills accused the Trump administration of \"stoking fear in our communities ... and arresting people not on public safety grounds but based on quotas, on skin color, on accents, on religion, on ethnic origin.\"   \"We will not be intimidated — we will not be silenced,\" Mills said. \"And to anyone outside these halls, including any federal officials, I say, 'If you seek to harm Maine people, you will have to go through me first.'\"   As attorney general and now governor, Mills once had a seemingly friendly working relationship with Collins. But now, the moderate Democrat routinely portrays Collins as being unwilling to stand up to President Trump.   \"Right now, she's voting to fund ICE — to continue to fund ICE without any standards, without any substantive controls, without any accountability,\" Mills told reporters last week. \"The people of this country want accountability.\"   \n   Democratic groups are targeting Collins with the same message. A group tied to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has endorsed Mills, is spending more than $2 million on television and digital ads in Maine hitting Collins on the issue of ICE and DHS funding.   Collins' campaign has called those ads \"false and intentionally misleading.\" Collins also pointed out that the Republican-backed version of the DHS budget bill still stalled in Congress contains about $20 million for body cameras and de-escalation training for ICE agents. The agency is currently shut down as Democrats demand broader reforms within ICE, such as prohibiting masked agents, before approving funding.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Maine Gov. Janet Mills speaks during a moderated discussion among Northeast governors and Canadian premiers on the impacts of President Trump's tariffs, in Boston on June 16, 2025.\n                \n                    Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   In an interview, Collins said it \"remains to be seen\" whether Trump's policies will be a factor in her reelection bid.   \"But I am running on my record of independence,\" Collins said. \"I support the president as I have every other president that I've worked with when I think he is right. I oppose them when I think he is wrong.\"   The Collins campaign's repeated use of the word \"independence\" is strategic. Nearly one-third of Maine voters are independents, or unaffiliated, making them the second-largest voting block after Democrats. Those independents have been crucial to Collins' past victories, including in 2020 when she defeated a better-funded Democrat by 9 percentage points.   But Dan Shea, a professor of government at Colby College and a longtime political observer in Maine, pointed out that independents accounted for roughly 40% of Maine voters a few decades ago. Shea said that shift has largely benefited the Democratic Party.   \"It's a blue state, but it's becoming more deeply blue,\" Shea said. \"So that's a big issue for the senator. She wins by split-ticket voters, by unaffiliated voters, independents. And that pool is getting smaller.\"   Shea said Collins will likely campaign hard on her ability to bring home money as chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee. The spending package passed by Congress last month contains more than $300 million in \"congressionally directed spending\" for Maine that was requested by Collins.   \n   But the bigger headwinds facing Collins and other Republicans, Shea said, is what he projects will be a massive turnout this fall by Democrats motivated by their anger over Trump's policies — with immigration potentially topping that list.   \"I think her association with the Republicans in Washington is going to hurt her in Maine,\" Shea said. \"I think she's the underdog. She may win — she's a great campaigner. Again, she's known across the state. But one thing's for sure: I think it's going to be wicked tight.\"\n",

Jesse Jackson, an American civil rights leader, minister, and politician, who was a protégé of Martin Luther King Jr. and in the 1980s reshaped Democratic politics with two galvanizing presidential campaigns, died Tuesday at the age of 84.   \"Our father was a servant leader — not only to our family, but to the oppressed, the voiceless, and the overlooked around the world,\" the Jackson family said in a statement. \"We shared him with the world, and in return, the world became part of our extended family.\"   According to the Jackson family, public commemorations will take place in Chicago.   \n   Jackson was born Oct. 8, 1941, in a tiny house in Greenville, S.C., where he began his lifelong work fighting for civil rights.    \n   While visiting home for Christmas break during his freshman year at the University of Illinois,  Jackson needed to borrow a book but couldn't get it from the town's white-only library. Six months later, on July 16, 1960, he and seven other students held a sit-in at the library and were arrested for protesting. After his experience as a member of the \"Greenville Eight,\" Jackson transferred to North Carolina Agricultural & Technical College, a historically Black school in Greensboro, N.C.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Rev.

Jackson became a close ally of King — eventually leaving his graduate studies at the Chicago Theological Seminary to join King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference. He became the Chicago coordinator and a year later, in 1967, the national leader of the SCLC's Operation Breadbasket, which was dedicated to improving the economic conditions of Black communities in the U.S.   In April 1968, Jackson traveled with King to Memphis, Tenn., where he witnessed the civil rights leader's assassination.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Rev.

By 1971, he split with the group and formed his own organization, called Operation PUSH. The group continued Jackson's work to increase Black Americans' political strength and political opportunities.    \n   Jackson later merged Operation PUSH with his National Rainbow Coalition to form the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, which became a prominent civil rights organization.   Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Jackson, who became an ordained Baptist minister in 1968, increasingly became an influential player on the national stage.   In 1983, Jackson organized a voter registration drive in Chicago that is credited as being the key factor for the election of the city's first Black mayor, Harold Washington.   Presidential bids   In November 1983, he announced his first bid for president, becoming the second Black person to seek a major party's nomination after Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm in 1972. His rousing speech at the 1984 Democratic Convention in San Francisco appealed to a \"Rainbow Coalition\" of disenfranchised Americans and people of color.     \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Rev.

We're not a perfect people,\" Jackson said. \"Yet, we are called to a perfect mission. Our mission to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to house the homeless, to teach the illiterate, to provide jobs for the jobless, and to choose the human race over the nuclear race.\"   Though Jackson had significant support for his bid, with his campaign registering more than a million new voters and winning 3.5 million votes, his run for president was not without controversy. Jackson drew heated criticism for making a disparaging remark about New York's Jewish community and for his relationship with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who has said the Jewish community is to blame for Black oppression.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The 1984 Democratic presidential candidates pose for photographers prior to the Democratic debate at Dartmouth College.

He placed third in the Democratic primary behind former Vice President Walter Mondale and Sen. Gary Hart. Still, it was a landmark achievement for Jackson and a growing Black political movement.   In 1988, he ran again, expanding his outreach to more white Americans, and reached an emotional crescendo during an impassioned speech at that year's Democratic convention. Although Jackson won major presidential primaries, the first African American to do so, he came in second to the Democratic Party nominee, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. Until Barack Obama's election in 2008, Jackson was the most successful Black U.S. presidential candidate.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Democratic presidential hopeful Rev.

In several instances, he negotiated and secured the release of  American hostages held captive abroad — most notably from Syria, Cuba and Serbia.  From 1992 to 2000, he also hosted a weekly discussion show on CNN, Both Sides with Jesse Jackson, where he addressed current social and political issues.    \n   In 2000, Jackson received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest honor a civilian in the U.S. can receive. But controversy was not far behind. A year later, news that Jackson fathered a daughter with a former member of his staff became public.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Bill Clinton embraces the Rev. Jesse Jackson, founder and president of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, after awarding him the Presidential Medal of Freedom during ceremonies in the East Room of the White House on Aug. 9, 2000, in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP\n    \n\n   \n   When the scandal broke, he said, \"This is no time for evasions, denials or alibis. I fully accept responsibility and I am truly sorry for my actions.\"    Jackson found himself apologizing again in 2008, this time to Obama, for crass remarks he made about the presidential candidate in an aside to a reporter on a Fox News program. Obama accepted the apology. And despite other comments critical of the tone of some of Obama's campaign speeches, Jackson was present at his victory party at Grant Park in Chicago and wept.     \"I knew that people in the villages of Kenya and Haiti, and mansions and palaces in Europe and China, were all watching this young African American male assume the leadership to take our nation out of a pit to a higher place,\" Jackson told NPR after Obama's election night.   Jackson saw the rise and painful fall of the promising political career of his oldest son, Jesse Jackson Jr., who was elected to Congress from Illinois in 1995 and resigned in 2012 citing health issues. After leaving office, he was investigated for misuse of campaign funds and pleaded guilty in 2013 to spending $750,000 in campaign funds for personal use. He was sentenced to 30 months in prison.     \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. walks away after speaking to the media following a sentencing hearing for his son, former Illinois Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr., and his wife, Sandi Jackson, at the U.S. District Court in Washington, DC, on Aug. 14, 2013. Jackson Jr. was sentenced to 30 months in prison and his wife, Sandi, received a year sentence for separate felonies involving the misspending campaign funds.\n                \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"I speak really today as a father,\" Jackson Sr. said at the courthouse the day of the sentencing. \"Most of my career has been spent outgoing — helping someone else on something I really understood socially and politically. But this one, of course, is home.\"   \n   In 2017, Jackson announced he had Parkinson's disease, a degenerative disorder that affects movement.  In November, his organization revealed Jackson was diagnosed in April with progressive supranuclear palsy, a rare neurological disease similar but different from Parkinson's disease.  Despite his illness, Jackson often showed up at protests against police brutality, calling for justice for victims of police shootings.    In August 2020, Jackson spoke at a news conference in Kenosha, Wis., where police shot Jacob Blake, a Black man, several times.    \"Today, there's a moral desert, top-down. The acid rain is coming, top-down,\" he said. \"That kind of moral desert hurts all of America.\"    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Rev. Jesse Jackson speaks during a community gathering at the site of Jacob Blake's shooting on Sept. 1, 2020, in Kenosha, Wis.\n                \n                    Morry Gash/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Morry Gash/AP\n    \n\n   \n   He compared the demonstrations that summer to those that occurred during the Civil Rights Era, comments that echoed earlier remarks he made to NPR that  June  about the nationwide protests that erupted after another Black man, George Floyd, was murdered by a white police officer in Minneapolis.     The marches were \"hopeful signs,\" Jackson said. \"The marchers are full of hope. They believe something can happen. On the move, we're not going backwards.\"    \n   In 2021, Jackson contracted COVID-19. He was hospitalized and spent several weeks in a rehabilitation facility.  He stepped down as president of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition in 2023.    On Nov. 12, the coalition announced Jackson was hospitalized for PSP, which affects body movements, balance, vision, speech and swallowing.    Jackson is survived by his wife, Jacqueline, and six children.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Rep.

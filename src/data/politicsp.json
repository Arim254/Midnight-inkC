The dead included eight children, Subramanian said.</p>   <p>The rally, which officials say was attended by tens of thousands of people, was being addressed by Vijay, one of Tamil Nadu's most successful actors-turned-politician in the district of Karur.</p>   \n   <p>Indian media reports, quoting local officials, said as Vijay spoke to the surging crowd, a group of his supporters and fans fell while trying to get close to his bus, causing the stampede. Supporters had gathered at the political rally amid intensely hot temperatures and Vijay arrived hours late, officials said.</p>   <p>\"There was indiscipline\" at the rally, Subramanian said, adding that an investigation had been ordered.</p>   <p>Quoting officials, the Press Trust of India news agency reported that at least 30 people fainted while Vijay was addressing the rally from atop his campaign vehicle and were rushed in ambulances to area hospitals. He halted his speech mid-way when workers raised alarm after noticing that people were fainting and falling, it said, adding that as they were removed to hospitals, Vijay continued his speech.</p>   <p>However, he ended his speech shortly after sensing an abnormal situation in a section of the huge gathering, the news agency said.</p>   <p>Hours after the accident, Vijay offered his condolences.</p>   <p>\"My heart is shattered,\" he posted on X. \"I am writhing in unbearable, indescribable pain and sorrow that words cannot express.\"</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1620x1080+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F54%2F54%2F1005eb85439090e042f83daae225%2Fap25271202340892.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1620x1080+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F54%2F54%2F1005eb85439090e042f83daae225%2Fap25271202340892.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1620x1080+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F54%2F54%2F1005eb85439090e042f83daae225%2Fap25271202340892.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1620x1080+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F54%2F54%2F1005eb85439090e042f83daae225%2Fap25271202340892.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1620x1080+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F54%2F54%2F1005eb85439090e042f83daae225%2Fap25271202340892.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1620x1080+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F54%2F54%2F1005eb85439090e042f83daae225%2Fap25271202340892.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1620x1080+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F54%2F54%2F1005eb85439090e042f83daae225%2Fap25271202340892.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw -

Many have become politicians and some have even been given divine status.</p>   <p>In 2024, Vijay retired from acting and launched his own political party. It was unclear whether he plans to run for office in Tamil Nadu state.</p>   <p>Stampedes are relatively common in India when large crowds gather. In January, at least 30 people were killed as tens of thousands of Hindus rushed to bathe in a sacred river during the Maha Kumbh festival, the world's largest religious gathering.<br /></p>\n</div>"

But through Oct. 9, the country's capital, Riyadh, is hosting dozens of A-list comedians — many of them American — at the first ever <a href=\"https://www.visitsaudi.com/en/seasons/riyadh-comedy-festival\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Riyadh Comedy Festival</u></a>.</p>   <p>The participation of big-name funnymen, including Dave Chappelle, Aziz Ansari, Kevin Hart and Jimmy Carr, has provoked criticism from fellow comedians, including Marc Maron, Shane Gillis and Stavros Halkias, as well as human rights groups and other commentators.</p>   <p>\"The Saudi government is using the Riyadh Comedy Festival … to deflect attention from its brutal repression of free speech and other pervasive human rights violations,\" said Human Rights Watch in a <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/09/23/saudi-arabia-riyadh-comedy-festival-whitewashes-abuses\" target=\"_blank\"><u>statement</u></a> this week. \"Participating comedians, to avoid contributing to laundering the Saudi government's reputation, should use the comedy festival to publicly urge Saudi authorities to free unjustly detained Saudi dissidents, journalists, and human rights activists.\"</p>   \n   <p>A recent U.S. State Department <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/reports/2024-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/saudi-arabia/\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> on Saudi Arabia's human rights record in 2024 listed abuses including \"arbitrary or unlawful killings, disappearances, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, and serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom,\" among other issues.</p>   <h3>Comedians' spat</h3>   <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DO9RDQ0ks4P/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\"><u>video</u></a> on Maron's Instagram channel, the WTF podcast host took aim at colleagues who signed up to perform at the festival, while referencing the allegations of the Saudi government's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/09/12/1036389448/biden-declassifies-secret-fbi-report-detailing-saudi-nationals-connections-to-9-\" target=\"_blank\">possible involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks</a> and its <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/10/02/1202937036/jamal-khashoggi-mbs-murder-saudi-arabia-human-rights\" target=\"_blank\">role in the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi</a>.</p>   <p>\"From the folks that brought you 9/11.

But don't let that stop the yucks, it's gonna be a good time!\"</p>   <p>Gillis and Halkias were both invited to perform at this event, which was <a href=\"https://www.spa.gov.sa/en/N2366242\" target=\"_blank\"><u>announced</u></a> in July by General Entertainment Authority chairman Turki Alalshikh. On his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/i-5YGz0z-Ro\" target=\"_blank\"><u>podcast</u></a>, Gillis said he declined a \"significant bag\" to perform at the event. \"I took a principled stand,\" he said. In a podcast <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6fGtKnAVeVk\" target=\"_blank\"><u>conversation</u></a> with Chris DiStefano, Halkias said \"Can't do it.\"</p>   \n   <p>Fellow comedian DiStefano, conversely, told Halkias he accepted the invitation: \"I didn't want to do it either,\" he said, adding that it was his wife who urged him to take the money.</p>   <h3>Saudi Arabia's play</h3>   <p>NPR reached out to representatives of nearly every participating comedian for comment, as well as the Saudi embassy in Washington, D.C., and the country's General Entertainment Authority. No one had responded by the time of publication. However, in its statement announcing the event, the General Entertainment Authority described the festival as \"the largest of its kind globally,\" adding that it \"reflects the efforts to amplify Riyadh's status as a leading destination for major cultural and artistic events.\"</p>   <p>As a nation heavily dependent on oil, Saudi Arabia is currently engaged in a plan to diversify itself economically, socially and culturally. Its <a href=\"https://www.vision2030.gov.sa/en\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Vision 2030</u></a> program, implemented in 2016, encompasses efforts to increase the country's visibility on the cultural stage. \"Vision 2030 is a blueprint that is diversifying the economy, empowering citizens, creating a vibrant environment for both local and international investors, and establishing Saudi Arabia as a global leader,\" the website states.</p>   <h3>A history of pushback </h3>   <p>The Riyadh Comedy Festival isn't the first time artists have inspired blowback for accepting invitations to participate in events in Saudi Arabia.</p>   <p>Big name pop music acts including Mariah Carey, The Black Eyed Peas and Justin Bieber all earned criticism for opting to perform in the country in recent years. \"Doesn't she know Saudi Arabia is one of the most repressive and murderous regimes on the planet?\" wrote the activism group Code Pink in a 2019 <a href=\"https://www.codepink.org/dont_artwash_saudi_crimes\" target=\"_blank\"><u>statement</u></a> calling for Carey to cancel her show that year.</p>   <p>And American visual artists who've exhibited their work at Desert X AlUla, a spinoff of the U.S. <a href=\"https://desertx.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Desert X</u></a> art festival in the Saudi Arabian desert, as well as the event's organizers, have also received criticism. In a 2019 <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2019-10-29/desert-x-alula-saudi-arabia\" target=\"_blank\"><u>article</u></a>, <em>Los Angeles Times </em>art critic Christopher Knight called the show \"morally corrupt.\" Knight added: \"Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy built on theocratic law. Free expression is forbidden. Illegal. A criminal act.\"</p>   \n   <p>Comedian Tim Dillon said on his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNa2lhfSWxg\" target=\"_blank\">podcast</a> last month that he signed up for financial reasons. He said he had been offered \"a large sum of money\" — $375,000 for one performance — and said that other comedians had been offered as much as $1.6 million. He told his detractors to \"get over it,\" adding, \"So what if they have slaves, they're paying me enough to look the other way.\"</p>   <p>But in an <a href=\"https://audioboom.com/posts/8779658-462-cancelling-kimmel-fired-from-riyadh-the-prison-housing-market\" target=\"_blank\">episode</a> of the Tim Dillon Podcast last week, the comedian announced he'd been removed from the lineup for the comments he made about the country's record on slavery. (NPR reached out to Saudi's General Entertainment Authority for verification, but has not yet heard back.) \"I addressed it in a funny way and they fired me,\" Dillon said on his podcast. \"I certainly wasn't gonna show up in your country and insult the people that are paying me the money.\"</p>\n</div>"

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>President Trump's most outspoken Republican critic on Capitol Hill is facing immense pressure to fold or pay the price. Now, Kentucky Congressman Thomas Massie is asking constituents to fight an effort to oust him.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>SCOTT SIMON, HOST: </p><p> President Trump's most outspoken Republican critic on Capitol Hill is facing enormous pressure to fold or pay the price. And now Kentucky Congressman Thomas Massie, a 12-year incumbent, is asking his constituents to fight an effort to oust him.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>THOMAS MASSIE: We need to have a second opinion on everything. Our founders set up a balance of government, and the balance of government is gone if you don't have a counterbalance within your own party.</p><p>SIMON: That's Representative Massie, joined by Kentucky Senator Rand Paul to rally voters during a blitz of campaign stops in their state. NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales traveled to northern Kentucky, but she's here in our studios now. Claudia, thanks so much for being with us.</p><p>CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Good to see you, Scott.</p><p>SIMON: Congressman Massie and Senator Paul, who has been another prominent Trump critic on many issues, visited more than half a dozen communities. What did you hear?</p><p>GRISALES: Visit after visit, they told constituents that President Trump is one of the best presidents of their lifetimes. But they argued they're also part of the same Republican Party, and there should be room for disagreement. Paul defended Massie, who is a longtime friend, as the last member of the Tea Party, fighting for conservative values. I asked Paul to expand on what that means.</p><p>RAND PAUL: There'll be no more Tea Party. It's about the idea of limited government. But I'm all in for Thomas Massie.</p><p>GRISALES: And we should note Trump has also taken aim at Paul, but he's not up for reelection until 2028. However, in Massie's case, his seat will be contested, like all House seats, in next year's midterms.</p><p>SIMON: Now, President Trump has repeatedly publicly attacked Massie and Paul for voting against his agenda. Why don't they fall in line like their colleagues?</p><p>GRISALES: Both Massie and Paul are cut from the same kind of Tea Party, libertarian cloth, which is a contrast from the president - especially at this moment, when the Republican-led Congress has shown great fealty to the president. So they're often on the opposite ends of the president when it comes to spending, tariffs, the First Amendment. And in Massie's case, he's leading a charge to force the release of the Jeffrey Epstein records. And both are also playing to this independent, maverick Kentucky political brand and state of mind.</p><p>SIMON: How did you see constituents receive Massie and Paul's messages?</p><p>GRISALES: I saw a whole range of reactions. Some were very loyal to Massie and Paul. Others were saying they've gone too far or that Trump has gone too far. I talked to one couple who showed up to an event wearing T-shirts that read, I stand with Thomas Massie.</p><p>I talked to Diane Olberding. She voted for Trump in the last election, and she feels betrayed.</p><p>DIANE OLBERDING: These two guys here don't change their convictions. You know, talk is cheap, and we all know Mr. - President Trump loves to talk. But he needs to continue what he was voted in on - MAGA.</p><p>SIMON: Now, of course, President Trump has won Kentucky three elections in a row by double-digit margins. In fact, his highest percentage was in 2024. How big of a challenge could Massie face in his reelection campaign?</p><p>GRISALES: Well, it's unusual to launch a campaign for a congressional seat more than a year out this aggressively and with this level of spending, all for a primary race in a solidly red district. Massie thinks it's the most ever spent on a congressional race this early on. And the war chest amassed against him, which has been fueled by the president - Massie says it's raised millions. He also has repeatedly referenced these television ads that are already airing in those markets, accusing Massie of flag burning, which he said was a complete lie. But we should note Massie ran unopposed in 2024, so it will be hard to find a candidate who will be strong enough and have that kind of name ID to turn away voters from Massie.</p><p>SIMON: NPR's Claudia Grisales, thanks so much.</p><p>GRISALES: Thank you.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ROB LEVIT'S \"THE TRAVELER\")</p><p>SIMON: This is NPR News.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has been indicted after a push by President Trump. The move marks a dramatic escalation in Trump's effort to go after his political opponents.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>ANDREW LIMBONG, HOST: </p><p> The Justice Department is following through on President Trump's threats to go after his political enemies. Former FBI director James Comey has been indicted, and tension among federal prosecutors has been building since Trump took office. Trump campaigned on the idea of ending the weaponization of the Justice Department, arguing that he had been unfairly targeted. Here to talk about what's happening and what might come next is NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro. Hey, Domenico.</p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey, Andrew, great to be with you.</p><p>LIMBONG: Yeah, so all right, for someone who came into the office saying he would stop the weaponization, the targeted Comey indictment seems contrary to that, right?</p><p>MONTANARO: Yeah, I mean, he said repeatedly on the campaign trail and during his second term here in the White House that he was going to stop the weaponization. You know, his attorney general, Pam Bondi, said during her confirmation hearing that she would take the politics out of the Justice Department. But it turns out that what they mean by all of that is that it's about anticonservative bias, not removing politically motivated investigations overall. To Trump and his MAGA allies, they see the moves that he's making, like going after Comey, as going after people who deserve it. Frankly, though, none of this is very surprising. Yes, Trump talked about ending weaponization, but he also - remember - said, quote, \"I am your retribution,\" and he's certainly following through on that.</p><p>LIMBONG: And it's not just Comey, right? Remind listeners who else he's gone after.</p><p>MONTANARO: Yeah, I mean, Trump has tried to wrest control of lots of aspects of society. He's gone after the media with lawsuits to try and control the narrative. He pushed ABC, for example, to get Jimmy Kimmel, the comedian, off the air, using the FCC and licensing threats to operationalize what Trump wants.</p><p>He's gone after quasi-independent agencies like the Federal Reserve, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; federal workers who don't, quote, \"align\" with his philosophy universities that don't adhere to what he wants to see taught or not taught or the types of people that they hire.</p><p>And of course, when it comes to the Justice Department, prosecutors were fired who investigated him and the January 6, 2021, siege at the Capitol. Plus he pardoned all of those convicted for their actions on January 6.</p><p>LIMBONG: Usually, there are traditional checks on this power of the executive. Not so much this time.</p><p>MONTANARO: Yeah, and it's quite the opposite. Republicans control both chambers of Congress, and they've only greased the wheels for his agenda and this retribution campaign. You know, he has an open ear at the Supreme Court after he appointed three justices during his first term that have swung the court to be more ideologically conservative. They haven't weighed in yet on this apparent political retribution effort, though, we should say.</p><p>And the only tension that continues here about Trump's philosophy of, you know, being able to put forward this retribution campaign and exerting total control has to be through the lower courts, and of course, that's where this Comey case is going to be heard.</p><p>LIMBONG: Yeah. This apparent retribution is happening despite the fact that Trump didn't face substantial consequences from any of the charges or investigations he's faced, right?</p><p>MONTANARO: Yeah, and the criminal charges against Trump are far more serious than the charges against Comey here. I mean, Trump was facing multiple counts in multiple courts on everything from fraudulent business practices in New York, which he was convicted on, to inciting the January 6 riots. You know, this case against Comey is a very short indictment, just two pages, with a former personal attorney of Trump's who's - just this week was sworn in as the U.S. attorney, and she's the only signee.</p><p>And on the substance, it's about alleged false statements to Congress, statements that the inspector general's office already investigated, about whether Comey authorized a leak about the existence of an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. The IG report stated that they found it highly improbable that Comey would have been approving of the leak. So on its face, this looks like a very thin case.</p><p>LIMBONG: All right, we got 3 1/2 years left in the Trump presidency. What should we expect going forward?</p><p>MONTANARO: I mean, you can expect more to come. I mean, just on Friday, in fact, Trump himself said that this is not about revenge, but about justice and that he, quote, \"thinks that there will be others.\" So there are going to be a lot of people looking over their shoulders, and it may have a chilling effect, or it could make dissenters more dug in.</p><p>LIMBONG: Alright, that's NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Domenico, thanks so much.</p><p>MONTANARO: You're welcome.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Security Council, meaning China and Russia could not stop it alone, as they have other proposed actions against Tehran in the past. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called them a \"trap\" for Iran on Saturday.</p>   \n   <p>France, Germany and the United Kingdom triggered snapback over Iran 30 days ago for its further restricting monitoring of its nuclear program and the deadlock over its negotiations with the U.S.</p>   <p>Iran further withdrew from the International Atomic Energy Agency monitoring after Israel's war with the country in June, which also saw the U.S. strike nuclear sites in the Islamic Republic. Meanwhile, the country still maintains a stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% purity — a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90% — that is largely enough to make several atomic bombs, should Tehran choose to rush toward weaponization.</p>   \n   <p>Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is peaceful, though the West and IAEA say Tehran had an organized weapons program up until 2003.</p>   \n   <p>The three European nations on Sunday said they \"continuously made every effort to avoid triggering snapback.\" But Iran \"has not authorized IAEA inspectors to regain access to Iran's nuclear sites, nor has it produced and transmitted to the IAEA a report accounting for its stockpile of high-enriched uranium.\"</p>   <p>Tehran has further argued that the three European nations shouldn't be allowed to implement snapback, pointing in part to America's unilateral withdrawal from the accord in 2018, during the first term of President Donald Trump's administration.</p>   <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio praised the three European nations for \"an act of decisive global leadership\" for imposing the sanctions on Iran and said \"diplomacy is still an option.\"</p>   <p>\"For that to happen, Iran must accept direct talks,\" Rubio said.</p>   <p>However, it remains unclear how Tehran will respond Sunday.</p>   <p>\"The Trump administration appears to think it has a stronger hand post-strikes, and it can wait for Iran to come back to the table,\" said Kelsey Davenport, a nuclear expert at the Washington-based Arms Control Association. \"Given the knowledge Iran has, given the materials that remain in Iran, that's a very dangerous assumption.\"</p>   <p>Risks also remain for Iran as well, she added: \"In the short term, kicking out the IAEA increases the risk of miscalculation. The U.S. or Israel could use the lack of inspections as a pretext for further strikes.\"</p>   <h3>Hunger and anxiety grow in Iran</h3>   <p>The aftermath of the June war drove up food prices in Iran, putting already expensive meat out of reach for poorer families.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7655x5104+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F43%2F160c896c4c69ae9cc1cf85faa2b1%2Fap25270427625732.jpg\" alt=\"Two women walk past a huge banner showing the late commander of the Iran's Revolutionary Guard expeditionary Quds Force, Gen.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>NPR's Scott Simon talks with Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin about the looming government shutdown, and his proposed bill that aims to end shutdowns for good.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>SCOTT SIMON, HOST: </p><p> The U.S. government is hurtling toward a shutdown unless lawmakers can reach a spending deal before midnight Tuesday. House Republicans have passed a short-term extension. But in the Senate, Democrats are holding out for more than $1 trillion in spending, primarily on health care. Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, joins us now from his home state. Senator, thanks so much for being with us.</p><p>RON JOHNSON: Good morning, Scott. Hope you're doing well.</p><p>SIMON: I hope you're doing well, sir. And let's ask about the possibility of a shutdown. Would you be willing to compromise with Democrats to keep health care benefits to avoid one?</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, first of all, aren't you getting sick of reporting on this year after year? I sure am. Since I've been there, since 2011, we've had three shutdowns, 55 continuing resolutions. We've increased or suspended the debt ceiling 12 times, taking our debt from $14 trillion to $37 trillion in debt. Last year, it took us six months to finally come to agreement to finally fund government. So what I'm suggesting is passing a bill - Eliminate Shutdowns Act - that gets rid of this for all time, ends the turmoil. It's incredibly simple. All you have to do is just pass this bill, and then you'll establish 14-day rolling continuing appropriations if you haven't appropriated for these particular departments. It's just really simple, so there shouldn't be any compromise needed. Just pass this bill and then get to work on individual appropriation bills.</p><p>SIMON: Well - but with respect, sir, that - I mean, your bill hasn't passed yet. What would you be willing to do over the next few days?</p><p>JOHNSON: We can - we're going to vote on it on Monday. And so we'll also be voting on the House bill. The, you know, House passed a continuing resolution up to Thanksgiving. And by the way, that's the well-honed process by the uniparty to put pressure on the process to just pass anything, which has then resulted in us going from $14 trillion to $37 trillion. It's designed to increase spending. Everybody has to get together and compromise to spend more on everybody's programs. Again, we can't afford this. So again, let's end the dysfunction. There's no reason - this is what we do in Wisconsin. It's really why I proposed this bill. In - back in the '50s, Wisconsin said, OK, if we're so dysfunctional we can't pass appropriation bills, we don't shut down the agencies. We just fund them at last year's levels. Isn't that incredibly common sense? That's what we ought to do.</p><p>SIMON: But does the threat of a shutdown encourage the parties to compromise?</p><p>JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean, compromise to spend a whole lot more money on everybody's priorities. So again, there'll be plenty of pressure to pass appropriation bills because we've got big spenders. Last year's funding level will never be enough for a lot of the members, so it'll be plenty of pressure. We would just end the turmoil. Listen, this is politicians playing games with people's lives. We ought to end it. There's no need for it whatsoever. I come from the private sector. This is beyond absurd - how dysfunctional Congress is. But we...</p><p>SIMON: Are we in a - I didn't ask.</p><p>JOHNSON: We need to stop accepting it.</p><p>SIMON: Senator, are we in a state of affairs now, though, where politicians believe there are more points to be won by refusing to compromise, even if it results in another shutdown?</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, again, what I'm saying is, let's get rid of all of that. Again, isn't this this elegantly simple solution? By the way, this is what'll end up happening. This will be the end result. It's what the end result was last year. We - again, six months until we came to a full-year continuing resolution. That's it. Democrats - this is how reasonable they are. They'll give us four-week continuing resolution. All we have to do is spend another $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years. So they obviously don't want to compromise. Again, I don't need compromise right now. Just continue to fund the government at last year's level. Then start working on individual appropriation bills.</p><p>SIMON: Would you still want to eliminate shutdowns under a Democratic president? Because...</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>SIMON: ...It could...</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes. I mean, if I pass this bill, you'll never have another shutdown ever. You'll just - you - again, if you don't pass appropriation - no matter who's in power, if you don't pass an appropriation bill for the whole of government or individual departments, you just spend at last year's level. Two-week rolling continuing appropriations, and then you get back to work.</p><p>SIMON: Are you saying, essentially, pass my bill or there'll be a shutdown?</p><p>JOHNSON: No. I'll vote for the House continuing resolution. I've generally voted for continuing resolutions, as much as I hate them, because I don't want to shut down government. It's very inefficient. It hurts people. This sets up an automatic continuing appropriation. You'll never have another shutdown ever. You'll never have to have this conversation. We'll never have to do another interview like this. Won't that be great?</p><p>SIMON: Well, it's always good to talk to you. Senator Ron Johnson, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>JOHNSON: Have a great day.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>We examine the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey after President Trump called for several of his political enemies — including Comey — to be prosecuted.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>SCOTT SIMON, HOST: </p><p> Justice, as in the U.S. Justice Department, can move swiftly. A week ago today, President Trump publicly called on the DOJ to prosecute his perceived political enemies, including the former FBI director James Comey. On Thursday, prosecutors followed through and secured a criminal indictment against James Comey for false statements and obstruction. NPR Justice correspondent Ryan Lucas joins us. Ryan, thanks so much for being with us.</p><p>RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Thanks for having me, Scott.</p><p>SIMON: What does the indictment allege?</p><p>LUCAS: Well, look, it's very much a bare-bones indictment. It's just a page and a half long, but it contains the two counts you mentioned - one for false statements, the other for obstruction of a congressional proceeding. Now, these charges stem from testimony that Comey gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee in September of 2020, so about five years ago. That hearing revolved around the FBI's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election. The indictment says that Comey lied by denying that he had authorized someone at the FBI to leak information. That appears to be a reference to an exchange at that hearing between Comey and Texas Republican Ted Cruz. Cruz asked Comey whether he had authorized someone at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports. Comey gave only a brief reply. He told Cruz that he stood by the answer that he had given back in 2017, which was that he had not authorized any such leak.</p><p>SIMON: And what do you think we should make of the timing of this indictment, given what the president had said just a week ago?</p><p>LUCAS: I think the timing is a really important aspect here. You mentioned the demand the president made one week ago today, in essence instructing Attorney General Pam Bondi by name to investigate specific people he doesn't like. Trump named three people in that post to be prosecuted -  New York Attorney General Letitia James, California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff and James Comey.</p><p>Now, the case against Comey was being handled by the U.S. attorney's office in the Eastern District of Virginia. Last week, Trump pushed out the top federal prosecutor there, in part because that prosecutor had expressed doubts about the strength of the case against Comey. Trump then installed Lindsey Halligan to replace him. Halligan has no prosecutorial experience, but she did once serve as a personal attorney for Trump, and she had been working in the White House. Halligan then pushed through the indictment against Comey over the objections of career prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office there, who also had concerns about the strength of the evidence in this case.</p><p>SIMON: Now that James Comey's been indicted, what did the president have to say?</p><p>LUCAS: Well, Trump was asked about it yesterday when he was leaving the White House. He was asked who would be next on his list of retribution. You can hear the helicopter in the background here, but here's a bit of what he said.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's not a list, but I think there'll be others. I mean, they're corrupt. These were corrupt, radical-left Democrats. 'Cause Comey essentially was a - he's worse than a Democrat.</p><p>LUCAS: Now, Trump has insulted Comey for years. He did it again yesterday. He called him a dirty cop. Now, after the indictment was made public, Comey also put out a video on Instagram. Here's a bit of what he said.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>JAMES COMEY: My family and I have known for years that there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump, but we couldn't imagine ourselves living any other way. We will not live on our knees, and you shouldn't either.</p><p>LUCAS: Comey also declared his innocence, said he has confidence in the federal judicial system. And he said, let's have a trial.</p><p>SIMON: Finally, does this signal anything for the second Trump term?</p><p>LUCAS: Well, look, traditionally, the Justice Department has enjoyed independence from the White House, particularly when it comes to investigations and prosecutions, because you want to be sure that prosecutions and investigations aren't driven by and don't appear to be driven by politics. Here in just the past week, we have the president openly calling for the attorney general to go after people Trump doesn't like, including James Comey. Now Comey's been indicted. So for legal observers and Justice Department veterans, this sure looks like Trump using the Justice Department to enact the campaign of retribution that he promised.</p><p>SIMON: NPR's Ryan Lucas. Thanks so much.</p><p>LUCAS: Thank you.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>Maryland Gov. Wes Moore has committed to being a bipartisan bridgebuilder. But he's also under pressure to redistrict the state's one GOP congressman out of his House seat.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: </p><p> Democratic Governor Wes Moore of Maryland campaigned on the slogan, leave no one behind. It references both his time in the military and his openness to working with both parties. Now, Moore is facing pressure to set aside bipartisanship. President Trump wants Republican states to break with tradition and redraw their voting lines before the midterm elections, and Democrats are pressing Moore to make a partisan countermove in deep blue Maryland. WAMU's Jenny Abamu talked with him about it.</p><p>JENNY ABAMU, BYLINE: When asked whether Governor Moore considers himself a progressive or moderate, he bucks at the idea of being labeled. Here he is in our one-on-one interview last week.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>WES MOORE: What is the Democratic platform? What is the Republican platform? I don't know. I can tell you my beliefs. I can tell you what we're trying to do in Maryland.</p><p>ABAMU: Moore frequently reminds the public that he's not a career politician, having lived several lives, including as a soldier, investment banker, author and CEO of a philanthropic organization before winning the governorship in 2022. And he's worked with Republicans. Here's Ed Rothstein, a Republican who served as county commissioner in conservative Carroll County, Maryland. He serves in Moore's Cabinet as the secretary of the Department of Veterans and Military Families.</p><p>ED ROTHSTEIN: We speak the same language when it comes to loyalty, responsibility, respect, honor, personal courage. You know, these are not just words, but they're ways of life.</p><p>ABAMU: Now, Moore's promises of bipartisanship are being tested. As President Trump has criticized Baltimore and threatened to send the National Guard, Moore has pushed back. He denied Trump's claim that Moore praised him in private, tweeting, LOL, you keep telling yourself that.</p><p>Then there's a big question of redistricting. Trump's urging Republican states to redistrict to help the GOP hold Congress. States usually just redistrict early in each decade after the census. And while Moore didn't commit to doing it, he told me states can't get hung up on, quote, \"principle\" if Trump's rewriting the rules.</p><p>MOORE: I believe deeply that all options need to be on the table in the state of Maryland because if we are going to have specific states - Trump-picked states - saying we should have a process to decide, do we have fair maps, then you know what? So should Maryland.</p><p>ABAMU: Already, only one of Maryland's eight House seats is held by a Republican, so drawing new maps could leave Maryland with no Republicans in Congress even though they make up about 24% of the voters. Brigitta Mullican, the Montgomery County GOP treasurer and a Republican organizer, says the state already gerrymanders to silence Republican voices.</p><p>BRIGITTA MULLICAN: I'm not happy about it, but you know what? I personally can't change any of that. But very disappointing.</p><p>ABAMU: In 2022, the court struck down the Democratic legislature's map for extreme partisan gerrymandering, making it draw a new one then. Mullican wants all politicians to play fair.</p><p>MULLICAN: And, you know, they play games on both sides. And my thing is do the right thing. You know, I want our districts to be properly redistricted right, you know?</p><p>ABAMU: Many progressive voters, though, like to see their governor taking on the president. Here's activist Dee Clarkin (ph) from Montgomery County.</p><p>DEE CLARKIN: I mean, Trump is a bully, and Governor Moore seems to instinctively understand that, and he is pushing back appropriately. And I have been pleased with that so far.</p><p>ABAMU: Clarkin says she sees redistricting in Maryland as a necessary evil. And Democrats around the county are looking toward the midterms as a way to stop Trump's agenda, which would make it hard for Wes Moore's leave no one behind motto to survive.</p><p>For NPR News, I'm Jenny Abamu.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF COMMON & JOHN LEGEND SONG, \"THEY SAY\")</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.

Ron, thanks so much for being with us.</p><p>RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.</p><p>SIMON: How significant, do you believe, is this indictment?</p><p>ELVING: We're seeing the depth of resentment the president still seems to feel about the start of his first term. That was when Comey asserted the independence of the Justice Department, as Ryan Lucas was just telling us. You may recall how Trump suggested Comey could go easy on one of Trump's allies and early appointees. Comey pushed back, and the relationship soured quickly. Trump fired Comey, prompting many people to conclude that Trump did not understand that the DOJ was not his to order about like an in-house lawyer.</p><p>So in significance, this current indictment may say more about the Trump administration than it does about Comey. And while it may well be a personal and financial burden for the former FBI director, it is highly unlikely to lead to a conviction, and it may not even get to a trial. Now, we heard a chorus of the president's usual supporters in certain media coming out to call this indictment weak. Moreover, the prospect of a trial that brings out the facts about what Trump did and what Trump didn't do and what Comey did back 10 years ago is not likely to bathe the president in a flattering light.</p><p>SIMON: President Trump addressed the U.N. General Assembly earlier this week. Didn't hold back, did he?</p><p>ELVING: The president seemed genuinely annoyed by a bulky escalator that stopped just as he got on, and then by a teleprompter that malfunctioned. He also seemed upset about one of his companies losing out on a bid to renovate the U.N. building years ago. But of course, he also went well beyond the merely peevish and personal with his assault on other countries and their handling of immigration. Let's listen.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's time to end the failed experiment of open borders. You have to end it now. It's - I can tell you. I'm really good at this stuff. Your countries are going to hell.</p><p>ELVING: So on one hand, Trump seems to be bearding the United Nations lion right in its own den, but his real audience there may be far outside the U.N. itself. He knows that organization and other international entities are not popular with his own voters. They delight in hearing him disrespect the U.N. They believe the United States has been taken advantage of by the United Nations and many of its members, and they are glad to hear someone say so and insist on greater respect for the U.S.</p><p>SIMON: Ron, next week, can a government shutdown be averted? And if not, what might it look like?</p><p>ELVING: It's hard to see how they can avoid it now. Both sides at least seem to have decided to have the shutdown, Trump because he thinks it will empower him to do as he wishes and strengthen his standing with voters. Democrats seem resigned to a shutdown because anything more cooperative would make them look weak or, worse yet, make them look like enablers for Trump. So they've chosen to take a stand over health care spending. Now, Democrats could have shut the government down back in March. And some say they should have, that nothing was gained by going along. And that sentiment seems to be dominating right now in the opposition party.</p><p>SIMON: Politically, what implications do you think it has for both parties? Who'll get the blame if there is a shutdown?</p><p>ELVING: It's usually easier for the president to dominate the debate about a shutdown. The White House can speak with a single, authoritative voice. Meanwhile, the opposition consists of scores of different people and coalitions, and it can be nearly impossible to get all the Democrats on the same rhetorical program at the same time. That enables the president and his party to say, look, we gave this all the votes we had, but we don't have 60. And that's the magic number to cut off debate, so we need a few of you Democrats to come over and help us keep the government open.</p><p>It's easier for politicians to mischaracterize their opposition sometimes than it is to formulate a policy of their own that actually pleases swing voters. And this is happening at a time when many other issues are in the news and pulling voters in different directions, and distracting them makes it all the harder to explain a complex budget process.</p><p>SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving.

In the interview on Fox News on Thursday night, Trump praised the government of acting President Delcy Rodríguez, saying: \"they've been great. ... Everything we've wanted, they've given us.\"   Jorge Rodríguez, brother of the acting president and head of Venezuela's National Assembly, said a \"significant number\" of people would be freed, but as of late Thursday night it was still not clear who or how many people would be released. The U.S. government and Venezuela's opposition have long demanded the widespread release of imprisoned politicians, critics and members of civil society. The Venezuelan government insists it does not hold prisoners for political reasons.   \n   \"Consider this a gesture by the Bolivarian (Venezuelan) government, which is broadly intended to seek peace,\" he announced.   High profile releases   Among those released was Biagio Pilieri, an opposition leader who was part of Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado's 2024 presidential campaign, according to Foro Penal, an advocacy group for prisoners based in Venezuela's capital, Caracas. Also released was Enrique Márquez, a former electoral authority and candidate in the 2024 presidential election, the organization said.   Videos posted by journalists on social media show Márquez and Pilieri embracing loved ones on the streets outside the prison. One video showed Márquez beaming and video-calling family members, saying, \"Soon I will be with you all.\"   Five Spanish citizens — including the prominent Venezuelan-Spanish lawyer and human rights activist Rocío San Miguel — were also released in the afternoon and, as the night wore on, reports trickled out of more detainees walking free. Relatives who waited for hours outside a prison in Guatire, about an hour east of Caracas, briefly chanted, \"Libertad! Libertad!\" meaning \"Freedom! Freedom!\"   Venezuela's government has a history of releasing people imprisoned for political reasons — including real and perceived opponents — during moments of high tension to signal openness to dialogue. The releases on Thursday were the first since Maduro was deposed.   \n   Human rights groups and members of the opposition were encouraged by the move, though it wasn't clear yet what it represented — whether the growing pains of a government in transition or a symbolic overture to placate the Trump administration, which has allowed Maduro's loyalists to stay in power as it exerts pressure through crippling sanctions.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Relatives of detainee Yosnars Baduel embrace outside the Rodeo I prison in Guatire, Venezuela, Thursday, Jan. 8, 2026, after National Assembly President Jorge Rodriguez said the government would release Venezuelan and foreign prisoners.\n                \n                    Matias Delacroix/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Matias Delacroix/AP\n    \n\n   \n   'Nothing brings back the stolen years   For opposition leader Machado – whom Trump has snubbed by endorsing Rodríguez to lead the transition — the gesture was \"an act of moral restitution.\"   \n   \"Nothing brings back the stolen years,\" she said in an audio message from exile addressed to families of released detainees, urging them to take comfort in the knowledge that \"injustice will not be eternal and that the truth, though badly wounded, eventually prevails.\"   Alfredo Romero, president of Foro Penal, expressed cautious hope \"that this is indeed the beginning of the dismantling of a repressive system in Venezuela ... and not a mere gesture, a charade of releasing some prisoners and incarcerating others.\"   Despite a widespread crackdown in the aftermath of the tumultuous 2024 election — in which authorities said they detained more than 2,000 people — Venezuela's government denies that there are prisoners unjustly detained, accusing them of plotting to destabilize Maduro's government.   Romero's organization said that as of Dec. 29, 2025, there were 863 people detained in Venezuela \"for political reasons.\"   The Spanish government said Thursday that five of its citizens, including dual national San Miguel, had been released from custody in Venezuela and would soon return to Spain.   Speaking to Spanish broadcaster RNE, Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares identified the other Spanish nationals released as Andrés Martínez, José María Basoa, Ernesto Gorbe and Miguel Moreno.   Two of them, Martínez and Basoa, were arrested in Venezuela in September 2024 and accused of plotting to destabilize Maduro's government as Spanish spies — allegations vehemently denied by Spain.   \n   Spain's El País newspaper reported Thursday that another freed detainee, Gorbe, was arrested in 2024 on allegations of overstaying his visa.   Families wait outside prisons   As the news of the release broke Thursday, families of detainees rushed to prisons across the country, seeking information on their loved ones.   Pedro Durán, 60, was among those hoping to reunite with his brother Franklin Durán as he waited outside the prison in Guatire. Durán said his brother was detained in 2021 on charges of trying to overthrow Maduro's government — an accusation his family denies.   Durán, who has been living in Spain, heard rumors on Wednesday that the government could release a number of detainees and immediately bought a plane ticket from Madrid to Caracas to find his brother.   \"I don't have words to express the emotion I'm feeling,\" Durán said. \"We're feeling a lot of hope ... We're just waiting now.\"   Despite the anticipation, fear persists.   \"Of course everyone here is very scared, but what more could (the government) do to us that they haven't done already,\" he added.   'A bargaining chip'   Ronal Rodríguez, a researcher at the Venezuelan Observatory at the University of Rosario in Bogotá, Colombia, said the government releases prisoners at politically strategic moments.   In July last year, Venezuela released 10 jailed U.S. citizens and permanent residents in exchange for the repatriation of over 200 Venezuelans deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador, where they had been held in a prison built to house criminal gangs.   \"The regime uses them like a bargaining chip,\" he said of prisoners in Venezuela. It will be telling to see not only how many people the government releases, he said, but also under what conditions and whether the releases include anyone high-profile.   On Wednesday, the Trump administration sought to assert its control over Venezuelan oil, seizing a pair of sanctioned tankers transporting petroleum and announcing plans to relax some sanctions so the U.S. can oversee the sale of Venezuela's petroleum worldwide.   \n   Both moves reflect the administration's determination to make good on its effort to control the next steps in Venezuela through its vast oil resources. Trump pledged after the capture of Maduro that the U.S. will \"run\" the country.   Trump on Thursday night said that Machado may be visiting Washington next week and that he may be meeting with her.   \"I understand she's coming in next week some time and I look forward to saying hello to her,\" Trump said in the Fox News interview with Sean Hannity. \"And I've heard that she wants to do that.\"\n",

At least 62 people have been killed in the protests that began in late December over Iran's ailing economy and have morphed into the most significant challenge to the government in years.   Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dismissed Trump as having hands \"stained with the blood of Iranians\" as his supporters shouted \"Death to America!\" in footage aired by Iranian state television. State media later referred to the demonstrators as \"terrorists,\" setting the stage for a violent crackdown as in other protests in recent years.   \n   Protesters are \"ruining their own streets ... in order to please the president of the United States,\" the 86-year-old Khamenei said to a crowd at his compound in Tehran. \"Because he said that he would come to their aid. He should pay attention to the state of his own country instead.\"   Iran's judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei separately vowed that punishment for protesters \"will be decisive, maximum and without any legal leniency.\"   Late Friday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron issued a joint statement condemning reported deadly violence against the protesters, and urged Iran to allow its citizens to express themselves without fear of reprisal. The Associated Press could not independently confirm local media reports that state forces had opened fire on protesters in Tehran on Friday.   There was no immediate response from Washington, though Trump has repeatedly pledged to strike Iran if protesters are killed, a threat that has taken on greater significance after the U.S. military raid that seized Venezuela's former President Nicolás Maduro.   Internet cut off   Despite Iran's theocracy cutting off the nation from the internet and international telephone calls, short online videos shared by activists purported to show protesters chanting against Iran's government around bonfires as debris littered the streets in the capital, Tehran, and other areas into Friday morning.   \n   Iranian state media alleged \"terrorist agents\" of the U.S. and Israel set fires and sparked violence. It also said there were \"casualties,\" without elaborating.   The full scope of the demonstrations that began Dec. 28 couldn't be immediately determined due to the communications blackout.   The protests also represented the first test of whether the Iranian public could be swayed by Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, whose fatally ill father fled Iran just before the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution. Pahlavi, who called for the protests Thursday night, similarly has called for demonstrations at 8 p.m. Friday.   Demonstrations have included cries in support of the shah, something that could bring a death sentence in the past but now underlines the anger fueling the protests that began over Iran's ailing economy.   So far, violence around the demonstrations has killed at least 62 people while more than 2,300 others have been detained, said the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.   \"What turned the tide of the protests was former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi's calls for Iranians to take to the streets at 8 p.m. on Thursday and Friday,\" said Holly Dagres, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \"Per social media posts, it became clear that Iranians had delivered and were taking the call seriously to protest in order to oust the Islamic Republic.\"   \"This is exactly why the internet was shut down: to prevent the world from seeing the protests. Unfortunately, it also likely provided cover for security forces to kill protesters.\"   Thursday night protests preceded internet shutdown   When the clock struck 8 p.m. Thursday, neighborhoods across Tehran erupted in chanting, witnesses said. The chants included \"Death to the dictator!\" and \"Death to the Islamic Republic!\" Others praised the shah, shouting: \"This is the last battle! Pahlavi will return!\" Thousands could be seen on the streets before all communication to Iran cut out.   \n   On Friday, Pahlavi called on Trump to help the protesters, saying Khamenei \"wants to use this blackout to murder these young heroes.\"   \"You have proven and I know you are a man of peace and a man of your word,\" he said in a statement. \"Please be prepared to intervene to help the people of Iran.\"   The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Pahlavi's appeal to Trump.   Pahlavi had said he would offer further plans depending on the response to his call. His support of and from Israel has drawn criticism in the past — particularly after the 12-day war Israel waged on Iran in June. Demonstrators have shouted in support of the shah in some demonstrations, but it isn't clear whether that's support for Pahlavi himself or a desire to return to a time before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.   The internet cut also appears to have taken Iran's state-run and semiofficial news agencies offline. The state TV acknowledgment at 8 a.m. Friday represented the first official word about the demonstrations.   State TV claimed the protests were violent and caused casualties, but did not offer nationwide figures. It said the protests saw \"people's private cars, motorcycles, public places such as the metro, fire trucks and buses set on fire.\" State TV later reported that violence overnight killed six people in Hamedan, some 280 kilometers (175 miles) southwest of Tehran, and two security force members in Qom, 125 kilometers (75 miles) south of the capital.   The European Union and Germany condemned the violence targeting demonstrators as new protests were reported in Zahedan in Iran's restive southwestern Sistan and Baluchestan province.   Trump renews threat over protester deaths   Iran has faced rounds of nationwide protests in recent years. As sanctions tightened and Iran struggled after the 12-day war, its rial currency collapsed in December, reaching 1.4 million to $1. Protests began soon after, with demonstrators chanting against Iran's theocracy.   \n   It remains unclear why Iranian officials have yet to crack down harder on the demonstrators. Trump warned last week that if Tehran \"violently kills peaceful protesters,\" America \"will come to their rescue.\"   In an interview with talk show host Hugh Hewitt aired Thursday, Trump reiterated his pledge.   Iran has \"been told very strongly, even more strongly than I'm speaking to you right now, that if they do that, they're going to have to pay hell,\" Trump said.   He demurred when asked if he'd meet with Pahlavi.   \"I'm not sure that it would be appropriate at this point to do that as president,\" Trump said. \"I think that we should let everybody go out there, and we see who emerges.\"   Speaking in an interview with Sean Hannity aired Thursday night on Fox News, Trump went as far as to suggest Khamenei may want to leave Iran.   \"He's looking to go someplace,\" Trump said. \"It's getting very bad.\"\n",

Officials also point, without evidence, to immigrants as the primary drivers of the fraud.   Late Friday a district judge in New York blocked the funding freeze for now.   Public policy experts say the structure of U.S. safety-net programs does create opportunity for scammers, and more could be done to tackle that. At the same time, there's concern that the Trump administration's mounting drumbeat of unfounded fraud allegations could undermine public trust in a system that millions of people rely on.   \n   The issue gained traction late last month after right-wing media influencer Nick Shirley alleged corruption at Somali American owned daycare centers in Minnesota. Even though his accusations were unsubstantiated they've fueled a political firestorm. They also focused renewed attention on a massive years-long benefits scandal in Minnesota that's already seen more than 60 people convicted and dozens of others charged.Here's a look at some of the issues.   Accusations of benefit fraud are as old as the programs themselves   The first major American social welfare program was pensions for Civil War veterans, \"and that likewise was associated with a lot of accusations of fraud and mismanagement by the government,\" says public policy expert Don Moynihan at the University of Michigan.    He says longstanding tropes around welfare fraud persist today, along with actual fraud, but the Trump administration is politicizing the issue.   The extent of benefits fraud is not known since presumably not all criminal behavior is caught. But \"the bottom line is there are billions and billions of dollars that are lost by taxpayers to improper payments, including fraud, every year,\" says Matt Weidinger, who studies poverty at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and has worked on unemployment benefits policy.   Most fraud is by providers or outside scammers, not as much by recipients. Individuals who have been convicted of such fraud are overwhelmingly U.S. citizens. In fact, undocumented immigrant workers pay billions into Social Security every year, effectively subsidizing a program they will never collect from.   \n   Wrongdoing occurs despite required procedures to prevent it, along with investigations by inspectors general, state audits, and criminal prosecutions.   The structure of the U.S. safety net creates opportunities for fraud   It's common for states to administer programs with federal money, which Weidinger says undermines their incentive to be \"super vigilant.\"   \"This is the same reason why you don't wash rental cars, right? It really belongs to somebody else,\" he says.   He notes there are also more than 80 federal social service programs for low-income people, a sprawling network that is confusing for people who need help and \"too complicated to efficiently administer.\"   \n   A lot of benefits also flow through private contractors for services already performed. Moynihan says this reflects an American desire for smaller government, but comes with a trade-off.   \"Once you make that choice, then that also invites more opportunities for bad apples to engage in fraud,\" he says. \"Government then has to do more to monitor that behavior to try to prevent it.\"   Democrats say Trump aims to \"punish\" them, not actually address fraud    The Trump administration has specifically alleged \"extensive and systematic fraud\" in five Democratic-led states: California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York. Letters sent to each this week say there is \"reason to believe\" they are \"illicitly providing illegal aliens\" with benefits, although the administration has offered no evidence of any ongoing fraud.   \"For too long, Democrat-led states and Governors have been complicit in allowing massive amounts of fraud to occur under their watch,\" said Department of Health and Human Services spokesman Andrew Nixon in a statement to NPR. \"Under the Trump Administration, we are ensuring that federal taxpayer dollars are being used for legitimate purposes. We will ensure these states are following the law and protecting hard-earned taxpayer money.\"   \n   In all, the agency is seeking to withhold $10 billion in cash aid, childcare subsidies, and other social services for low-income families until states provide a large amount of data – going back years – on recipients, providers, and anti-fraud measures.   The five Democratic-led states have filed suit arguing the funding freeze is unlawful and violates congressional authority over spending. In a press conference Friday, New York Attorney General Letitia James called the move cruel and said it was about \"punishing Democratic states that oppose the President.\"   California Attorney General Rob Bonta compared it to the pause in SNAP food aid during the recent federal shutdown, saying it amounts to \"a political attack on the most vulnerable in our society.\"   \n   Fraud happens in every state, blue and red, says researcher Weidinger, because criminals \"will find weakness wherever it is.\"   One massive recent scandal over cash aid was in Mississippi. In December 2024 the Biden administration notified the state it must pay back $101 million in welfare money that was misspent. Last year the Trump administration rescinded that penalty letter, agreeing to the state's request for more time.\n",

It's the latest sign of friction between the Trump administration and local officials over federal agents' use of lethal force in two separate shootings this week.   \n   Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said the initiative, announced Friday, is a response to federal authorities' decision to exclude state investigators from the FBI's investigation into the fatal shooting of Good in Minneapolis on Wednesday.    Moriarty said she wants the government to reconsider that decision.   \"Our efforts in advocating for a joint investigation is not an attack on the FBI,\" Moriarty said during a news conference. \"We have had a strong working relationship with the local FBI field office throughout my administration.\"   \n   With the FBI acting as the sole lead agency for the inquiry, she added, state and local authorities would be blocked from viewing the bureau's findings. They would also not have access to critical evidence, such as Good's car, any shell casings, and witness interviews.    Moriarty said her office is working with the state attorney general's office to gather evidence and ensure a transparent investigation. They issued a call for Minneapolis residents to submit evidence online.   \n   Officials in Oregon are also calling for a transparent inquiry into a second high-profile shooting this week involving federal agents, after Customs and Border Protection agents shot and injured two people in Portland on Thursday. As in the Minneapolis case, federal officials say the agents fired in self-defense, in line with their training.   \"We know what the federal government says happened here,\" Portland Mayor Keith Wilson said of Thursday's shooting. \"There was a time when we could take them at their word. That time is long past. That is why we are calling on ICE to halt all operations in Portland until a full and independent investigation can take place.\"   Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek echoed Wilson's call for answers, saying on X that a full and thorough investigation, not more detentions, should be the government's main priority.   \n   Along with the rift between local and federal officials, reactions to the shootings, from public protests to online arguments, reflect a deep divide in how they're seen — as tragic abuses of power or law enforcement officers acting in self-defense.   Portland: Border Patrol shoot and wound 2 people   Shortly after 2:15 p.m. local time, a man and a woman were shot by federal agents in the Hazelwood neighborhood, according to the Portland Police Bureau. FBI Portland told member station OPB that U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents were involved.   Less than 10 minutes later, Portland officers responded to a call several miles away from a man who had been shot and was requesting help, Portland Chief of Police Bob Day said in a news conference.   \"We found a male and a female with apparent gunshot wounds,\" Day said. \"Officers applied a tourniquet and summoned emergency medical personnel.\"   The pair were taken to a local hospital and officers determined that they were wounded in the shooting involving federal agents, Day said. Details about their conditions have not emerged.   Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said the shooting occurred while Border Patrol agents were conducting a targeted vehicle stop. After agents identified themselves, McLaughlin alleged, the driver \"weaponized his vehicle and attempted to run over the law enforcement agents.\"   \"Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired a defensive shot,\" she said in a statement, adding that the driver fled the scene in the car.   McLaughlin said the driver and passenger were affiliated with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua but did not offer evidence of their gang association.   On Friday, Homeland Security identified the driver of the vehicle as Luis David Nico Moncada, and the passenger as Yorlenys Betzabeth Zambrano-Contreras, both from Venezuela.   Just hours after issuing a message of solidarity to Minneapolis, Portland Mayor Wilson convened a news conference about a shooting by federal officers in his own city. Wilson said he spoke to Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Thursday about what he called the \"recklessness\" of federal actions under President Trump.   \n   Like Frey, Wilson called for a halt to the \"surge\" of federal agents targeting cities such as Minneapolis and Portland.   Minneapolis: ICE agent in shooting is identified   Good died after being shot in her Honda Pilot SUV on Wednesday morning, in a residential area a few blocks north of where police killed George Floyd in May 2020.   ICE agents at the scene were trying to deal with a vehicle that had gotten stuck in the snow, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said. As other ICE vehicles arrived, so did protesters. A witness named Caitlin Callenson told member station MPR that agents gave Good conflicting orders about either getting out of the vehicle or driving away.   (Warning: The video at the following link includes violent actions and profanity.)   Video footage from the scene shows Good's SUV sitting sideways on a snowy street, with her driver's side window down. As officers approach, the SUV moves forward — and an ICE agent who was near the front of the vehicle, later identified as Ross, opens fire at close range. The SUV then crashes into a nearby telephone pole.   NPR identified the ICE agent who shot and killed 37-year-old Good as Jonathan Ross by cross-referencing court records with details about the officer released by Noem at a Wednesday news conference. Noem — without naming the officer — spoke about a previous confrontation he had with a motorist.   \"The very same officer who was attacked today had previously been dragged by an anti-ICE rioter who had rammed him with a car and [dragged] him back in June. He sustained injuries at that time, as well,\" she said.   The description of the incident matches a court case against a Mexican national, Roberto Carlos Munoz-Guatemala, who was found guilty in December of assaulting a federal officer in Bloomington, Minn. DHS confirmed to NPR that the court case is the one Noem referenced. Ross' name is mentioned in court documents for the case. According to the legal records, federal officers initiated a traffic stop of Munoz-Guatemala, who had been convicted of sexual abuse, in an attempt to arrest him. Munoz-Guatemala sped away after Ross had reached inside the vehicle, trapping the agent's arm and causing him to sustain injuries to his arm and hand.   \n   Noem said that Wednesday's shooting occurred after protesters in Minneapolis harassed and impeded ICE agents and that the officer acted to protect himself and fellow officers. She alleged that Good's actions amounted to \"an act of domestic terrorism.\"   Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison told NPR's Morning Edition that he disagrees with Noem's characterization of Good as a domestic terrorist.   \"She was a compassionate neighbor trying to be a legal observer on behalf of her immigrant neighbors,\" Ellison said. \"That's what she was doing at the moment of her death. And she was a poet. She was a mom. She was a daughter. And I am deeply saddened by what happened to her and her family.\"   Good's wife, Becca Good, said in a statement to MPR that when the shooting took place, the couple was attempting to support their neighbors.   \"Renee leaves behind three extraordinary children; the youngest is just six years old and already lost his father,\" Becca Good said. \"I am now left to raise our son and to continue teaching him, as Renee believed, that there are people building a better world for him.\"   Competing narratives quickly emerge   Minneapolis Mayor Frey and other local officials have dismissed Noem's version of events as political spin. At a news conference on Wednesday, Frey said of the self-defense explanation, \"Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody that is bull****. \"   \"This was a federal agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying,\" Frey said, adding that he wants ICE units to leave Minneapolis.   Hours after the shooting, Noem defended the ICE officer who shot Good, saying the woman had blocked federal officers with her SUV and disobeyed orders to get out of her vehicle.   \"It's clearly established law that a vehicle driven by a person and used to harm someone is a deadly weapon,\" she said, as NPR reported. \"Deadly force is perfectly lawful when a threat is faced by a weapon, so I do believe that this officer used his training in this situation.\"   \n   When Noem was asked on Thursday whether the officer remains on field duty, Noem said he had gone to a hospital for treatment, but was then released \"and is spending time with his family now.\"   She also said the federal surge in Minneapolis will continue, and could even grow.   \"We've got thousands of officers there,\" she said, \"and I'm not opposed to sending more if necessary to keep people safe.\"   What's next?   Investigations in Minneapolis and Portland are ongoing, and in both instances, the FBI is in charge of investigating the shootings by federal agents.    In Portland, Day, the police chief, said that local police have been helping to secure scenes related to Thursday's shooting, but that's the extent of their involvement.  \"This is a federal investigation. It's being led by the FBI,\" he said.   In Minnesota, O'Hara initially said on Wednesday that the FBI and Minnesota's state agency, the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, would jointly investigate the fatal shooting.   But in a statement Thursday, the BCA said that the U.S. Attorney's Office reversed course at the federal level, and the FBI alone would lead the investigation, as MPR reports. The BCA said it \"has reluctantly withdrawn\" from the process, because it would no longer have access to case materials and evidence.   A day later, prosecutors in Minnesota unveiled their plan to pursue their own investigation of the case.\n",

The action happened swiftly, with brief debate, in floor action Thursday. Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina had announced during this week's fifth anniversary of the Capitol siege that he would seek to ensure the plaque is installed, partnering with Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who was also working on the situation, and Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California. No senators objected.   \n   \"A lot of people said it was a dark day for democracy,\" Tillis said about Jan. 6, 2021, describing his memory of hearing the thousands of people — \"thugs,\" he said — lay siege to the Capitol as Congress was tallying the 2020 election results.   \n   He said that because of the work of the law enforcement officers, it instead became a great day for democracy. \"We came back and completed our constitutional duty to certify the election,\" he said. \"We owe them eternal gratitude and this nation is stronger because of them.\"   This week, senators stepped up after learning the plaque, which had been approved by Congress more than three years ago, was nowhere to be found at the Capitol. Instead, many House lawmakers have been hanging up replicas outside their office doors.   The Senate also appeared to be motivated by the shifting narrative from President Donald Trump 's White House about what happened Jan. 6, 2021, when his supporters stormed the building after he urged them go to Capitol Hill to confront Congress over Democrat Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.   Trump himself shifted blame for the attack during a speech this week in which he said he only intended for his supporters to march peacefully to the Capitol. Moreover, the White House produced a glossy new report also shifting blame for the deadly riot — on Democrats, for Biden's victory over Trump, and on the police for their response to the mob.   \n   \"It's so important we be honest with the American people about what happened,\" Merkley said, as he called the resolution up for passage.   \"It's so important we recognize those who defended our democratic republic on that day,\" he said, and that \"people know we came back, as senators and House members, and finished our work that day, for the peaceful transfer of power.\"   Padilla said part of the context is the White House's new website that he said is an \"attempt to rewrite history.\" He said that \"dishonors\" the officers.   \"The Senate bipartisan commitment to real history is strong,\" he said.   \n   The plaque, according to the law, was intended to be placed at the West front of the Capitol where some of the fiercest fighting took place. It was required to be installed in 2023, a year after the legislation had passed.   The new resolution directs the Architect of the Capitol to \"prominently display\" the plaque in a \"publicly accessible\" location in the Senate wing of the Capitol until it can be placed in its permanent location.   To display the plaque in its intended location would require agreement with the House.   The office of Johnson, a Republican who before becoming the House speaker led efforts to object to the 2020 election results, said this week that the plaque, as constructed, does not comply with the law.   Police have sued to have the plaque put on display, as required, but Trump's Justice Department is trying to dismiss the lawsuit.   Tillis said part of the \"technical implementation problem\" was a concern that the law specified the plaque would honor all the officers involved, but the plaque only lists the various law enforcement agencies that responded to help the Capitol Police that day.   He said there will be a digital component, presumably a website, that will list all the names. The number of officers runs into the thousands.   \n   \"You'll see how many people came here,\" he said.\n",

In an interview with All Things Considered, Mamdani said the announcement means the state will commit $1.21 billion for New York City \"to take the first steps towards universal child care.\"   The city will be able to fund fixes to make universal care for 3-year-olds \"a reality\" and work toward enrolling about 2,000 kids aged 2 this fall, Mamdani added.

    "body": "\n      President Trump ran as the Peace President, but since taking office has been on a military spree with strikes on Iran, Yemen, Nigeria, Syria and Venezuela — and threats against others.   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  It has been a remarkable start to the new year for President Trump, from authorizing an attack on Venezuela in the wee hours last Saturday to threatening a takeover of Greenland. This from a president who openly covets the Nobel Peace Prize and who ran on a campaign promising no U.S. involvement in foreign wars. NPR international affairs correspondent Jackie Northam has this report.JACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: By any measure, President Trump's second term has been far more muscular than his first - launching military strikes and issuing threats from Africa to the Middle East and now Latin America. Here he is on Air Force One just hours after the U.S. raid on Venezuela and the arrest of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, contemplating what could be next for Mexico and its drug cartels...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Mexico has to get their act together because they're pouring through Mexico and we're going to have to do something.NORTHAM: ...For Iran...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they're going to get hit very hard by the United States.NORTHAM: ...And Greenland.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: We need Greenland from a national security situation. It's so strategic.NORTHAM: Trump also made similar suggestions about Cuba and Colombia. There have been strikes on Yemen, Syria and Nigeria. He's threatened Canada, Panama and others.STEWART PATRICK: There's no question that in his second term, Donald Trump is entirely unbound and he's eager to throw America's weight around in the world.NORTHAM: That's Stewart Patrick, a specialist on world order and international cooperation at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He says Trump is waving aside rules-based international order in his effort to ensure U.S. dominance.PATRICK: Donald Trump feels zero restraints and is experiencing a great sense of hubris in terms of his interactions with the world. You know, he's in a sense on a sugar high after having (laughter) gotten rid of President Maduro.NORTHAM: Laurel Rapp, who heads up the U.S. and North America Programme at Chatham House, a London-based think tank, agrees Trump is demonstrating more muscular foreign policy ambitions in his second term. She sees several major differences from his first term in office.LAUREL RAPP: The first is geography. Trump is willing to use U.S. military force across the world, from Latin America to Africa to the Middle East, and now potentially in Greenland, in Europe.NORTHAM: Rapp says the second difference is the level of risk involved. The Venezuela operation is a case in point.RAPP: And the third big difference is that he is willing to not just go after adversaries but also allies - treaty allies.NORTHAM: Stephen Miller, one of Trump's top aides, lays bare the administration's view on raw power during an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STEPHEN MILLER: We live in a world - in the real world, Jake - that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world that have existed...JAKE TAPPER: But are you saying that...MILLER: ...Since the beginning of time.NORTHAM: But Rapp, who spent 14 years at the State Department, says just because the military can invade a country doesn't mean it'll bring sustained change.RAPP: When you have insufficient planning, when you have unclear and conflicting objectives, a lack of diplomatic capacity in the country, limited or shifting U.S. attention and unrealistic timelines, these are all recipes for failure.NORTHAM: Carnegie's Patrick says the administration's embrace of force to advance national interests is enabling great powers in other parts of the world.PATRICK: Not least China and Russia to actually legitimate their own claims to a sphere of influence in their immediate backyards. So he's providing cover to a number of U.S. adversaries around the world to do the same thing where they are.NORTHAM: There's always the notion that threats against Greenland, Colombia and other nations are just overheated rhetoric or a negotiating tactic. But Venezuela proves nothing is off the table.Jackie Northam, NPR News.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Reactions to the shooting reflect outrage over Good's death and a deep divide in how it's portrayed — as either a tragic abuse of power or an officer acting in self-defense.   NPR identified the ICE agent who fired the gun as Jonathan Ross by cross-referencing court records with details about the officer released by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem at a Wednesday news conference. Noem — without naming the officer — said he had been in a previous confrontation with a motorist.   \n   \"The very same officer who was attacked today had previously been dragged by an anti-ICE rioter who had rammed him with a car and [dragged] him back in June. He sustained injuries at that time, as well,\" she said.   \n   The description of the incident matches a court case against a Mexican national, Roberto Carlos Munoz-Guatemala, who was found guilty in December of assaulting a federal officer in Bloomington, Minn. DHS confirmed to NPR that is the court case that Noem referenced. Ross' name is mentioned in the court documents for the case. According to court records, federal officers attempting to arrest Munoz-Guatemala, who had been convicted of sexual abuse, pulled him over in his car. Munoz-Guatemala sped away after Ross had reached inside the vehicle, trapping the agent's arm and causing him to sustain injuries to his arm and hand.   Noem said that Wednesday's shooting occurred after protesters in Minneapolis harassed and impeded ICE agents and that the officer acted to protect himself and fellow officers. She alleged that Good's actions amounted to \"an act of domestic terrorism.\"   Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison told NPR's Morning Edition that he disagrees with Noem's characterization of Good as a domestic terrorist.   \"She was a compassionate neighbor trying to be a legal observer on behalf of her immigrant neighbors,\" Ellison said. \"That's what she was doing at the moment of her death. And she was a poet. She was a mom. She was a daughter. And I am deeply saddened by what happened to her and her family.\"   \n   2 people wounded in a shooting involving Border Patrol agents in Portland, Ore.   As Minneapolis continued to grapple with the fatal shooting, police in Portland, Ore., said two people were injured in a shooting by federal agents.   Around 2:15 p.m. local time on Thursday, a man and a woman were shot by federal agents in East Portland, according to the Portland Police Bureau. FBI Portland told member station OPB that U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents were involved. The two people wounded were taken to a local hospital. Their conditions were unknown.   \"We are still in the early stages of this incident,\" said Portland Police Chief Bob Day in a press release. \"We understand the heightened emotion and tension many are feeling in the wake of the shooting in Minneapolis, but I am asking the community to remain calm as we work to learn more.\"   Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said the shooting occurred while Border Patrol agents were conducting a \"targeted vehicle stop.\" McLaughlin asserted that the driver \"weaponized his vehicle and attempted to run over the law enforcement agents\" after agents identified themselves. McLaughlin said the driver and passenger were affiliated with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua but did not offer evidence of their gang association.   \"Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired a defensive shot. The driver drove off with the passenger, fleeing the scene,\" she said in a statement. \"This situation is evolving, and more information is forthcoming.\"   Competing narratives quickly emerge   Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and other local officials have dismissed Noem's version of events as political spin. At a news conference on Wednesday, Frey said of the self-defense explanation, \"Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody that is bull****. \"   \"This was a federal agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying,\" Frey said, adding that he wants ICE units to leave Minneapolis.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A woman and other demonstrators confront federal officers outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis on Thursday, one day after a federal agent fatally shot a woman in her car in south Minneapolis.\n                \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Scott Olson/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he was angered by the killing, which he linked to President Trump's policy of sending ICE and other federal agents surging into cities such as Minneapolis.   \n   \"What we're seeing is the consequences of governance designed to generate fear, headlines and conflict,\" Walz said on Wednesday. \"It's governing by reality TV and today that recklessness cost someone their life.\"   Noem said on Wednesday that she had spoken with Walz about the killing, but added that they don't agree on whether it was justified: \"We have two very different viewpoints on what happened.\"   Hours after the shooting, Noem defended the ICE officer who shot Good, saying the woman had blocked federal officers with her SUV and disobeyed orders to get out of her vehicle.   \"It's clearly established law that a vehicle driven by a person and used to harm someone is a deadly weapon,\" she said, as NPR reported. \"Deadly force is perfectly lawful when a threat is faced by a weapon, so I do believe that this officer used his training in this situation.\"   When Noem was asked on Thursday whether the officer remains on field duty, Noem said he had gone to a hospital for treatment, but was then released \"and is spending time with his family now.\"   Noem also said the federal surge in Minneapolis will continue, and could even grow.   \"We've got thousands of officers there,\" she said, \"and I'm not opposed to sending more if necessary to keep people safe.\"   Key details of a controversial shooting   Here is a brief overview of what we know so far about the events leading to Good's death:   When: Police officers responded to reports of shots fired just after 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, according to a timeline published by the city of Minneapolis.   \"Minneapolis firefighters then removed the 37-year-old victim from the vehicle and immediately began lifesaving measures until paramedics could respond,\" the city's account states. \"She was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center, where she later died.\"   \n   Where: Good was shot in her car on Portland Avenue, near East 34th Street, in a residential area a few blocks north of where police killed George Floyd in May 2020.   ICE agents at the scene were trying to deal with a vehicle that had gotten stuck in the snow, Noem said on Wednesday. As other ICE vehicles arrived, so did protesters, a witness named Caitlin Callenson told member station MPR.   How: Callenson, who recorded a video of the incident, told MPR that agents gave Good conflicting orders: One agent told her to drive away while another told her to get out of her SUV, Callenson said.   (Warning: The video at the following link includes violent actions and profanity.)   Video footage from the scene shows Good's Honda Pilot SUV sitting sideways on a snowy street, with her driver's side window down. Two uniformed officers approach the vehicle from the left. As one officer grabs at her door handle, a third officer who had circled to the front of the SUV from the opposite side draws his gun. As Good begins to drive away, the officer fires into her car.   \"The preliminary information that we have indicates that this woman was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway,\" Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said at a news conference Wednesday. \"At some point, a federal law enforcement officer approached her on foot and the vehicle began to drive off. At least two shots were fired. The vehicle then crashed on the side of the roadway.\"   What's next: On Wednesday, O'Hara said the FBI and Minnesota's state agency, the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, would jointly investigate the fatal shooting.   But in a statement Thursday, the BCA said that the U.S. Attorney's Office reversed course at the federal level, and the FBI alone would lead the investigation, as MPR reports. The BCA said it \"has reluctantly withdrawn\" from the process, because it would no longer have access to case materials and evidence.   \n   Ellison, Minnesota's attorney general, said that he believes the FBI should not be involved in the inquiry.   \"I know that ICE and FBI are different agencies,\" Ellison said, \"but I think in order for public confidence to be at its best, there is some legitimate question as to what the role the FBI should be playing.\"   NPR's Ximena Bustillo contributed reporting. \n",

You can subscribe here to get the newsletter delivered to your inbox, and listen to the Code Switch podcast to hear about all the messy and meaningful ways race shows up in all of our lives.      I'll be honest, it didn't take long for the fresh, excited energy I was trying to bring into 2026 to be quashed. (But maybe that's on me — I forgot to put \"attack a foreign country and seize its leader with only the murkiest of communications about what might come next\" on my \"out\" list this year.)   \n   But this week, I want to talk about two other stories that, when juxtaposed, paint a striking picture of how some people are grappling with life under the second Trump administration.   First, a kind of ridiculous one: the petitions to deport Nicki Minaj.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Nicki Minaj arrives at the MTV Video Music Awards on Sept. 12, 2023, at the Prudential Center in Newark, N.J. (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP, File)\n                \n                    Evan Agostini/Evan Agostini/Invision/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Evan Agostini/Evan Agostini/Invision/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Have you all heard about this? More than 120,000 people have signed petitions calling for the rapper cum right wing political activist to be deported to her home country of Trinidad. Minaj was brought to the U.S. by her parents as a young child, and has spoken in the past about not being a U.S. citizen. And in recent months, she's angered large portions of her fan base by praising Donald Trump and the broader MAGA movement, after being outspokenly against the first Trump administration's family separation policies. (There's a whole lot of other stuff people don't like about Minaj, which you can read about here.) One of the petitions asserts that deporting her \"would serve as a reminder that public figures need to be accountable for their words and the broader impact they have on diverse communities.\"   I read about all that a day before an ICE officer shot and killed a woman, Renee Nicole Good, in Minneapolis.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A makeshift memorial honoring the victim of a fatal shooting involving federal law enforcement agents is taped to a post near the site of the previous day's shooting, Thursday, Jan. 8, 2026, in Minneapolis, Minn. (AP Photo/Mike Householder)\n                \n                    Mike Householder/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mike Householder/AP\n    \n\n   \n   There are, predictably, diverging accounts of what led to the shooting. The federal government says that it was an act of self-defense against Good, who they allege was attempting to drive her car into ICE agents. State and local officials are, quite literally, calling bull****. The mayor of Minneapolis described the event as \"an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.\" He then, uh, politely requested that ICE \"get the f*** out of Minneapolis.\" There is likely to be weeks of fallout as the federal and local governments clash over the continued presence of ICE in Minnesota, and the repercussions of Wednesday's violence.   \n   So what do these stories have to do with each other? To me, they illustrate the contradictions that come up when people try to cherry pick applications of the law. The signers of the Nicki Minaj deportation petitions seem to be deeply offended by her embrace of the Trump administration. (\"If [Minaj] believes in supporting the agenda that all illegal immigrants should be deported no matter what they bring to this beautiful country then what is good for the goose is good for the gander. Good riddance homophobic Nicki,\" one petitioner commented.) But in calling for her deportation, they are tacitly accepting a key bit of MAGA logic — that a person's political ideology can and should be grounds for their removal.   If you accept that, then you may also have to accept that deporting people is something that requires a force of agents — agents whose job is to remove people from the country. Not just people who offend their fans.   Audre Lorde famously wrote that \"the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house. They may allow us temporarily to beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change.\" It may have felt fun for some people to feel like they were giving Nicki Minaj a taste of her own MAGA-flavored medicine by calling out her immigration status. But if those people are genuinely concerned about how Trump's policies are affecting everyday people, their rage should potentially be focused more at the underlying structures of the administration than at one of its minor mouthpieces.\n",

    "body": "\n      In a rare rebuke to President Trump, five Republicans joined with Democrats on Thursday to advance a measure that would require congressional authorization for future military action in Venezuela.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  Five Senate Republicans joined with Democrats to advance a resolution to stop President Trump from ordering new unilateral military action against Venezuela. Here is Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer following that vote.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHUCK SCHUMER: It's a clear rejection of the idea that one person can unilaterally send American sons and daughters into harm's way without Congress, without debate.SUMMERS: It marks the largest Republican rebuke of Trump's policy on Venezuela after last weekend's military raid that ousted president Nicolás Maduro. Joining us now is NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales. Hi.CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Hi, Juana.SUMMERS: So, Claudia, the same bipartisan group - which was largely led by Democrats - it's forced several votes to limit Trump's war powers, but there have been mixed results. So tell us what's different.GRISALES: Well, quite a bit. As we know, President Trump demands fierce loyalty from this Republican-led Congress, and his party has largely stayed in line. But seeing five Senate Republicans break ranks today signals Congress may not have the same appetite as the White House for expansion of military action against Venezuela. Tim Kaine, the Virginia Senate Democrat who co-led this effort, said members learned through Trump-led classified briefings this week that a lot of information about this operation has been withheld from the public.TIM KAINE: We know a lot that we can't describe. Once folks start to get deeper and deeper into this, I think they're not going to like it.GRISALES: And he says that's partly a reason why more Republicans are shifting to support this. And Democrats and even some Republicans argue there's still a lot of questions about the next steps, such as the potential for the U.S.-Venezuela conflict to continue for the next year or more, the cost to the American public, expansion of this conflict to other countries and more.SUMMERS: The success of this vote apparently came as quite a surprise to other Republicans who voted against the measure. Have we heard from the Republicans who broke ranks?GRISALES: Yeah. Many have pointed to the same concerns about whether this could lead to another endless war. Kentucky GOP Senator Rand Paul has co-led several of these efforts with Kaine. I asked him, what is his biggest concern at this stage?RAND PAUL: I want to make sure that the war doesn't spread throughout South America or throughout the Caribbean and that there's diplomatic alternatives.GRISALES: Republican Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Todd Young of Indiana joined Paul and Democrats to vote yes, some for the first time - and that includes Young. He was a no on three war powers-related votes last year, but a yes today. And he said, while he applauded bringing Maduro to justice, he believes the vast majority of his state is not prepared to commit troops to Venezuela.SUMMERS: Claudia, have we heard any of the response from President Trump at this point?GRISALES: Yeah. Quickly after the vote, he lashed out at those five Senate Republicans on his social media site. He said the parties should, quote, \"be ashamed\" of these GOP members, and they should never be elected to office again. And he argued, despite their, quote, \"stupidity,\" that the War Powers Act is unconstitutional. But of course, we know that's not clear in this case. It's also worth noting here that some of these lawmakers, like Senator Collins, are in a tight election race come this November.SUMMERS: That's right. Claudia, last thing - what's next?GRISALES: Well, this sets up a series of votes next week in the Senate. The first is a procedural vote, and if that passes, it would lead to hours of debate, potentially more votes before a bid for final passage. But as we saw in that post by the president, he seemed to warn Republicans who sided with Democrats to reconsider their position. So they're going to have a lot of weight on their shoulders if they break ranks again.SUMMERS: NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales, thank you.GRISALES: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

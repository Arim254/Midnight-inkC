More than 2,000 troops have been deployed in the city since August, both from the District and at least 11 Republican-led states. Hundreds more were added after a targeted attack on National Guard troops killed one and wounded another last month, both of whom were from West Virginia.   The decision Wednesday upends a lower court order that troops be removed from the city.   \n   President Trump's deployment in Washington is the most robust long-running operation so far, in what has become a pattern of military deployments to help with policing in Democratic-led cities around the country.   Several other smaller deployments are tied up in legal battles — including Trump's deployment to Chicago which is at the Supreme Court awaiting an emergency decision.   In today's ruling the judges wrote that Washington, D.C.'s unique federal status allows President Trump to largely control the deployment of troops in the city. They also said the Trump administration is likely to win the overall case, which would see the deployment remain until at least the end of February 2026.   But the judges also raised serious doubts about the lawfulness of deployments of other cities. In particular, the deployment of out-of-state Guard to another state without the consent of that state's governor — as the administration has tried to do in both Oregon and Illinois.   The opinion called such a move \"constitutionally troubling to our federal system of government.\"   Troops have left Los Angeles   Today's decision comes days after a different federal appeals court ruled that troops had to leave Los Angeles on Monday.   The Ninth Circuit ruled late Friday night to uphold a ruling by a federal judge in California to end Trump's deployment. Trump seized control of the California National Guard in June amid protests in the city and sent more than 4,000 troops there, against Gov. Gavin Newsom's wishes.   \n   That number had since dropped to around 100, but the administration had sought to extend the federalization of the state's Guard several times, most recently until February, saying it was still necessary.   The decision from the Ninth Circuit effectively blocked the administration from using those remaining National Guard troops in Los Angeles — but it did not force control of the troops to return to the state, leaving them under federal control for now.   All troops have left their stations in the city, according to two sources familiar with the matter who are not authorized to talk publicly. A military official who was not authorized to discuss details of a deployment publicly told NPR that the troops have been moved to a military facility in the area and are conducting training exercises.   NPR's Tom Bowman contributed to this report from Washington. \n",

Testifying behind closed doors, Smith also told the House Judiciary Committee that his team developed \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt\" that Trump took part in a criminal scheme to overturn the 2020 election. Investigators also had \"powerful evidence\" that Trump had willfully retained classified documents and tried to obstruct justice to hide that he had them.   \n   \"The decision to bring charges against President Trump was mine, but the basis for those charges rests entirely with President Trump and his actions,\" Smith told lawmakers.   Smith appeared in private before the Republican-led committee in response to a subpoena after the panel rejected his offer to testify publicly about his investigations.   Those probes led to two criminal indictments against Trump: one for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election, and the other for allegedly obstructing justice and mishandling classified documents.   After Trump's 2024 election win, the Justice Department dropped the election case and abandoned its appeal effort of a federal judge's dismissal of the classified documents prosecution.   Trump and his allies, including GOP lawmakers on the panel, have long accused Smith of investigating Trump for political reasons — a claim Smith denied.   He also stood by his decision to pursue the cases.   \"If asked whether to prosecute a former president based on the same facts today, I would do so regardless of whether the president was a Republican or a Democrat,\" he said.   In addition to the portions of his opening remarks obtained by NPR, Smith is expected to use his testimony to try to correct what he views as mischaracterizations of his work, according to a person familiar with the matter who was granted anonymity in order to discuss the private deposition. That includes the special counsel office's obtaining phone records of some Republican members of congress.   \n   Despite his appearance taking place behind closed doors, Smith will still be limited in what he can say. For example, he won't be able to answer questions related to grand jury materials, which are still covered by secrecy rules.\n",

In a statement posted on X, Bongino thanked President Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel \"for the opportunity to serve with purpose.\"   Bongino was an unusual pick for the No. 2 post at the FBI, a critical job overseeing the bureau's day-to-day affairs traditionally held by a career agent. Neither Bongino nor his boss, Patel, had any previous experience at the FBI.   Bongino did have previous law enforcement experience, as a police officer and later as a Secret Service agent, as well as a long history of vocal support for Trump.   \n   Bongino made his name over the past decade as a pro-Trump, far-right podcaster who pushed conspiracy theories, including some involving the FBI. He had been critical of the bureau, embracing the narrative that it had been \"weaponized\" against conservatives and even calling its agents \"thugs.\"   His tenure at the bureau was at times tumultuous, including a clash with Justice Department leadership over the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.   But it also involved the arrest earlier this month of the man authorities say is responsible for placing two pipe bombs near the Democratic and Republican committee headquarters, hours before the assault on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.   In an unusual arrangement, Bongino has had a co-deputy director since this summer when the Trump administration tapped Andrew Bailey, a former attorney general of Missouri, to serve alongside Bongino in the No. 2 job.   President Trump praised Bongino in brief remarks to reporters before he announced he was stepping down.\"Dan did a great job,\" Trump said. \"I think he wants to go back to his show.\"\n",

Though he's recently mocked Democrats' focus on affordability, their focus on pocketbook issues is seen as why they swept key off-year elections in November. And the president has tried to address the issue, recently hitting the road to make his economic case. He pitched supporters in Pennsylvania last week by promising bigger tax returns in April thanks to his policies, as well as promoting \"Trump accounts\" for children born between 2025-2028.   But his labeling of the economy as \"A+++++\" in a recent Politico interview was knocked by even some conservatives as tone-deaf, however.   \n   Wednesday's address will provide the president another opportunity to regain the economic narrative, though the White House says the speech will cover an array of issues. (NPR will stream the address starting at 9 p.m. ET).    \n   \"He'll be addressing the country about all of his historic accomplishments over the past year and maybe teasing some policy that will be coming in the new year, as we head into this Christmas season,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told Fox News on Tuesday.   Leavitt specifically cited border security and lower gas prices as two likely focuses of Trump's address.   The address comes as approval of Trump's handling of the economy has hit a new low, according to the latest NPR PBS News Marist Poll. Fully 45% of Americans said prices are their top economic concern right now, far ahead of the next-highest category – housing prices – at 18%.   The various tariffs President Trump has unilaterally imposed are driving prices higher, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell reported last week. He told reporters that inflation growth is happening entirely in goods (as opposed to services), and that the growth is \"entirely in sectors where there are tariffs.\"   Trump will have another opportunity to talk directly to voters on Friday, when he will deliver a speech in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.\n",

As NPR's Quil Lawrence reports, two survivors of an initial hit were targeted and killed as they clung to burning wreckage and waved in distress.QUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE: President Trump is using language from the so-called war on terror to justify ongoing strikes on alleged drug traffickers at sea. His defenders say destroying drug boats is like hitting al-Qaida targets. Many military and civilian lawyers call these killings execution without trial or simply murder. Video of the September 2 strike, according to lawmakers who have already seen it, shows shipwrecked survivors being killed as they cling to their overturned boat. President Trump said he'd have no problem releasing that video to the public. Then he deferred to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. Now Hegseth says that won't happen.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PETE HEGSETH: Of course, we're not going to release a top-secret, full, unedited video of that to the general public. HASC and SASC and appropriate committees will see it.LAWRENCE: The HASC and SASC are the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, which will view the full video today. Reactions from a few lawmakers who have already seen it mostly fell along partisan lines. Republicans saw a legitimate strike. Democrats saw a potential war crime.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHUCK SCHUMER: It was deeply troubling.LAWRENCE: Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer said the other issue is what role these boat strikes play in the Trump administration's campaign to oust Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SCHUMER: Policies in the Caribbean are unclear. We don't know what the limits are. We don't know where they'll stop. We don't know what the ultimate goal is. The president says different things at different times and contradicts himself.LAWRENCE: Trump's chief of staff, Susie Wiles, told Vanity Fair magazine that the boat strikes are about pushing out Maduro. Underscoring that point, last night, Trump ordered what he called a, quote, \"total and complete blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers going into and out of Venezuela.\" He called Venezuela's oil fields stolen and said the oil must be returned to the United States. The president did not provide any further explanation to back up his allegations.Quil Lawrence, NPR News.(SOUNDBITE OF MENAHAN STREET BAND'S \"RAINY DAY LADY\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

Mike Lawler of New York has called congressional inaction on the expiring Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies that millions rely on \"idiotic\" and \"shameful.\" More than 20 million people rely on these subsidies.   A vote is scheduled Wednesday on a proposal from Speaker Mike Johnson focused on cutting health costs and instituting some reforms favored by conservatives. Johnson's plan currently does not extend the ACA subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of this year.   In an interview with Morning Edition, Lawler said that while the ACA subsidies were meant to be temporary, he finds it \"unacceptable\" for Congress to allow them to expire knowing that health care premiums will skyrocket.   \n   \"Speaker Johnson is correct that the system is not working, and just throwing money at the insurance companies is not going to make it more affordable,\" Lawler said. \"But you have to have a plan in place. You have to have reforms in place. And to just end the subsidy without those changes to me is idiotic.\"   Speaking to NPR's Steve Inskeep, Lawler discussed efforts by some House Republicans to push a temporary extension of ACA subsidies and find bipartisan support for a deal.   \n   Listen to the full interview by clicking the blue play button above.

According to NPR's congressional retirement tracker, as of Dec. 17, 2025, there are 54 current representatives and senators who are retiring or running for a different office — 10 senators and 44 House members.   Loading...\n   They include the retirement of longtime leaders like California Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, the planned resignation of onetime Trump ally-turned-foe Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and a slew of politicians looking to flee Washington, D.C., for state or local offices.   \n   There are 25 retiring from public office with the rest running for a different office — 15 looking to become governor of their state and 13 looking to make the jump from House to Senate.   Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy is looking to become his state's attorney general.   Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn and Colorado Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet are not up for reelection in 2026, but would resign their seats if they win their respective gubernatorial races.   They join eight lawmakers who began the 119th Congress in January and have since died or resigned. Former Rep. Mikie Sherrill resigned her New Jersey House seat effective Nov. 20 after winning her race for governor earlier in the month.   On pace for record departures in the Trump era   According to an NPR review of the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress and campaign records, 900 people have served in Congress since President Trump first took office in 2017. That includes 132 senators, 751 representatives — and 17 who have served in both chambers.   \n   Almost two-thirds of the current Senate and 44% of the current House have served since the start of Trump's term, too.   The most common way to leave Congress in the Trump era is retirement, as more than 140 lawmakers have done from 2017-2024.   Pelosi's announcement that she would not seek another term came shortly after November 2025 off-year elections that saw Democrats surge in races across the country. Greene's surprise decision to resign effective Jan. 5, 2026, came after a very public clash with President Trump over his second-term agenda and the release of the Epstein files.   \n   Ahead of the 2026 midterms, many older Democrats are opting to pass the torch to a younger generation, like Sens. Dick Durbin and Jeanne Shaheen and Reps. Jan Schakowsky, Dwight Evans and Danny Davis.   An unusually high number of lawmakers are running for governor, Senate and other political offices, including 12 House members and three senators running for governor of their state.   The 54 announcements made before the end of 2025 is a modern record for this far ahead of the election for both chambers. It also includes the most Senate turnover since 2012.   Redistricting and narrow majorities in a midterm year are factors   Republicans have narrow control of both the House and the Senate heading into an election year where the party faces headwinds with voters unhappy with Trump's second-term agenda.   \n   Efforts by Republican-led states to enact mid-decade gerrymandering to gain more favorable districts — and retaliatory redrawing by Democratic-led states like California — have led to a reshuffling of boundary lines that has accelerated some lawmakers' decisions.   \n   The Supreme Court ruled that Texas' new congressional map will be used in 2026, coming just ahead of the state's Dec. 8 primary qualifying deadline that saw nine incumbents retire, file for the Senate or run for other offices.   California's drastic redraw that favors Democrats could see some targeted Republicans announce retirement or be forced into a primary challenge against another sitting Republican.   Several other states may still seek to redraw their House maps ahead of their qualifying deadlines.\n",

In a new lawsuit, President Trump is seeking $10 billion from the BBC for defamation.\n                \n                    Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Not content with an apology and the resignation of two top BBC executives, President Trump filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit Monday against the BBC in his continued strategy to take the press to court.   Beyond the legal attack on yet another media outlet, the litigation represents an audacious move against a national institution of a trusted ally. It hinges on an edit presented in a documentary of the president's words on a fateful day. Oddly enough, it also hinges on the appeal of a niche streaming service to people in Florida, and the use of a technological innovation embraced by porn devotees.   \n   A sloppy edit   At the heart of Trump's case stands an episode of the BBC television documentary program \"Panorama\" that compresses comments Trump made to his supporters on Jan. 6, 2021, before they laid siege to the U.S. Capitol.   The episode seamlessly links Trump's call for people to walk up to the Capitol with his exhortation nearly 55 minutes later: \"And we fight, we fight like hell, and if you don't fight like hell you don't have a country anymore.\"   Trump's attorneys argue that the presentation gives viewers the impression that the president incited the violence that followed. They said his remarks had been doctored, not edited, and noted the omission of his statement that protesters would be \"marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.\"   As NPR and other news organizations have documented, many defendants in the Jan. 6 attack on Congress said they believed they had been explicitly urged by Trump to block the certification of President-elect Joe Biden's victory.   \n   Trump's lawsuit calls the documentary \"a false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction of President Trump.\"   The lawsuit alleges that the depiction was \"fabricated\" and aired \"in a brazen attempt to interfere in and influence the Election to President Trump's detriment.\"   While the BBC has not filed a formal response to the lawsuit, the public broadcaster has reiterated that it will defend itself in court.    A Nov. 13 letter to Trump's legal team on behalf of the BBC from Charles Tobin, a leading U.S. First Amendment attorney, argued that the broadcaster has demonstrated contrition by apologizing, withdrawing the broadcast, and accepting the executives' resignations.   \n   Tobin also noted, on behalf of the BBC, that Trump had already been indicted by a grand jury on four criminal counts stemming from his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, including his conduct on Jan. 6, 2021, on the Capitol grounds.   The appeal of BritBox   For all the current consternation about the documentary, it didn't get much attention at the time. The BBC aired the documentary twice on the eve of the 2024 elections — but never broadcast it directly in Florida.   That matters because the lawsuit was filed in Florida, where Trump alleges that the program was intended to discourage voters from voting for him.   Yet Tobin notes, Trump won Florida in 2024 by a \"commanding 13-point margin, improving over his 2020 and 2016 performances in the state.\"   Trump failed to make the case that Floridians were influenced by the documentary, Tobin wrote. He said the BBC did not broadcast the program in Florida through U.S. channels. (The BBC has distribution deals with PBS and NPR and their member stations for television and radio programs, respectively, but not to air \"Panorama\".)   It was \"geographically restricted\" to U.K. viewers, Tobin wrote.   Hence the argument in Trump's lawsuit that American viewers have other ways to watch it. The first is BritBox, a BBC streaming service that draws more on British mysteries set at seaside locales than BBC coverage of American politics.   Back in March, then-BBC Director General Tim Davie testified before the House of Commons that BritBox had more than 4 million subscribers in the U.S. (The BBC did not break down how many subscribers it has in Florida or how often \"Panorama\" documentaries are viewed by subscribers in the U.S. or the state, in response to questions posed by NPR for this story.)   \"The Panorama Documentary was available to BritBox subscribers in Florida and was in fact viewed by these subscribers through BritBox and other means provided by the BBC,\" Trump's lawsuit states.   \n   NPR searched for \"Panorama\" documentaries on the BritBox streaming service through the Amazon Prime platform, one of its primary distributors. The sole available episode dates from 2000. Trump does not mention podcasts. \"Panorama\" is streamed on BBC Sounds. Its episodes do not appear to be available in the U.S. on such mainstream podcast distributors in the U.S. such as Apple Podcasts, Spotify or Pocket Casts, according to a review by NPR.   Software that enables anonymous browsing — of porn   Another way Trump's lawsuit suggests people in the U.S. could watch that particular episode of \"Panorama\", if they were so inclined, is through a Virtual Private Network, or VPN.    Trump's suit says millions of Florida citizens use VPNs to view content from foreign streamers that would otherwise be restricted. And the BBC iPlayer is among the most popular streaming services accessed by viewers using a VPN, Trump's lawsuit asserts.    In response to questions from NPR, the BBC declined to break down figures for how many people in the U.S. access the BBC iPlayer through VPNs.   Demand for such software did shoot up in 2024 and early 2025. Yet, according to analysts — and even to materials cited by the president's team in his own case — the reason appears to have less to do with foreign television shows and more to do with online pornography.   \n   Under a new law, Florida began requiring age verification checks for visitors to pornographic websites, notes Paul Bischoff, editor of Comparitech, a site that reviews personal cybersecurity software.   \"People use VPNs to get around those age verification and site blocks,\" Bischoff says. \"The reason is obvious.\"    An article in the Tampa Free Press cited by Trump's lawsuit to help propel the idea of a sharp growth of interest in the BBC actually undercuts the idea in its very first sentence — by focusing on that law.   \n   \"Demand for Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) has skyrocketed in Florida following the implementation of a new law requiring age verification for access to adult websites,\" the first paragraph states. \"This dramatic increase reflects a widespread effort by Floridians to bypass the restrictions and access adult content.\"   Several legal observers anticipate possible settlement    Several First Amendment attorneys tell NPR they believe Trump's lawsuit will result in a settlement of some kind, in part because there's new precedent. In the past year, the parent companies of ABC News and CBS News have each paid $16 million to settle cases filed by Trump that many legal observers considered specious.   \n   \"The facts benefit Trump and defendants may be concerned about reputational harm,\" says Carl Tobias, a professor of law at the University of Richmond who specializes in free speech issues. \"The BBC also has admitted it could have done better and essentially apologized.\"   Some of Trump's previous lawsuits against the media have failed. He is currently also suing the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Des Moines Register and its former pollster, and the board of the Pulitzer Prize.\n",

Today's top stories   With two days until Congress's scheduled holiday recess, lawmakers will likely leave Washington without extending Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies. The enhanced subsidies for ACA marketplace plans will expire at the end of the year. Millions of Americans can expect a spike in their premiums, and some may see the price of their plans double or triple in the new year.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) discusses rising health insurance premiums as U.S. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) (L) and House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN) look on during a press conference in the U.S. Capitol Building on Dec. 10, 2025, in Washington, DC.\n                \n                    Heather Diehl/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Heather Diehl/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 The House expects to vote today on a package of long-favored conservative ideas around health reform, NPR's Sam Gringlas tells Up First. The proposed policies include association health plans and revising pharmacy benefit manager regulations. Rank-and-file congressmembers continue to hold bipartisan talks on subsidies, but lawmakers have acknowledged that a solution is unlikely to come this year.   As President Trump nears the end of his first year of his second term, only 36% of Americans approve of his handling of the economy, according to the latest NPR/PBS Marist poll. This marks his lowest score in the six years that Marist has been asking the question. Democrats now hold a slight 37% to 33% lead over Republicans on economic trust. This is a sharp turnaround from the 16-point advantage the GOP had on the question in 2022. The wide-ranging poll also showcases other stark economic pressures Americans face.   \n   The Trump administration unveiled a program earlier this year to fast-track the construction of new and untested nuclear reactor designs. The goal is to have three new nuclear test reactors by the U.S.' 250th birthday on July 4, 2026.    🎧 The Reactor Pilot Program is fast-tracking 11 new reactor designs by nuclear startup companies, according to NPR's Geoff Brumfiel. The program is run by the Department of Energy, not the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which has one of the world's strongest nuclear regulatory agencies. Some companies believe the NRC has been too strict and the Energy Department will be easier to work with. Isaiah Taylor of Valar Atomics tells Brumfiel that he believes the NRC is more relevant for a plant that is 100% ready to be constructed all over the U.S. However, critics of the pilot program believe that the Energy Department is the wrong regulator and that it compromises safety for the sake of speed.

    "body": "\n    TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. The most powerful person in the Trump administration, next to the president, is someone you may never have heard of or seen. That is, until yesterday, when a long article about her was published on the Vanity Fair website. And it surprised a lot of people because behind the scenes is where she typically wants to be. Now she's all over the news. She's Susie Wiles, President Donald Trump's White House chief of staff and the first woman ever to serve as a presidential chief of staff.The article was written by my guest, Vanity Fair writer Chris Whipple, who managed to do 11 interviews with her over the past year. He'll tell us about what she had to say about subjects ranging from why she says Trump has an alcoholic's personality, even though he's not a drinker, the deal she made with Trump that he'd end his revenge tour in 90 days - he didn't - her take on several members of the cabinet, including Vice President JD Vance, who she says has been a conspiracy theorist for 10 years, and how she justifies U.S. strikes on Venezuelan boats that have so far killed 87 people. Whipple's piece, titled \"Eye Of The Hurricane,\" will be published in the magazine's winter issue in January.Whipple is the author of the books \"Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, And The Odds In The Wildest Campaign In History\" and \"The Gatekeepers,\" about White House chiefs of staff. Before we hear the interview I recorded with Whipple yesterday morning, let's listen to a mix of clips from Trump and Wiles.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I want to thank the great chief of staff - most powerful woman anywhere in the world, they say. She got - the most powerful woman in the world. One phone call, and a group of people - I better not say it. I was going to say, one phone call and a country is wiped out, but we're not going to say that...(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: ...Because we're a peace-loving nation. We are a peace-loving nation. Susie Wiles. Where are you, Susie?(CHEERING)TRUMP: There she is.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SUSIE WILES: The people that came before me - all men, as you know - had a dinner for me in November last year. And they said, it's so stressful. You'll be so tired. Be sure you pace yourself. Be sure you, you know, are good to yourself, and all that kind of thing. And I thought, what am I getting into, right?KIMBERLY FLETCHER: (Laughter).DEBBIE KRAULIDIS: I might not even sign up for this, right?WILES: And I'm older than all of them. Not now, but when they were in this job. And I have not had that. I keep thinking that's going to happen to me. I love coming to work every day, and I'm not just saying that. I love coming to work every day. I love Donald Trump. I love working for him, and all my people around us - they're fantastic. We couldn't have assembled a better team, and they are so devoted to our cause. It's a joy to be there.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: So Susie Trump. Do you know Susie Trump?UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Yeah.TRUMP: Sometimes referred to as Susie Wiles. Susie Trump.UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Yeah.TRUMP: She's the great chief of staff at the - they don't use the word chief of staff anymore because of - the Indians got extremely upset.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: But now the Indians actually want their name used, which is true. They never didn't want it used. But the chief of staff, and she's fantastic. She said, we have to start campaigning, sir. I said, I won. What do I have to do already? They said, we have to win the midterms, and you're the guy that's going to take us over the midterm.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)WILES: We've been together a long time, and I'm so lucky every day that he trusts me to make decisions and to make recommendations. He doesn't always listen or do what I say. I don't want him to. But I'm always heard, and that's all you can ask.KRAULIDIS: Right.WILES: That is really all you can ask of a boss.KRAULIDIS: And he values your voice, your advice, correctly.WILES: He does...KRAULIDIS: Yeah.WILES: ...I think. I hope he does.GROSS: So those clips of Susie Wiles are from her interview last week on the streaming show \"The Mom VIEW\" on YouTube. The Trump clips are from last June and then last week at his rally in Pennsylvania.Chris Whipple, welcome back to FRESH AIR.CHRIS WHIPPLE: Great to be back.GROSS: Any reaction to what you just heard?WHIPPLE: Well, first of all, how rare is it to hear Susie Wiles' voice? I mean, it's just so unusual, and that's because she has this kind of under-the-radar role in the Trump White House. My other reaction is, have you ever heard Trump speak about anyone else the way he speaks about Susie Wiles? She has a kind of magic with him. It's what Marco Rubio told me is earned trust, quote-unquote. It's not only because she ran his against-all-odds presidential campaign in 2024, but because she has this unique relationship.GROSS: What is your reaction to him saying that she's the most powerful woman in the world and with one call could - what did he say? - demolish the country? I mean, what? I can't imagine how she would react to that.WHIPPLE: Well, it's Trumpian, isn't it? I mean, it's the kind of thing that she is accustomed to hearing. It's part of this magic that she has with Trump. She takes this stuff in stride. I mean, any traditional, conventional White House chief of staff would be in the Oval Office 10 minutes after a comment like that, saying, seriously, Mr. President? Look, let's avoid using that kind of rhetoric. Susie is inclined to give Trump a long leash when it comes to all kinds of remarks that would be - previously be considered beyond the pale by a president.GROSS: She is a very behind-the-scenes person. How did you get access to her?WHIPPLE: You know, every once in a while in a reporter's career, lightning strikes, and I really feel this was an example of that. It began way back in January and lasted for 11 months, right up until this week. I was struck by how remarkably unguarded and candid she was. We talked mostly about the campaign at that point. This was 10 days before Trump's inauguration, more or less. But everything was - nearly everything was off the record. And I can tell you, as someone who wrote a book about the Biden White House, that this is extraordinarily rare. Senior White House officials almost always speak to you on background. They require quotation approval. They're hardly ever on the record.GROSS: On January 11, she told you that she was determined to show the world a new Trump. She said, I told Hakeem Jeffries, you will see a different Donald Trump when he gets there - to the White House. I haven't seen him throw anything. I've not seen him scream. I didn't see that really horrific behavior that people talk about and that I actually experienced years ago.She's seen it now.WHIPPLE: Well, she's seen it now. And she saw it famously back in 2016, in the fall of that year, when at one point, Donald Trump called her to his golf club. At this point, she was working on his campaign on Florida. And he, in front of a bunch of cronies, proceeded to verbally abuse her to a fare-thee-well. She said that she wanted to just break down and cry. She instead steeled herself and told Donald Trump that, if you want to win Florida, I can do that - I'm paraphrasing now - but if you want someone who sets their hair on fire, I'm not your girl. And with that, she stood up, and she turned on her heel and departed.Trump called her every day thereafter, she says, and he got the message. He needed Florida and he needed Susie Wiles, and she never looked back. By 2024, she was the co-chair of his presidential campaign, ran a brilliant against-all-odds campaign, was undoubtedly first among equals running that campaign. And I think Donald Trump would not be president if not for Susie Wiles.GROSS: One of the things she told you is that she and Trump had an agreement that his revenge tour would be over in 90 days. And it's been considerably longer than that that he's in the White House. Tell us more about what she said about the revenge tour.WHIPPLE: I found this absolutely extraordinary, and it really is almost the arc of the Vanity Fair piece and the arc of the journey that I took with Susie Wiles from - it was Day 56 of the Trump presidency. I said to her, look, Susie, do you ever go into the Oval and sit the president down and say, look, why don't we cut out this revenge and retribution and focus on governing? And she said, yes, I've had that conversation. And she said, we have a loose agreement that the revenge and retribution will end - I'm paraphrasing now - after 90 days. Well, six months later, seven months later - don't hold me to the exact day - I said, you remember when you told me months ago that you had an agreement that this would end after 90 days? And she said, oh, well, I don't think he's on a retribution tour. But when I pressed her again, she confessed that the Letitia James case, for example - oh, well, that would be one, a case of retribution.So it's been this kind of journey from Susie Wiles thinking initially, early on, that she could have these discussions with Trump and get him to agree to these things. But in the course of this yearlong journey as White House chief of staff, I could see that by the end, she was all in. She was all in not only on MAGA, but she was all in on pursuing Trump's enemies, having them prosecuted. And I don't think that was the case initially. I think she knew that this would be a problem.GROSS: So are you saying that the more she saw of him in his second term, the more she started following through on his actions and supporting his beliefs?WHIPPLE: I can't read her mind, Terry, but what I do find really fascinating is that these kinds of conversations that she seemed to be having early on with Trump - for example, on Day 1, she argued with him that, are you sure you want to pardon all of the January 6 protesters? And she said, maybe we should be more selective. She lost that argument. She had a so-called promise, a loose agreement, as she put it, that the revenge and retribution would end after 90 days. They had that conversation. She seemed to be trying to act as - at least tap the brakes on some of Trump's excesses and, you know, overreach. But by now, I think, many months later - we're now approaching the first anniversary of Trump 2.0 - I think those conversations are few and far between. And those are the kinds of conversations, in my view, that a White House chief of staff must have to fulfill the most important duty, which is telling the president what he doesn't want to hear. She's doing less and less of that, I'm afraid.GROSS: Well, she tells you she sees her job, you know, as fulfilling his mission and that the American people elected him, and her job is to help him achieve his agenda.WHIPPLE: Yeah, she does. She does say that. But at the same time, she - you know, she loves to quote James A. Baker III, who was Ronald Reagan's quintessential White House chief. And nobody was better than Baker at telling Ronald Reagan what he didn't want to hear. And I - so I think that's the part of it that she's missing. I mean, JD Vance said to me that her philosophy of being White House chief of staff is - just as you said, it's to facilitate the president's vision. He said in the first term, White House chiefs, we're trying to look out for the national interest and rein Trump in and all of this, and he regarded that as nonsense. And Susie's done the diametrically opposite thing, which is help the president fulfill his agenda.Having written a book about White House chiefs and having interviewed every living chief at one point, here's what's missing. You cannot fulfill the president's vision. You cannot facilitate it without steering him clear of land mines. You have to be able to have the tough conversations. And to give just one example, when James A. Baker III, Reagan's White House chief, swapped jobs with Don Regan, it was no coincidence that shortly thereafter, we had the Iran-Contra affair. The White House chief has to be able to tell the president, you cannot go down this road. Believe me, it's a mistake.GROSS: Well, let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Vanity Fair writer Chris Whipple. His two-part series on White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles is available on Vanity Fair's website and will be on the newsstand next month. We'll be back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF ALEXANDRE DESPLAT'S \"SPY MEETING\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. We're talking to Vanity Fair writer Chris Whipple. He interviewed White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles multiple times in the last year and has a new two-part portrait of her that's on Vanity Fair's website and will be in the magazine next month. The article is titled \"Eye Of The Hurricane.\" Our interview was recorded yesterday.She helped him pick a Cabinet of hard-liners, you write. Does she see herself as a hard-liner?WHIPPLE: I don't think she does. I don't think she's an ideologue. I think she would regard herself as a kind of Jim Baker-style pragmatist trying again to facilitate the president's vision, execute his agenda, play honest broker, all of those things that White House chiefs - the good ones - traditionally have been. She doesn't insert herself, assert herself or express her opinion all that often about policy of any kind. When she does, Trump listens. And he would turn to Susie after Vance and Rubio and Miller and the others had had their say and say, Susie, what do you think? And rarely would she express her own opinion that differed from the consensus, but when she did, he listened.GROSS: You mentioned Vance. She describes Vance as having been a conspiracy theorist for a decade. Was she referring to in the past or when he was chosen as Trump's running mate?WHIPPLE: Oh, no. I think, to this day, she considers him a real conspiracy theorist. And she's really talking about all the way back to 2016, that for a decade, Vance has been that way, and she says he'd be the first to admit it.GROSS: So does she have faith in him as a conspiracy theorist?WHIPPLE: She does have faith in JD Vance. She thinks he's doing a terrific job. She's a JD Vance fan. She's also a Rubio fan. But she makes this fascinating distinction between the two of them, because I asked her. I said, what about this 180 -degree conversion from Never Trumpers to Trump acolytes that both Rubio and Vance seem to have made. And she said about Rubio that his was really principled, that Rubio - you know, it took him time to get there, but it was a genuine kind of ideological conversion to Trumpism. But by contrast, she suggested that JD Vance was - well, he was running for the Senate, and it was \"sort of political,\" quote-unquote. Sort of political was her view of JD Vance's 180-degree about-face from someone who once called Trump America's Hitler to being all-in.GROSS: Also, she calls Russell Vought, the architect of Project 2025 and current director of the Office of Management and Budget - she calls him a right-wing zealot. Did you say any more about why she calls him that?WHIPPLE: Yeah, a right-wing, absolute zealot, as a matter of fact, I think, was the exact quote. You know what? That's not necessarily an insult in the Trump White House. I think that she did have her differences with Russell Vought early on. And there was a memo that the Office of Management and Budget put out - this was even before a vote was confirmed, but presumably with his blessing, that made draconian cuts in grants, federal grants, and was clearly a mistake and was Vought getting out over his skis. And she quietly revoked that memo. So she clearly regards Russell Vought as a real MAGA hard-liner, a zealot, as she put it, but I'm not sure if she holds it against him. I mean, I think that she thinks that this is an extraordinarily competent Cabinet. A lot of people would say the opposite.But she believes in what she calls disruptors. She thinks Pete Hegseth is one and that the Defense Department needed that. She refers to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as my Bobby, quirky Bobby, but just what the doctor ordered for HHS - a kind of shock treatment. So, look, she's all-in with this very hard-line Cabinet.GROSS: She helped Trump choose the Cabinet members. So that would make me think she was a hard-liner at the very beginning of his presidency.WHIPPLE: I think what she believed in above all, Terry, was she wanted Trump to be able to have the people he wanted, the team that he wanted. And I think she would also subscribe to the view among a lot of the Trump White House, the current Trump White House, that the problem during Trump 1.0, his first term, was that you had all of these independent-minded people like General Mattis and John Kelly and others who were telling Trump what he couldn't do, trying to keep - put him in a kind of straitjacket. And I think she was determined to help Trump pick the people who would execute his agenda in his view and in her view. I think - but I don't think it's ideological. I think it was tactical in that sense.GROSS: So she sees herself as Trump's enabler in that respect and occasionally trying to put on the brakes.WHIPPLE: Well, she would fiercely contest that. She would argue with you about whether she's an \"enabler,\" quote-unquote. And I'll tell you, I interviewed Leon Panetta, whom I've known for a long time. He was Bill Clinton's extremely effective and empowered White House chief of staff. He really turned the Clinton White House around, in my view, very much up there with Jim Baker as the gold standard. And I asked him about Wiles. And he said - he's never met her, but from a distance, he couldn't decide whether she was an enabler or someone who was trying to be a disciplinarian and help Trump do the right thing. Well, when I repeated this to Susie Wiles, I got a real rise out of her. Her response was, paraphrasing now, but, I'm not an enabler, and I'm not a b**** and, in fact, that she doesn't, you know, assert herself unnecessarily, in her view. So that was her response, and I thought it was telling.GROSS: We have to take another break here, so let me reintroduce you. If you're just joining us, my guest is Vanity Fair writer Chris Whipple. His two-part series on White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles is titled \"Eye Of The Hurricane.\" It's available on Vanity Fair's website and will be on newsstands next month. We'll be back after a short break. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview that I recorded yesterday with Vanity Fair writer Chris Whipple. He interviewed White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles multiple times in the last year and now has a two-part portrait of her that's on Vanity Fair's website and will be in the magazine next month. It's titled \"Eye Of The Hurricane.\" Whipple is also the author of the 2025 book \"Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, And The Odds In The Wildest Campaign In History.\" His other books include \"The Gatekeepers,\" about White House chiefs of staff.You spoke to Wiles about the U.S. strikes against boats from Venezuela. What does she have to say about that?WHIPPLE: Well, she is all for it. She is in complete support of the president's policy. She insists that these boats - because the CIA can do remarkable things, she insists that these are drug dealers on these boats. I asked her - I went to see her. I think - I'm pretty sure it was on November 4, just last month. And on that day, she'd just come out of a meeting with the president, talking about the Venezuela policy and the lethal strikes on boats, and she said, words to this effect. He wants to keep blowing up boats until Maduro cries uncle. Which of course, really contradicts the official administration policy that this is all about stopping illegal drugs from reaching U.S. shores and not about regime change. So I found that a remarkable statement. But she certainly doesn't have any qualms about the policy. Although she also makes a somewhat newsworthy admission, which is that she says that land strikes by the U.S. on Venezuela would require going to Congress. Trump has said the opposite, you know, that land strikes could be imminent.GROSS: When she says, until Maduro cries uncle, it's ambiguous to me whether she means until he gives in and does more to stop the drug trade or if it means until he gives up the presidency and is, you know, replaced.WHIPPLE: Well, I suppose you could argue that that's what she meant. That's not the way I took it. It seemed to me - it certainly sounded to me as though they really feel that they could force Maduro out.GROSS: And one of the ways she justifies what's being done is that the boats that we fire missiles at are in international waters. Therefore, it's not a war crime. But does it matter if you're shooting people who are criminals? That's not grounds for execution and might still be a war crime, even if it's in international waters, where no country's individual laws apply.WHIPPLE: She says a couple of things, and they're not always consistent. But one of the things she said was that we can strike - I mean, I'm paraphrasing now - but the U.S. is entitled to strike even within territorial waters because they're evading detection, and therefore, presumably they're guilty of drug smuggling. So she said that - as though Trump could simply go ahead and order these strikes with impunity.But I really did have a very pointed exchange with her about the whole Venezuela policy - or the blowing up of boats, these lethal strikes. And I don't think she had a very convincing answer. I mean, we had an exchange about it, and she said, well, we're fighting a war. It's a war against these drug smugglers, to which I replied, well, yeah, but it's a war only in the president's opinion. He has - he doesn't have congressional approval. And she said, well, we don't need it. She said, we only need it if we're going to do land strikes. But we did have some really pointed exchanges. And again, it was just remarkable to me that she was willing to really answer, or at least attempt to answer, any question I threw at her. And I give her credit for that.GROSS: Susie Wiles described Trump as having an alcoholic's personality. And she grew up with her father, Pat Summerall, who had become famous because he was a kicker with the New York Giants and then became known as the voice of the NFL as a broadcaster. So she is familiar with what an alcoholic's personality is, if there is any one singular personality. What did she mean when she described Trump as having an alcoholic's personality? Because he's always said he never even had a drink.WHIPPLE: Yeah. It's got nothing to do with drinking. What she really means by that is this notion, this grandiose notion, that he can do anything. Nothing is beyond his ability to achieve. It's a larger-than-life confidence, not always grounded in fact. I don't think she would say that. But I think what she would say is that growing up with an alcoholic father, father for whom she had to lead interventions with her mother to get him into treatment - Pat Summerall was sober for the last 21 years of his life. But it was a hard-earned kind of boot camp for her in dealing with larger-than-life men with difficult personalities. And she, of course, went on to run Ron DeSantis' successful campaign for governor of Florida in 2018 and, of course, is famously now Donald Trump's White House chief of staff.She'd be the first to tell you that - in fact, she said to me, I'm kind of an expert at that. I specialize in it, she said, about dealing with men with big personalities. Part of the fascination, I think, of her relationship with her father, Pat Summerall, is that she bonded with Trump because she knew all about - not only was she a sports junkie, which Trump loves to talk about, but she absorbed the zeitgeist of 1970s Manhattan, and she - that whole bygone era of the Copacabana and Sammy Davis Jr. And she could talk with Trump about stuff like that, which he just loves. And it was part of their bonding experience.GROSS: So Trump was a big admirer of Pat Summerall, Wiles' father. And the first time Trump met Susie Wiles, he said to her, I judge people by their genes.WHIPPLE: Absolutely. I mean, Susie Wiles told me if she's heard it once, she's heard it 100 times. Trump judges people by their genes - G-E-N-E-S. You know, look, I don't think it's a coincidence that Bobby Kennedy Jr. is head of HHS. Trump loves having a Kennedy in his cabinet. He loved having - being in the room with the daughter of the great Pat Summerall, who was kind of a mini John Madden when it came to reeling off scores of football games from bygone days. He loves that stuff. But he really does believe in two things above all, Trump, somebody once told me - winning and genes.GROSS: Well, let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Vanity Fair writer Chris Whipple. His two-part series on White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles is available on Vanity Fair's website and will be on the newsstand next month. We'll be back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF THIRD WORLD LOVE'S \"SEFARAD\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. We're talking to Vanity Fair writer Chris Whipple. He interviewed White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles multiple times in the last year and has a new two-part portrait of her that's on Vanity Fair's website and will be in the magazine next month. The article is titled \"Eye Of The Hurricane.\" Our interview was recorded yesterday.So what does she think about Elon Musk and how he handled DOGE?WHIPPLE: Wiles told me that she was initially distraught, as she put it, when she learned that Elon Musk, as part of this kind of scorched-earth cost-cutting campaign known as DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, had in effect burned USAID to the ground. This is the Trump modus operandi. You know, he - he's done it in business, and he certainly did it in the Trump White House. And she paints this vivid picture of this odd duck, as she put it, who was up all night, slept during the day in a sleeping bag in the Executive Office Building across from the White House, like some kind of jacked-up Nosferatu.But she was really aghast when she discovered that not only was he cutting stuff that the Trump White House wanted cut, what they considered wasteful, but also vital lifesaving immunization programs in Africa. Not only that, but PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Program for AIDS Relief, started by George W. Bush with $15 billion back in the early 2000s - that program was gutted. She began to get phone calls from relief agencies, former officials, saying that lives were in the balance. She called Musk in, tried to fix this. And she knew that fixing it was on her, that Trump couldn't be bothered. Trump didn't really care what was going on in the so-called smaller agencies, as she put it.GROSS: Let's talk about the Epstein files. Tell us what you learned about what happened in the inner circle when they did want to release it and when they didn't want to release it. The general outline of this has been, you know, revealed, but you may know stuff through Susie Wiles that others haven't reported yet.WHIPPLE: Well, this is absolutely fascinating. Susie Wiles told me she has read the Epstein file, quote-unquote, as she calls it, and she says Trump is in it. He's all over it, but not doing anything awful, as she put it. People can draw their own conclusions as to what she means by that. She says in so many words that, you know, he knew - obviously, he knew Epstein. She said, I know it's kind of an outmoded word, but they were playboys together running around in South Florida during this period of time. But she also says, really interestingly, that there's nothing incriminating on Bill Clinton in the files and that Trump is wrong about that - was wrong about that when he said repeatedly that Clinton had gone to Epstein's Caribbean island, Little Saint James, quote, \"supposedly 28 times,\" end quote, as Trump once said. So she said the president was wrong about that.It's not clear exactly why the Trump White House has not released the files. But there are plenty of theories, including the fact that Trump is obviously in those files. But what Wiles did tell me was that she thought that Pam Bondi had whiffed, as she put it, on the handling of all of this. You may recall Bondi called in a bunch of social media influencers who were passionate about this issue and presented them with binders full of, quote, \"nothingness,\" as Susie Wiles put it. So she was quite candid about how she felt about Pam Bondi's mishandling of this. She says that JD Vance and Kash Patel and Dan Bongino - vice president, head of the FBI and deputy head - were all for getting the files out. And as you know, on December 19, that's the deadline for another release. Certainly, Susie Wiles doesn't think that there's going to be anything earthshaking in the files to come.GROSS: So tell us about the trip that two high-powered people in the Trump administration took to interview Ghislaine Maxwell, the close associate of Epstein who enabled his rendezvous with young women and seemed to be part of the sex trafficking ring.WHIPPLE: Yeah. So Ghislaine Maxwell was Jeffrey Epstein's partner in crime, as it were. She was accused of procuring these underage women and sex trafficking them for Epstein. She was convicted in 2021 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. And during this whole recent flap during the Trump administration over the release of the files, Todd Blanche was suddenly dispatched to go and interview her in a courthouse in Florida. So I said to Susie Wiles, it's not typical, is it, to send the No. 2 person at the Department of Justice, who happens to be the president's former defense attorney, to go and interview a convicted sex trafficker in prison? And she said, well, it was Blanche's suggestion. It was his idea, in effect. She also said that she and the president had no advance knowledge that Maxwell would be moved from this prison to a less secure - what some have called a kind of Club Fed prison. She insists that not only did they not know in advance, but the president was ticked off, as she put it. She then said, if you want to know more about this, I'll find out. We've had several subsequent interviews, but to date, before the story closed, she had not found out. So here we are.GROSS: Or she's not telling you.WHIPPLE: Or she's not telling me. Yeah.GROSS: Well, let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Vanity Fair writer Chris Whipple. His two-part series on White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles is available on Vanity Fair's website and will be on the newsstand next month. We'll be back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF BENJI MERRISON AND WILL SLATER'S \"BETWEEN FEEDS/AMOROUS PEACOCK\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. We're talking to Vanity Fair writer Chris Whipple. He interviewed White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles multiple times in the last year and has a new two-part portrait of her that's on Vanity Fair's website and will be in the magazine next month. The article is titled \"Eye Of The Hurricane.\" Our interview was recorded yesterday.Just to set the scene for a little bit, like, when you interviewed her, there was a big hole where the East Wing of the White House used to be. And you also mentioned that there's a giant screen with a constant flow of Trump's Truth Social posts, his social media posts on his own platform. This was in her office?WHIPPLE: So I met Wiles. She was in the Oval Office when I arrived. She excused herself and met me in her office, and we had lunch from the White House mess and talked about all kinds of things, including the elections. She knew they were going to have a rough night, and the GOP certainly did. They got routed, as you know. So we talked about that. We talked about Maduro and Venezuela policy. We talked about all kinds of things.And at one point, I said to her - this was just days after the demolition of the East Wing, and I said, were you surprised by the reaction? You know, the fierce criticism of demolishing the East Wing for Trump's 90,000-foot ballroom. And she said, no, they weren't surprised at all. Trump was determined to just forge ahead. And then she said, but I think you need to judge it in its entirety. In other words, judge the White House renovation in its entirety. And I said, what do you mean? She said, well, there are other things that he's planning. And I said, like what? And she said, I'm not telling.And anyway, as I was leaving, I noticed that there is a big monitor just to the left of the wood-burning fireplace in that corner office, where the White House chiefs reside. And on that feed is a constant live feed of Trump's Truth Social posts.GROSS: Is that for staffers who are trying to keep him in check with his social media posts?WHIPPLE: You know, I didn't ask her specifically about that. I think it's - look, my guess is it's a little bit like having just a monitor of what the president is up to.GROSS: Is she concerned about how his popularity is dropping?WHIPPLE: She would tell you that she doesn't care about approval ratings. Whether you believe that or not is up to you. But she is emphatic about the notion that approval ratings change rapidly. The only approval rating that counts is a couple of weeks out from a midterm. For example, in this case, 2026. She is convinced - I said to her, how do you think you'll do in the midterms? And she said, we're going to win the midterms flatly. Well, that would be something because, as you know, history says that incumbent presidents suffer shellackings, as Barack Obama famously put it, in midterms. And this one - all the smart money would say this one will be no different and perhaps even worse for Trump than usual.By contrast, I will tell you, I asked JD Vance about this. And he said he thought that an incumbent president could be expected to lose as many as 13 seats in the House and two or three in the Senate, and he thought they'd do better than that. Now, you can take that any way you like, but that sure sounds to me like JD Vance trying to lower expectations before 2026.GROSS: Did she tell you anything about her perceptions of Trump's physical health, his mental health or his seemingly erratic behavior?WHIPPLE: I did talk to her about all of the above. Some of it was off the record. On the record, she insists that he is fine. She says, my health is good. His health is great. I should be so lucky, in effect. When I pressed her about Trump's tendency to fall asleep during Cabinet meetings - you may recall the time when Marco Rubio gave a kind of dear-leader speech right next to him, and he seemed to be sound asleep. Susie Wiles insists that he's closing his eyes, period, full stop. He's not sleeping. Even if it looks to all the world as though he's sleeping, he's actually just closing his eyes. So when I pressed her about Donald Trump's increasing tendency to lash out and verbally abuse women who challenge him - and in particular, that case where he snapped at a female Bloomberg reporter, quiet, piggy - her response to that was, he's a counterpuncher. And increasingly in this world, women are doing the punching.That was her answer.GROSS: And what about his cognitive or mental health?WHIPPLE: Again, Susie Wiles would have you believe that Trump is cognitively fine. I never got any indication from her that she felt any differently.GROSS: So what was your final impression of Susie Wiles?WHIPPLE: I just think it's been fascinating because Trump, famously or infamously, went through four White House chiefs of staff in his first term - Reince Priebus, John Kelly and all the others. And Susie Wiles has what none of them had, which is Trump's ear and Trump's trust. She is without a doubt the second most powerful person in the Trump White House, other than the president himself.And given that influence that Susie Wiles has with Trump, which no one else does, it really makes you wonder if history might be different if she used that influence to tell the president hard truths - to walk into the Oval Office, close the door and say, Mr. President, you cannot or should not go down this road. We just don't know the answer to that question because, by her own admission, she's not doing that. She's not having those hard conversations. She admitted to me that - she said, you know, other White House former chiefs have told me about these seminal moments when they've gone in and said to the president, you know, this is unconstitutional. I don't have those, she said. Well, what if she did? Maybe Trump would go on his way and be undeterred, but we don't know because I'm not sure she's tried.GROSS: Chris Whipple, thank you so much for talking with us.WHIPPLE: My pleasure. Thanks for having me.GROSS: Vanity Fair writer Chris Whipple's profile of White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, titled \"Eye Of The Hurricane,\" was published yesterday on Vanity Fair's website and will be in the winter issue next month. While we were recording our interview yesterday morning, Wiles responded to Whipple's article, writing this on X, formerly Twitter.Quote, \"the article published early this morning is a disingenuously framed hit piece on me and the finest president, White House staff and Cabinet in history. Significant context was disregarded, and much of what I and others said about the team and the president was left out of the story. I assume, after reading it, that this was done to paint an overwhelmingly chaotic and negative narrative about the president and our team. The truth is, the Trump White House has already accomplished more in 11 months than any other president has accomplished in eight years. And that is due to the unmatched leadership and vision of President Trump, for whom I have been honored to work for the better part of a decade. None of us will stop our relentless pursuit of making America great again,\" unquote.Tomorrow on FRESH AIR, Lucy Liu joins us to talk about \"Rosemead,\" in which Liu stars as a terminally ill woman grappling with her teenage son's escalating mental health crisis and the impossible choices she faces to protect him. It's based on a true story. She'll talk about the movie and her decades-long career. I hope you'll join us.(SOUNDBITE OF JESSICA WILLIAMS' \"BEMSHA SWING\")GROSS: To keep up with what's on the show and get highlights of our interviews, follow us on Instagram at @npfreshair.

Refugees must either get a green card within a year, or \"present themselves to the agency\" to avoid detention, according to a Feb. 18 memo from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.   The move marks yet another attempt from the Trump administration to further limit legal pathways to resettle in the United States. The administration last year set the lowest-ever cap for refugees it would admit into the U.S.   \n   And USCIS later announced that it would re-review the status of everyone who had been admitted into the U.S. as a refugee under the Biden administration, essentially reopening those cases and risking the loss of legal refugee status.   \"This policy is a transparent effort to detain and potentially deport thousands of people who are legally present in this country, people the U.S. government itself welcomed after years of extreme vetting,\" said Beth Oppenheim, CEO of HIAS, one of the resettlement organizations. \"They were promised safety and the chance to rebuild their lives. Instead, DHS is now threatening them with arrest and indefinite detention.\"   The memo was filed as a part of documents submitted in a federal court case tied to refugees who were arrested in Minnesota. In it, USCIS Director Joseph Edlow and ICE acting Director Todd Lyons direct their agencies to \"detain and inspect\" refugees who do not \"voluntarily return to DHS custody for inspection and examination\" to be a legal permanent resident at the one-year mark of being in the country.   \n   The policy rescinds prior guidance that did not treat the failure to apply for a green card as grounds for deportation. It also states that refugees may be placed in immigration detention while their application for a green card is being considered. The agency leaders say the new policy is needed to prevent immigration fraud, identify national security threats and vet people for criminal histories.   \"This detain-and-inspect requirement ensures that refugees are re-vetted after one year, aligns post-admission vetting with that applied to other applicants for admission, and promotes public safety,\" the memo states.   \n   DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the policy.   \n   The new policy sent shockwaves through an already weakened refugee resettlement system. In the past 12 months, the Trump administration has cut off key funding to organizations that assist refugees resettling in the U.S., including services that help with green card and citizenship applications. Refugees are required to apply for permanent residence, or a green card, after they've been in the country for at least a year.   Refugee resettlement organizations estimate this new policy could impact tens of thousands of refugees, mostly those who entered during the Biden administration. After going through extensive vetting to arrive in the U.S., they will now fear they could be affected by delays in processing at USCIS.   Shawn VanDiver, president of the organization AfghanEvac, called the memo \"a reckless reversal of long-standing policy\" that treats refugee admission as conditional.   \n   \"It breaks faith with people the United States lawfully admitted and promised protection,\" he said.   Groups that work with refugees warn there are several reasons why refugees may not have adjusted status quickly after arriving in the U.S., including a complex immigration system and backlogs at USCIS itself.   In fiscal year 2025, 38,000 refugees were resettled into the U.S. For this fiscal year, the Trump administration set a historic low ceiling for refugee admissions of 7,500, with the priority for admission going to white South Africans.   The memo was filed in Minnesota federal court as a part of an ongoing lawsuit over the revetting, arrest and detention of refugees who have not yet received a green card. Last month, a federal judge ordered the release of refugees in Minnesota and granted a temporary pause on detentions, which he said had been made \"without warrants or cause,\" while the case played out.   The arrests came after USCIS in January launched an investigation into 5,600 refugees in Minnesota, who had not yet received their green cards, and swiftly began referring cases to ICE.\n",

The Iranian drill and the arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier near the mouth of the Mediterranean Sea underscore the tensions between the nations. Iran earlier this week also launched a drill that involved live-fire in the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow opening of the Persian Gulf through which a fifth of the world's traded oil passes.   \n   The movements of additional American warships and airplanes don't guarantee a U.S. strike on Iran — but it does give President Donald Trump the ability to carry out one should he choose to do so. He's so far held off on striking Iran after setting red lines over the killing of peaceful protesters and Tehran holding mass executions, while reengaging Tehran in nuclear talks earlier disrupted by the Iran-Israel war in June.   \n   \"Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia, and the Airfield located in Fairford, in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social website, seeking to pressure the United Kingdom over its plans to settle the future of the Chagos Islands with Mauritius.   Meanwhile, Iran struggles with unrest at home following its crackdown on protests, with mourners now holding ceremonies honoring their dead 40 days after their killing by security forces. Some of the gatherings have included anti-government cries, despite threats from authorities.   Iran holds drill with Russia   The drill Thursday saw Iranian forces and Russian sailors conduct operations in the Gulf of Oman and the Indian Ocean, Iran's state-run IRNA news agency reported. The drill will be aimed at \"upgrading operational coordination as well as exchange of military experiences,\" IRNA added.   \n   China had joined the \"Security Belt\" drill in previous years, but there was no acknowledgment it participated in this round. In recent days, a vessel that appeared to be a Steregushchiy-class Russian corvette had been seen at a military port in the Iranian city of Bandar Abbas.   Iran also issued a rocket-fire warning to pilots in the region, suggesting they planned to launch anti-ship missiles in the exercise.   \n   Meanwhile, tracking data showed the Ford off the coast of Morocco in the Atlantic Ocean midday Wednesday, meaning the carrier could transit through Gibraltar and potentially station in the eastern Mediterranean with its supporting guided-missile destroyers.   Having the carrier there could allow American forces to have extra aircraft and anti-missile power to potentially protect Israel and Jordan should a conflict break out with Iran. The U.S. similarly placed warships there during the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip to protect against Iranian fire.   Anti-government chants made at mourning ceremonies   Mourning ceremonies for those killed by security forces in the protests last month also have increased. Iranians traditionally mark the death of a loved one 40 days after the loss. Both witnesses and social media videos showed memorials taking place at Tehran's massive Behesht-e Zahra cemetery. Some memorials included people chanting against Iran's theocracy while singing nationalistic songs.   The demonstrations began Dec. 28 at Tehran's historic Grand Bazaar, initially over the collapse of Iran's currency, the rial, then spread across the country. Tensions exploded on Jan. 8, with demonstrations called for by Iran's exiled crown prince, Reza Pahlavi.   \n   Iran's government has offered only one death toll for the violence, with 3,117 people killed. The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which has been accurate in previous rounds of unrest in Iran, puts the death toll at over 7,000 killed, with many more feared dead.\n",

The agency wants to ban families with any undocumented member from federally subsidized housing.\n                \n                    Kent Nishimura/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kent Nishimura/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   WASHINGTON, D.C. — The Department of Housing and Urban Development wants to ban families with any member who is undocumented from living in federally subsidized housing. A proposed rule also would require local housing authorities to report any tenant not eligible for rental aid to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.   It's part of a broader Trump administration crackdown on immigration, and in an opinion column in the Washington Post Thursday HUD Secretary Scott Turner called for \"ending the era of illegal aliens and other ineligible noncitizens exploiting public housing resources.\"   Undocumented immigrants do not get federal rental aid, but they can live with family members who do, including many U.S.-born children. In his column, Turner said roughly 24,000 such residents in are in HUD-subsidized housing. He and some other conservatives argue that is unfair, given limited funding and long waitlists for HUD housing.    \n   Most non-citizens with permanent legal status are eligible for housing aid. If the rule becomes law, housing authorities in large cities with lots of immigrants, like New York and Los Angeles, would see the biggest impact.   \"Trump's proposal runs contrary to federal law and is designed to instill fear and hardship on immigrant families,\" Shamus Roller, executive director of the National Housing Law Project, said in a statement. \"His administration deflects blame for the housing crisis onto immigrants so they can continue dismantling HUD's hallmark and lifesaving housing programs.\"   HUD proposed a similar rule change late in Trump's first term, to heated opposition from immigrant and housing advocates. It was not finalized before the COVID-19 pandemic shifted the Trump administration's focus, and the Biden administration rescinded it.   If the new proposal were enacted, a recent analysis by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities calculates nearly 80,000 people would face eviction, including nearly 37,000 U.S. citizen children.   Tens of thousands of U.S. citizen children could face eviction or family separation   Over the past year, Turner has repeatedly suggested that undocumented immigrants are taking advantage of public housing benefits and cheating Americans. The headline of the agency's news release announcing the proposed rule said, \"Illegals, Ineligibles and Fraudsters, Pack Your Bags,\" with emojis of a waving hand, a purse and a plane.   \n   Local housing agencies say they are following longstanding, bipartisan policy.    \"Public housing authorities are faithful stewards of taxpayer dollars,\" La Shelle Dozier, CEO of the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities, said in a statement to NPR. She added that they are committed to ensuring access to housing for \"America's most vulnerable families.\"   Such a change would leave families who've been in the U.S. for decades facing tough choices.   \"We were really planning on staying here,\" said one woman who lives in public housing in Los Angeles but asked that her name not be used for fear of being targeted for deportation. \"Our family is our kids, and this is where they grew up.\"   She and her husband came to the U.S. from Mexico nearly three decades ago. She cleans houses, her husband is a butcher, and she says they've been in the process of trying to legalize their immigration status. One son came with them when he was young, and that allowed him certain rights under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which has protected such people from deportation. But the Trump administration has been rolling those back, recently urging \"Dreamers\" to self-deport.   The woman said they've talked with their children about the possibility of being separated or having to move to her home country.   \"They've seen photos and videos and have spoken with family, but they don't really know anything about Mexico,\" she said. She's also not sure family members there would be able to house them.   She worries most for her younger kids, who are still teenagers and would not be able to stay on their own in the U.S.    \"They might not have a place to call home and to come back to,\" she said.   Conservatives say federal aid is so limited that housing people here illegally is wrong   The Republican policy guide Project 2025 put out by the Heritage Foundation called for the mixed-status rule, stating that \"HUD's statutory obligations include providing housing for American citizens who are in need.\" It suggested local governments or nonprofits could help noncitizens.   \n   Some conservatives argue it's not fair to house people who entered the country illegally, especially when federal rental assistance already falls far short of need. Only about 1 in 4 Americans who qualify for such aid are actually able to get it, and waitlists are often years-long.   \"It makes sense to change the policy for potential new tenants — both to be fair to those on waiting lists and to limit a financial incentive for illegal immigration,\" Howard Husock of the American Enterprise Institute wrote in the New York Post last year.   But he added that it's not practical to evict non-citizens currently living in subsidized housing, \"who were party to legal leases signed with public agencies. ICE agents have enough to do without raiding the projects.\"   The change would be costly since mixed-status families pay more   Immigrant and housing advocates point out that because undocumented tenants get no subsidy, mixed-status families pay significantly higher rent and effectively subsidize others.   \"The net result is to make more housing available for everyone, including people who are on the waiting list,\" says Marie Claire Tran-Leung with the National Housing Law Project, a housing law and advocacy center.   She also worries that evicting mixed-status families would worsen poverty and homelessness at a time when local governments already struggle with a record-high number of people living outside or in shelters.   Another public housing resident in LA, who also did not want her name used for fear of deportation, says it would be devastating if her family could not stay where they are. She's Mexican, her husband is Guatemalan, and all four of their children were born in the U.S.   \"The government doesn't want people living on the streets, but we won't have any other option,\" she said.   They applied for rental aid after the bathroom ceiling in their former apartment caved in, she said. Two children have health issues that keep her from working full time. Her husband is a day laborer, a job that's become more precarious since Immigrations and Customs Enforcement stepped up raids and arrests in Los Angeles.   \n   \"We have to focus on saving so that we can take care of our kids,\" she said.   Starting Friday, the HUD proposal will be open for public comment for 60 days. The agency is required to take comments into account before issuing a final version of the rule. In Trump's first term, Tran-Leung says 30,000 comments were overwhelmingly against the measure, which could factor into a potential legal challenge.\n",

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The renovations are more modest in scale and scope than what President Trump has publicly outlined for the revamped arts center, and it is unclear whether or not these plans are the extent of the intended renovations.   The email was sent on Feb. 2 by Brooks Boeke, the director of the Friends of the Kennedy Center volunteer program, to tour leaders and some staffers at the arts complex. In a response to NPR emailed Tuesday, Roma Daravi, the Kennedy Center's vice president of public relations, wrote: \"The Trump Kennedy Center has been completely transparent about the renovations needed to restore and revitalize the institution, ever since these proposals were unveiled for Congressional approval last summer. The changes that the Center will undergo as part of this intensive beautification and restoration project are critical to saving the building, enhancing the patron experience and transforming America's cultural center into a world-class destination.\"   \n   The center's closure was announced after many prominent artists canceled their planned appearances, saying that the Trump administration had politicized the arts. The Washington National Opera, which had been a resident organization at the Kennedy Center, left its home there last month, citing a \"financially challenging relationship\" under the center's current leadership; The Washington Post, in an analysis of Kennedy Center ticket sales last October, reported that ticket sales had plummeted since Trump became the center's chairman – even before the complex's board renamed the venue as the Trump-Kennedy Center in December.   In her memo, Boeke cited Carissa Faroughi, the Kennedy Center's director of the program management office. Boeke said that upcoming renovations to the complex's Concert Hall will include replacing seating and installing marble armrests, which President Trump touted on his Truth Social platform in December as \"unlike anything ever done or seen before!\" Other changes include new carpeting, replacement of the wood flooring on the Concert Hall stage and \"strategic painting.\"   The planned changes to the Grand Foyer, Hall of States and Hall of Nations include a change of color scheme, from the current red carpeting and seating to \"black with a gold pattern.\" The carpeting and furnishings in these three areas and its electrical outlets were redone just two years ago, according to the Kennedy Center, and were accomplished without interrupting performances and programming.   \n   Other planned work on the complex include upgrades of the HVAC, safety and electrical systems as well as improving parking. It is unclear whether these plans are the extent of the intended renovations; Daravi declined to answer that specific question.   The scope of the project as outlined in the memo differs sharply from public statements by President Trump, who said earlier this month on social media and in exchanges with the press that he intends a \"complete rebuilding\" and large-scale changes to the Kennedy Center, and that the arts complex is \"dilapidated\" and \"dangerous\" in its current state.   \n   Earlier this month, Trump said that a two-year shutdown of the Kennedy Center is necessary to execute these renovations. This idea was echoed by the center's president, Richard Grenell. Grenell wrote on X that the Kennedy Center \"desperately needs this renovation and temporarily closing the Center just makes sense - it will enable us to better invest our resources, think bigger and make the historic renovations more comprehensive.\"   On Feb. 1, Trump announced his plans to close the center entirely for two years \"for Construction, Revitalization, and Complete Rebuilding\" to create what he said \"can be, without question, the finest Performing Arts Facility of its kind, anywhere in the World.\" He later said that the project would cost around $200 million. The announcement came after many prominent artists had canceled their existing scheduled appearances at the Kennedy Center.\n",

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is in California trying to drum up support for a ballot measure asking for a tax on billionaires.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  A proposal to tax California's billionaires is pitting the state's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom against independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Sanders was in Los Angeles Wednesday night rallying support for the measure. From member station KQED, Guy Marzorati has the story.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BERNIE SANDERS: Thank you, LA.GUY MARZORATI, BYLINE: Senator Sanders is backing a one-time 5% tax on billionaires' net worth that's meant to offset federal health care cuts.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SANDERS: The billionaire class cannot have it all.MARZORATI: The tax would apply retroactively to anyone living in the state on January 1, 2026. But it's still a long way from becoming a reality. The health care union proposing the measure needs to collect nearly 875,000 signatures to get the measure on the November ballot. But Sanders is the biggest name yet to throw his weight behind the idea.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SANDERS: When millions of people in this state are struggling to be able to afford health care, maybe billionaires should start paying their fair share of taxes.(CHEERING)MARZORATI: The billionaire tax is aimed at what Boston College Law School professor Ray Madoff calls the tax avoidance playbook of America's wealthiest residents.RAY MADOFF: And the very first step is that they avoid salaries.MARZORATI: By keeping their wealth in stocks and other assets, Madoff says billionaires can dodge California's progressive income tax. But Madoff has concerns about a single state like California enacting its own wealth tax.MADOFF: Because there's too much free movement of people. It's too easy for people to pick up and move to different states or to choose to open new businesses in other states.MARZORATI: That concern was echoed last month by California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, who pointed to some billionaires already leaving the state.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GAVIN NEWSOM: It's a badly drafted effort. It's already had an outsized impact on this state.MARZORATI: Newsom also criticized the measure for setting aside 90% of revenue for just one area - health care.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NEWSOM: It doesn't support our first responders and firefighters. It doesn't support the general fund and parks.MARZORATI: Newsom is likely to play a leading role in the campaign against the billionaire tax, and some of the state's billionaires are already putting up money to fund the opposition.For NPR News, I'm Guy Marzorati in San Jose.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

    "body": "\n      Early voting began this week in the Texas Senate Democratic primary election, and one candidate got a fundraising bump from talk show host Stephen Colbert.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Early voting started this week in Texas for some closely watched U.S. Senate primaries. On Monday, we heard about the Republican side of that race, including incumbent Senator John Cornyn and the state's Attorney General Ken Paxton. Today, we hear about two of the Democratic primary candidates, Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett, and state representative James Talarico. The Texas Newsroom's Blaise Gainey is here to break this all down. Good morning.BLAISE GAINEY, BYLINE: Morning.FADEL: So there's been a lot of attention on Talarico this week because of the interview that he did with Stephen Colbert, and Colbert says CBS lawyers told him not to air it. So he talked about that on the show and put the interview on YouTube. CBS disputes his account. But has this controversy around the interview been a big boost for Talarico?GAINEY: I mean, it's been a huge boost. It's actually outstanding. That interview now has over 7 million views on \"The Late Show's\" YouTube page. The campaign yesterday came out and said they've raised $2.5 million since it aired on YouTube, and Talarico is now using the situation as fodder for his campaign, saying that it's another sign that the current administration will go to any level to try and prevent messaging that isn't in line with their talking points from being aired.FADEL: Now, one of the main questions that arose over this interview was an FCC rule about equal time for political candidates, which the current commissioner says he's considering applying to late-night shows. That hasn't applied in the past. So what has Talarico's main opponent, Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett, said about this so far?GAINEY: Yeah. The Congresswoman is mostly still gathering details, but on the briefing with Jen Psaki on MS NOW, she said it was ultimately beneficial for Colbert and her opponent Talarico.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JASMINE CROCKETT: It probably gave my opponent the - a boost he was looking for. So I think it's probably better that he didn't get on and that they went straight to streaming because we know that when we resist and when we know that it seems like they're trying to change the rules and bend the need to this president, that it backfires in a historic fashion.GAINEY: And also, Crockett said she wasn't approached by \"The Late Show,\" but she's been on the show multiple times. Her and Colbert both noted that.FADEL: Right. So she's referencing the FCC trying to apply this rule. How are Crockett and Talarico doing before all this?GAINEY: Right before this started, Crockett was ahead by eight points on Talarico. That was a recent poll that came out from earlier this month. But who knows now? I mean, because of the views and since this happened sort of right as early voting started in the state, it could sort of change people's minds in the last minute.FADEL: After all of this focus on a single interview of one candidate, I mean, talk about the bigger picture. Do Democrats even have a chance to win in Texas? I mean, Republicans have won every statewide race there for three decades.GAINEY: Yeah. I mean, if you ask them, of course they do. And here's how Talarico describes his chances in that interview on the YouTube channel for 'The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.\"(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT\")JAMES TALARICO: I think that Donald Trump is worried that we're about to flip Texas.(CHEERING)TALARICO: And, Stephen, this is the party that ran against cancel culture, and now they're trying to control what we watch.GAINEY: Yeah. And he's not exaggerating. Trump's approval numbers are low. And historically, during a midterm election, the party in power doesn't really gain seats. So this is the time for Democrats to try and flip seats, even in a state as red as Texas.FADEL: That's Texas Newsroom's Blaise Gainey in Austin, Texas. Thank you, Blaise.GAINEY: Thanks for having me.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Opponents say the legislation would disenfranchise millions of voters.   The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act — now dubbed the SAVE America Act — narrowly passed the U.S. House last week, with all Republicans and one Democrat backing the bill.   Its approval came about 10 months after House Republicans last passed the SAVE Act.   The measure, which would transform voter registration and voting across the country, faces persistent hurdles in the GOP-led Senate due to Democratic disapproval and the 60-vote threshold to clear the legislative filibuster. Some Republicans have called for maneuvering around the filibuster to pass the legislation, but GOP leadership has been cool to the idea.   \n   The overhaul would require eligible voters to provide proof of citizenship — like a valid U.S. passport, or a birth certificate plus valid photo identification — when registering to vote. The new iteration adds a requirement that voters also provide photo ID when casting their ballot.   \"This bill takes a strong piece of legislation, the SAVE Act, and makes it even stronger in the SAVE America Act,\" Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis., chair of the Committee on House Administration, said in prepared remarks on Capitol Hill last week.   It's already illegal for non-U.S. citizens to vote in federal elections, and proven instances of fraud — including by noncitizens — are vanishingly rare.   But Steil and other Republicans say current law, which requires sworn attestation of citizenship under penalty of perjury, is not strong enough, and documentary proof is needed.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis., speaks during a House Rules Committee meeting about the SAVE America Act on Feb. 10. At right is Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y.\n                \n                    Samuel Corum/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Samuel Corum/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Some states already take steps to verify citizenship for newly registered voters. And three dozen states also require voters to show an ID to cast a ballot, with some mandating it be a photo ID, while others allow additional options, such as a bank statement.   Democrats and voting rights advocates say the new SAVE Act is even worse than the prior iteration, and that the legislation's two main identification requirements would make voting notably more difficult for tens of millions of Americans who don't have easy access to necessary personal documentation. About half of Americans didn't have a passport as of 2023, for instance.   \n   The measure's provisions would take effect immediately, a prospect that opponents see as placing an unfair burden on voters and election officials right before millions are set to cast midterm ballots, and without extra funding. Those election officials would also face criminal penalties, including imprisonment, for registering voters without proof of citizenship.   The bill's prospects appear slim in the Senate, even as Trump and members of his administration ramp up public messaging in favor of the overhaul — often by pointing to polling that shows 8 in 10 Americans support the proof-of-citizenship and photo ID provisions.   \n   Trump tried to overturn his 2020 election loss and has long railed baselessly about corrupt elections, and many of the president's opponents see the push for the SAVE bill as intertwined with his efforts to raise doubts about voting and interfere with this year's midterms.   Michael Waldman, head of the Brennan Center of Justice, which advocates for expanded voting access, described the measure as \"Trump's power grab in legislative garb.\"   Trump raised alarms by suggesting recently that Republicans should \"nationalize\" elections, and last week he teased a new executive order, writing on social media: \"There will be Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!\"   The U.S. Constitution grants states and Congress control over election rules, and a 2025 executive order from Trump, which sought to require proof of citizenship for voter registration, has been halted by federal judges who say the order's provisions exceed a president's authority.   Here are four new items in the new SAVE Act:   1. The photo ID provision only lists valid U.S. passports, driver's licenses, state IDs, military IDs and tribal IDs as acceptable. Voters who do not present one must vote provisionally and return in three days with an ID, or sign an affidavit that says they have \"a religious objection to being photographed.\"    \n   Notably, people who don't vote in person must also submit a copy of a valid photo ID.   2. The legislation includes new guidelines for name discrepancies in proof-of-citizenship documents. That includes, per the bill, \"an affidavit signed by the applicant attesting that the name on the documentation is a previous name of the applicant.\"    This nods at one criticism of the measure, which is that tens of millions of women changed their name after getting married, and so their current names don't match their birth certificate.   3. The measure provides exemptions for absent service members and their families.   \n   4. The bill requires each state to submit its voter list to the Department of Homeland Security for comparison with the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) system.   The Trump administration has overhauled SAVE, turning it into a de facto national citizenship system. Despite privacy and data accuracy concerns, a number of states have eagerly used the new SAVE tool to try to identify and remove noncitizens on their voter rolls. But SAVE has erroneously flagged U.S. citizens too.\n",

Trump created the group to oversee his ceasefire plan in Gaza, and announced Thursday that member states have pledged $7 billion for reconstruction in Gaza. He also said the U.S. would contribute $10 billion to the Board of Peace.   Representatives of more than 40 countries gathered at the U.S. Institute of Peace — a building that now bears Trump's name. In opening remarks, Trump credited his Secretary of State Marco Rubio for taking over the building.   The Board of Peace is chaired by Trump and the group was formally established last month.   \n   Trump addressed a room full of heads of state and top diplomats. The meeting included dignitaries from countries including Argentina, Hungary, India, Pakistan and Vietnam. Meanwhile, other countries such as the United Kingdom, which have not joined the board out of concerns that Russia could be part of this new group, sent observers to the meeting.   Israel and Arab states are part of this board and they too had representatives at the meeting. There is no Palestinian representative on the board.   \"This is the most prestigious board ever put together. You know, I've seen some great corporate boards. I've seen some great boards, period. It's peanuts compared to this board,\" Trump told the assembled dignitaries.   Some fear Trump's new organization could be used to undermine the United Nations. On Wednesday, a U.N. Security Council meeting on Gaza was moved up in order to accommodate diplomats being able to attend both meetings.   Trump acknowledged the possibility of a broader future role for the panel in his remarks Thursday.   \"Someday I won't be here, the United Nations will be, I think, is going to be much stronger. The Board of Peace is going to almost be looking over the United Nations and making sure it runs properly,\" Trump said, adding that they will be working \"very closely\" with the U.N.   \n   \"But we're going to strengthen up the United Nations. We're going to make sure it's facilities are good. They need help, and they need help money wise. We're going to help them money wise. And we're going to make sure the United Nations is viable, and you have some very good people that the United Nations can do a good job,\" he said.   The Board of Peace meeting was convened as the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza that Trump pushed through last October remains fragile. Palestinian health officials say more than 600 people in Gaza have been killed in Israeli attacks since the ceasefire began, and the next steps of the plan are still unclear.   Trump acknowledged the attacks but said the war was effectively over.   \"There are little flames,\" he said, noting that his ceasefire had succeeded in returning dozens of Israeli hostages who had been held by Hamas and other militants inside Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas launched an attack on Israel that killed more than 1,100 people.   Gaza is split in two at present. Israeli forces occupy more than half of the tiny territory, and the population lives in dire conditions in a sliver along the sea, where Hamas governs. Reconstruction funds would not go to the area where Palestinians are currently living but to areas under Israeli military control.   \"Large parts of Gaza Strip are severely damaged, destroyed, actually, humanitarian needs are acute,\" Ali Shaath, the Palestinian who has been tapped to lead a committee of technocrats to administer Gaza under Board of Peace auspices, told the meeting.    A crucial part of the next phase of Trump's ceasefire plan will be the deployment of thousands of international troops to Gaza. This International Stabilization Force would not police the streets of Gaza, but would be more of a buffer between Israel and Hamas. Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country, is among a handful of nations so far planning to send troops.   \n   The U.S. Army officer appointed to command the International Stabilization Force, Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers, said the deployment would have 20,000 soldiers and 12,000 police officers.   Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian diplomat and former U.N. Middle East envoy who is the newly appointed director-general for the Board of Peace in Gaza, has started to recruit Palestinian police officers for the territory and told the meeting that 2,000 people so far \"have applied to join a new transitional Palestinian police force to be formed in Gaza.\"   The other key part of the Trump plan hinges on Hamas disarming. That is one of the demands by Israel, the U.S. and several Arab states, who don't want to pour money into Gaza without assurances Hamas no longer rules the territory, which they fear could lead to a resumption of the war.   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Hamas must not only give up heavy weapons like rockets and mortars but also small arms like Kalashnikov rifles, even though Israel is arming rival Palestinian militias that are fighting Hamas in Gaza.   And this week, Israel said Hamas has just 60 days to give up all its weapons or Israel would resume full-scale military operations, which would blow up Trump's ceasefire and resume a war that has left Gaza in ruins and killed more than 75,000 people, according to a report by the Lancet, the peer-reviewed medical journal.   Amid Thursday's talk of peace in Washington, the Middle East is bracing for a possible new war with Iran. President Trump said the Gaza ceasefire wouldn't have happened without the U.S. and Israel bombing Iran's nuclear sites last year.   \"So now we may have to take it a step further,\" he said. \"Or we may not. Maybe we are going to make a deal. You are going to be finding out probably over the next 10 days.\"\n",

You're reading the Up First newsletter. Subscribe here to get it delivered to your inbox, and listen to the Up First podcast for all the news you need to start your day.   Today's top stories   President Trump convenes the first-ever meeting of the Board of Peace today at the Donald J. Trump U.S. Institute for Peace in Washington. The president says he created the group to oversee his Gaza ceasefire plan and that member states have already pledged $5 billion for Gaza's reconstruction. At today's event, Trump will address heads of state and top diplomats from around 40 countries, including the European Union.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                People snap photos outside the United States Peace Institute, with the recently added name of President Trump.\n                \n                    Allison Robbert/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Allison Robbert/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Today's meeting is significant because the next steps in the ceasefire deal that Trump pushed through last October remain unclear, NPR's Aya Batrawy tells Up First. Additionally, officials could unveil which countries made the initial pledges for reconstruction efforts. The $5 billion commitment is only a fraction of what Gaza needs. The money would go toward the Trump administration's vision for a new Gaza under Israeli control and not to the area where Palestinians are living, Batrawy says. Currently, Israeli forces occupy over half of Gaza, leaving some 2 million Palestinians in dire conditions in a sliver by the sea that Hamas governs. Among the topics that nations could discuss today is a crucial step in Trump's ceasefire plan, which involves the deployment of thousands of international troops into Gaza.   \n   U.K. police have arrested a man in his 60s on suspicion of \"misconduct in public office.\" U.K. media reports that this man is Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew. Police have investigated whether Mountbatten-Windsor shared confidential government information with his late friend, convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, while he was U.K.'s trade envoy. Mountbatten-Windsor admits to ties to Epstein and settled a lawsuit with one of Epstein's underage victims, but denies wrongdoing. The media spotted several vehicles at the royals' Sandringham estate this morning, NPR's Lauren Frayer, who is in London, confirms. Mountbatten-Windsor turns 66 today. He has been living at the estate since being evicted from his royal cottage on the grounds of Windsor Castle.   The U.S. has concluded another round of talks in an effort to end the war in Ukraine. While the White House pressures Kyiv to make concessions, it is negotiating with Moscow. Today, Russia's negotiator offered $14 trillion in deals if the U.S. drops its sanctions.    🎧 Russia is tempting the White House with huge potential profits because the Kremlin knows the Trump administration views diplomacy through a business lens, NPR's Charles Maynes says. Moscow suggests that lifting sanctions and achieving \"peace\" would unlock American investment in rare earth minerals, energy, and mining. Russia continues to insist its victory in Ukraine is inevitable, despite the glacial pace of its gains and heavy battlefield losses. Russia's talking points are designed to convince Trump that Ukraine's surrender serves everyone's interests. Ukraine continues to refuse demands to surrender territory.   \n   Trump is demanding billions of dollars from his own government by filing multiple claims against the Justice Department. He argues that past investigations and the leak of his tax returns years ago hurt him. Now, he has forced his own political appointees to decide whether to pay their boss with taxpayer funds. These claims amount to unfinished business for the president, says a White House official, who was not authorized to speak on the record.

The action prompted outcry over the racist trope. The White House deleted the post, and Trump deflected the blame to an aide. Scholars and civil rights advocates, steeped in the language and aesthetics of white nationalism, find the post to be part of an overtly racist trope. They say it fits a year-long pattern where extremist rhetoric, visual material and other media have found their way into public messaging from federal agencies.    ➡️ The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is behind the most notable examples of extremist themes in federal messages, some extremist researchers say. The agency has generated a body of propaganda in its effort to recruit large numbers of new federal agents.➡️ Researchers cite the characterization of immigration as an \"invasion,\" federal calls to \"defend the homeland\" and the promotion of \"remigration\" as examples where the administration has mainstreamed once-fringe concepts.➡️ The Trump administration dismissed connections between its messages and white nationalist movements. A DHS spokesperson suggested NPR is \"manufacturing outrage\" when responding to questions about the connections.

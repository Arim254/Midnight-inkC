Mississippi is one of those states, and in June, its top election official asked the court to hear a lawsuit filed by the Republican National Committee that argues the state's five-day mail ballot grace period violates federal law.   An appeals court sided with the RNC. The ruling, which came while voters were casting ballots in last year's presidential election, did not go into effect immediately.   \n   Sixteen states plus Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Washington, D.C., currently accept and count mail-in ballots that are received after Election Day — typically, only if those ballots are postmarked on or before Election Day. More states have grace periods like that just for military and overseas voters.   \n   States provide this wiggle room to voters in case they forget to return their mail ballots ahead of time, if there are issues with the postal service, or if there are other unforeseen issues like bad weather and natural disasters.   The GOP has argued that Congress alone — not states — has the right to decide when elections end, and that Congress established a uniform Election Day.   The RNC filed multiple legal challenges to various state grace period laws ahead of the 2024 election, including in the swing state of Nevada. Since then, GOP-led states including Utah have eliminated their mail ballot grace periods, and President Trump has sought to end them nationally via executive order.   During the 2024 election, hundreds of thousands of mail ballots were counted that were received by officials after Election Day. In Washington state, for instance, where the vast majority of voters cast mail ballots, officials reported that \"more than 250,000 Washington ballots postmarked on time arrived after Election Day.\"   \n   Joyce Vance, a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law, told NPR last year that Republicans are \"trying to set up a possible rule for the future where only ballots that are cast and counted on Election Day count,\" which she said made more sense for voting patterns a hundred years ago.   \"It doesn't reflect the modern reality where we have early voting days and have mail-in voting days precisely to accommodate the fact that not everybody can get away during normal business hours on a Tuesday to vote,\" she said.   \n   The Mississippi case becomes the third related to voting taken up by the Supreme Court this term.   Justices are considering another mail-ballot case that centers on whether candidates have standing to sue over voting regulations, and a high-profile challenge to the Voting Rights Act.\n",

Most congressional Democrats were against the deal that eight of the senators, who caucus with them, crossed the aisle to vote and reopen the government.   Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren called the move a \"terrible mistake\"; Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said it was indefensible; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, declared it a \"policy and political disaster.\"   And there were far harsher things said about the deal on social media across the political spectrum of people left of center, not just the most progressive.   \n   Make no mistake: bridging the divide is going to be a significant challenge. But despite the intense blowback, the result in the end might not be all that bad for Democrats in next year's midterm elections.   Consider that affordability was the dominant issue in the off-year elections, where Democrats won sweeping victories. If it's the most important issue next year — and it very likely will be — then Democrats will likely retain the advantage.   What's more, if Republicans do vote against health care subsidy extensions in December — when a promised vote is to take place as part of this shutdown deal — then the GOP will fully own the increased health care costs that come with it.   Democrats could also look like the adults who took the high road, recognizing the very real pain that a lot of people were beginning to feel when President Trump and his administration were beginning to turn the screws on the most vulnerable.   So, Democrats' biggest challenge heading into next year's midterms may be keeping progressives on their side — and fired up to vote — after what many of them are viewing as the latest show of weakness from a party, as they see it, defined by that weakness.   \n   A Democratic vise   Democrats put themselves in a very difficult position from the very beginning of this fight. Any acute observer could have seen this coming — and realize Democrats had nothing but bad options.   Republicans dug in, figuring at least enough Democrats couldn't handle the pain of millions losing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits as well as federal worker furloughs and layoffs.   And they were right.   \"Most of us up here have voted repeatedly with the Democratic strategy,\" Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said. \"But after 40 days, it wasn't going to work.\"   It's hard to \"win\" a fight when one side broadly cares about whether the government is open and working properly and the other thinks government is the problem.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                This combination photo of eight senators who are facing criticism from the Democratic Party for their deal to end the government shutdown shows Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., top row from left, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., and bottom row from left, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H.\n                \n                    AP/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        AP/AP\n    \n\n   \n   For Kaine and the seven others who crossed over to join most Republicans in voting to end the shutdown, a commitment to hold a vote to extend health care subsidies, combined with the protections for federal workers and SNAP benefits, was enough.   \"I don't think much of anything has been accomplished for the last 40 days except a lot of chaos and a lot of upheaval,\" said Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who voted repeatedly to end the shutdown.   Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with the Democrats, is one of the three Democrats who has also been voting to end the shutdown, said bluntly: \"It wasn't working. It's been six weeks. Republicans made it clear they weren't going to discuss the health care issue, Affordable Care Act tax credits, until the shutdown was over.\"   \"Waiting another week, or another month, wouldn't deliver a better outcome,\" New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said. \"It would only mean more harm for families in New Hampshire and all across the country.\"   Not everyone agrees with that reasoning, including swing-state Sen. Elissa Slotkin from Michigan.   \n   \"I always said it's got to do something concrete on health care,\" she said of an agreement to reopen the government. \"And it's hard to see how that happened.\"   Leadership problems   Democratic leaders also were ostensibly against the deal to reopen the government.   Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer voted no, though there are questions about whether Schumer allowed the senators, who went ahead with the votes, to do so.   None of the senators who came out in favor of the shutdown deal are in imminent political jeopardy, given they're not facing reelection next year, and two of them are retiring.   \n   \"The overwhelming majority of Senate Democrats, led by Leader Schumer, are opposing this bill in the Senate,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Monday.   He pointed out that the Trump administration's actions when it comes to federal workers leaves most Democrats \"deeply skeptical\" of their \"intentions.\" And on health care, Republicans, he noted, have not acted in \"good faith,\" given that it's the party that tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act dozens of times.   \"It doesn't change the core problem here,\" Jeffries said of the shutdown deal. \"We need to decisively address the Republican health care crisis on behalf of working-class Americans, everyday Americans and middle-class Americans.\"   But Schumer already faced significant pushback when he abandoned the fight in March and voted to keep the government open. And given the party's movement toward ousting older leaders, the shutdown deal could spell trouble for the 74-year-old New Yorker as a party leader, even if he didn't vote for it.   A changing party — from pragmatism to pugilism in the age of Trump   Schumer is certainly not representative of how the Democratic Party is changing. And the moderates, who signed onto this deal, also very much represent the old guard of the party.   \n   For as much that's made of how much the GOP has changed since Trump came into office — and it has been a lot — the Democrats have changed as well.   Democrats have moved from pragmatism to pugilism. As an example of that, in April of 2017, just after Trump began his first term, an NBC poll found that 6-in-10 Democrats favored making compromises with Trump to gain consensus on legislation.   But that has completely flipped. As of March of this year, the last time there was a threat of a shutdown, two-thirds of Democrats said they think Democrats in Congress should instead stick to their positions even if this means not getting things done in Washington.   Not every progressive sees what happened as a total disaster for the left. Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo, who is generally a pretty pragmatic progressive, sees a silver lining. He described the deal as \"embarrassing,\" but sees progress for the left:   “[T]here’s a difference between the deal itself and where the deal leaves Democrats and the broader anti-Trump opposition. This deal shows us that Democrats still don’t have the caucus they need for this fight that will be going on at least through this decade. But the shutdown also accomplished a lot. And not withstanding the WTF fumble at the 10-yard line, it’s still a dramatically different caucus than we had in March. … Democratic voters need to keep demanding more, keep up the pressure and keep purging the Senate caucus of senators who are not up to the new reality.”   He also points out that if this deal goes through, there will be another funding deadline at the end of January. At that point, if Democrats don't extract health care extensions or anything else of consequence, there will be another opportunity for leverage.   \n   Over the next year, there will also likely be primaries from the left and expect the shutdown positioning to be a litmus test for those primaries — and for 2028.   In the meantime, Democratic officials are banking on voters having a short-term memory, that with time, progressives will take a victory in the progress they've made in moving the party to a more fighting stance — and the issue landscape will propel them to winning next year.   And winning cures a lot of divisions.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Ailsa Chang talks with Republican strategist Mike Ricci about the deal to end the government shutdown.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  The Senate has voted to fund the government through January. Late last night, a handful of Senate Democrats broke with their party and sided with Republicans. For more, we're going to turn now to Republican strategist Mike Ricci. He has worked with several congressional Republicans, including former speakers John Boehner and Paul Ryan, and Ricci was on the Hill for government shutdowns in 2013 and 2018 going into 2019. I spoke with him before the Senate vote today.CHANG: OK, so we love to say government shutdowns feel like a movie that just keeps on...MIKE RICCI: (Laughter).CHANG: ...Replaying. Has this shutdown felt any different to you?RICCI: Well, to your point, you know, you go into these trying to have a sense of how they'll end. And your job is to kind of know kind of how to get to the ending, the denouement, if you will. And this shutdown, there just never was a sense of, you know, how are they going to land this plane? How are they going to stick this landing?CHANG: Yeah.RICCI: And, you know, instead, we got kind of this underwhelming, you know, exit last night and tonight. They're kind of rushing out of there. So it's hard to believe that after such a long ordeal that it's happening so abruptly.CHANG: I was going to ask you what you thought of the deal. You find it totally underwhelming?RICCI: Well, I think, again, you know, perception is destiny for these leaders. And so you want to - if you're going to go into a big fight like this, you want to have a sense of - you know, there's a lot of showmanship involved, and you want to sell the deal. And you want to - you know, you can win by losing and saying, look, we got more than we thought we could, than Republicans thought we could. And, you know, instead, it was kind of a handful of Senate Democrats, nobody in leadership really, at a press conference last night instead of, you know, leadership's Chuck Schumer, especially, kind of dictating the pace of things. And again, it's just very much underwhelming after such a long ordeal.CHANG: Yeah. Well, let's talk about blame because this shutdown...RICCI: Sure.CHANG: ...It's another example of how both parties blame each other for some problem.RICCI: Yeah.CHANG: Who do you see getting the blame here? - because, yes, Republicans are in control of Congress, but, you know, here's a small faction of Democrats breaking away from their leaders to make this deal. Who do you think is going to be held responsible for the last several weeks?RICCI: Well, I think I'm going to punt a bit and say that we're kind of in a runoff, if you will, here to see what happens in the next 30 days or so with the health care subsidies. And if Democrats can figure out - 'cause they said they would get a vote on these subsidies. And so if everything is about the cost of living now, as we saw in last week's elections, and you can frame the next 30 days around health care and around the cost of living going into the holidays, then Democrats have a chance to shift the blame back to President Trump and Republicans.But if this becomes about the division among Democrats that we're seeing play out on social media once again, as we have time and again, then, you know, Democrats will miss an opportunity here to really keep Republicans on the defensive. So, you know, I think there's going to be a bit of an overtime period here, if you will, to really see how it lands. And, you know, obviously, we didn't see the worst of it with SNAP benefits or even with, you know, air travel.CHANG: Yeah...RICCI: But...CHANG: ...With Thanksgiving coming up.RICCI: ...You know, that probably would have been where the blame really would have set in, but perhaps they've cut that off here at the pass.CHANG: Well, I'm asking about blame because blame obviously most matters when there's an election. How much do you...RICCI: Yeah.CHANG: ...Think voters will remember this fight a year from now when they're voting in the midterms?RICCI: Very little.CHANG: (Laughter).RICCI: I was part of the shutdown in October 2013, and I thought it was going to be the end of everything. And we won the next election 13 months later. You know, we could - if you - if I - you know, you could point out things that happened two, three months ago that you forgot almost happened. So I think very little, but it does affect the dynamics of how these parties, you know, get together, how they have a coherent message for the midterms. You know, a lot of Democrats are going to be having conversations in the next few days of whether Chuck Schumer should still be, you know, one of their leaders, and that obviously takes away time and energy from...CHANG: Yeah.RICCI: ...Fighting in the election.CHANG: Well, last question for you. I mean, obviously, we're seeing fault lines among Democrats, at least in the Senate. What kind of tensions are you seeing among Republicans right now?RICCI: So, you know, Speaker Mike Johnson took the extraordinary step of keeping the House away now for, I think, almost 50 days, and bringing them back, that'll be a bit of a - there'll be a bit of venting and a bit of decompression there. And we'll see how much Republicans resented that and how much, you know, they're able to get back together on the same page. Again, Democrats kind of fighting with each other probably convinces them that they got a good win here, and maybe that's a way to move past last week's elections. But those first 24, 48 hours when the House comes back, you're going to want to watch closely what members are saying and how much theatrics there are towards the speaker there.CHANG: That is Republican strategist Mike Ricci. Thank you very much.RICCI: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Steve Inskeep speaks with Democratic Congressman Seth Moulton of Massachusetts about divisions within his party over the shutdown deal in the Senate.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Massachusetts Representative Seth Moulton is among the House Democrats who are criticizing the Senate deal, and he's on the line. Congressman, good morning.SETH MOULTON: Good morning.INSKEEP: Here's an argument, listening to Domenico, that you could make in favor of reopening the government now. You made your point. You raised your issue. You don't have the power to prevail on the issue right now, but you made it clear who's blocking you and now you move on. What's wrong with that thinking?MOULTON: Why would you give up now? I mean, this is actually when the Republicans seem to be starting to give in. You have Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of the most extreme Republicans in history, saying that she can't afford health care for her own family. And so the Democrats are right, and Republicans should give in. Just after the Democratic sweep in last Tuesday's elections, you had Trump come out and say the shutdown is a real problem. You need to come bring this to an end. So why you would give up now and put Americans in a position where they're not going to be able to afford health care in a few months? I just don't know. We're the only folks standing between Donald Trump and the American people.INSKEEP: There was, of course, an opposite position expressed by John Fetterman of Pennsylvania. He's one of the Democrats who voted to reopen the government. And he spoke with our colleague, Scott Detrow, on All Things Considered yesterday. Let's listen to that.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)/NPR CLIPJOHN FETTERMAN: I absolutely support extending those tax credits. But for me, the kinds of chaos and holding our government hostage is unacceptable. And you can have priorities, but it's wrong to go shutting our government down.INSKEEP: Do you think that another week or another month would have made a difference?MOULTON: I think it would've. I think the administration was feeling the pressure, especially going into the Thanksgiving holiday. They didn't want chaos over Thanksgiving. They didn't want people unable to get home for Thanksgiving. This was just the wrong time to give in. You don't capitulate at the moment where you think that the other side is actually coming around. With all due respect to Senator Fetterman, I mean, he sounds like he's using Trump's talking points here. And that's what we don't need. We don't need people who are giving in to Donald Trump. We need people who are fighting for him on behalf of - fighting him on behalf of the American.INSKEEP: Well, that raises another interesting question because as some people will know, Congressman, you're running for U.S. Senate from Massachusetts. You're in the Democratic primary. If you were to win, would you be voting for the Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer to remain the Democratic leader?MOULTON: No, I will not. I think there's a leadership vacuum in the Democratic Party right now, and it's time for a new generation of Democrats to step up. And that's the message I'm running on in Massachusetts, and it's the message that we need to hear across the country. The two brightest spots for Democrats in the past week were Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey, representing a new generation of leadership and now taking over entire states. That's what Democrats are excited about right now. We're frustrated, frankly, with the status quo, with the same old playbook that Schumer and others are using that's led us to a second term of Donald Trump, where he's hurting a lot of people.INSKEEP: I'm intrigued by your analysis of last week's elections because you mentioned the Democrats who won the governors' races in Virginia and New Jersey, who are considered a bit more pragmatic. You did not mention Zohran Mamdani, the democratic socialist on the Democratic ticket who won the mayoralty of New York. Where does he fit into your analysis of the direction of the party?MOULTON: He's also young. He also represents a new generation of leaders. I mean, that's the point. The people who are winning right now are a new generation who's stepping up to make a difference for this country. And that's what we need right now. The status quo has not worked. And people right now who are just protecting the establishment, they're not getting it done for the Democratic Party.INSKEEP: Are you getting close - and I don't mean in terms of policies, but in terms of attitude - getting close to the place that House Republicans have been for a number of years, that they would almost rather burn things down than sustain things, that they don't feel there's really very much value in the system as it stands?MOULTON: Listen, the point is that Donald Trump is trying to tear apart this country. He's trying to burn things down. So this is not a time to give in to him. This is the time to stand up to Donald Trump. And we have very few moments where we can actually do this. But the two biggest moments in the last year, the shutdown in March and the shutdown right here, in both cases, Senator Schumer has given in.INSKEEP: Any chance you might still get what you want here? By which I mean this has passed the Senate. It goes to the House. Democrats seem united against it or nearly united against it, and maybe Republicans will not muster the votes to pass it.MOULTON: Well, we don't know. It'll be a close vote in the House. The Democratic House Caucus is quite united against this deal. And there are a lot of Democrats across the country who do not agree with these Senate Republicans who gave in and do not understand why Senator Schumer, who's supposed to lead Senate Republicans - sorry, Senate Democrats, allowed them to do that.INSKEEP: Democratic Congressman Seth Moulton of Massachusetts. It's a pleasure talking with you. Thank you so much.MOULTON: Always good to talk to you, Steve.INSKEEP: And we'll note that as always, we invite multiple Republicans as well as Democrats on the program to discuss the shutdown. We'll keep reaching out to them.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Today's top story   The U.S. Senate voted 60 to 40 last night to approve a continuing resolution to reopen the government. Speaker Mike Johnson called the House of Representatives back to Washington, D.C., as they will have to pass the measure before President Trump can sign it into law.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The U.S. House of Representatives is seen on the 40th day of a government shutdown on Nov. 9, 2025, in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 In addition to voting on the temporary funding measure, lawmakers voted on three bipartisan annual appropriations bills that cover specific agencies like the FDA, NPR's Sam Gringlas tells Up First. Moving forward with these measures means there is a chance of a partial government shutdown at the end of January, but programs like SNAP, would continue. A provision to extend expiring health care subsidies was not included in the measure, but Senate Majority Leader John Thune says he will hold a vote by mid-December. In the legislation for the subsidies, Democrats who are in favor of them will need something that can win enough Republican votes.🎧 Seven Senate Democrats and one independent joined Republicans in voting to reopen the government, a move drawing backlash from voters on the left who say the party keeps caving on key priorities. NPR's Domenico Montanaro notes Democrats may have an advantage heading into next year's midterms if affordability and the cost of living remain top concerns.   \n   Delegates from nearly 200 countries have begun climate negotiations at the COP30 in Brazil. As with previous summits, the negotiations begin on a weak note as countries are still not meeting their goals to cut heat-trapping emissions from burning fossil fuels.    🎧 The world is on track for five degrees Fahrenheit of warming currently, NPR's Lauren Sommer reports, which could lead to heatwaves and storms becoming more intense, as well as ecosystems like coral reefs having a low chance of survival. But there's good news: over 90% of new power projects built last year were renewable showing electricity is becoming cleaner globally.➡️ Stay up-to-date with the latest news from the COP30 with this app-exclusive playlist of stories.   Some white Afrikaners and Afrikaans groups are now pushing back against the U.S. administration's claims, labeling them as \"lies\" and \"falsehoods\" made in their name. The backlash follows Trump's announcement that no U.S. officials will attend the G20 Summit, which South Africa is hosting as the current rotating chair of the group of major world economies, later this month in Johannesburg, citing \"human rights\" concerns.

But some nutritionists say not all of them are unhealthy.\n                \n                    ruzanna/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        ruzanna/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Living Better is a special series about what it takes to stay healthy in America.   In recent years, efforts to improve Americans' health have focused on reducing the consumption of ultra-processed foods, which comprise the majority of Americans' diets. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said these foods are \"poisoning\" Americans. But public health and nutrition experts still don't agree on a definition of ultra-processed foods:    \n   🍟 The term describes how much processing foods undergo, from unprocessed or minimally processed to those with manufactured ingredients and additives.🍟 Some experts argue that certain ultra-processed foods, such as plant-based milks, can be beneficial for health.🍟 For many, they are also more affordable and accessible. However, consumers seeking healthier options can aim to make more informed decisions within the ultra-processed category and reduce their sugar intake.   Behind the story   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                NPR's Quil Lawrence interviewing Dave Carlson.\n                \n                    Caroline Yang for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Caroline Yang for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   This essay was written by Quil Lawrence, NPR's veterans correspondent     It's Veterans Day today and NPR is the only mainstream national network with a dedicated veterans reporter. This week, Quil Lawrence released a two-part podcast on The Sunday Story from Up First, which follows the story of Dave Carlson, an Iraq war veteran who he has been talking to for over a decade.   Back in 2015, I was doing a story that led me to talk to some veterans who were incarcerated. That's when someone told me a surprising fact: when you get incarcerated, you become a ward of the state. Meaning, it doesn't make sense for the Department of Veterans Affairs to be taking care of you, because a different part of the government is taking care of you. And you lose a lot of your veteran's benefits.   I wanted to know: what's it like to have combat PTSD and then be thrown into this environment where you can't let your guard down, where you can't really heal, and where you don't have access to services that could help? So I was looking for an incarcerated veteran to interview. And that's when I found a website featuring Carlson's writing from prison. His mom had set it up for him and she helped me get in touch.   There's this question that's been nagging me ever since I was a war reporter embedded with active duty troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Those were the first major set of wars we've had without a military draft, which means a lot of American families weren't forced to endure the experience of fighting or sending loved ones to fight these wars. That can make veterans kind of feel this loneliness and this cultural divide.   \n   I wanted to know: What do we owe the people who were sent to war and came back with painful but often invisible wounds? I don't know that I've fully found the answer, but this podcast helped me process that question through Carlson's story. Ultimately, I think what we owe veterans mostly is an open mind. And remembering that most vets are just like you and me.

The measure would fund much of the government through Jan. 30 and provide funding for some agencies through the end of next September.   But the shutdown will not end right away. The U.S. House of Representatives must also pass the legislation, which is not guaranteed, before President Trump can sign it into law.   House leadership has told members to return to Washington for a vote as early as Wednesday afternoon.   Seven Democrats and one independent senator voted with nearly every Senate Republican to approve the stopgap funding bill after a more than monthlong impasse that resulted in missed paychecks for millions of federal workers, delayed food assistance benefits and air travel disruptions.   \n   Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was the sole GOP no vote.    \n   The funding package includes language to reverse reductions in force of federal employees by the Trump administration during the shutdown, protections against further layoffs through the end of January, backpay for federal employees and a trio of appropriations bills, including one that will fully fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, through Sept. 30, 2026.   \"This is a great victory for the American people, and it shows that the Senate can work,\" said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Me.   A deal without Democrats' health care demands   But the deal does not include an extension of subsidies for Affordable Care Act health insurance premiums that are set to expire later this year. Most Democrats have refused to vote for a funding measure that did not include a concrete path to preserve the subsidies.   Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Sunday that he would hold a vote by mid-December on a bill of Democrats' choosing to extend the expiring subsidies. Thune has said throughout the shutdown that Republicans would only negotiate on the subsidies once the government was open.   \"There was no guarantee that waiting would get us a better result, but there was a guarantee that waiting would impose suffering on more everyday people,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told NPR.   \n   But the majority of Senate Democrats disagreed that this was the best deal they could get, doubting that Republicans would agree to extend the subsidies without the pressure of an ongoing shutdown. After Democratic victories on election night last week, some senators said it was a mistake to back down.   \"A handshake deal with my Republican colleagues to reopen the government and no guarantee to actually lower costs is simply not good enough,\" Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., said on the floor before the vote. \"The people I work for need more than that. They need health care that they can afford, not a symbolic vote.\"   \n   Over the weekend, a bipartisan group of senators reached an agreement to end the shutdown after holding a series of on-again, off-again talks over the last several weeks. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who helped drive the bipartisan negotiations, told reporters Monday that more than eight members of the caucus had initially pledged to support the deal, but some backed out ahead of the vote.    On to the House   House leadership alerted members Monday morning that they would have 36 hours' notice to return to Capitol Hill for a vote. The House has not conducted official business since the chamber passed its version of a continuing resolution in mid-September. While Speaker Mike Johnson has held near-daily press conferences at the Capitol, many rank-and-file have not been in for weeks.   \"At the very moment that they do that final vote, I will call all House members to return as quickly as possible,\" Johnson told reporters Monday and, noting the ongoing shutdown-related air travel delays, told members, \"You need to begin right now returning to the Hill.\"   \n   Moving the measure through the House could require some arm-twisting. Many Democrats have indicated they will not support the deal, and some hard-line Republicans may not be inclined to vote for it either.   But Johnson projected confidence Monday that the measure can pass and said Trump is ready to sign it.   Coming health care debate   Democrats now need to come up with health care legislation that can get the support of enough Republicans. Some Republicans in the House and Senate have expressed interest in preventing the Affordable Care Act premiums from skyrocketing, but many have also talked about the need for reforms like income caps and fraud prevention.   A few weeks is not much time for an overhaul, and people are deciding now whether to keep their insurance plans next year.   \n   \"If we want to get a bill that has bipartisan support, we've got to address some of those issues,\" Shaheen told reporters on Monday. \"I think the White House is going to engage on this because the president has figured out, and his pollsters have been very clear, it's more of an issue for people in red states than it is in blue states. If he [doesn't], well, shame on him.\"     Speaker Johnson, though, told reporters on Monday that he would not guarantee an ACA vote in the House should a bill pass the Senate.   \n   The government funding situation is not fully resolved for the year, either. The full-year funding measures passed by the Senate include money for agriculture, military construction and veterans affairs and the legislative branch. Congress still needs to pass nine other appropriations bills before the continuing resolution runs out again at the end of January.    NPR's Barbara Sprunt and Deirdre Walsh contributed reporting.\n",

He spent the fall railing against the federal government shutdown and he, along with a few other Senate Democrats, broke from the party and struck a deal with Republicans.   \"It's always been wrong for us to shut the government down,\" he told NPR. \"Rightly, [Democrats] criticize the Republicans when they've shut the government down. It's wrong. It's reckless.\"   \n   In an interview with All Things Considered host Scott Detrow, Fetterman posed a question to his critics: \"What exactly am I guilty of?\"   \"I suffered from depression and I made a recovery and I won an election,\" he said. \"And I went on to be an unapologetic supporter of Israel. And I happen to think that we have to have a secure border and I think it's wrong to shut our government down.\"   Fetterman spoke with NPR in a conversation tied to his new memoir, Unfettered, about his 2022 Senate campaign that saw him suffer a stroke and fall into a deep depression.   A video of the interview will be available to watch later today. The interview text below has been edited for length and clarity.      Interview highlights   Scott Detrow: This is a book about an election cycle where you suffered a stroke and you struggled with serious depression.   Sen. John Fetterman: Profound depression. Honestly, I know millions of Americans suffer from it.   And when you hear the expression that you can't get out of your bed — that's true.   Detrow: Last time I interviewed you, you had just returned to the Senate from Walter Reed [National Military Medical Center]. It was a pretty emotional conversation. You were still processing your treatment and what came next.   \n   I wanted to ask a little bit about that because there's parts of this book where it seems like you're saying that you've, at times, regretted being so open about your mental health struggles. Is that accurate?   Fetterman: No. I don't regret it.   But people have been willing to use it or to create an impression that's just not true. And it's an honest conversation because a lot of people have had those things. And I've had a lot of people reach out to me over the years since and it's an honor to speak to people, to their experience, because sometimes people can feel alone.   \n   And I've always wanted to make that conversation as simple as it can to just stay in this game. Because I've had people in my life make the decision to leave. And that's not a fail, they didn't fail. But that's a decision that they can't come back [from]. And how heartbreaking that is and how sad that is.   Detrow: You're talking about suicide.   Fetterman: Yeah, absolutely.   It's not a weakness. And that's [I want to be] a voice saying, \"hey, look, that's a lie. I don't know what your recovery looks like, but as long as you stay in it, I promise you you will get better.\"   Detrow: I want to ask about Israel. You were very out front about [supporting Israel]. You never changed your tune. I'm wondering, as the Israeli attacks and bombing of Gaza continued, were there any points where you second guessed the place that you had staked yourself?   Fetterman: [Israel] had an opportunity to take out the Iranian nuclear facilities. I was the only Democrat that supported that. I was actually charging for those things. You know, that comes from Trump. Well, then I happen to agree with it. And now, can you imagine if they would have acquired a nuclear weapon there? And now what is behind this constant violence there? Is it Israel or it's because Iran funding these proxies like Hamas and Hezbollah doing these kinds of terrible things. And that war would have ended when you sent back all the hostages.   \n   Detrow: So, at no point in the conflict did the balance shift for you as you thought about this in the context of 69,000 Palestinians dead?   Fetterman: No one breaks down how many actual Hamas fighters or other people that were involved in that. So, we're not really sure.   The only time you see members in Hamas is when they're handing over funerals and rallying. Otherwise, they embed themselves in the civilians and they were forced to fight a war through an urban situation.   \n   Why can't people condemn putting tunnels under hospitals and embedding themselves in where civilians are? And you know, because they can't fight a real war. So, that's why they use civilians as human shields. And that's the tragedy.

    "body": "\n      The House could return as early as Wednesday to vote to reopen the government. But many Democrats say they will not support the deal, and some Republicans may not be inclined to vote for it either.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Congress is one step closer to ending the longest government shutdown in American history. The Senate approved a funding bill by a 60 to 40 vote.LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Speaker Mike Johnson called the House of Representatives back to Washington after more than a month off. The House would have to pass the measure, and President Trump would need to sign it. The federal government could open within days, although a debate over health insurance subsidies remains unresolved.INSKEEP: NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas is here. Sam, good morning.SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: Hey, Steve.INSKEEP: OK, so what exactly did the Senate pass?GRINGLAS: So some of this is very similar to what the Senate has been voting on for weeks now, a temporary funding measure to fund the government for just a few weeks, in this case, through January 30. But this time, lawmakers also included three bipartisan annual appropriations bills that cover specific agencies, like the Department of Agriculture and the FDA. So instead of a short-term extension, those areas will be funded now through next September.INSKEEP: OK, this is useful to know. This means the government could shut down again at the end of January but not the whole federal government.GRINGLAS: Yeah, it would be just a partial government shutdown. And SNAP benefits, for example, they would not be in danger of running out this time. The package also includes a measure to undo the firings of federal workers during the shutdown and ensures federal workers get back pay. Here's Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SUSAN COLLINS: This is a great victory for the American people. And it shows that the Senate can work, that we can produce the results that are needed.GRINGLAS: Now, I should note a key element that you will not find in the text of this measure, and that's an extension of expiring health care subsidies, which has been the crux of Democrats' shutdown fight. What Senate Republicans have promised is a vote on that in the future.INSKEEP: Oh, Republicans did promise the Democrats a vote, but they could've given them that vote a month ago. They were promising that vote a month ago. It doesn't sound like Democrats got anything near what they wanted.GRINGLAS: Yeah, Democrats really wanted something a lot more concrete. So in the end, all but seven Democrats and one independent who caucuses with them, they voted against this deal. Senate majority leader John Thune says he'll hold a vote by mid-December on separate legislation to address the subsidies, but what exactly Democrats put forward is an open question. They need something that can win enough Republican votes. And while some Republicans do talk about wanting to prevent premiums from skyrocketing, they also want reforms. And a few weeks is not a lot of time for an overhaul.INSKEEP: Well, even if a health care bill were to pass the Senate in that vote in December, what are the odds it gets a vote in the House and gets signed by the president?GRINGLAS: You know, this is exactly what many Democrats, like Wisconsin Senator Tammy Baldwin, are worried about.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TAMMY BALDWIN: A handshake deal with my Republican colleagues to reopen the government and no guarantee to actually lower cost is simply not good enough. The people I work for need more than that.GRINGLAS: House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters yesterday he could not guarantee a vote. And it's also unclear what Trump is willing to support.INSKEEP: OK, so we don't know what's going to happen with people who rely on Obamacare subsidies, Affordable Care Act subsidies, the extra subsidies, we should add. But people who rely on food assistance, who are traveling for Thanksgiving - we're thinking about the FAA and air traffic controllers - do they have relief?GRINGLAS: House members have been told to report to Washington for a vote Wednesday. After being out for weeks, Johnson may have his work cut out for him to get this shutdown-ending deal to the president. But he says it will get done. The dispute over health care, though, does remain unresolved, along with this contentious political debate about how this shutdown played out with the midterm elections just around the corner.INSKEEP: NPR's Sam Gringlas. Thanks so much.GRINGLAS: Thanks, Steve.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Leila Fadel asks Illinois Democrat Mike Quigley, who serves on the House Appropriations Committee, about his opposition to the Senate-brokered shutdown deal.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  The lack of a concrete deal on health care has many Democrats fuming. Illinois Congressman Mike Quigley is among them. He sits on the House Appropriations Committee, and he joins me now. Good morning, Congressman.MIKE QUIGLEY: Morning.FADEL: I want to start with why you're so angry at your colleagues in the Senate for voting for this deal.QUIGLEY: Sure. Twenty-two million Americans' health insurance premiums are going to be increasing, I don't know, 114% on the average, from about 888 to about $1906. The Senate deal completely abandons them. During this Trump administration, my constituents ask me, what are you doing? I tell them all I have is my voice and my vote. This is giving up my vote if I were to vote yes on this. I think that my office would be surrounded by crowds with torches if I voted yes on this. This is absolutely critical in terms of affordability and what's most important to the American people.FADEL: But then what is the answer? I mean, the Republicans have refused to budge. Do you just keep the government shut down forever?QUIGLEY: No. I think what we saw last Tuesday is some cracks in what the Republicans are doing. They were seeing that they weren't winning this, if anybody wins in a shutdown. I think even the president recognized that. And fundamentally, you've got to ask yourself, at what point do you draw the line? This is a president who has reneged on past deals that we've passed into law - spending deals. This is a president who's unilaterally pushed back on the power of the purse of the House and the Senate. So why would you trust them in the first place? Fool me once is probably the lesson of the day.FADEL: Now, I understand you're trying to get back to D.C. from Chicago for the vote. When do you expect to vote in the House, and are you and your colleagues going to be able to get back in town with everything going on at the airports?QUIGLEY: Yeah. I suspect that they'll probably figure this out and get these flights there, but I think most members would be smart to book multiple flights coming back today. We're hearing that the earliest the vote would be is around 4 o'clock Eastern time Wednesday. So we're trying to head back tonight. One way or another, we'll get there. It does remind me of COVID when we were going back to vote for emergency supplementals and there were no flights and people drove to D.C.FADEL: Now, I know you say you're going to vote against this bill. Another Senator, Dick Durbin from your home state of Illinois, is one of the eight senators who broke with the party and did vote for this bill. His explanation of why was that although he blames the president and Republicans for the shutdown, he, quote, \"cannot accept a strategy which wages political battle at the expense of my neighbor's paycheck or the food for his children,\" unquote. Now, Congressman, this bill does not extend health care subsidies, but it does fund SNAP food benefits through September of 2026. Nearly 2 million people in Illinois receive those benefits. Is this something your constituents needed or need?QUIGLEY: Absolutely. And I've been at the Chicago Food Depository programs, where we were dispensing the food, people waiting four hours for a single box. But we sound like characters from a Dickens novel. You know, can I have more, please? This is fundamental of what they should have had already. And to say, just to give you what the status quo is, you're going to have to sacrifice health care for millions of Americans. It's just not a deal you need to make, especially at a time when the Republicans seem to be cracking.FADEL: Given the vote and Democratic senators breaking with the leadership, do you have faith in the leadership of your party in this moment, specifically Senator Chuck Schumer?QUIGLEY: Yeah. I mean, look, I'll leave the senators to deal with their leadership. You know, my leader, Mr. Jeffries, has said that they're going to stand firm. I believe...FADEL: Is he whipping the vote against the bill?QUIGLEY: Yeah. I - he is, and I believe that the Democrats will stand pat. I think last time we only had one or two break from the party. I suspect that'll be the case tomorrow. I don't know what's happening on the Republican caucus. There's always a few who hold out until they get a call from the president, get a photo op and then they go back to their constituents and declare victory.FADEL: Do Republicans need you to pass the bill? We just have a few seconds.QUIGLEY: I think they'll get this bill passed, unfortunately, and we go through the status quo. And unfortunately, while people will be getting fed, they won't have health care.FADEL: That's Democratic Representative Mike Quigley of Illinois. Thank you for your time.QUIGLEY: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Now, two decades later, she's back with What to Eat Now, a revised field guide for the supermarket of 2025.   Nestle recommends what she called a \"triple duty\" diet aimed at preventing hunger, obesity and climate change: \"Eat real food, processed as little as possible, with a big emphasis on plants,\" she says.       Interview highlights   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        North Point Press\n    \n\n   \n   On how supermarkets are in the business of selling products, not providing nutrition    The more products you see, the more you're likely to buy. Therefore, the products that are organized so that you cannot miss them are in prime supermarket real estate. And companies pay the supermarkets to place their products at eye level, at the ends of aisles — those have a special name, end caps — and at the cash register. When you see products at the catch register, they're paying fees to the supermarket by the inch of space. And that's how supermarkets make a lot of their money, is through slotting fees. And, of course, what this does is it keeps small producers out, because they can't afford to make those kinds of payments. ... I mean, we're talking about thousands, or in some cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars. And every single product that is in a supermarket is placed where it is for a reason.   \n   On how dollar stores got into the food business   \n   They started out by selling the most popular ultra-processed foods. ... They're going to have chips. They're going to have sugar-sweetened cereals. They're going to have every junk food you could possibly think of. That's what they make their money off of. They will have a few fruits and vegetables, a few sad bananas, a few sad apples, maybe some pears, maybe some green vegetables, but not very many, and they'll be in a case off somewhere because they have to offer those. Because they're taking SNAP benefits, they're required to meet the stocking requirements of the SNAP program, which requires them to have a certain number of fruits and vegetables. … And [dollar stores are] just everywhere. And during the pandemic, particularly, they just proliferated like mad, and they undercut local stores. They're cheaper. They have poorer quality food, but the prices are lower. Price is an enormous issue.    \n   If you want a Trader Joe's or a Whole Foods or a Wegmans in your neighborhood, you've got to have hundreds of thousands of people within walking distance or quick driving distance who make very, very good incomes or the [people] aren't gonna go there. They're going to close the stores that are not performing well, meaning having lots and lots of people spending lots and lots of money at them. And so as the big grocery stores have closed in inner city neighborhoods, the dollar stores moved in.   On food waste in America   \n   Our food system in the United States produces 4,000 calories a day for every man, woman and little tiny baby in the country. That's roughly twice what the population needs on average. So waste is built into the system. Because that's how the subsidies work. The agricultural subsidies encourage food producers to produce as much food as possible because they get paid for the amount of food that they produce.    On initially agreeing with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \"Make America Healthy Again\" approach to the food industry   I was very hopeful when he was appointed, because he was talking about, let's get the toxins out of the food supply. Let's make America healthy again. Let's make America's kids healthy again. Let's do something about ultra-processed foods. Let's do something about mercury and fish. And a lot of other issues that I thought, \"Oh, how absolutely terrific that we're going to have somebody who cares about the same kind of issues I do. This is very exciting.\"    \n   When President Trump introduced his nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on social media, President Trump talked about the food industrial complex. I nearly fell off my chair! I thought, \"Here's the president sounding just like me. What's going on here?\" So then we had the first MAHA report, the first Make America Healthy Again report, which talked about a lot of these issues and put in an aspirational agenda. \"We're going to work on this, this and this\" — all of that sounded terrific. And then the second report came out and they had backed off on nearly all of the things that I thought were really critically important.   \n   On why she believes the food system needs a revolution   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Marion Nestle recommends a diet aimed at preventing hunger, obesity and climate change: \"Eat real food, processed as little as possible, with a big emphasis on plants.\"\n                \n                    Peter Menzel\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Peter Menzel\n    \n\n   \n   I think it would start with transforming our agricultural production system to one that was focused on food for people instead of animals and automobiles. We would need to change our electoral system so that we could elect officials who were interested in public health rather than corporate health. We would need to fix our economy so that Wall Street favors corporations who have social values and public health values as part of their corporate mission. Those are revolutionary concepts at this point because they seem so far from what is attainable. But I think if we don't work on that now, if we do not do what we can to advocate for a better food system, we won't get it. And it's only if we advocate for it that we have a chance of getting it. And you never know, sometimes you get lucky. …   I tell people that they can't do it on their own, that even the act of going into a grocery store and trying to make healthy choices means that you, as an individual, are up against an entire food system that is aimed at getting you to eat the most profitable foods possible, regardless of their effects on health and the environment. So you have to join organizations. You have to join with other people who are interested in the same issues and concerned about the same problems and get together with them to set some goals for what you'd like to do and then work towards those goals. Because if you don't do it, who will?   Therese Madden and Anna Bauman produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

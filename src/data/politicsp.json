It is another marker of the Trump administration's disruptive force throughout the media.   NPR alleges that CPB unlawfully yanked away a planned three-year contract worth $36 million in the face of intense pressure from the White House to sever ties with the radio network.   In a court hearing on Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Randolph Moss had indicated a deep skepticism of CPB's argument that it sharply reversed course this spring on the merits as NPR presented more evidence it sought to appease the administration. The most plausible explanation, Moss said, was that CPB was hoping to survive.   \n   The CPB is the nonprofit that funneled federal dollars to public media until this month, as Congress and the president acted this summer to halt all $1.1 billion in planned future subsidies. Only a skeleton crew remains at the corporation.   President Trump had been in the White House barely two months when he began attacking NPR and its TV counterpart PBS on social media as \"radical left MONSTERS.\" On May 1, he followed up with an executive order to stop all federal dollars from going to them. In response, NPR and three member stations in Colorado sued both the Trump administration and CPB, alleging their First Amendment rights were being violated.   The portion of the lawsuit headed to trial does not involve the subsidies, but a separate contract to provide satellite and distribution services for public radio stations. NPR has operated it for four decades under a series of contracts with CPB.   A rush to get a deal, then a change of heart   In late March, CPB had heard rumors of the possibility of an executive order against public media but were uncertain what form it would take.   With that in mind, on April 2, CPB's board authorized its officials to work out the fine print of a fresh contract with NPR.   \n   A top CPB official, Kathy Merritt called NPR's executive overseeing the satellite and distribution system and told him not to trip up the negotiations over minor matters, citing the urgency to get the money approved. (Merritt affirmed this account during a sworn deposition last week.)   The next day, at an in-person meeting, a top White House budget official told CPB's board chairperson and two senior executives of her \"intense dislike for NPR.\" Memoranda about the meeting reflect the White House official, Katie Sullivan, also said \"it would be a shame to throw the baby out with the bath water,\" according to legal documents NPR filed in court.   The day after that, on April 4, CPB's board reversed itself, deciding that the radio satellite and distribution system had to be operated by an entity separate from NPR. CPB asked NPR to come up with plans to spin off the division, court filings show; NPR declined but bid for the project nonetheless.   Behind the scenes, CPB's chairperson, Ruby Calvert, was \"adamant that she doesn't want funding to go to NPR,\" according to an April 12 email from Merritt to a colleague brought to light in the litigation.   \"Something has been fundamentally missing\"   On April 13, CPB's chief of staff, Debra Sanchez, wrote that she wasn't sure how to explain the requirement that it spin off its satellite and distribution system, called PRSS, court documents show. \"Something has been fundamentally missing for me ... and it's the 'because' statement,\" she wrote to colleagues. \"In particular, the 'local stations would be better served by having PRSS as an independent entity' which begs the question... because?\"   Newly hired Republican consultant Carl Forti advised CPB on key themes to embrace in dealing with the administration: \"CPB has taken proactive steps to rein in what it sees as bias at NPR and PBS,\" according to court filings.   \n   The consultant stated that CPB should stress it had \"already taken steps to address the administration's concerns\" including by \"[w]ithholding interconnection funds from NPR.\" The word \"interconnection\" is a shorthand for the satellite and distribution system.   Forti's memo also stated that CPB should note it had stopped a grant supporting NPR's international reporting and for newsroom support. CPB had subsidized a new senior editorial review team last year after allegations of bias led to criticism from Republicans on Capitol Hill.   Clayton Barsoum, CPB's chief lobbying executive, affirmed the memo in a note to Sanchez, writing, \"This looks good to me,\" court filings show.   CPB argues it is a bulwark against political pressure   In September, the corporation announced it was awarding a longer, bigger contract — $57 million over five years — to a new consortium that includes major public radio stations, a public radio distributor and an industry consulting firm. It said it was doing so to address long-standing concerns about NPR's performance.   CPB's attorney, Joseph D. Lipschitz, argued that the corporation has acted as a resolute bulwark for public media, including NPR, against political pressure. He noted that CPB had separately sued Trump over his attempt to fire corporation board members.   In his remarks, Moss cast doubt on the credibility of that defense, repeatedly questioning the quick-twitch decision to demand that NPR no longer run the distribution system after such a longstanding arrangement.   \"All of a sudden there was this change. And so what happened to cause this change?\" the judge asked. \"I have to say, the most plausible explanation for what's happening here, is that everything is not quite as linear as \"We're for or against it'.\"   \"CPB is understandably trying to survive,\" Moss said. \"There are a lot of materials that are in the record here that say there are a lot of strategies going on: 'What do we do? One thing we do is distance ourselves from NPR, because they don't like NPR'.\"   \n   In that April memo reproduced in court filings, CPB's consultant Forti came up with a message to convey senators whom Trump was urging to pull all funding for public media:   \"a. We understand the new world.   \"b. We are responsive to the new world.   \"c. We are trying to limit funds direct to NPR and PBS for biased content.\"   Barsoum had endorsed the memo. Yet CPB officials felt they could not make that case publicly, evidence presented by NPR in court shows.   Behind the scenes, CPB officials were asking Forti how they could best present their decision, without referring to the political firestorm around them. \"I don't think we are comfortable with the approach to publicly state we cut funding to NPR, so the bland statement might be where we land,\" Sanchez, the CPB chief of staff, wrote, according to materials filed in court.   Moss ordered a brief expedited trial on this portion of the litigation. He will assess it himself, instead of a jury, in what is called a bench trial. It is expected to last three to four days.

On the flight back to Washington, Trump told reporters traveling with him that he would rate the meeting with Xi \"on a scale from zero to 10, with 10 being the best, I would say the meeting was a 12.\"   \"It was an outstanding group of decisions I think that was made. A lot of decisions were made too, there wasn't too much left out there,\" Trump said.   \n   The decisions that were made included lowering tariffs on Chinese exports from 57% to 47% – which Trump said was because of Xi's commitment to decrease the flow of fentanyl.   \"I believe he's going to work very hard to stop the death that's coming in,\" Trump said.   China will also begin repurchasing soybeans from the U.S. The pause thus far has been detrimental to farmers.   Trump said China's decision from earlier this month to limit exports of rare earth minerals, which he called a \"roadblock,\" is now off the table for one year. As part of that agreement, the U.S. will also scale back some of its own export restrictions.   The White House has not yet released a full readout of the meeting or details on updates to the deal. Trump said he would visit China next April for another meeting with Xi, and Xi will visit the U.S. after that.   In response to the meeting, Beijing released its own statement, where Xi said China and the U.S. should not get \"caught in a vicious cycle of mutual retaliation.\"   The meeting took place in Busan before Trump left the region   Trump and Xi met at a South Korean military base in Busan right by the city's airport. The meeting began with a handshake before moving into a session with representatives from both countries.   \n   \"President Xi is a great leader of a great country, and I think we're going to have a fantastic relationship for a long period of time,\" Trump said at the top of the meeting, calling Xi a friend.   It's the first time Trump and Xi are meeting in person in six years. Xi noted in his remarks, through an interpreter, that the two have spoken on the phone three times and exchanged several letters since Trump was reelected last year.   Xi said to Trump it was \"normal\" that the U.S. and China have \"frictions\" in their relations from time to time but said amid challenges, \"You and I at the helm of China-U.S. relations should stay the right course.\"   \"China and the U.S. should be partners and friends. This is what history has taught us and what reality demands,\" Xi said.   Xi also said he appreciated Trump for his contributions to the ceasefire agreement in the Middle East, and said Trump cares \"a lot about world peace.\"   He also mentioned Trump's recent trip to Malaysia for the ASEAN summit, where Trump presided over a signing of a peace deal between Cambodia and Thailand. Trump has been adamant that China played no role in procuring the ceasefire, but Xi said that \"China's been helping our own way\" to end the border dispute there.   Not every topic was covered in the meeting   The two leaders discussed Russia's war in Ukraine, Trump said. China has been buying Russian oil but Trump said they didn't discuss that topic in depth.   Taiwan – an issue Trump has shied away from in recent days – also didn't come up, he said. China considers self-governing Taiwan a breakaway province and there have been signs from Trump that he might be willing to ease up support for the island.   \n   A deal on TikTok was also potentially a topic of discussion but Trump didn't mention it in his remarks to reporters after the meeting.   While flying on Air Force One back to Washington, Trump posted to his platform Truth Social that China also agreed to purchase American energy, and teased that the purchase would involve oil and gas from Alaska, though he didn't provide any further detail.   \"Chris Wright, Doug Burgum, and our respective Energy teams will be meeting to see if such an Energy Deal can be worked out,\" Trump said, referring to the secretary of energy and interior, respectively.\n",

He made the announcement on social media minutes before he met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday in South Korea. When he spoke to reporters later aboard Air Force One as he flew back to Washington, he offered little clarity.   The U.S. military already regularly tests its missiles that are capable of delivering a nuclear warhead, but it has not detonated the weapons since 1992 because of a test ban.   \n   But the president suggested that changes were necessary because other countries were testing weapons. It was unclear what he was referring to, but it evoked Cold War-era escalations.   \"Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,\" he said in a post on Truth Social. \"That process will begin immediately.\"   The White House did not immediately respond to questions seeking more details. Trump ignored a question from a reporter about his post as he sat face-to-face with Xi in Busan, a meeting that focused on trade issues between the two countries.   When he spoke to reporters later, Trump appeared to be conflating the testing of missiles that deliver a nuclear warhead with the testing of the warheads.   Other countries, he said, \"seem to all be nuclear testing\" but when it comes to the U.S., \"We have more nuclear weapons than anybody. We don't do testing.\"   \"I see them testing and I say, well, if they're going to test, I guess we have to test,\" Trump said as he continued speaking to reporters.   Trump was asked where the tests would occur and he said, \"It'll be announced. We have test sites.\"   \n   Pentagon officials didn't immediately respond to questions about the announcement from Trump on the nuclear missile tests.   Russian President Vladimir Putin this week announced that Russia tested a new atomic-powered and nuclear-capable underwater drone and a new nuclear-powered cruise missile. Putin did not announce any tests of Russia's nuclear weapons, however, which last occurred in 1990.   Trump did not specifically mention the Russian tests in his post, but alluded to the nuclear stockpiles controlled by both Xi and Putin, saying, \"Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.\"   Putin in 2023 signed a bill revoking Russia's ratification of a global nuclear test ban, which Moscow said was needed to put Russia on par with the U.S.   The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which was adopted in 1996 and bans all nuclear explosions anywhere in the world, was signed by President Bill Clinton but never ratified by the Senate.   Russia in 2023 said it would only resume tests of its nuclear weapons if Washington did it first.   Earlier this year, Trump signaled he wanted to push his Russian and Chinese counterparts in the other direction, saying he wanted to resume nuclear arms control talks with both countries.   A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson called on the U.S. to refrain from carrying out nuclear tests.   \"China hopes the U.S. will earnestly fulfill its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and honor its commitment to suspend nuclear testing,\" Guo Jiakun said at a briefing in Beijing.   Despite his announcement that sounded like an escalation, Trump told reporters that he would like to see a \"denuclearization and \"de-scalation.\"   \"We are actually talking to Russia about that,\" Trump said, though he did not elaborate.   Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association, quickly criticized the president's announcement and said Trump was \"misinformed and out of touch.\"   \n   Kimball, in social media posts, said the U.S. has no reason to resume nuclear explosive testing and it would take at least 36 months to resume testing at the former test site in Nevada, where the last detonations occurred underground.   \"By foolishly announcing his intention (to) resume nuclear testing, Trump will trigger strong public opposition in Nevada, from all U.S. allies, and it could trigger a chain reaction of nuclear testing by U.S. adversaries, and blow apart the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty,\" Kimball said in a post on X.   Japanese survivors of the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end World War II condemned Trump's announcement.   \"The act vehemently opposes all countries that are endeavoring to achieve a nuclear-free and peaceful world and absolutely cannot be tolerated,\" said Jiro Hamasumi, secretary general of Nihon Hidankyo, a survivors organization that won the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize.\n",

A slim majority of the GOP-led Senate voted this week to roll back Trump's use of emergency powers to set tariffs on Canada, Brazil and other countries.\n                \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   In a series of three votes this week, a slim majority of the GOP-led Senate delivered a rare, bipartisan rebuke of President Trump's use of emergency powers to set tariffs on Canada, Brazil and other countries.   The last of these votes — a measure approved Thursday to roll back global tariffs announced by Trump in April — passed by a margin of 51 to 47. Democrats cleared the measure with support from four Republicans: Susan Collins of Maine, Alaska's Lisa Murkowski and Kentucky's Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul.   \"The way that the president has imposed the tariffs is leading to nothing but chaos,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., the lead sponsor of the measure, said ahead of the vote. Kaine said the strategy behind Trump's tariff policy amounted to, \"Announce tariffs on everyone, then announce that they may be suspended or delayed while I work out one-on-one deals.\"   \n   Earlier this week, the same four Republican senators joined Democrats to approve resolutions to terminate tariffs on Brazil and Canada that were announced using emergency powers. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., joined Democrats to terminate the Brazil tariffs, which he argued specifically had no rational basis.   \n   The vast majority of Senate Republicans voted against the measures, with many saying that at this point they're counterproductive to the president's tariff program. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said Trump's new plans to lower China's tariffs Thursday were a good reminder. Trump announced the plans after meeting in South Korea with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.    \"The president's negotiations are bearing fruit. President Trump already announced new trade deals,\" Crapo said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote. \"Other deals are, hopefully, forthcoming.\"   However, the success of this week's resolution votes, which only needed a simple majority to pass, may not go far. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., installed a special rule to block such votes in the House, so they're currently unlikely to reach the floor. Even if they were to somehow pass the House, President Trump would almost certainly veto them.   Still, the vote marked a test of support for the president's tariff policies among Republicans, reflecting unease inside the party about their impacts on the U.S. economy, and specifically the farming and manufacturing sectors. It came ahead of arguments at the Supreme Court this fall in a case challenging Trump's authority to put sweeping tariffs in place using emergency powers.   \n   Thursday's vote wasn't the first time Senate Republicans took up Trump's authority to set global tariffs. In April, a similar measure failed 49 to 49. That same month, a measure to block tariffs on Canada drew a simple majority in the Senate.   \"Since then our nation's trade policy has looked pretty much like a dog chasing a squirrel,\" Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a lead co-sponsor of the global tariffs resolution, said on the Senate floor on Thursday. \"More tariffs threatened, added, taken away, thousands of packages being destroyed because the customs service wasn't prepared, secretive deals to lift tariffs for certain companies and products that have influence at the White House.\"   \n   The Republicans who broke ranks did so despite a lobbying push by Vice President JD Vance, who met with Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill on Tuesday and urged them to back the president's policies. Vance told reporters after the lunch meeting that the tariffs are critical leverage for Trump in international negotiations.   But Tillis, for example, was one of those Republicans not convinced when it came at least to the Brazil tariffs.   \"I just don't think there's a rational basis for it,\" Tillis said.   Trump triggered the Brazil tariffs this summer to pressure the country's government to end what he called a \"witch hunt\" against his ally, former far-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Last month, Bolsonaro was sentenced to 27 years in prison for attempting a coup to stay in power following his 2022 election defeat.\n",

That's the lowest since the U.S. refugee program was established in 1980.   The U.S. wants to primarily admit Afrikaners from South Africa, according to a notification in the Federal Register filed on Thursday, and \"other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.\"   The administration has largely paused the U.S. refugee resettlement program so far this year, with the exception of a streamlined process of resettlement for white South Africans. Several hundred from the group have been resettled across the U.S. since March.   \n   In response, some resettlement groups have been quick to voice concern over the lack of resources and limits on admission of those from other countries. Others have shuttered their services, changing the landscape of the refugee resettlement process.   Thursday's notification, which covers the fiscal year that started October 1, does not provide a reason for the lower cap, beyond mentioning previous Trump administration policies on refugees, including pausing admissions overall and barring admissions from countries seen as threats to U.S. security and welfare.   Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state, previously told reporters that criteria for bringing in refugees included making sure that they did not pose a national security challenge and could be easily assimilated.   \n   \"This decision doesn't just lower the refugee admissions ceiling. It lowers our moral standing,\" Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president of Global Refuge, said in a statement. \"At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the program's purpose as well as its credibility.\"   The Biden administration had set the refugee cap at 125,000 for fiscal year 2025.   Push for higher caps   Refugee advocates have spent the year pushing for a broader range of admissions beyond Afrikaners, including admitting people from other countries who had already been vetted to arrive in the U.S.   \n   \"It is egregious to exclude refugees who completed years of rigorous security checks and are currently stuck in dangerous and precarious situations,\" said Sharif Aly, president of the International Refugee Assistance Project. He said that the number of those with confirmed travel plans to the U.S. is greater than the new refugee cap.   \n   The admission of Afrikaners to the U.S. has drawn scrutiny from resettlement agencies in the U.S., who have faced sharp budget, resource, and personnel cuts since President Trump took office.   Among his first executive actions, Trump paused the refugee resettlement program. Various agencies including the State Department have also paused disbursing funding for critical services for other refugees, such as the home, job and school assistance the Afrikaners are poised to receive.   The pause also sent the refugee resettlement agencies into turmoil as refugees already cleared to arrive in the U.S. received notice their flights had been cancelled.   \n   Among those left in limbo were Afghans who worked with the U.S. military, a move that some Republicans have criticized. A lower-court judge had ordered the government to at least resume the refugee program for those who had already been approved to travel, but an appeals court ruled in favor of the administration.   The notice in the Federal Register makes no mention of Afghans, despite past promises to help those who supported the U.S. in America's longest war.\n",

NPR has obtained the draft text of a proposed rule that would prohibit federal Medicaid reimbursement for medical care provided to transgender patients younger than age 18. It also prohibits reimbursement through the Children's Health Insurance Program or CHIP for patients under age 19.   \n   An additional proposed rule would go even further, blocking all Medicaid and Medicare funding for any services at hospitals that provide pediatric gender-affirming care.   The rules are being prepared for public release in early November, according to an employee at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The employee asked that NPR not use their name because they fear professional retribution for speaking to the media without authorization. An HHS spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment about the planned timing of the proposed rules' release.   \n   A near ban in all states   Both supporters and opponents of transgender rights agree that, taken together, the forthcoming rules could make access to pediatric gender-affirming care across the country extremely difficult, if not impossible. The care is already banned in 27 states.   \"These rules would be a significant escalation in the Trump administration's attack on access to transgender health care,\" says Katie Keith, director of the Center for Health Policy and the Law at Georgetown University.   \"I think it's really, really important to note that nothing is changing immediately,\" she explains. \"These would be proposals that would go out for public comment, it would take months for the Trump administration to issue a final rule, and then, if past is prologue, we would see litigation over whatever the final rules are.\"   Administration goals   In his first days in office, President Trump signed an executive order declaring that the United States \"will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another.\"   In the months since, HHS released a report critical of the research that supports access to this care. A federal suicide prevention lifeline specifically for transgender youth was cancelled, as were hundreds of millions of dollars in scientific research funding related to LGBTQ people. Federal health officials warned state Medicaid directors to tread carefully, and the Department of Justice announced subpoenas of some children's hospitals and threatened providers with prosecution.   \n   \"I think these restrictions are very good,\" says Terry Schilling of the forthcoming rules. Schilling is president of the American Principles Project, a conservative advocacy group. \"It's going to change the entire transgender industry, and it's going to take away a lot of their funding streams.\"   He points to an opinion poll from the spring, which found 66% of the public opposes Medicaid coverage for this type of care for young people.   \"They believe that if you want to get some type of sex-trait modification procedure, you should have to pay for it,\" Schilling says. \"The American people are fully behind this effort.\"   \n   Dramatic new expansion of power   The proposal to condition a hospital's participation in Medicaid and Medicare on halting gender-affirming care for youth represents an \"unprecedented\" use of the executive branch's power to control what medical care is available in hospitals, says Keith.   \"Because Medicare is such a significant portion of many hospitals' revenue,\" she explains, the rule would essentially force hospitals to end their gender care programs for transgender youth. That would mean all of those programs' patients — whether they have Medicaid or private insurance — would lose access.   This is not how the federal government normally uses this type of rule, Keith says. She served in the Biden administration on the Gender Policy Council, and worked on some \"conditions of participation\" regulations for Medicare and Medicaid, she says. \"They're so basic — it's like, you have to have a crash cart [with] enough medicine to help a pregnant woman in crisis.\"   Instead of health and safety standards, this proposal would instruct hospitals \"to stop offering a certain type of care completely to a certain patient population,\" she says.   Law professor Katie Eyer of Rutgers University questions whether such a rule would survive a court challenge. \"But if it were successful, I shudder to think what this administration would do with such a tool in their hands,\" she says. It could open the door for any White House to withhold all federal funding from hospitals over the provision of medical care that it disfavors.   \"The writing has been on the wall that this has been coming,\" says Lindsey Dawson, director of LGBTQ Health Policy at KFF, a nonpartisan health research organization.   Yet the timing of the release has been a mystery for months. Notice of both proposed rules — though not the rules themselves — appeared on a government register over the summer, and it's been unclear why they have yet to be released, Dawson says.   \n   'An obsessive focus'   The administration's efforts on transgender issues stretch far beyond health policy and beyond youth. The Federal Trade Commission recently hosted a workshop \"on unfair or deceptive trade practices in 'gender-affirming care' for minors.\" The military forced out transgender servicemembers. Universities have been told their federal funding is contingent on adopting anti-transgender policies on issues like bathroom access.   \n   Even the impending lapse in funding for food assistance, or SNAP, is linked to Democratic support for \"gender mutilation procedures,\" according to a banner on the Department of Agriculture website.   \"It's endless,\" says Eyer. \"It really has been an obsessive focus that's been deployed across the administration.\"   The warning letters and cancelled grants and more have had a significant chilling effect. In the states where the care is still legal, many clinics and hospitals have ended their programs for gender-affirming care. If these rules were to take effect, the remaining programs would likely follow suit.   \"There are real people behind all this,\" says Eyer, who is also the parent of a transgender child. \"People are really scared and suffering as a result of this onslaught of attacks on the trans community.\"   It's still legal, although access is shrinking   Gender-affirming care for youth — including puberty blocking medications, hormones, and rarely, surgery — does not actually violate federal law, Eyer notes. And, despite recent political pressure, no major U.S. medical organization has altered their clinical guidance that supports these treatments as appropriate and safe.   Approximately 3% of youth in the U.S. identify as transgender or nonbinary, although not all of them seek medical treatment related to their identity.   Notably, in Utah, a state-commissioned analysis of the evidence recently came to the opposite conclusion as the Trump administration's transgender report. University of Utah researchers found that there was ample evidence of benefits and safety for these treatments, and wrote that policy restrictions on this care for youth \"cannot be justified based on the quantity or quality of medical science findings or concerns about potential regret in the future.\"   \n   The draft text of the proposed federal rule obtained by NPR does not mention the Utah analysis, nor does it cite the American Academy of Pediatrics, whose guidelines also support access to the care.   In Eyer's view, the public release of these rules will offer the opportunity for them to be legally challenged.   \"It will be subject to 'arbitrary and capricious' review, and a court will presumably take a close look at the factual basis that actually underlies it,\" she says. \"That is actually preferable to what we've had up until now, which is coercion without law.\"   Diane Webber edited this story.\n",

Experts say that the resumption of testing would be a major escalation and could upend the nuclear balance of power.   \"I think a decision to resume nuclear testing would be extremely dangerous and would do more to benefit our adversaries than the United States,\" said Corey Hinderstein, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for Nuclear Peace.   \n   Here's what a test would involve, and why the president might be calling for one now.   There's currently only one place America could test a nuke — near Las Vegas, Nevada   The Nevada National Security Site, approximately 60 miles northwest of Las Vegas, is currently the only place where America could test a nuclear weapon, says Robert Peters, a senior research fellow for strategic deterrence at the Heritage Foundation.   \n   The Nevada site is around 1,300 square miles in size, larger than the state of Rhode Island. Starting in the 1950s, scientists conducted atmospheric nuclear tests at the site, but from 1962 to 1992, testing was done underground.   Today, testing would likely be done in \"a complex of deep underground mineshafts,\" Peters said.   Scientists dig a deep shaft either directly below ground or into the side of a mountain. They then put a nuclear device in a chamber at the end of the shaft and seal it up. The detonation is contained by the rock, reducing the risk of atmospheric fallout.   Although underground testing is far safer than atmospheric testing, it still carries risks, said Hinderstein. In the past, some radioactive fallout has leaked from test shafts. Additionally, the test could shake buildings as far away as Las Vegas, and Hinderstein said some of the newer buildings in Vegas could even be at risk of damage.   \n   \"All of these big highrises — including Stratosphere, including the Trump Hotel,\" she said. \"They're not designed for massive, significant seismic activity.\"   America's last test in Nevada was over 30 years ago   At the end of the Cold War, the nation's major nuclear powers declared a voluntary moratorium on nuclear testing. Russia, then the Soviet Union, tested its last nuclear weapon in 1990, the U.S. conducted its final test in 1992, and China conducted its last test in 1996.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The U.S. conducted hundreds of underground tests in Nevada. Each massive explosion created a subsidence crater visible at the surface.\n                \n                    NNSA/NNSS\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        NNSA/NNSS\n    \n\n   \n   The voluntary test moratorium has been in place as part of an effort to maintain nuclear stability. The U.S currently uses scientific experiments and supercomputer simulations to make sure its bombs still work.   Last year, NPR was one of a handful of organizations granted rare access to the top-secret underground tunnels where the tests take place. Scientists working in the tunnels said they were confident they could continue to ensure the safety of America's nuclear weapons without testing.   Although a full-scale nuclear detonation would be \"complementary\" to current experiments, \"our assessment is that there are no system questions that would be answered by a test, that would be worth the expense and the effort and the time,\" Don Haynes, a nuclear weapons scientist from Los Alamos National Laboratory told NPR as they walked through the tunnels.   Indeed Hinderstein says, preparing for a nuclear test is no small matter. While a basic demonstration test could be done in approximately 18 months. Conducting a test that would produce scientifically useful data would likely take years.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                In this photo taken from video distributed by Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Wednesday, Oct. 22, 2025, the crew of the Bryansk nuclear submarine of the Russian navy prepares to conduct a practice launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile during the drills of Russia's nuclear forces.\n                \n                    AP/Russian Defense Ministry Press S\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        AP/Russian Defense Ministry Press S\n    \n\n   \n   Trump's announcement is likely reacting to some recent tests by Russia   On Sunday, Russia announced it had conducted a successful test of a new nuclear-powered cruise missile. Then on Wednesday President Vladimir Putin announced the successful test of another doomsday weapon — a nuclear-powered underwater drone, which Russia says can be used to attack coastal cities.   \n   Trump never called out Russia by name, but he did suggest recent testing was behind the announcement. \"I see them testing,\" he said aboard Air Force One, \"and I say, 'Well if they're going to test I guess we have to test.'\"   \n   While testing nuclear-powered weapons is not the same as testing nuclear weapons themselves, Russia's tests are highly provocative. They come just months before the expiration of the last nuclear treaty between the U.S. and Russia, designed to put limits on their arsenals.   The back-and-forth has all the hallmarks of the start of an arms race, noted Jon Wolfsthal, the director of global risk at the Federation for American Scientists.   \"We saw this play out throughout the Cold War through nuclear testing, nuclear deployments, nuclear investments,\" he said.   Many experts warn that now is not the time to resume nuclear testing   Hinderstein, who served as a deputy administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, the agency responsible for America's nuclear weapons, from 2021-2024, said that a decision to resume testing would not be in America's interests.   At the end of the Cold War, the U.S. had conducted more than a thousand nuclear tests — far more than any other nation (China, by comparison had conducted just 45).   \n   Other nations, \"have more to gain by resuming nuclear testing than the United States does,\" she said.   Testing would likely be expensive adds Paul Dean, vice president for global nuclear policy at the Nuclear Threat Initiative. \"The cost estimates I've seen have been at around, ballpark, $140 million per test,\" he said.   \"It's not necessary to conduct a nuclear explosive test right now\" agreed Robert Peters of the Heritage Foundation. But he added. \"But there very well be compelling reasons to test in the coming months and years. That's how bad things are getting.\"\n",

Today's top stories   Today, President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met and reached an agreement on several points in trade negotiations. Trump announced the U.S. would lower the 20% tariffs to 10% because China has committed to doing more to curb exports of ingredients for fentanyl. China will defer export controls on rare earths and resume buying U.S. soybeans. U.S. and Chinese economic officials ironed out the trade details in Malaysia last weekend.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping shake hands as they depart after a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on Oct. 30 in Busan, South Korea. Trump is meeting Xi for the first time since taking office for his second term, following months of growing tension between the two countries.\n                \n                    Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Xi and Trump met on the sideline of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea. Trump said he didn't come to South Korea for APEC or Korean issues, but to meet with the Chinese leader. On social media, Trump posted that the U.S. would resume testing nuclear weapons \"on an equal basis\" with Russia and China. NPR's Anthony Kuhn clarifies to Up First that while Russia and China are upgrading and expanding their nuclear arsenals, neither country has tested atomic bombs since the 1990s. Kuhn adds that Xi has not responded to Trump's statement, but \"couldn't have liked it much.\" Kuhn says if Trump's announcement was to try to pressure China into a conversation about arms control, it could have the opposite effect and result in an arms race.   \n   More than 65,000 infants, toddlers and preschoolers could lose access to their local Head Start centers across the U.S. beginning Nov. 1 because of the government shutdown. The federal program provides childcare and early learning for low-income families.    🎧 Without federal dollars, 134 Head Start programs are rushing to find alternative funding, NPR's Cory Turner says. If the programs close, many working families may have to choose between going to work and taking care of their children. Corey Holcomb, who runs a Head Start program in Michigan, told Turner that her agency secured two more weeks of funding by pulling from other resources with the hopes that they will be reimbursed. They've also asked for deferments on some bills.   Trump's pick for Surgeon General, Casey Means, will have her confirmation hearing in front of a Senate committee today. The president announced that Means would replace his initial choice, a Fox News contributor, more than five months ago. Means is a wellness influencer and entrepreneur. Last year, she published the bestselling book Good Energy. Here's what to watch for during the hearing.    🎧 NPR's Will Stone says the hearing is somewhat unusual because it will be held virtually, and Means will join remotely. Stone says he expects that she will be grilled about her qualifications and potential conflicts of interest. Some medical and public health professionals have pushed back on Means' confirmation. They have highlighted her lack of qualifications, and note that she dropped out of her surgical residency and does not have an active medical license. Critics argue that Means doesn't possess the leadership or clinical experience typically expected from the surgeon general, who is regarded as the nation's top doctor.   \n   Deep dive   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Over the past year, many federal law enforcement agents conducting immigration arrests have been concealing their faces under masks and vehicles being used in what appear to be immigration-related arrests do not have license plates.\n                \n                    Getty Images, Tik tok, Eyes Up\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Getty Images, Tik tok, Eyes Up\n    \n\n   \n   In the past year, many federal law enforcement agents conducting immigration arrests have hidden their identities. They have not only concealed their faces but have also masked their vehicles. NPR discovered through a review of videos that the vehicles used by officers during immigration-related arrests sometimes lacked license plates or had plates that were swapped out from their originals. Immigration advocates say that as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement increases its presence across the U.S., untraceable vehicles may add to confusion over what tactics its officers can or should be using, and could prevent people from holding officers accountable for their actions.    🚨 ICE spokesperson Mike Alvarez informed NPR that federal regulations require government vehicles to display license plates on both the front and rear. However, this requirement can be waived if showing the plates would interfere with investigative, law enforcement, intelligence, or security operations.🚨 Some states prohibit swapping license plates on vehicles. However, photos taken by activists and videos shared on social media suggest that some federal agents are doing it anyway. Some activists have also spotted vehicles with a license plate on the front of a vehicle that doesn't match the one on the back.🚨 In Washington and Illinois, some videos shared on social media show federal agents making arrests in vehicles marked with Mexican objects or icons. When asked about this tactic, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said that the agency believes its employees are not camouflaging their identities.

The bulk of their customers depend on SNAP benefits, and the store depends on their business. A lapse in funding would hurt everyone.\n                \n                    Tovia Smith/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Tovia Smith/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   SPRINGFIELD, Mass. — Theresa Rios came to the grocery store this week with a shorter shopping list than usual. And she's also paying even more attention than usual to price.   Walking past a shelf of items labeled \"Real Bacon Bits\" next to packages of imitation bacon bits, Rios doesn't hesitate. \"This is $2.19 and this is $1.59,\" she says, \"so I'm going to buy this.\"   Rios is a regular at the Save A Lot store in Springfield. But since she started hearing that her federal food assistance might soon be cut off, she has been trying to put some of the money she receives aside, just in case. And, she's no longer giving all her business to Save A Lot.   \n   \"I'm at the point where I am shopping for deals at three different stores,\" she says. \"So I'll come here because this is cheaper than Stop & Shop, but some of the items at Price Rite are cheaper than here, and Walmart is [cheaper for] the cleaning stuff … I just shop around.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Like many worried about a possible cut off in SNAP food aid, Theresa Rios is reducing her spending and doing more of her shopping at retail giants like Walmart hoping to stretch her dollars. Some smaller grocery stores in low-income communities are already seeing their sales slump and bracing for it to get worse.\n                \n                    Tovia Smith/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Tovia Smith/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Rios says she's also forgoing some items altogether, as she has switched to new, cheaper meals for herself and her three young grandchildren, who she takes care of full time. Dinner is downgraded to rice and beans, and she is no longer buying the kids' favorite cereal.   \"They'll have to settle for what I can give them,\" she says.   Rios is hardly the only shopper forced to be more frugal. Some 42 million Americans rely on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, formerly known as food stamps, and as many of them worry about losing their food aid, some grocery businesses are increasingly concerned as well. There are 250,000 retailers authorized to accept SNAP benefits. Most would be able to absorb whatever loss that might come from a lapse in SNAP, but others, like the Springfield Save A Lot, are more vulnerable. SNAP purchases at this store make up a solid 65% of sales.   \n   Already, manager Jose Pajares says those sales have started to dry up.   \"It's scary,\" he says. \"I see less customers every day because they're afraid to spend all the money they have for the whole month.\"   As a result, Pajares says he's been ordering less stock for the store, and he's dropping prices to try to boost sales. But he still ends up with meat and produce languishing on the shelf until its expiration date.   \"If we don't sell we have to throw it out,\" he says. \"Every day, we throw things away.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The entrance door of the Save A Lot grocery store in Springfield, Mass., features a sign that notes that the store accepts benefits from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, also known as WIC.\n                \n                    Tovia Smith/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Tovia Smith/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Even in the best of times, grocery profit margins are razor thin — usually just a penny or two on the dollar. And recent challenges around tariffs, for example, have sliced profits even thinner.   \n   Anthony Peña, who owns this store, also owns a few others that are less dependent on SNAP business. That means he's able to weather a dip in sales for a bit, he says, but not for long.   \n   \"After one, maybe two months, I'll start to think about the nuclear options, as we call it, having to think about closing the store,\" Peña says.   \"For small supermarket grocers, challenges like SNAP reductions can have a significant impact on profitability, which unfortunately can put some stores and lots of jobs in jeopardy,\" says Scott Moses, an investment banker with Solomon Partners who wrote the book A 'Grocery' Christmas Carol about the rapid and seismic changes in the grocery industry.   He says a prolonged SNAP shutdown could mean more pressure on the already shrinking number of small independent supermarkets, which are being squeezed by grocery giants like Walmart. By itself, Walmart has almost as much market share as all the nation's 26,000 small supermarket grocers combined.   Now, Moses says, Walmart might well gain even more; if there is a cutoff of SNAP benefits, he says the superstore would likely draw in more new customers.   \"A significant amount of customers are going to trade down to what they perceive to be lower-priced operators, and net, net, Walmart will likely come out ahead,\" Moses says.   For the less fortunate stores, however, there is growing concern that any closures could have broad and serious repercussions.   \"There's a ripple effect that's going to happen here,\" says Jerome Bouyer, vice president of retail operations for Save A Lot. For starters, Save A Lot stores tend to be \"in places that are already 'food deserts' and have food insecurity. That just makes the problem that much worse.\"   There is also worry about the impact on local vendors, suppliers and distributors.   \n   \"For example, the bread guy or the guy who delivers eggs or milk to the store,\" Peña says. \"Instead of delivering 100 units, now he's going to deliver 25 units — 75 units less. So that's when things get a little bit more complicated.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Cashier Stephanie Hernández is bracing for what could be a double blow. If SNAP food assistance is cut off, business at Save A Lot could crater and she could be laid off. But she is also a SNAP recipient herself, so she could end up losing her food assistance as well as her job.\n                \n                    Tovia Smith/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Tovia Smith/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   And of course, store employees are acutely aware that their jobs are also on the line. Already, there are cashiers just standing around during what is supposed to be the busiest shopping hour of the day.   \"I'm worried because if customers aren't coming because they don't get food stamps, our jobs are at risk,\" cashier Stephanie Hernández says in Spanish. She has an 11-year-old and twin 1-year-olds. \"If I don't work,\" she says, \"how will I pay my bills?\"   If the worst-case scenario does come to pass, it would be a double blow for Hernandez. She gets SNAP benefits herself. So if payments are allowed to lapse, she could end up losing her food assistance — and her job.\n",

He was also one of the people behind Project 2025, which was intended to be a blueprint for a second Trump term, and that's what it's become. Vought describes himself as a radical constitutionalist. Andy Kroll has been investigating how Vought has been using his power and what his goals are. Kroll covers the Justice Department and judiciary system for ProPublica, where he's written extensively about Vought. Kroll has an article in The New Yorker in collaboration with ProPublica titled \"Donald Trump's Deep-State Wrecking Ball.\" Kroll is also the journalist who first got access to and published the video of Vought saying this back in 2023.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RUSSELL VOUGHT: We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected. We want - when they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work.(LAUGHTER)VOUGHT: Because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down so that the EPA can't do all of the rules against our energy industry because they have no bandwidth financially to do so. We want to put them in trauma.GROSS: OK, and there's one more Russell Vought clip I want to play for you that will give you more of a sense of Vought's goals and strategy. When he was on The Tucker Carlson Show in November 18, 2024, just 13 days after Trump was reelected, Carlson asked Vought about his priorities. This was on top of Vought's list.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)VOUGHT: So my belief, for anyone who wants to listen, is that you have to - the president has to move executively as fast and as aggressively as possible with a radical constitutional perspective to be able to dismantle that bureaucracy and their power centers. And I think there are a couple of ways to do it. Number one is going after the whole notion of independence. There are no independent agencies. Congress may have viewed them as such - SEC or the FCC, CFPB, the whole alphabet soup. But that is not something that the Constitution understands. So there may be different strategies with each one of them about how you dismantle them, but as an administration, the whole notion of an independent agency should be thrown out, particularly with the Department of Justice in which there's literally no law. All it is is precedent from the Watergate era, that the attorney general and those lawyers don't work for the president. And...TUCKER CARLSON: Well, who do they work for?VOUGHT: They think that they work for themselves. They think that they are...CARLSON: So they have the power to kill people just 'cause they awarded themselves that power?VOUGHT: They...CARLSON: The power to kill people. I mean...VOUGHT: They believe that they have the power for all of the prosecutions and that the president doesn't get a say in any of that. And that - we have to go at that as hard as we possibly can.GROSS: Well, Andy Kroll, welcome to FRESH AIR. We have a lot to talk about (laughter).ANDY KROLL: Yeah, we sure do. It's a real pleasure to be here.GROSS: Pleasure to have you. So let's get into what we just heard Russell Vought say. I'll start with federal agencies. Why are they such a big target for Vought?KROLL: Russ Vought believes that federal agencies are one of the chief reasons that, in his view, the American government has ceased to serve the American people and that it has become this rogue bureaucracy where there are civil servants who are unelected and who have their own agendas. They, in his belief, ignore the president and carry out this plan, these policies, these rules and regulations that, again, in Russ Vought's view, have become completely untethered from the will of the president and then the people who elected that president. And he wants to rip out as much of that bureaucracy as he possibly can. He calls it the deep state. He deeply believes that, as he put it in a different part of that Tucker Carlson interview, that the bureaucracy in the American government hates - to use his term - the American people and has to be eliminated.GROSS: OK. So he says that the agencies aren't mentioned in the Constitution and therefore, they don't necessarily even have a right to exist, if I'm hearing him correctly. What is mentioned in the Constitution is the separation of powers between the president, the judiciary and Congress. He thinks, according to the clip we just heard, that the president should be involved directly with the judiciary. Does that violate the Constitution?KROLL: It certainly would be a major break from how our three-part system of government has operated for quite a long time, and it would certainly be a break in terms of what the president is now doing as it relates to Congress from the plain text of the Constitution itself. What I'm talking about here is the Article 1 authority that Congress has, No. 1 job that Congress has, the power of the purse. Pass the laws with funding to implement those laws. Article 2, as anyone who has done a cursory read of the Constitution knows, says that the president must take care to implement those laws faithfully. Russ Vought has a very different theory of this case. As he and President Trump and this administration have shown in the almost 10 months they've been in office, they believe that the president has vastly more power to defy Congress' will, to block spending, to block programs approved by Congress, to essentially step on that Article 1 authority and really scramble the fundamental idea of separation of powers that, again, has governed this country for quite a long time.GROSS: Why is Congress allowing the president to limit the power of Congress? Why are Republican congressman standing for that?KROLL: It's a very good question. I think it speaks to the degree to which the Republican Party today is so controlled by one man, the president of the United States right now, Donald Trump. If you talk to members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, you come away with the impression that the overriding concern that most Republican members of the House and the Senate have in their day-to-day existence is winding up on the wrong side of President Trump, winding up on the wrong side of his most ardent followers. So when these confrontations have come up this year, when Russ Vought has acted in ways that have thwarted, again, Congress' fundamental power of the purse responsibilities, Congress has essentially said, oh, OK. You know, well, maybe we'll put out some strongly worded statements saying we disagree, maybe we'll grumble a little bit to the Capitol Hill Press Corp. But the Republicans who run Congress right now, to be clear, seem much more concerned about staying in the good graces of President Trump and his base than they do about asserting Congress' institutional authority, which, again, is really uncharted territory for how our government is supposed to function.GROSS: Russell Vought also wants the president to be able to fire federal workers who don't adhere to the president's agenda. And part of his rationale is that federal workers weren't elected, so the president should be able to fire them, like any boss can fire an employee. Vought wasn't elected either. So where does his power come from? Is he that powerful as the director of the Office of Management and Budget?KROLL: The power comes from a few places. Some of it is the nature of the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, and I can get into that a little bit more. Some of it, though, is really an extension of this maximalist view of executive power. It's been referred to as the unitary executive theory - this notion that Article 2 of the Constitution gives the executive, gives the commander in chief vast powers, not just to dictate foreign policy or to shape the agenda of the various agencies that are in the executive branch, but to actually go in and fire people who are ostensibly protected by the kind of civil service safeguards, workplace protections, in some cases, actual collective bargaining agreements in place. That the president has this blanket authority to just say, no, those bargaining agreements are not valid. Those unions are not legitimate. I can go in and just say, you are fired at the Department of Education. You several thousand employees at the Department of Homeland Security, your positions are eliminated. So there's that kind of - almost a legalistic blanket approach that is just essentially pointing to Article 2 and saying, Article 2 stands for a lot more than people think it does.But then there is this little-known, not particularly sexy, as you put it, but incredibly powerful agency known as the Office of Management and Budget. And it sits at this critical juncture in the American government. Congress, as we talked about, passes the laws, appropriates the funds, sets the policy agenda. And I think a lot of Americans figure that, OK, Congress does that. The money goes to these agencies. The plans, the laws go to the agencies, and that's how our government works. But there is this office, OMB, that sits in between Congress and the agencies that in the hands of Russ Vought has become this choke point to cut off funding, to cut off the functioning of programs and to exert the president's will in a way that we honestly haven't seen since the Nixon administration.GROSS: OK. I want to talk with you a lot more about what Vought is doing to American government. But first, we have to take a short break. If you're just joining us, my guest is Andy Kroll, an investigative reporter for ProPublica covering the Justice Department and the judiciary. He has an article in The New Yorker in collaboration with ProPublica about Russell Vought titled \"Donald Trump's Deep-State Wrecking Ball.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF THE AMERICAN ANALOG SET SONG, \"IMMACULATE HEART II\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday with Andy Kroll, an investigative journalist covering the Justice Department and the judiciary at ProPublica. He's been investigating Russell Vought, the person behind Trump's dismantling of federal agencies and expanding the power of the presidency. Vought is the director of the Office of Management and Budget and an architect of Project 2025. He's the subject of Kroll's article in The New Yorker, written in collaboration with ProPublica, titled \"Donald Trump's Deep-State Wrecking Ball.\"Does Vought, as the director of the Office of Management and Budget, get to veto, like, budgets that come across his desk? Does he have any kind of final say over how money is dispensed?KROLL: Not in a permanent, official kind of way. The director of the Office of Management and Budget can't put a veto on, say, a multibillion-dollar program to support clean energy or to build the Second Avenue subway in New York City. That is the role of Congress - again, writes the laws, appropriates the money. What OMB does in normal times is what I've kind of likened to a loving but cautious parent, who gives out an allowance to their kids at sort of regular intervals to try to make sure that those kids don't spend the money that's going to them in one fell swoop. So OMB apportions money - to use the wonky term - to federal agencies at a kind of regular cadence to basically make sure that, say, the EPA doesn't run out of money two months before the fiscal year is over. Agencies have some problems with controlling the spending if they don't have that sort of regulator in place, that cadence coming from OMB. So that's what OMB normally does.What it has done in a massive way, in an unprecedented way with Russ Vought in charge, is actually say, we're just not going to apportion that money, period. We've frozen money that is supposed to go from Congress to, say, the National Institutes of Health or the Environmental Protection Agency or the IRS. We're freezing it. And they give various reasons. They say, we're doing a review of this funding, but these reviews have no timetable. The agencies don't know how long or why this review is happening. Or Vought and his colleagues will say, this funding doesn't align with the president's priorities. It's part of the green new scam, a term that they've used, or it's part of, quote-unquote, \"transing our kids.\" And so they just hold the money back. And that has created this chaos across the federal government because the normal functioning of how laws get passed, money gets appropriated, and agencies do their work has been completely jammed up.GROSS: And after the money is frozen, does it expire at the end of Congress' term?KROLL: It depends on what kind of money we're talking about. Sometimes the money is over a multiyear period. Sometimes the money is called no-year funding, which means it doesn't have an expiration date. But by and large, this money does have an expiration date, often one fiscal year. And the money will expire at the end of the fiscal year if it hasn't been spent. And one budgetary gambit that Vought has used just, you know, several months ago was trying to freeze federal funding so close to the end of the fiscal year that it would just expire on its own without any support from Congress, without any attempt to get the legislative branch to sign off on that. And again, this is one of these maneuvers that Vought is using now to try to upend the normal functioning of our democratic system.GROSS: So in full disclosure, I should mention that Congress had voted funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes federal funding to public radio and public TV. But then Vought had asked Congress to rescind that money, to claw it back, and they did. So is that kind of thing unprecedented? And also, there's something that's being called, not a pocket veto, but pocket rescission. Can you explain that?KROLL: Yeah. And we're getting into the budgetary weeds here. But these are really critical.GROSS: These are powerful tools.KROLL: Yeah, that's right. And they are very much the tools that Vought has been using to accomplish the very goal he talked about in that Tucker Carlson clip that you played earlier. In June, the White House sent what's called a rescission request down Pennsylvania Avenue to Congress. What that asked Congress to do, that request, was to rescind $9 billion that Congress had already appropriated by law. It had passed a law that accounted for this money to go to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, to go to foreign aid programs. And now the White House said to Congress, we want you to take a vote on rescinding that money, zeroing it out.The thing that is striking to me is that Vought tried to do this in the first Trump administration when he had a similar role at the Office of Management and Budget. And ultimately, he was the director at the end of the first Trump administration. They sent a massive rescissions request in the first Trump administration to Congress, and Congress said no. Congress narrowly defeated this measure. And it was seen back then as the legislative branch exerting its will, kind of standing up for itself and saying, we write the laws, we appropriate the money. We don't support you, the White House, coming over here and telling us to undo work that we've already done, the negotiations, the compromises, the deal-making.Fast-forward to this summer, Vought goes back to the tool kit and sends another rescission request to Congress for Corporation for Public Broadcasting funding, for USAID foreign aid funding. And this time it passes. Congress votes to rescind this money. And the effects of that, of course, have been pretty devastating for the programs and agencies affected. But then a few months later, Vought takes an even more aggressive step in the same direction. He issues what he has called a pocket rescission.What that essentially means is it's a request that went to Congress and said, we want to rescind even more money. This time, it was about $5 billion, again, targeting foreign aid. But what Vought essentially told Congress was, I don't need your vote. I don't need you at all to rescind this money because the way the law works, Congress has a 45-day period to consider one of these rescission requests, to consider, again, whether to undo work it had already done.Vought sent this request down Pennsylvania Avenue so close to the end of the fiscal year for Congress that he said, I don't need your support - the clock is going to run out, and the money will go away. That is a maneuver that's largely seen as not legal. Republicans in Congress said as much to Vought. But by all indications, he was undaunted by this. And he sees this pocket recission - kind like a pocket veto, but again, specifically targeting funding at programs - as a way that he can erase government funding whether Congress likes it or not.GROSS: My guest is Andy Kroll, an investigative reporter for ProPublica covering the Justice Department and the judiciary. He has an article in The New Yorker in collaboration with ProPublica about Russell Vought titled \"Donald Trump's Deep-State Wrecking Ball.\" We'll be right back. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF TERENCE BLANCHARD'S \"AIN'T YO STUFF SAFE HERE\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday with Andy Kroll, an investigative journalist covering the Justice Department and judiciary at ProPublica. He's been investigating Russell Vought, the person behind Trump's dismantling of federal agencies and expanding the power of the presidency. Vought is the director of the Office of Management and Budget and an architect of Project 2025. He's the subject of Kroll's article in The New Yorker in collaboration with ProPublica titled \"Donald Trump's Deep-State Wrecking Ball.\"It seems that one of the things that Russell Vought is doing is creating chaos - freezing funds with agencies not knowing, like, if those are going to be unfrozen or if they'll never get that funding back, creating chaos, in many ways, in agencies, creating some chaos in Congress. Because Trump has been telling Republicans in Congress what to do, and sometimes that's contradicting what they've already voted to do. Is chaos a goal of Russell Vought's?KROLL: I don't think you can take in the full sweep of what this administration has done in less than a year and not come away with thinking that chaos is a goal and certainly an outcome that serves Vought and his team's larger agenda of putting cracks in the federal government, shaking the stability of this typically rock-solid, steady institution that is the federal bureaucracy. I talked to dozens of people who have worked with Vought, who have observed him closely - talked with a lot of federal workers who have been affected by the funding freezes, affected by the mass layoffs, affected by all the different maneuvers that Vought has attempted so far. One thing that really stuck with me - and it came out of one of these conversations with a former civil servant - was how much this administration and really Vought's efforts have shattered this idea of public service, at least at the federal level, as a reliable, stable way to not just find employment, but to serve a greater good, to serve your country, to be a part of this larger mission, this larger ideal.You know, the people who work in the federal government aren't doing it because the pay is great. They're not toiling away at the Education Department or the FBI because it's going to make them famous or they're going to achieve viral influence or status. They do it because they believe in this larger mission, and they're willing to work under Democratic and Republican presidents. But there is this larger notion of public service, this ideal that drives them. That idea has really taken a beating in this administration to the point that former federal workers I talked to have said, things are so chaotic. Things are so uncertain. I don't know if I would want to work for the federal government again because I don't want to have to go through what I've already gone through this year.GROSS: I wonder if that's intentional. Like, if you want to destroy federal agencies and the so-called deep state, one way to do it is to discourage people from working in federal government, to make it seem like you're not going to have a reliable job. We might take it away from you at any point. If the president thinks you're disloyal and you're not following his agenda, he has the right to fire you. We can defund agencies. We can close the doors of agencies. So, like, you're asking for instability. You might be an idealist, but, you know, this might not be good for you.KROLL: I have to think that that is the intended outcome. And I think this comes back to the line of Vought's that set me down this path, this yearlong path of reporting, which were these comments about wanting to put civil servants in trauma. I went back and looked at his social media footprint. He doesn't have a major presence online. He is not a Pete Hegseth or a Kash Patel, who sees himself as this kind of public influencer-type figure. But Vought does chime in every once in a while, and he has over the years. And what I found, actually, was there was a New York Times article that came out when Joe Biden was president. But it talked about the lingering effects of the first Trump administration's chaos and the dysfunction and the aggressive policy changes at the top, specifically at the EPA. And there was someone in there - in The New York Times article - who said that this was a traumatic experience for the people who worked at the EPA. The first Trump administration there - we're talking about here. And Russ Vought shared this story online, and he shared it with a little message above that said, quote, \"straight into my veins,\" as in, I love what this story is conveying about federal workers feeling traumatized. And clearly, his goal was to try to replicate that on a much larger scale. And that is just something that has really stuck with me this entire time, is this psychological motivation that he has to want to traumatize people who have devoted their lives, their careers to public service.GROSS: Well, we need to take another break, so I'm going to reintroduce you. My guest is Andy Kroll, an investigative reporter for ProPublica covering the Justice Department and the judiciary. He has an article in The New Yorker in collaboration with ProPublica about Russell Vought titled \"Donald Trump's Deep-State Wrecking Ball.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF JULIAN LAGE GROUP'S \"IOWA TAKEN\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday with Andy Kroll, an investigative journalist covering the Justice Department and judiciary at ProPublica. He's been investigating Russell Vought, the person behind Trump's dismantling of federal agencies and expanding the power of the presidency. Vought is the director of the Office of Management and Budget and an architect of Project 2025. He's the subject of Kroll's article in The New Yorker in collaboration with ProPublica titled \"Donald Trump's Deep-State Wrecking Ball.\"As part of your investigation into Russell Vought, you got access to court records. And you did interviews with people close to Vought. And you learned that DOGE was guided more than was previously known by Russell Vought. What did you learn about his role that we didn't know before?KROLL: I think the way to understand Vought and DOGE is this. Vought is a planner. He's a thinker. He's a student of not just history, but how the federal government works and where the levers are that he can pull to try to enact his agenda. DOGE with Musk at the head was like a battering ram, a blunt force instrument that swept through the federal government trying to get rid of as many employees, cancel as many programs as it could, as fast as it could.And so I think, while there may have been some particular programs, there may have been some specific offices that Russ Vought may not have wanted to get rid of or may not have had on his list of targets to be wound down and DOGE did go after those, DOGE kind of changed the calculus for Vought. But for a lot of Trump administration officials, they saw that if you moved fast and broke things, to use the Silicon Valley catchphrase, you could kind of get away with it.GROSS: Was Russell Vought the person behind DOGE? Was it his idea to start that?KROLL: From all the reporting I've done, people I've talked to who are close to DOGE, that was very much an Elon Musk idea, something that Musk pitched to the president and the president embraced. In some ways, I think DOGE kind of got in the way initially of Vought's plans that he had been crafting for years for a potential second Trump administration. But as things started to play out earlier this year, and as DOGE started to move so aggressively through the federal government, I think Vought saw an opportunity to take advantage of what DOGE showed was possible and to take even more drastic action. He did not choose to be in this situation, Russ Vought. But he saw a way that he could use it to his advantage, based on all of the interviews, all of the documents I've read, and he took that opening.GROSS: Yeah, they're opposite in terms of approaches. You know, Musk had the chainsaw, and Russell Vought is more of a technocrat. Like, he knows all the ins and outs of congressional rules. He drafts executive orders. He works to break the rules by knowing the rules. But, you know, one of the outcomes of DOGE is a lot of lawsuits. Can you talk more about that goal of creating lawsuits to see how far you can push things and still, you know, maybe violate law or push law and still be able to get away with it?KROLL: We're seeing this play out right now as we approach a month of a federal government shutdown here in Washington. Vought and OMB sent out this memo a few days before the shutdown telling agencies to put together plans to lay off workers en masse during the shutdown. Now, that is something that all the legal experts I talked to, the congressional staffers, people steeped in the law of how personnel actions work in the federal government, say you can't do. You can't use a shutdown as an opportunity to lay off tens of thousands of people. That is exactly what Vought told agencies to do. That's exactly what he has given interviews saying he wants to do.This is one of those examples of what you're talking about. It has teed up a legal fight that's playing out. A federal judge on the West Coast has, for now, temporarily halted Vought's actions, these agency actions, to lay off workers. But this seems like one of those moments where Vought is testing the limit. He's looking for ways to potentially get new precedent, change the law. And I think you see a number of those attempts across the board, freezing programs, laying off workers. That is very much a part of this strategy, looking for ways to get these questions in front of judges and try to change laws, find certain laws unconstitutional or just shift the line a little bit of what the executive power that a president has looks like.GROSS: And in terms of the shutdown that we're experiencing now, one of Vought's plans when he was drafting his plans for a second Trump term was to use shutdowns as a way to accomplish his political goals. So you gave us one example. Are there other political goals he wants to accomplish through shutdowns?KROLL: Vought sees shutdowns as these rare opportunities, though they're increasingly less rare lately, to achieve big policy outcomes that you can't get through the normal course of Congress or the normal course of the federal government's business. I quote him in the story in one of I think about 50 briefings that he gave that I got a recording of saying Republicans need to love shutdowns because shutdowns are the way you save the country. It's not just about using a shutdown as leverage to threaten or actually fire tens of thousands of federal workers. It's also the way that you try to achieve these really dramatic policy changes.Right now, this shutdown is all about these really critical subsidies for Obamacare. The next shutdown could be trying to get Democrats to concede to major policy changes, funding cuts on clean energy or infrastructure, unwinding, say, Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. Vought sees these shutdowns as chances to get what you can't otherwise achieve, you can't otherwise get the opposing party to agree to, when Congress is normally in session. That's why he's so eager for them.GROSS: Russell Vought talks about the Constitution and democracy. But he supported Trump's false claim that Trump won the 2020 election. What does that say about Vought, do you think?KROLL: I think it says that his loyalty to President Trump is so central to how he believes he is going to enact this larger vision for radically changing the federal government here in the United States. If he had broken with the president over the 2020 election, like a lot of other senior officials in the administration did, he loses the ability to be a part of the MAGA movement, to harness the political support, the energy of Donald Trump, America First, toward really things that Vought has been trying to do since long before Donald Trump has been on the political scene. I'm talking 20, 30 years back in time. So he stays loyal to the president, and he spends those four years between the two Trump presidencies remaining close to the president, saying that the 2020 election was stolen. And that gives him the ability to come back in office this time and have far more influence and leeway to do what he wants to do than he did even the first time around.GROSS: You learned through previously unreported recordings of briefings by the think tank that he started during the Biden presidency, Citizens for Renewing America, that Vought had pressured members of the Freedom Caucus to ban critical race theory in schools. Where does that figure into his larger, like, political plan to expand the executive office?KROLL: Vought has spent nearly 30 years working in Washington and has toiled away as a staffer on Capitol Hill, as an activist for the Heritage Action group and then, of course, in the Trump administration to try to find ways to convince the public to rally behind - and then members of Congress to actually shrink the size of the federal government in a dramatic way. These were always arguments being had about the debt, the deficit, the specific dollar amount of these programs.What I learned in my reporting, largely drawing on these recordings that I obtained for this story, is that Vought comes to this realization that he has to link together the culture war and the fiscal wonky budgetary agenda if he's going to be successful. It's not enough to just talk about impoundment, to talk about how much this or that program costs. You need to come up with a way that makes that program feel wrong on a cultural level. He comes up with this phrase, woke and weaponized. Programs that have anything to do with diversity are too woke. The Justice Department and the FBI are weaponized. It becomes a very sticky talking point. And I think it's a real inflection point for him, where he brings together these two parts of his worldview and the larger MAGA agenda so that the public, or at least the president's followers, are along with him. They support, they understand why we're going after clean energy funding or why we're going after the community developmental financial institution - these wonky agencies that are now tagged as being too woke or they're being weaponized.GROSS: We have to take another break here, so let me reintroduce you. My guest is Andy Kroll, an investigative reporter for ProPublica covering the Justice Department and the judiciary. He has an article in The New Yorker in collaboration with ProPublica about Russell Vought titled \"Donald Trump's Deep-State Wrecking Ball.\" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF ANORAAK SONG, \"HERE YOU GO\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday with Andy Kroll, an investigative journalist covering the Justice Department and the judiciary at ProPublica. He's been investigating Russell Vought, the person behind Trump's dismantling of federal agencies and expanding the power of the presidency. Vought is the director of the Office of Management and Budget and an architect of Project 2025. He's the subject of Kroll's article in The New Yorker in collaboration with ProPublica titled \"Donald Trump's Deep-State Wrecking Ball.\"Russell Vought describes himself as a Christian nationalist. And he says, of course I describe myself that way. I'm a Christian, and I'm a nationalist. But when you say Christian nationalist, the implication is - or the definition is usually that you want to define America as a Christian nation. So to what extent does Russell Vought want to define America as a Christian nation? Like, what is - does he have a vision of what a Christian nation would be?KROLL: He's talked about this in private settings - what that actually means that we are a Christian nation 'cause he very much believes that. He has said that repeatedly. He talks about it in a couple of ways. For instance, he has argued that if we are a Christian nation, then our immigration system should reflect that and there should be more vetting of people who want to come to this country legally, whether they believe Christianity or not. He has said, why would we let someone into this country who, for instance, believes in Sharia law? So that's one approach - you know, who do we even let into the country?He's also talked at great length about Judeo-Christian values and teachings informing the work of people in public office, people who make policies, people who work not only in Congress but also in the executive branch and in the bureaucracy. How do you get policies that flow from Judeo-Christian worldviews? How do you make the legislative process more influenced by a Judeo-Christian worldview? For him, to go by his own words, that would mean that things like same-sex marriage are not compatible with that Judeo-Christian worldview and shouldn't exist. Abortion rights, in any form, not compatible with that Judeo-Christian worldview value system is how he's put it. He uses this term actual truth. I think it's a - kind of a biblical truth notion when he talks about how do we more integrate this specific Judeo-Christian value system with the functioning of our American government? It's a longer-term idea, obviously, but it's something that I think is really central to his own worldview.GROSS: So Vought calls himself a radical constitutionalist. What does he mean by that?KROLL: He means that the president has dramatically more powers than presidents have traditionally used, that the executive branch has far greater authority to exert the president's will and to freeze or block the work of Congress and that these independent agencies that have for so long operated without presidential or political interference should, in fact, be very much under the control at the direction of the White House. That, in his view, is what the founders intended. Hence, the name radical constitutionalists. That, of course, is not what many legal scholars and many administrations before this one have believed in how they have acted.GROSS: What do you think are the permanent or at least the long-term changes that Vought will leave behind?KROLL: The feeling that working for the federal government, that public service is not a safe and stable way to create a career, to be part of this larger American project, I think is a really major consequence and impact of what he's done. I think he has pushed the legal bounds of what the president can do to exert his will, talking about the funding freezes, talking about checking Congress' power of the purse, using the executive branch to choke off funding or redirect it in other - to other places that are more in line with the president's agenda. Ultimately, I think the biggest consequences of Vought's actions are going to play out in front of the United States Supreme Court. So many of the changes, the policies, the executive powers that Vought has exercised in just this year alone are likely going to end up in legal battles before the conservative supermajority in the Supreme Court. How the high court rules in those cases could lead to quite a radically different looking executive branch and even a dramatic set of changes to how we understand our three-part Democratic government working.GROSS: Andy Kroll, thank you so much for your research, and thank you for being on our show.

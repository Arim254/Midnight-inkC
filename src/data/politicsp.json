    "body": "\n      What does President Trump's base think of his second-term agenda? How will they vote in November? We road-tripped through conservative counties in Maryland, New York and Pennsylvania to find out.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  President Trump is one year into his second term at a moment when many scholars and historians and a growing number of voters say Trump has wielded power in ways that are shaking the foundations of American democracy. We wanted to hear how some of Trump's core supporters view his performance so far, so we sent NPR's Brian Mann on a road trip through conservative counties in the eastern U.S.BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: It is a messy, gray, snowy winter morning, and I'm heading first on this trip to Elkton, Maryland, a little town that voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump. The goal today, through what really is Trump country, is to talk to people, to ask how they feel about how this is going.(SOUNDBITE OF DOOR OPENING)MANN: The town's Main Street is mostly empty, but I find Ann Marie Hamilton working in an office and arts nonprofit. She loves President Trump.ANN MARIE HAMILTON: I want to be proud of him, and I was the first time he was in office.MANN: Right away, I hear this deep, personal loyalty, but also uncertainty. For Hamilton, the big question in Trump's second term is affordability, grocery prices and her electric bill.HAMILTON: Prices are high enough that it stings like crazy. Like, you know, he ran his campaign, and we're all like, yay. And yay didn't happen yet.MANN: I ask if Hamilton sees any Democratic leaders offering better ideas, and she shakes her head. She tells me the Democratic brand is dead.HAMILTON: Yeah, broken. Nothing's resonating.AUTOMATED VOICE: Seven twenty-seven east.MANN: My next stop is Milford, a little town in Pike County, a place so conservative some locals call it Trump County, Pennsylvania. Like my other stops, Milford is mostly rural and overwhelmingly white. There's a nasty snowstorm, so the downtown is empty, but I find a little diner, where one of the waitresses, Tina Howell, tells me she thinks Trump is great, but she thinks he's focusing too much overseas.TINA HOWELL: He needs to start worrying about America first.MANN: What about the question of affordability? Have you started to feel any real improvement there?HOWELL: No. Nothing. I think it's getting tighter, actually, for people. Around here it is, in this town.MANN: So some real criticism. But Howell, too, says the Democratic Party isn't offering her choices. She can't name a single Democrat she likes or trusts. It's important to say my approach on this road trip isn't scientific. I'm spending time with random Trump voters in conservative towns. A poll released yesterday by YouGov and The Economist found 1 in 4 Republican voters think the country is on the wrong track under Trump. And I hear some of those doubts. But broadly, people tell me they're comfortable with Trump's use of federal power, including his controversial crackdown on immigrants.My final stop is Whitehall in Washington County, New York, where two-thirds of voters backed Trump in the last election. I meet Frank Juckett, a former Marine, outside the American Legion Hall. He says Trump is an improvement over the Democrats and Joe Biden.FRANK JUCKETT: Better than what we had.MANN: OK. So report card - what's your grade?JUCKETT: A B+.MANN: Pretty much so far, so good.JUCKETT: So far.MANN: While we talk, Juckett echoes many criticisms of Trump, saying he, too, wants the president focused on domestic issues and the economy, not things like Greenland and Venezuela. Juckett tells me he sees Trump as a bully. At one point, he compares Trump's style to that of Russian President Vladimir Putin.JUCKETT: If they're really good and crooked, things get done. And if they're not, they get stepped on.MANN: So the fact that he's kind of a rough character, that's a good thing.JUCKETT: Yes, I think so.MANN: So here's the takeaway. After this first year, many people in Trump's base talk about him critically. I hear skepticism, questions, even some harsh judgments of Trump's character. Several people tell me they want less chaos, less drama. But I also hear deep distrust of the Democrats, and every Trump voter I talked to while in these conservative rural counties say they're willing to give him more time to make their lives better.Brian Mann, NPR News in Whitehall, New York.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

Tim Walz, expanding the agency's probe alleging that Minnesota officials conspired to impede law enforcement amid the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.   Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her have also been subpoenaed. NPR has not yet confirmed reports that other state and local leaders have also been issued subpoenas.   Frey's subpoena requires him to appear in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis on Feb. 3. The mayor accused the federal government of weaponizing its power to intimidate local leaders.   \n   \"We shouldn't have to live in a country where people fear that federal law enforcement will be used to play politics or crack down on local voices they disagree with,\" he said in a statement.   Earlier Tuesday, U.S. Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino appeared with ICE leader Marcos Charles in a news briefing criticizing Minnesota leaders and defending the work of immigration officers.    \"They're everyday people doing a very hard job, trying to enforce the immigration laws in an environment where local and state politicians have been spreading rhetoric that dehumanizes these officers and agents,\" Charles said.     Protesters in Minnesota have roiled against Immigration and Customs Enforcement after one of its agents shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Macklin Good earlier this month.   \"Less than two weeks ago, federal agents shot and killed a Minnesotan in broad daylight,\" Ellison said in a statement. \"Now, instead of seriously investigating the killing of Renee Good, Trump is weaponizing the justice system against any leader who dares stand up to him.\"   During a White House press briefing Tuesday, President Trump discussed ICE tactics and Good's shooting.    \"They're going to make mistakes. Sometimes ICE is going to be too rough with somebody, or, you know, they're dealing with rough people,\" Trump said. \"Are they going to make a mistake sometimes? It can happen. I feel terribly. I felt horribly when I was told that the young woman who was, who had the tragedy. It's a tragedy. It's a horrible thing.\"   \n   Ellison said the DOJ is asking for records and documents related to his office's work regarding federal immigration enforcement. He pointed out that this action comes shortly after his office sued the Trump administration over ICE's tactics in the region.   \"Let's be clear about why this is happening: Donald Trump is coming after the people of Minnesota and I'm standing in his way,\" Ellison said. \"I will not be intimidated, and I will not stop working to protect Minnesotans from Trump's campaign of retaliation and revenge.\"   NPR has reached out to the White House for comment on the DOJ subpoenas, but has not yet received a response\n",

    "body": "\n      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent is seen in Park Ridge, Ill., Sept. 19, 2025.\n                \n                    Erin Hooley/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Erin Hooley/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Just 10 years ago, the annual budget for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, was less than $6 billion — notably smaller than other agencies within the Department of Homeland Security. But ICE's budget has skyrocketed during President Trump's second term, becoming the highest-funded U.S. law enforcement agency, with $85 billion now at its disposal.   The windfall is thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, enacted last July. After hovering around the $10 billion mark for years, ICE's budget suddenly benefited from a meteoric spike.   \"With this new bill and other appropriations, it's larger than the annual budget of all other federal law enforcement agencies combined,\" said Lauren-Brooke Eisen, senior director of the justice program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan policy institute.   \n   ICE is now the lead agency in President's Trump immigration crackdown, sending thousands of agents into U.S. communities. As its funding and profile has grown as part of those efforts, ICE has come under increasing criticism for its officers' actions, from masked agents randomly stopping, questioning, and detaining people and thrusting them into unmarked vehicles to the recent killing of Renee Macklin Good in Minneapolis.   \n   A cycle of more migrants, more money and a larger ICE mission   ICE's sudden growth spurt follows roughly two decades of relatively modest funding since 2003, when the agency was created by merging the U.S. Customs Service with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. In 2015, for instance, Congress approved a budget of around $5.96 billion, which was nearly $1 billion less than then-President Barack Obama had requested.   \n   In 2019, during the first Trump administration, border control officer's encounters with migrants attempting authorized entry to the U.S. spiked. Those numbers then plummeted as the COVID-19 pandemic prompted invocation of the Title 42 public health law, allowing CBP to expel migrants more quickly, with restricted pathways to asylum.   Encounters rose sharply under former President Joe Biden and soared above 3.2 million in 2023, when Biden lifted Title 42. By late 2024, fewer migrants were arriving at the border, due to U.S. asylum limits and Mexico bolstering enforcement.   When Trump returned to the White House in 2025, he sought to empower immigration authorities to quickly remove migrants and announced a crackdown led by ICE.   \n   Under the 2025 law, ICE has a $75 billion supplement that it can take as long as four years to spend, along with its base budget of around $10 billion. If the agency spends that money at a steady pace and current funding levels continue, it would have nearly $29 billion on hand each year. That essentially triples ICE's total budget from recent years.   To give that large number a sense of scale, consider that the Trump administration's 2026 appropriations request for the entire Justice Department, including the FBI, stands at a little over $35 billion.   \n   The Trump administration has set lofty goals for ICE, aiming to deport 1 million people each year. And the One Big Beautiful Bill Act also allocates $45 billion for ICE to expand its immigration detention system — Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last June that the agency will be able to hold up to 100,000 people in custody daily. By comparison, the federal Bureau of Prisons currently holds over 153,000 inmates.   As of Nov. 30, 65,735 people were held in immigration detention, according to the data tracking project Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.   With those metrics in mind, ICE went on a hiring spree in 2025, fueled by its bigger budget. In just one year, the agency says, it \"more than doubled our officers and agents from 10,000 to 22,000.\" (The Office of Personnel Management, which tracks federal workforce statistics, is only updated through Nov. 30 and does not reflect any hiring made by the DHS in the last quarter of the year.)   According to the DHS, ICE received 220,000 applications in 2025, thanks in part to a generous incentive package with perks like a signing bonus of up to $50,000, disbursed over the course of a five-year commitment, and up to $60,000 in student loan repayment.   ICE is still on that hiring spree, looking to hire deportation officers in at least 25 cities around the U.S., according to a job listing on the USA Jobs website that will remain active through the end of September. The starting salary for an ICE deportation officer in the Enforcement and Removal Operations division, or ERO, ranges from $51,632 up to $84,277.   \n   The dramatic growth came in the same year that the Trump administration sharply reduced the number of federal workers, firing thousands of employees and inviting many more to resign.   What else will the new funds be spent on?    With base level funding for DHS and ICE due to expire at the end of January, Democrats in Congress are calling for changes to how ICE operates. It comes after a year in which deaths of people in ICE custody spiked to the highest levels in decades, with ICE reporting seven deaths in December, and three more in 2026, as of Jan. 16.   ICE's increased budget makes sense to Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the right-wing Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group advocating for lower levels of immigration. He says the funding boost \" is directly commensurate with the size of the task the agency is addressing.\"   \n   \"ICE exists to find and remove people who are in the country illegally,\" Mehlman said, referring to a category that grew when the Trump administration stripped legal status from 1.6 million immigrants in 2025.   The focus of the new spending reflects President Trump's emphasis on arrests and removals, said Margy O'Herron, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center's liberty and national security program who worked at the DOJ in the Biden administration.   O'Herron said she agrees with the idea that, for years, a reasonable case could be made that DHS agencies such as ICE and CBP needed more money. But other parts of the immigration system aren't getting as much help, she said.   \"All of the money is going to enforcement to arrest, to detain and to deport,\" she said. \"It's not going to things like immigration hearings or immigration judges, to conduct additional review of whether or not somebody should be in the country. And that is a real problem for the system.\"\n",

President Trump has been texting world leaders, and they have been texting him.MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  In one message, Trump told Norway's prime minister that he's trying to seize Greenland in part because he did not receive a Nobel Peace Prize. That was Trump's explanation for shaking the most important U.S. alliance and disrupting the world order. Overnight, Trump shared messages he received. One comes from France's president, who tries flattery on Trump but then raises the issue of Greenland and proposes to discuss it over dinner.INSKEEP: Now, world leaders meet face-to-face at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben is covering all this. Danielle, good morning.DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning.INSKEEP: What's the U.S. delegation doing in Europe?KURTZLEBEN: Well, today, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will be speaking in Davos, then Trump is scheduled to talk on Wednesday. And then on Thursday, there's what the White House is calling a charter announcement for the Board of Peace that Trump created to oversee reconstruction in Gaza after the conflict he's been trying to end between Israel and Hamas. In terms of substance, we don't know much yet. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett has suggested that Trump will unveil a new housing policy. Beyond that, we know he likes to talk about tariffs. And days ago, he threatened to tariff goods from eight European countries until the U.S. has a deal to acquire Greenland.INSKEEP: OK. Thank you for raising that. For those who didn't follow the news over the holiday, what were these threats about tariffs?KURTZLEBEN: Well, Trump posted that he's going to impose 10% tariffs on those eight countries starting on February 1, then raise it to 25% in June - that is, until a Greenland deal happens. Now, we don't really know details here. I've asked the White House, for example, what law would even authorize this, and I haven't received word yet. But those European countries, meanwhile, they're all NATO members, and they've all said they stand in full solidarity with fellow NATO member Denmark, as well as with Greenland, which is part of the kingdom of Denmark.INSKEEP: And Trump has certainly drawn all attention to himself once again with these threats, including personal messages with world leaders. What are these text messages?KURTZLEBEN: Well, maybe most famously over the weekend, Trump texted the Norwegian prime minister that because Trump didn't get the Nobel Peace Prize, he no longer feels the need to think, quote, \"purely of peace,\" adding that the U.S. should have total control over Greenland. Now, of course, the Norwegian government does not decide who gets that prize. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly elaborated to NPR that Greenland is important for national security and that Trump thinks, quote, \"Greenlanders would be better served if protected by the United States.\" That's, of course, certainly not how everyone sees it. In that overnight message from French President Emmanuel Macron that you mentioned, he said at one point, I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland.INSKEEP: A fascinating message also mixed in some flattery. You're doing a great job in Syria.KURTZLEBEN: Right.INSKEEP: Let's get together for dinner. But this is not the only thing Trump is doing on the world stage. There's also that Board of Peace you mentioned, which is what?KURTZLEBEN: Well, that is something that Trump laid out when he talked about how he wants to solve the conflict between Israel and Hamas. And that announcement - that charter announcement that the White House talked about is happening on Thursday. We've learned more about that charter recently. According to a copy obtained by NPR, permanent seats will cost nations a billion dollars each, and Trump is set to be the permanent chair. And as our colleague Daniel Estrin has reported, the charter says there's a need for a more effective international peace-building body, which makes some fear that the board is attempting to create a rival to the U.N. So we're keeping a close eye on that. Russia says Trump has asked President Vladimir Putin to sign on as part of the board. So it's unclear what he'll do and what traditional U.S. allies will do.INSKEEP: OK. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. Thanks so much - really appreciate it.KURTZLEBEN: Of course.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

    "body": "\n      President Trump held court with reporters for more than 90 minutes marking the first year anniversary of his second term.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  Today marks the one-year anniversary of President Trump's return to office. He marked the occasion by making a surprise appearance at the White House press briefing. Trump spoke for 80 minutes before taking a question. And for a president who knows how to make news, he made surprisingly little even with a room full of reporters.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Wow, that's a big crowd.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: It's a lot of people. I think it's, like, a record.DETROW: This all occurred just before Trump heads to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where Europeans are frantically trying to head off conflict over Trump's insistence that the U.S. takes over Greenland from Denmark. NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith is here to break it down. Hey, Tam.TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hi, Scott.DETROW: A lot of words from President Trump today. What should we take from it?KEITH: President Trump came into the room carrying a large document titled 365 Wins In 365 Days. But what he delivered was not a concise recitation of wins. Instead, it was a low-energy and very long monologue where he complained that his message just isn't getting through to people.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Maybe I have the bad public relations people, but we're not getting it across.KEITH: In fact, he said that's why he was doing this press conference. Like so many presidents before him, he thinks that he is his own best messenger.DETROW: And like so many presidents before, I mean, seems frustrated with how the message is getting out. So I'm curious, do you think this message got through today?KEITH: Yeah, he certainly held the cable airwaves for a long time, nearly two hours. But he said so much about so many things, repeating the same jokes and falsehoods that he comes back to again and again, that it would be hard to pick out what his precise point was. For quite a while, he was up there just holding pieces of paper with pictures of criminals he says have been arrested in the immigration raids in Minnesota. At one point, he even had an extended back and forth with himself about the ferocity of a binder clip.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: And this is something - oh, I'm glad my finger wasn't in that sucker. That could have done some damage, but you know what? I wouldn't have shown the pain.KEITH: It was just Trump unfiltered.DETROW: I mean, this comes at a time where there's a lot of major issues that Trump is facing. He took questions for 25 minutes. Did he get pressed on any of these issues, like Greenland or tariffs?KEITH: He did. And as he often does, he left his options open. His answers on questions about NATO, Iran, Panama and Greenland were all a little, like, trying to pin down Jell-O. Here's what he said when he was asked about how far he would go to get Greenland.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: I think that we will work something out where NATO is going to be very happy and where we're going to be very happy. But we need it for security purposes. We need it for national security and even world security.KEITH: You know, in the middle of the night last night, Trump was on a social media tear where, among other things, he boosted the idea that NATO is the real problem, not Russia and China. He didn't bring any of that same inflammatory language or energy to the briefing room. And when asked about his relationship with European leaders Emmanuel Macron of France and Keir Starmer of the U.K., both of whom were quite pointed in their criticism of him, Trump said they are friends.DETROW: Tam, Trump talks to the press a lot. What was different about today?KEITH: You know, in the second Trump era, the briefing room is now packed not just with mainstream journalists from the nation's largest news organizations, but also with influencers who make no secret of how much they love the president. At one point, he was asked if God would be happy with his first year in office. He said, yes, he thinks, quote, \"God is very proud of the job I've done.\" So this press conference definitely covered it all.DETROW: NPR's Tamara Keith, thanks so much.KEITH: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Scott Detrow speaks to Ashley Parker of The Atlantic about her essay recapping how President Trump's relentless boundary-pushing has exhausted his critics.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  Today, speaking in Europe, President Trump told an audience of global leaders that for now at least, he has decided the United States will not try to acquire Greenland by military force.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: 'Cause people thought I would use force. I don't have to use force. I don't want to use force. I won't use force.DETROW: The fact that I just read this sentence tells you a lot about the state of the Trump administration now a full year in. In international relations, tariffs, immigration enforcement, federal spending, federal prosecution, sending the military into cities and many more areas, Trump has repeatedly said and done things that were previously assumed to be unacceptable to voters. As Ashley Parker wrote in The Atlantic this week, the Trump administration has pushed the window of what is possible in American politics so far that his opposition just seems exhausted. Ashley, thank you for joining us again.ASHLEY PARKER: Thanks for having me.DETROW: I want to start with the title of your essay. The president has had this term for critics for years now that they suffer from Trump derangement syndrome. And you wrote that there's been so little meaningful resistance this term that we might think about Trump exhaustion syndrome instead. Can you tell me more about what you're thinking about with that?PARKER: Yeah, what I was really trying to explore with this piece one year into his second term was sort of the boiling frog theory of American politics. And I should say upfront that this theory is apocryphal. It's not actually true, but I think it works for our purposes.DETROW: Yes.PARKER: Which is - the way it goes is that if you drop a frog in boiling water, it will hop out. But if you put a frog in lukewarm water and slowly turn up the heat, it will not know to jump out because the changes will be so incremental and gradual, and it will boil to death.DETROW: I think you also gave a really good example when you talked about the boiling frog. You walk through the series of events leading up to the seizure of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela. Can you recap kind of how we got from point A to point B without any of the steps feeling overly dramatic?PARKER: Sure. So it really starts back when - in 2015 when Trump comes to national prominence as a politician in a campaign launch speech that demonizes immigrants broadly as, you know, criminals, rapists, not the best among us, people who are bringing drugs across the border. So he has been getting the country comfortable for a long time with the idea that undocumented immigrants are dangerous and they're a problem. But going to this term with Venezuela, he uses a fairly obscure wartime powers act, the Alien Enemies Act, to essentially declare that we are at war with Venezuela, specifically a Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua. And because we are at war with them, we're able to take certain wartime liberties to deport Venezuelans.DETROW: And a lot of opinion polls along the way showed that, by and large, a lot of these steps did have broad, if not a majority - you know, from time to time, a good chunk of Americans were on board with each of these steps.PARKER: Exactly. Now, there might be images they see of what this actually looks like that they kind of cringe at, but yeah, broadly, they support this. Then he begins a series of strikes on boats in the Caribbean and east Pacific oceans off the coast of Venezuela. And yes, a lot of these boats that are targeted, there are drugs on them. But it is not, as the president has claimed, you know, a huge mob or cartel boss headed to the United States. In some cases, these are small fishing boats, people who are petty criminals, bringing small amounts of cocaine, not to the United States but to neighboring islands like Trinidad. But again, I was talking to someone in the White House, and they said, look, if you ask the average American - should we blow up a boat with drugs on it headed to the United States? - they say, yes.DETROW: And that all sets the stage for the most recent seizure of another country's president...PARKER: Correct.DETROW: ...Who's brought to the United States and put on trial. And maybe, as Steve Bannon put it, a lot of people who read The Atlantic are upset about this. But maybe Americans are actually on board with a lot of this and the pushback to steps toward authoritarianism is a lot different than maybe what we thought it would be in high school social studies.PARKER: Yeah, that's exactly right. A slide towards authoritarianism, you know, when you talk to experts about this, including some of my colleagues, is - people sort of imagine it like the movie version, where there's, you know, men in jackboots marching in the streets and tanks rolling. And that's not really how it often starts. It's sort of a slow slide of getting people comfortable with things that they never thought they would be comfortable with.DETROW: I mean, what is your sense a year into the second term, reporting this story and many other stories? Do you have a sense of what you think Trump's end goals are? Is it, I want to tear down democratic norms, or is it something more straightforward of, I want to be a notable, famous president, or is it even more moment to moment and topic to topic than that? Like, how do you think about this?PARKER: I don't think he has a particular pointed desire to tear down democratic norms. What - essentially, he wants to do what he wants to do, unconstrained by laws and norms and the Constitution. And when he took office the first time, Congress could prevent that from happening. Sometimes a single senator, sometimes a single senator from his own party, could foil something he cared deeply about, and that things like the Geneva Conventions and NATO alliances could get in the way with what he wanted to do. And in many ways, these guardrails worked. And in his second term, he is just unconstrained and doing what he wants to do. And if it means shattering democratic norms, he's more than happy to bulldoze through them, but that's sort of an inadvertent symptom, not the end goal.DETROW: Yeah. Ashley Parker is a staff writer at The Atlantic. Thank you so much.PARKER: Yeah, thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Today's top stories   President Trump plans to focus on affordability today in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. But his foreign policy — specifically, Trump's desire to acquire Greenland — and his threats of tariffs on eight European countries if he doesn't get his way are overshadowing the summit. When the president takes the stage, world leaders will be paying close attention to signs of where this confrontation with allies goes next.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                This photograph, taken on Jan. 20, 2026, shows the logo of the World Economic Forum in the Alpine resort of Davos.

She adds that, for his second term, Trump is pursuing a belligerent foreign policy that alienates allies and lacks domestic popularity. Kurtzleben says these actions, along with his aggressive tactics in Minnesota, are drawing attention away from the domestic economy, which Trump wants to focus on.   The Justice Department has issued grand jury subpoenas to multiple government officials in Minnesota, including Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. The agency is alleging that state officials conspired to impede law enforcement amid the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.    \n   🎧 Minnesota officials suggest the subpoenas do not faze them, says NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán. They say that these actions are an intimidation tactic by the administration that is weaponizing the DOJ. Officials say they pushed back against the administration's immigration crackdown because of what they say are the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency's illegal actions in their state. This includes ICE agents intimidating the people who follow them to alert neighbors to their presence. Day-to-day lives in Minnesota continue to be impacted as dozens of doctors in the state say patients are avoiding the medical care they may need because they fear ICE.   The U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments today regarding Trump's efforts to break with 112 years of law by firing Lisa Cook. Cook is a member of the Federal Reserve's governing board, appointed by former President Joe Biden.    🎧 The president's lawyers are expected to tell the Supreme Court that he is not looking for a free pass to fire Cook, but instead fired her for cause, says NPR's Nina Totenberg. The administration claims she committed mortgage fraud when she obtained loans on two different properties because she listed two homes as her primary residences, but at different times. Cook denies any wrongdoing. The Trump administration argues the court cannot review a president's decision to fire a Fed board member once he determines he has cause. This caveat would essentially grant him unrestricted power to purge the Fed and install personal picks, Totenberg says.   \n   Today's listen   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Boundaries, bodies, and better sex in 2026\n                \n                    Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   What does sexual safety look like these days?

One year in, gasoline prices are down about 20%, but electricity prices are going up. The Trump administration has also invested in nuclear power, which could help reduce costs in the long term. Take a look at how he has delivered on his goals:    ➡️ Presidents don't decide gas prices. The cost of crude oil is the biggest factor. A global oversupply of oil largely drove cheaper crude oil prices this past year.➡️ Electricity prices are increasing due to three primary reasons: an aging power grid, the cost of natural disasters and higher fuel costs, says Charles Hua, who runs the national energy consumer education nonprofit Powerlines.➡️ The administration has ended federal tax credits for large solar and wind projects, which provide more cost-competitive energy than natural gas, nuclear and coal projects.   3 things to know before you go   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A general view of the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 10, 2026.

Her embattled status as an interim federal prosecutor led to the dismissal of controversial Justice Department cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.   \n   Trump named Halligan to the Virginia post on Sept. 21, 2025 — one day after Erik Siebert, the district's former acting U.S. attorney, resigned under pressure from Trump, including repeated calls for criminal charges against James, Comey and others Trump perceived as enemies.   Federal judges repeatedly stated that Halligan, who once worked as a personal attorney for Trump, had no valid basis to identify herself as the acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, ruling that her predecessor, Siebert, had already exhausted the 120-day period for an acting federal prosecutor.   \n   To legally occupy the job now, federal judges said, Halligan or any other potential prosecutor must be either Senate confirmed or appointed by a District Court.   Halligan and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi rejected the courts' interpretation in strong terms, saying in a court filing last week that U.S. District Judge David J. Novak was \"flat wrong\" and overstepping judicial powers.   \n   Novak's response, issued Tuesday, was equally forceful, stating that any attempt by the administration to fill the prosecutor post by appointment would violate U.S. law \"and the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\"   \"In short, this charade of Ms. Halligan masquerading as the United States Attorney for this District in direct defiance of binding court orders must come to an end,\" the judge wrote.   In a Tuesday post on X, Bondi said Halligan's 120-day appointment to the job had expired and blamed her departure from the prosecutor's office on Senate Democrats and \"multiple, unnecessary legal obstacles.\" She said Halligan, 36, \"will continue to serve her country in other ways.\"   After Trump announced her appointment, Halligan rapidly secured criminal indictments against both Comey and James — each of whom pleaded not guilty. The Justice Department charged Comey with making false statements and obstructing a congressional proceeding, in connection with his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee. James was charged with bank fraud and making a false statement.   \n   But Halligan's contested job status threw the work of the prosecutor's office into turmoil after U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie ruled that her appointment was unlawful. Because of Halligan's \"defective appointment\" and prominent role in prosecuting Comey and James, Currie ruled, the indictments were set aside.   \n   The Eastern District of Virginia is headquartered in Alexandria. As its U.S. Attorney's Office website notes, numerous influential jurists have held the top prosecutor's job there, including John Marshall, who went on to become chief justice of the Supreme Court.   As NPR reported in November, Halligan had previously drawn notice for her involvement in the Trump administration's review of more than half a dozen Smithsonian Institution museums, with the goal of aligning their cultural messages with the president.\n",

James Comer, R-Ky. (pictured right), and ranking member Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., confer during a hearing Wednesday on whether to hold former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in contempt of Congress.\n                \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Win McNamee/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The House Oversight Committee voted on Wednesday to hold former President Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in criminal contempt of Congress after the couple defied a congressional subpoena. The testimony demand was filed in connection with the panel's investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein case.   The panel's GOP members said they gave the Clintons plenty of chances to appear, but they refused to show for their scheduled, closed-door depositions last week. The Clintons have called the subpoenas legally invalid and said they have already shared with the committee what \"little information\" they know.    \n   House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., defended the effort, quoting Democrats who have said no one is above the law.   \"This Committee has acted in good faith. We've offered flexibility on scheduling,\" Comer argued ahead of the vote. \"The response we received was not cooperation, but defiance, marked by repeated delays, excuses and obstruction.\"   The move marks the GOP-led committee's first referral for contempt charges, underscoring the deep, partisan divide that has dominated the fight over the Epstein case. With the committee's approval, the issue will head next to the full House. If the House approves the referrals, they would move to the Justice Department for potential prosecution.   The committee voted 34-8 to hold the former president in contempt, with two members voting present. Nine Democrats joined with Republicans to advance the measure, highlighting internal tensions over what is more important: transparency in the Epstein case or defending two of their party's past standard bearers from a perceived partisan attack. Three Democrats voted to hold Hillary Clinton in contempt.    Democrats who opposed the contempt charges used Wednesday's hearing to argue that the vote amounted to little more than political score settling.   \"It's this subpoena only that Republicans and the chairman have been obsessed about putting all their energy behind,\" said California Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the panel.   \n   For example, former U.S. attorneys general Eric Holder, Loretta Lynch, Jeff Sessions and Merrick Garland also did not appear after receiving subpoenas — and none of them has been held in contempt. Comer said that was because they submitted written testimony and did not recall any information relevant to the investigation.   Garcia said the Clintons have turned over information to the committee, and offered alternatives to testify under a different format. Garcia urged Republicans to instead negotiate an interview with President Clinton, noting that he was willing to cooperate.   Democrats also argued that Republicans are not serious about the Epstein probe, noting that the Department of Justice has failed to fully cooperate with a legal mandate to release its tranche of files from investigations into the late sex offender.   \"We all agree, we all want to hear from former President Bill Clinton,\" said Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., said. \"But committee Republicans have failed to conduct a serious investigation.\"   Comer sought to push back throughout the hearing, saying Republicans are working to get to the bottom of the Epstein case. He noted that on Feb. 9, the panel will virtually interview Epstein's longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is being held at a federal prison in Texas after she was convicted for sex trafficking of a minor and conspiracy. Also, Attorney General Pam Bondi will appear in a public hearing before the House Judiciary Committee next month.   Contempt of Congress is a rare charge, though it has been used successfully in several high-profile cases. During the Biden administration, two close allies of President Trump, Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro, each served four months in prison after failing to cooperate with Democrats for their investigation into the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n",

Further information will be made available as discussions progress,\" he said in his Truth Social post.   The announcement — a marked backing off of the heated rhetoric from Trump preceding the conference — was a culmination of a day that began by with him ruling out military force to take over Greenland.   \n   \"We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force where we would be, frankly, unstoppable. But I won't do that,\" he said during his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.   \"That's probably the biggest statement I made, because people thought I would use force, but I don't have to use force — I don't want to use force. I won't use force,\" he said.   In his address, Trump went beyond his desire for Greenland and slammed European values as inferior to the values he is attempting to impose on the United States.   \"Certain places in Europe are not recognizable anymore. They're not recognizable,\" he said. \"In recent decades, it became conventional wisdom in Washington and European capitals that the only way to grow a modern Western economy was through ever-increasing government spending, unchecked mass migration and endless foreign imports.\"   The speech encapsulated a vision of the world where the importance of cooperation is dwarfed by the importance of self-interest, as well as economic and military strength.   Trump repeated his argument that U.S. ownership of Greenland is necessary for national security and that \"who the hell wants to defend a license agreement or lease, which is a large piece of ice in the middle of the ocean.\"   \n   The president referenced Greenland in that dismissive tone several times as a \"piece of ice\" that Denmark should be willing to give up. In the process, he also framed the U.S. as having a right to Greenland after the U.S. established a military presence there in World War II to protect it from invading Axis powers.   \"So we want a piece of ice for world protection, and they won't give it. We've never asked for anything else, and we could have kept that piece of land, and we didn't. So they have a choice. You can say yes and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no and we will remember,\" Trump said.   Trump said Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, \"and various others, as needed\" would be leading the Greenland framework negotiations.   Trump's antagonism toward allies in recent days   Just two weeks ago, Trump posted on social media that he'd address affordability when he spoke at the World Economic Forum.   But his belligerent foreign policy once again overshadowed his attempts at a cohesive economic message. Trump's aggressive push to acquire Greenland turned to open antagonism toward allies in the days leading up to this year's forum.   Just days before the forum began, Trump on social media threatened to tariff goods from eight European nations and NATO members until they supported a U.S. deal to purchase Greenland, which is an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark. In the following days, text messages revealed by Trump and other world leaders showed those leaders attempting to dissuade and placate Trump.   Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday delivered a forceful speech that, without mentioning Trump explicitly, argued that Trump's policies are leading to the breakdown of the international order.   \n   \"Let me be direct: We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition,\" Carney said. \"Great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons, tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited.\"   \"We stand firmly with Greenland and Denmark and fully support their unique right to determine Greenland's future. Our commitment to NATO's Article 5 is unwavering,\" he later added. \"Canada strongly opposes tariffs over Greenland.\"   Trump responded to Carney directly on Wednesday, saying: \"Canada gets a lot of freebies from us, by the way. They should be grateful also, but they're not. I watched your prime minister yesterday. He wasn't so grateful.\"   The foreign policy that Trump is bringing to Davos goes beyond Greenland. On Thursday, he will participate in what the White House is calling a Board of Peace charter announcement.   The Board of Peace is being created as part of Trump's 20-point plan to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas, and it has come under sharp criticism. A copy of the charter obtained by NPR said that countries that want permanent membership will have to pay $1 billion and that Trump is the permanent chair, even after he's president. The charter also says that the world needs a more effective international peace-building body, which may signal that the board is hoping to act as a rival to the United Nations.   The board's membership is still unsettled, but Trump said he has asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to take part. Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has said he will not join the board.   Economic messaging   Trump did eventually get to speaking about his efforts to tackle affordability in the United States. He called on Congress to pass a series of bills aimed at lowering costs, including bills on housing and capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year.   \n   Touting his executive order banning large institutional investors from buying single-family homes, he asked Congress to pass a law reinforcing the ban, saying, \"And I think they will.\"   He said that surging credit card debt was one of the biggest barriers to saving for a down payment and said Congress should pass the credit card interest rate cap.   \"This will help millions of Americans save for a home. They have no idea they're paying 28%. They go out there a little late in their payment, and they end up losing their house. It's terrible,\" he said.   Trump also touted the law he signed last year that helps ensure \"America remains the crypto capital of the world.\" He noted that Congress is continuing to work on legislation to regulate the crypto market, \"which I hope to sign very soon, unlocking new pathways for Americans to reach financial freedom.\"   The president also highlighted his work to lower prescription drug costs.   \n",

Legislators in most states want to regulate artificial intelligence and curb the sprawling, electricity-hungry data centers that make AI possible in the first place.   Big tech has \"scrambled the typical ideological alignments of the left and the right,\" says David Primo, a professor of political science and business administration at the University of Rochester in New York. \"Conservatives and liberals are saying, 'Well, here's an opportunity for us to stop what we think is a problem.'\"   \n   And while the two parties remain far apart on many issues — like tax policy, Primo says — it's not just big tech that has Republicans and Democrats aligned.   Regulating artificial intelligence   Ron DeSantis of Florida and Kathy Hochul of New York, two governors on opposite sides of the political spectrum, sound a lot alike when it comes to reining in AI.   DeSantis, a Republican, is backing legislation in Florida called the Artificial Intelligence Bill of Rights. The proposal, working its way through the state Senate, makes it illegal to use a person's name, image or likeness without their consent, requires anyone under 18 to have parental permission to engage with companion chatbots and mandates that bots remind users they're not talking to humans.   \"I really fear that if this is not addressed in an intelligent and proper way, you know, it could set off an age of darkness and deceit,\" DeSantis said when proposing the bill package. Tech companies have to be regulated, he says, because they have prioritized profits over user safety.   New York already requires chatbots to identify themselves as non-humans. This year, Hochul is pushing to further limit them. She wants to ban chatbots within social media apps for kids under 18. Other proposals would limit the way bots can interact with young people.   \n   \"We're going to disable certain companion features. You've heard about these, right?\" she asked an audience gathered at her high school alma mater earlier this year.   \"Under our proposals, we're removing that burden from parents and placing the responsibility where it belongs — on the shoulders of the app companies and the platforms themselves.\"   Late last year, Trump issued an executive order trying to prevent states from regulating AI on their own. But Republicans and Democrats in states are pressing ahead anyway. Nearly every state has a proposal to regulate AI. They range from requiring humans to oversee AI decisions about employees to blocking AI surveillance that could be used to set different prices for consumers.   Data center pushback    As the public's appetite for AI grows, so does the need for more data centers to handle the massive computing demands. That's a concern in states because data centers require substantial amounts of electricity and water to operate.   In Florida, lawmakers are raising issues about effects on the power grid and water use, and the possibility of passing higher utility costs along to residents, which the Republican-led state Senate is working to address. DeSantis says he thinks many of the arguments in favor of data centers, such as the idea that they'll drive job creation or lower property tax rates, are largely overblown.   South Dakota wants to make sure the state can't overrule local governments when it comes to regulating data centers. Oklahoma is also considering bills to limit the impact of data center growth.   As with the AI debate, Trump and most states have found themselves on opposite sides of the data center fight, too. Trump has largely been supportive of their growth, but says tech companies have to pay their own way. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, the president said, \"We're telling the major tech companies that they have the obligation to provide for their own power needs; they can build their own power plants as part of their factory.\" His administration wants to require tech companies building new centers to pay more for electricity to control price increases affecting consumers.   \n   Democratic lawmakers in New York and Maine are proposing a temporary ban on data centers, as are Republicans in Oklahoma.   The bill in New York is fairly new, but Hochul has announced the state's Public Service Commission will take a close look at the issue to ensure that data centers are \"paying their fair share.\"     In Colorado, a proposal would require data centers to use renewable energy for their operations. And many states, led by Republicans and Democrats alike, are considering expanding nuclear energy to help power AI.   Tech companies are opposing many of these proposals and putting money into political campaigns. They say it would be impossible to follow different laws in each state and that regulations could stifle innovation that could benefit the public.   Housing   Nationwide, the rising cost of housing is also a concern for both parties. In Florida, a bill to loosen restrictions on accessory dwelling units received full bipartisan support in the state Senate. DeSantis wants to address the affordable housing crisis by cutting property taxes. That isn't sitting well with Democrats in the state who say they worry about the impact on local governments. They say decreasing property insurance rates would be a better path.   Lawmakers in New York and other states are trying to streamline environmental regulations. Dozens of states are considering proposals to cut building regulations, strengthen tenants' rights and improve conditions in rental housing. In other words, when it comes to housing, lawmakers across the political spectrum are embracing ideas usually popular with one party or the other.\n",

In a few moments, we'll discuss all of this with John Bolton, a national security adviser in President Trump's first term. First, though, let's get the facts.MARTIN: NPR's Jane Arraf is following the talks from Amman, Jordan, and is with us now to tell us more. Good morning, Jane.JANE ARRAF, BYLINE: Good morning, Michel.MARTIN: So these are the third high-level talks between Iran and the U.S. in this round of negotiations over curbing Iran's nuclear program. If you would, just remind us about the background against which this is all taking place.ARRAF: So Israel attacked Iran last June, and those were followed by U.S. airstrikes just before scheduled negotiations. So that obviously put a halt, a dramatic halt, to those talks. These ones now are an even bigger deal because of the U.S. military buildup in the Middle East, the biggest since the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003. So those U.S. threats against Iran and the probable Iranian retaliation have raised what seems to be a very real risk of a wider war, and it has the entire region in a state of high alert. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke to reporters late Wednesday. He said he didn't know if today's talks were the key for a decision on military action, but he added this.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARCO RUBIO: It would be good if progress was made on Thursday. And I would say that the Iranian insistence on not discussing ballistic missiles is a big, big problem. I'll leave it at that.ARRAF: So in addition to uranium enrichment being discussed, the U.S. is demanding that Iran give up ballistic weapons as well.MARTIN: You know, it's interesting, Jane, that both sides seem to be tamping down expectations of any breakthrough today. So just give us a sense of the state of play and what can be accomplished.ARRAF: Sure. The Ammani foreign minister, who's mediating the talks, is going to relay the Iranian counterproposals that he received to the U.S. delegation this morning. That delegation is headed by Steve Witkoff, the billionaire real estate developer appointed by President Trump as his special Middle East envoy, and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. The Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said yesterday there was basis for some agreement with the U.S. on the nuclear issue, but he makes clear that ballistic missiles are not on the table. Iran has said that expecting it to give up its national defense assets is a demand driven by Israel, and he calls it a recipe for failure in negotiations. So bottom line, no breakthrough is expected today. But if more talks are scheduled, that itself is seen as progress.MARTIN: And this demand for no nuclear or ballistic weapons is not all that this administration wants from Iran. So tell us more about that.ARRAF: The administration's also demanding that Iran stop support for militant groups in other countries. It has demanded that it halt its crackdown on Iranian anti-government protests in which thousands of people, mostly protesters, have been killed by security forces. Limited protests restarted in Iran last weekend. Ultimately, though, there's that specter of toppling the regime. Trump in February said regime change in Iran would be the best thing that could happen. So that really is hanging over everything.MARTIN: That's NPR's Jane Arraf. Jane, thank you.ARRAF: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

But for all of his second term, President Trump has voiced an openness to unprecedented involvement by the federal government in those state processes.   \n   He has also continued to push false claims about noncitizen voter fraud — including during Tuesday night's State of the Union address — and those in his orbit have openly discussed the potential of immigration enforcement at voting locations.   \"We're going to have ICE surround the polls come November,\" said former Trump adviser Steve Bannon on his podcast earlier this month. \"We're not going to sit here and allow you to steal the country again.\"   Shortly after, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked about those comments and she responded that she \"can't guarantee\" that an ICE agent wouldn't be around a polling location in November.   All of that has led to deep concern from voting officials from both major political parties, who say they are actively preparing for some sort of federal interference in this year's midterms, though they have been hard-pressed to say what that involvement would look like. Those concerns were heightened after the recent FBI raid of the elections hub in Fulton County, Ga., which appears directly tied to debunked claims about Trump's loss in 2020.   \n   On Wednesday's midterm preparations call — which included representatives from the Justice Department, DHS, the Postal Service and other federal agencies — multiple Democratic secretaries of state asked questions that alluded to that uncertainty.   California's secretary of state, Democrat Shirley Weber, asked Honey, the DHS official, whether states would have advance notice if ICE agents were sent to polling places.   Honey responded by saying such a premise was \"disinformation.\"   The promise is especially notable coming from Honey, who comes from the election denial grassroots that sprouted out of Trump's false election claims in 2020. Before her current post at DHS, she worked closely with Trump's former attorney Cleta Mitchell to spread misinformation about the reliability of the country's voting systems.\n",

The rules slash requirements for security and environmental protections.\n                \n                    Idaho National Laboratory/Collage by Joan Wong for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Idaho National Laboratory/Collage by Joan Wong for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   The Department of Energy has made public a set of new rules that slash environmental and security requirements for experimental nuclear reactors.   Last month, NPR reported on the existence of the rules, which were quietly rewritten to accelerate development of a new generation of nuclear reactor designs.   The rule changes came about after President Trump signed an executive order calling for three or more of the experimental reactors to come online by July 4 of this year — an incredibly tight deadline in the world of nuclear power. The order led to the creation of a new Reactor Pilot Program at the Department of Energy.   \n   Commercial nuclear reactors have historically been regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which is known for its public process. The Energy Department rules had applied to a small number of experimental reactors on government property. The pilot program extends that authority to a larger set of experimental commercial designs. It also expands where those reactors can be built: several are under construction outside of the department's national laboratories.   To help facilitate Trump's deadline, Energy Department officials rewrote the internal rules. It shared the rules with ten companies who were part of the pilot program, but the rewritten rules, and even their existence, was not known to the public until NPR obtained copies of them.   The rules are now public on a website at Idaho National Laboratory, which is running the Reactor Pilot Program for the department. The website also contains standards and policy documents that were revised for the program.   \n   The laboratory notified NPR of their publication in response to a Freedom of Information Act request calling for their release.   \"DOE has recently completed the process of making these Nuclear Energy Orders and Standards publicly available to ensure broad public access,\" the Department of Energy wrote to NPR in a letter on Wednesday.   \"The U.S. Department of Energy posted the [Nuclear Energy] Orders earlier this year,\" an Energy Department spokesperson wrote to NPR in a separate statement. \"They collectively demonstrate the tremendous strides the Department has made under President Trump's leadership to modernize the DOE authorization process while maintaining safety and security standards.\"   \n   \"This is long overdue,\" said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"The public has the right to understand what the directives are that DOE is using to authorize these experimental reactors.\"   The rules, known as orders, define requirements for almost every aspect of the reactors' operations — including safety systems, environmental protections and site security.   NPR's review of the rules found substantial changes that experts warned had the potential to undermine safety, security and environmental protections at the new reactors. The orders slashed hundreds of pages of requirements for training guards and securing nuclear material. They also loosened protections for things like groundwater.    Loading... \n   In total, the new orders cut 750 pages from the earlier versions of the rules, according to NPR's analysis. That means roughly two-thirds of the original pages were eliminated.   In a statement responding to NPR's story in January, the Department of Energy said that early copies of the rules were shared with the companies as part of an \"iterative effort\" to develop a framework to \"expedite our review process while maintaining safety and security standards.\"    Loading... \n   (The orders seen by NPR in January were not marked as drafts and had the word \"Approved\" clearly displayed on their cover pages.)   In the month since NPR's original story, companies involved with the reactor program have rushed ahead with construction of their experimental designs. Two companies, Antares Nuclear and Radiant Industries, have announced they had completed a crucial step known as a Preliminary Documented Safety Analysis with the Energy Department regulators. Both companies say they are on track to start up their reactors this summer. A third called Aalo says it has completed its Final Design Review and hopes to finalize construction this summer.    Meanwhile, California-based Valar Atomics flew their reactor prototype on a military C-17 transport to Utah earlier this month. The Pentagon is looking to deploy small reactors to military bases as part of a separate program known as project Janus.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                An experimental reactor built by Valar Atomics sits inside a C-17 Globemaster. The Pentagon recently transported the reactor without its nuclear fuel from California to Hill Air Force Base in Utah.\n                \n                    Defense Department/Via X\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Defense Department/Via X\n    \n\n   \n   Lyman says he continues to be concerned that the new rules and tight deadlines threaten safety.   \n   \"My concern is that, in the rush to fulfill President Trump's order, they are slashing the procedures that would normally be used to ensure the safety and security case for these reactors,\" he said.   \n   But administration officials like Secretary of Energy Chris Wright remain bullish that the program can safely spark nuclear innovation.   \"Before July fourth of this year, we will have multiple nuclear reactors critical,\" Wright said at a public event on February 15 at Hill Air Force Base in Utah. \"That's speed. That's innovation. That's the start of a nuclear renaissance.\"\n",

Kennedy Jr. She made her case before a Senate committee Wednesday.   \n\n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  President Trump's pick for surgeon general made her case in front of a Senate committee on Wednesday. Dr. Casey Means is a wellness influencer, entrepreneur and author. She is closely aligned with Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his Make America Healthy Again agenda. But her nomination has faced plenty of pushback, including from the medical establishment. NPR health correspondent Will Stone covered the hearing. So, Will, first of all, it's been more than a year in the Trump administration. Why's it taken it this long to get a surgeon general in place?WILL STONE, BYLINE: That's right. There have been a few hiccups throughout the process. Casey Means was actually not Trump's first pick. He initially selected a doctor and Fox News contributor, though she ended up withdrawing her nomination. Trump then tapped Means for the job. She's gained prominence in the wellness space, mostly through a book she published about chronic diseases and diet. And she was all set for the Senate hearing back in October, but it was canceled at the last second because she was pregnant and had gone into labor.MARTÍNEZ: OK. So she had a lot going on. What did we hear today from Means during the hearing?STONE: In many ways, very similar messaging as Secretary Kennedy and his MAHA supporters. Mean (ph) talks about chronic diseases, diet and lifestyle, the harms of ultra-processed foods and toxins and the failures of the medical system. Take a listen to what she said during her opening statement.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CASEY MEANS: I believe that every American shares a core yearning to thrive and help their families thrive. But we are asking people to make healthy choices in environments that are squarely structured against them.MARTÍNEZ: All right. So that sounds pretty reasonable. How was she received?STONE: Well, unsurprisingly, she got tough questions from Democrats and mostly praise from Republicans, though not entirely. And that's because there are questions about where she stands on some of the most controversial causes taken up by Kennedy - most of all, vaccines. And Means has previously raised concerns about the safety of the childhood vaccine schedule. And Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican and doctor who chairs the committee, pressed Means on her views. Here he is asking about the disproven claims that vaccines cause autism.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BILL CASSIDY: Been a lot of evidence showing that they're not implicated. Do you not accept that evidence?MEANS: I do accept that evidence. I also think that science is never settled.STONE: And I'd say, A, this exchange is emblematic of how Means navigated many of the questions from senators. She would say she believes in vaccines. At the same time, when pressed, she would not directly say that she actually encourages mothers to vaccinate their kids for measles or for people to get the flu shot. In the past, Means has also questioned the use of birth control pills and their safety. Here, too, she was pressed by Cassidy and Democrats. She said that oral contraceptives should be widely available, but that they do have significant risks that women need to know about.MARTÍNEZ: All right. Now, you know, the surgeon general's considered the nation's top doctor. What's the deal with her qualifications?STONE: Yeah, this is another sticking point. Means did graduate from Stanford medical school, but she dropped out of her surgical training before finishing. She does not have an active medical license. She's an influencer, and she runs a company that sells glucose monitoring devices. So she doesn't have the clinical or leadership experience typical of a surgeon general, which is one reason for the opposition to her nomination.MARTÍNEZ: All right. That's NPR health correspondent Will Stone. Will, thanks.STONE: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

That's an issue for Democrats who have nine major candidates for governor.   \n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  California Governor Gavin Newsom knows he's widely considered a potential presidential candidate in 2028. Here's what he told NPR's Ailsa Chang this week when she asked why he thinks that is.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)GAVIN NEWSOM: Just conviction. Just letting it go. It's putting it all out there, calling balls and strikes. And I'm going to run the 110-yard dash. I got a sell-by date as governor, and we'll see what happens.MARTÍNEZ: You can see their entire interview on NPR's YouTube channel.MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Because Newsome is term-limited, though, something like a small army of Democrats is hoping to succeed him. But the party is worried that the state's unique primary system is leading to something unthinkable - a general election between two Republicans in the nation's largest blue state. Guy Marzorati from member station KQED has this report.GUY MARZORATI, BYLINE: Democratic activists bustled around San Francisco's massive Moscone Center convention hall last week, campaign workers setting up booths and hanging banners for the California Democratic Party Convention. The three-day event was a premiere showcase for the Democrats vying to be the state's next governor.BRIAN PARVIZSHAHI: Right now, we have a pretty crowded field with Democrats running to replace Gavin Newsom.MARZORATI: Brian Parvizshahi, a California political consultant, ran through some of the top names.PARVIZSHAHI: Eric Swalwell, who's a congressman out here in the Bay Area.MARZORATI: There's Tom Steyer, a billionaire philanthropist.PARVIZSHAHI: Matt Mahan, who's the mayor of San Jose.MARZORATI: Xavier Becerra, the former attorney general. Antonio Villaraigosa, the former mayor of LA.PARVIZSHAHI: And Katie Porter, former Congresswoman.MARZORATI: And that's just on the Democratic side. There's also two leading Republicans - commentator Steve Hilton and Chad Bianco, the sheriff of Riverside County. In California, Democrats and Republicans appear on the ballot together in the primary. The two candidates who receive the most votes move on to the general election. A poll this week from a think tank, the Public Policy Institute of California, found three Democrats - Porter, Swalwell and Steyer - in a virtual tie with Republicans Hilton and Bianco.MARK BALDASSARE: No telling at this point who the top two candidates are going to be...MARZORATI: That's Mark Baldassare, the survey's director.BALDASSARE: ...And whether they're going to be Democrats or Republicans that are going to be running for governor in November.MARZORATI: The fractured vote means that, yes, two Republicans could advance to the general election in California.NANCY TUNG: You know, it's not a negligible concern.MARZORATI: Nancy Tung is the chair of the San Francisco Democratic Party.TUNG: Because, you know, the Republican vote is going to be split two ways versus a Democratic vote that could be split - I mean, we have nine major candidates. It could be split into pieces.MARZORATI: The idea of electing a Republican governor, which California hasn't done in 20 years, is starting to worry Tung.TUNG: If we don't have somebody in the top two, then that seems like a future that I don't want to acknowledge.MARZORATI: But other Democrats are less concerned. State party Chair Rusty Hicks says candidates can take clear steps to stand out.RUSTY HICKS: Those who are able to raise the resources to communicate a message, those who land significant endorsements and supporters.MARZORATI: By the time voting begins in May...HICKS: My guess is we're not going to have the same number of candidates truly competing for the support of California voters.MARZORATI: But candidates can't wait that long to get their names off the ballot. The deadline for that is next month.For NPR News, I'm Guy Marzorati in San Jose.(SOUNDBITE OF BOOM BIP'S \"ROADS MUST ROLL\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Vance announced cuts to some Medicaid funding to the state Wednesday.   \n\n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  The Trump administration is putting a temporary hold on some Medicaid funding to Minnesota. It says it's concerned about fraud. Reporter Matt Sepic of Minnesota Public Radio has been covering fraud investigations there for the past four years. He joins us now from Minneapolis with the facts. So, Matt, what types of Medicaid programs is the administration targeting?MATT SEPIC, BYLINE: They don't appear to be focusing on direct medical care, such as physician visits, rather personal care, as well as home and community-based services. That includes things like intensive residential treatment, night supervision services and nonemergency medical transportation. Those are the same programs in which the state halted new enrollments last month at the direction of the federal government. Vice President JD Vance announced the latest cuts yesterday alongside Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.The Trump administration says it's withholding just over a quarter billion dollars in reimbursements this month. Oz pointed to a Minnesota Medicaid program meant to provide care to children with autism. Last year, federal prosecutors charged two people with setting up phony treatment centers and enrolling kids regardless of their symptoms.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MEHMET OZ: They then bill Medicaid - this has already happened - millions of dollars for services that were never rendered, never delivered by a qualified staff member. These schemes disproportionately involve immigrant communities.SEPIC: One of the defendants in the autism case pleaded guilty in December to stealing $14 million. The other is expected to plead guilty on Monday. More than a dozen other people are charged with ripping off a Medicaid housing program. Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, shut that down last year because of widespread fraud. Many of the defendants are from Minnesota's Somali American community, which Trump disparaged in his State of the Union address on Tuesday.MARTÍNEZ: You mentioned Governor Walz. What's he saying now?SEPIC: On social media yesterday, Walz called it a, quote, \"campaign of retribution\" by President Donald Trump that'll be devastating for people across Minnesota. He notes that Trump has pardoned numerous people convicted of fraud and that his Justice Department has driven out experienced fraud prosecutors.MARTÍNEZ: Why did those federal prosecutors quit?SEPIC: Well, more than a dozen staffers at the Minnesota U.S. attorney's office resigned after immigration agents killed Renée Macklin Good and Alex Pretti last month. They quit in protest after Justice Department leaders pressured them to investigate Good's widow and because the FBI has refused to include state police in the shooting investigations. That's according to a DOJ source who requested anonymity because they're not authorized to speak to the media. The people who resigned include everyone on the team that had been prosecuting fraud.MARTÍNEZ: Matt, what does the federal government want from Minnesota leaders before it releases this Medicaid money?SEPIC: Well, Oz says the state must develop a comprehensive plan to tackle fraud and Walz has 60 days to respond. It's important to point out, A, that fighting fraud is a key priority in the state legislature for lawmakers from both parties. Legislators are trying to hash out the details of a proposed inspector general's office that would oversee anti-fraud efforts in Minnesota. State Attorney General Keith Ellison says he is also asking lawmakers for money to hire more fraud prosecutors.MARTÍNEZ: All right, that's Minnesota Public Radio's Matt Sepic. Matt, thank you very much for your reporting on this.SEPIC: You're welcome.(SOUNDBITE OF LES TRES' \"THE GHOST IN YOUR SMILE\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n         Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt leads a state that gave President Trump 66% of the vote in 2024. He is also charting his own course and has publicly differed with the president on multiple occasions this year.   \n   Most elected Republicans have avoided direct criticism of the president. Republicans in Congress have voted for his priorities, even when some disagreed with them. Stitt has made his disagreements clear, though he has avoided personal attacks and isn't a member of the never-Trump movement. For his part, Trump has described Stitt on social media as a \"wiseguy,\" among other things.   Stitt discussed his vision for the Republican Party's post-Trump future and more during an NPR video interview on the sidelines of the National Governors Association meeting in Washington, D.C.   \n   \"We have to get back to integrity,\" Stitt said. He described an action by the administration as \"un-American.\" He differed with Trump on elections and embraced the diversity of the United States. He is himself a member of the Cherokee Nation.   You can watch the full interview by clicking on the video above, or you can listen to the portion of the interview that broadcast on Morning Edition by clicking on the blue play button above.   Below are some highlights from our conversation.   He wants to stop the \"pendulum\" swings   Stitt criticized a signature of recent administrations, especially Trump's: tearing up the work of earlier administrations.    He singled out a wind power project in Rhode Island that was canceled by the Trump administration.    \"They did everything right. They've been working on it for eight years. They have all their permits. They're 90% complete, and they just get the plug pulled on them — that is by the administration. That's un-American. We cannot be a pendulum swing where we are going back and forth and we're killing different projects based on our political views,\" he said.    In mid-January, a federal judge ruled that construction on the wind farm off Rhode Island's coast could continue while the legal battle plays out in court.   \n   He takes his own approach to immigration   Stitt questioned Trump's immigration raids in Minnesota as an infringement on states' rights. He also critiqued Trump's determination to remove everyone without legal status.    \"The president needs to tell us what's the endgame. Is it truly to deport every single person here in the country? I don't think that's what America wants,\" Stitt said.    Stitt advocates issuing work visas to people without legal status who are currently employed. He also has argued that states should play a larger role in immigration issues.   He favors bipartisanship   Stitt is chair of the bipartisan National Governors Association, which put him in an awkward position this month. It's traditional for the governors to meet with the president during their winter meeting each February, but the White House invited only Republicans.   \"The president can ask whoever he wants to the White House, but … if it's not going to include all the governors — I represent all 50 governors — we can't facilitate it from the National Governors Association,\" Stitt said.   Trump publicly criticized Stitt but also phoned him. The White House eventually invited all governors to a meeting, though two Democrats were not invited to a formal dinner. The incident pointed to a larger question of practicing politics: whether and when to deal with the opposition.   He celebrates his Cherokee heritage — and is at odds with Cherokee leaders   Stitt proudly identifies as part of the Cherokee Nation. He can trace his ancestry to an official list of Cherokees that the U.S. government compiled in the late 1800s. As governor, he nevertheless has been in conflict with Cherokee leaders, who are headquartered in eastern Oklahoma. Their debates touch on one of the biggest themes in American history, the country's relationship to Native nations.   In the 1800s, Cherokees and other tribes were forced to leave the eastern United States, surrendering their land in exchange for new land in what became known as Indian Territory. In 1907, that territory was incorporated into the new state of Oklahoma. But Cherokees maintained a separate government with a degree of their old sovereignty, as did other tribes such as the Creeks and Seminoles.   \n   In a 2020 case, the Supreme Court found that Oklahoma law enforcement officials had no right to enforce state law in what was once called \"Indian country.\" The power belonged to the tribes. That ruling set aside the conviction of a Seminole man who had been tried for sexual crimes in the Creek Nation.   Stitt strongly disagreed with the ruling as a threat to state authority. He has continued to battle with the tribes, and in late 2025 the Choctaw, Cherokee and Chickasaw nations sued him over the enforcement of state wildlife laws.   The discussion of his heritage underlines one more theme where Stitt differs with many on the political right. He spoke of Oklahoma's diversity as a strength and said he wanted to attract all kinds of voters to old Republican principles.   It also suggests a common theme in Stitt's governorship: He thinks states should wield more power. He has pushed against the federal government above the state and against the tribes that he feels should rank below.   Can't see the video above? Watch it on YouTube.\n",

Asked if he is concerned about a possible Justice Department cover-up after NPR discovered documents related to an accusation of sexual abuse against President Trump weren't  included in the database, Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., said Oversight Republicans plan to investigate.    \"We're looking into the accusation made by the NPR,\" Comer told reporters during a Thursday press conference ahead of the committee's deposition of former first lady Hillary Clinton. \"We don't know the answer to that. We know what the administration says. We're still looking to get a definitive answer on that.\"    \n   NPR's previous reporting found internal FBI and Justice Department outline documents related to allegations from a woman who, according to documents within the database, claimed that around 1983, when she was around 13 years old, Jeffrey Epstein introduced her to Trump, \"who subsequently forced her head down to his exposed penis which she subsequently bit. In response, Trump punched her in the head and kicked her out.\"   Records released last month show the FBI interviewed the woman four times, but only one of those interviews has been published in the Justice Department's public Epstein files database.   Comer's comments come after the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee asked the Justice Department for answers following NPR's reporting.    In a letter first shared with NPR, ranking member Robert Garcia, D-Calif., is asking Attorney General Pam Bondi to explain why what appear to be dozens of pages of interviews and interview notes related to allegations of sexual abuse against President Trump were not among three million pages released in recent months.   \n   \"We are witnessing a White House cover-up of serious allegations against the president by a survivor,\" Garcia said in a statement to NPR. \"We demand Attorney General Pam Bondi come clean about why these documents are being hidden, comply with our legally binding subpoena by sharing all records, and tell the American people if their president is under investigation for allegations of sexual assault.\"   Garcia wrote that Bondi and the Justice Department have to explain why those documents have been withheld, and more specifically if there is an active investigation into the sexual abuse allegations against the president.   \n   \"The American people demand transparency and accountability, and any further delay by the Department continues to deny justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's crimes,\" he wrote. \"DOJ must specify the exact grounds for the withholding of FBI interviews containing specific allegations against President Trump, as well as provide an update on the status of any ongoing investigations into allegations of sexual assault against President Trump.\"   Garcia reiterated Democrats' commitment to investigating the files ahead of the Clinton deposition.    \"We're going to be demanding even over these next few days that the remaining files that have not been released get released to the public. And that includes new files that were just discovered in the last couple of days,\" Garcia told reporters in a separate press conference Thursday. \"Where are these files? Who removed them? Those questions have to be answered.\"   The Justice Department has continued to defend its handling of the Epstein files release and offered differing responses to questions from NPR, other outlets and lawmakers.    Monday, a DOJ spokeswoman declined to answer questions on the record about these specific files, what's in them, and why they are not published. After NPR's report published Tuesday, the Justice Department reached out to NPR, taking issue with how its responses to questions were framed.    Justice Department spokeswoman Natalie Baldassarre reiterated DOJ's stance that any documents not published are privileged, duplicates or relate to an ongoing federal investigation.   Wednesday, a Justice Department X account said that they were reviewing discovery documents included in the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell and \"should any document be found to have been improperly tagged in the review process and is responsive to the Act, the Department will of course publish it, consistent with the law.\"   \n            As the Department of Justice has consistently said and has done since the January 30, 2026 publication of the Epstein files, if any member of the public, including victims, reported concerns with information in the pages, the Department would review, make any corrections, and…— DOJ Rapid Response (@DOJRR47) February 25, 2026\n   \n   The Justice Department has not responded to follow-up questions from NPR on the Congressional investigations.    When asked for comment earlier this week about the missing pages and the accusations against the president, a White House spokeswoman told NPR that Trump \"has done more for Epstein's victims than anyone before him.\"   \"Just as President Trump has said, he's been totally exonerated on anything relating to Epstein,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told NPR in a statement. \"And by releasing thousands of pages of documents, cooperating with the House Oversight Committee's subpoena request, signing the Epstein Files Transparency Act, and calling for more investigations into Epstein's Democrat friends, President Trump has done more for Epstein's victims than anyone before him. Meanwhile, Democrats like Hakeem Jeffries and Stacey Plaskett have yet to explain why they were soliciting money and meetings from Epstein after he was a convicted sex offender.\"   \n   Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have been investigating the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein files and the release of documents required by law. Garcia said Tuesday a parallel investigation would be opened into these missing documents.   Have information to share about the Epstein files?

    "body": "\n      Alabama Sen. Katie Britt came to national prominence in 2024 with an image as a firebrand on the right but has developed a reputation as a bipartisan deal maker in the Senate.   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  Senator Katie Britt was introduced to a national audience in 2024 when she gave the Republican response to President Biden's State of the Union. What many viewers saw was an over-the-top firebrand. But in the Senate, the Alabama freshman has been building a different reputation as a bipartisan dealmaker. Now she's negotiating changes to how immigration agents operate after deadly shootings of two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis. NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas has more.SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: Two years ago, from her homey kitchen in Montgomery, Senator Katie Britt took on what's often called the worst assignment in politics.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KATIE BRITT: Our families are hurting. Our country can do better.GRINGLAS: Standing in as party frontman to rebut the president is a daunting task for any politician. But even some Republicans describe Britt's performance with words like baffling and bizarre. Actress Scarlett Johansson spoofed it on \"Saturday Night Live.\"(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE\")SCARLETT JOHANSSON: (As Katie Britt) And I have the honor of (laughter) serving the great people of Alabama.(LAUGHTER)JOHANSSON: But tonight, I'll be auditioning for the part of scary mom.(LAUGHTER)GRINGLAS: Colleagues say this caricature of Britt as a hyper-partisan MAGA mom is just not true. Alabama political columnist Steve Flowers first met Britt when she was a teenager. He was so impressed, Flowers called up his friend, Alabama Senator Richard Shelby.STEVE FLOWERS: I said, Shelby, I've just met a young lady who's got U.S. senator or governor written all over her.GRINGLAS: Britt went to work for Shelby, who for years was the top Republican on appropriations. He taught young aides that making deals across the aisle hinges on trust and often genuine friendship, says former staffer Dayne Cutrell.DAYNE CUTRELL: Quite frankly, it's the ingredient that is necessary for any of that to come together. Not only does she see it because of who she is, but she had a front-row seat to somebody that was able to do it for years to the benefit of the state.GRINGLAS: When Shelby retired in 2022, Britt became the youngest Republican woman ever elected to the Senate.CUTRELL: She is the same person that wants to know not just you as an individual, but your family and what makes you tick and why it's important.GRINGLAS: That's in part why Britt was able to help bring Democratic Senator Tim Kaine onto a deal to end the shutdown last fall.TIM KAINE: I was testing ideas with her. And when it looked like things might break down - hey, come on, let's keep talking. We may disagree, but I'll get a read on where's the caucus, where's the White House. And that's helpful.GRINGLAS: In a time when compromise seems to have little political upside, I asked Britt why wade in.BRITT: Anybody can go sit in a corner. Two-year-olds do it best. And we have a lot of people that are taking their ball and sitting in the corner. I just think that this is too critical of a moment in our country's history to do that.GRINGLAS: For Britt, one critical moment was the viral image of a 5-year-old boy in a bunny hat being detained by federal officers in Minneapolis, so much so that she raised questions with the administration. But after assurances from a top official, Britt instead focused her public remarks on criticizing Democrats for refusing to fund the Department of Homeland Security.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BRITT: Everybody on that side of the aisle knows that ICE and CBP will continue to be funded. Who's going to pay the price? It's the TSA agent. It's the person working at FEMA.GRINGLAS: That message has frustrated Democratic negotiators like Senator Chris Murphy, who were already irked when Britt called their demands a ridiculous Christmas list.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHRIS MURPHY: My wish is for my Republican colleagues to be just as upset for the children that are being traumatized right now.GRINGLAS: Britt's appeal as a mediator comes from trust across the aisle with Senate leadership and the White House. But maintaining all three is a difficult balance. Britt was one of a few Republicans to criticize a racist video posted on President Trump's social media. Trump saw that as disloyalty, CNN reported, which Britt's office called fake news. Columnist Steve Flowers says there are two types of senators, ideologues...FLOWERS: You may have one senator who may be a Fox News-chasing publicity hound, who wants to be known as a right-wing fire-eater.GRINGLAS: ...And facilitators.FLOWERS: That's what Katie's role will be, is bring home the bacon, get things done for Alabama, as well as voting conservative.GRINGLAS: Flowers says it's not as easy to be a facilitator today.FLOWERS: Maybe she can balance it. But she doesn't owe Trump anything. She'll be there long after Trump's gone.GRINGLAS: Britt is facing a more immediate test, as immigration talks show little progress.Sam Gringlas, NPR News, Washington.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

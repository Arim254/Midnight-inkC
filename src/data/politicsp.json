The move comes less than a week after HHS confirmed it was freezing all federal funding through that same program.   The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) sends money to states, tribes and territories to help make child care more affordable for low-income families.   The Biden administration's rules encouraged states to base payments to child care providers on enrollment rather than verified attendance, pay providers in advance of services and favor guaranteed slots with providers over vouchers.   \n   Now, HHS says it plans to restore attendance-based billing, it will no longer require that providers be paid in advance and it will reprioritize vouchers.   \"When controls are not in place, bad actors can bill for children who aren't there,\" said Alex Adams, assistant secretary for family support at HHS's Administration for Children and Families. \"Families and taxpayers deserve proof that services are being delivered to children.\"   But child care advocates told NPR that states already have many controls in place to prevent fraud.   \"What we know to be true is that there are longstanding program integrity requirements that have been in place and are regularly updated, annually updated,\" said Susan Gale Perry, CEO of Child Care Aware of America, which helps families access affordable child care across the country.   Approximately 1.4 million children and 857,700 families per month received child care assistance through CCDF in 2019, according to the latest data posted on the HHS website.   Melissa Boteach, chief policy officer at Zero to Three, a nonprofit that advocates for infants, toddlers and families, said the proposed policy changes introduce \"chaos and confusion\" by rolling back provisions that aimed to make the child care industry more stable and affordable.   This follows a funding freeze announced over the holidays   Monday's announcement comes days after HHS said it was freezing the federal funding provided through CCDF.   \n   HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon told NPR on Wednesday that the agency was freezing CCDF funds effective immediately, and said the agency would unfreeze funding after individual states provided certain \"administrative data.\"   \"It's still unclear to many states who have to administer these programs what exactly this means.\" Boteach said. \"And that lack of clarity has real consequences for families and for early educators.\"   She also said there has \"not been clarity provided on whether or not funding is forthcoming, on what needs to be done for it to turn back on and what states are supposed to do in the meantime.\"   HHS has not yet responded to NPR's request for clarity on how Monday's announcement relates to the funding freeze.   \"What we do know is that child care providers operate on [a] very thin … margin of profit,\" said Perry of Child Care Aware of America.   She said going \"even a month\" without funding could result in child care centers closing – which would impact both children who benefit from CCDF funding and those who do not.   A focus on child care providers in Minnesota   The recent focus on federal child care funding comes in response to allegations of fraud by Minnesota day care providers.   \n   As NPR has reported, the day after Christmas, Nick Shirley, a right-wing social media influencer, posted a video in which he claimed to show Somali-American-run day care centers cheating the federal government out of millions of dollars. The video doesn't offer clear proof, but it went viral.   On Dec. 30, HHS Deputy Secretary Jim O'Neill posted on X about \"the serious allegations that the state of Minnesota has funneled millions of taxpayer dollars to fraudulent daycares across Minnesota over the past decade.\" He announced actions \"against the blatant fraud that appears to be rampant in Minnesota and across the country,\" including requiring \"a justification and a receipt or photo evidence before we send money to a state.\"   \n   In Monday's HHS announcement, O'Neill said, \"The reforms we are enacting will make fraud harder to perpetrate.\"   According to HHS, the rule changes are subject to a 30-day public comment period.\n",

Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., speaks at a news conference in the Capitol on Dec. 1, 2025. Kelly held the event to address what he described as intimidating actions by President Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, following the release of a video in which Kelly and several lawmakers urge U.S. troops to refuse \"illegal orders.\"\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly is pledging to fight back after Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced he's taking administrative action against Kelly.    Hegseth claims that Kelly's public statements, including a video message telling troops not to follow illegal orders, amount to sedition.   In a statement on social media, the defense secretary said that he has initiated a formal 45-day process to reduce Kelly's rank and retirement pay.   \"In response to Senator Mark Kelly's seditious statements — and his pattern of reckless misconduct — the Department of War is taking administrative action against Captain Mark E. Kelly, USN (Ret),\" Hegseth's statement reads.    \n   This administrative action will include a review of Kelly's retirement grade, which could result in a change or reduction to his rank, \"resulting in a corresponding reduction in retired pay.\"   \n   Hegseth also announced he issued a formal censure letter that will be placed in Kelly's official military file.    In response, Kelly issued a statement saying that he had earned his rank in combat and as an astronaut and that Hegseth and the Trump administration were trying to stifle free speech and dissent among retired military officers.    \"My rank and retirement are things that I earned through my service and sacrifice for this country. I got shot at. I missed holidays and birthdays. I commanded a space shuttle mission while my wife Gabby recovered from a gunshot wound to the head — all while proudly wearing the American flag on my shoulder,\" Kelly said.    \"Pete Hegseth wants to send the message to every single retired servicemember that if they say something he or Donald Trump doesn't like, they will come after them the same way. It's outrageous and it is wrong. There is nothing more un-American than that,\" Kelly added.   The Arizona senator said he won't be intimidated by censure or threats to his rank and retirement. He stated he plans to fight the action.     \n   \"I will fight this with everything I've got — not for myself, but to send a message back that Pete Hegseth and Donald Trump don't get to decide what Americans in this country get to say about their government.\"   Before serving as a U.S. senator, Kelly spent 25 years as a Navy pilot and retired with full military benefits. That status makes him subject to the military code of justice. The Pentagon launched an investigation into Kelly in November.\n",

Rubio, who is also President Trump's interim national security adviser, said the U.S. will enforce its influence through an existing \"oil quarantine\" imposed by U.S. naval vessels near the coast of Venezuela.     \n   \"Our military is helping the Coast Guard conduct a law enforcement function, which is not just the capture of Maduro, but the enforcement of our sanctions,\" Rubio said on the program. \"And we think that's just tremendous leverage, incredible crippling leverage, which we intend to continue to use until we see the changes that we need to see.\"    Since September, U.S. forces have struck at least 35 alleged drug boats, killed at least 115 people on board and seized oil tankers near Venezuela.    The comments offer the first glimpse of what U.S. policy toward Venezuela will look like following the weekend raid that captured the country's leader, and Trump's remarks that the U.S. will \"run\" Venezuela.   Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Tom Cotton, R-Ark., echoed Rubio in calling for a pressure campaign against Maduro's allies who still control the country. Cotton specifically named interim President Delcy Rodríguez, who previously served as vice president under Maduro.   \"They have control of the military and security services,\" Cotton told CNN. \"We have to deal with that fact.\"   During a Sunday interview with The Atlantic magazine, Trump said Rodriguez would \"pay a very big price\" if she didn't cooperate, a day after he claimed that she was on board with the U.S. plans.   \n   The Trump administration's actions over the weekend will likely see the first signs of domestic pushback this week in the form of congressional Democrats.   Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., condemned Trump for ordering the Saturday military operation without consulting Congress. The administration argues that it didn't need to notify Congress because Maduro was arrested in a law enforcement action. The Venezuelan president will appear before a New York judge Monday.   \"They went inside Venezuela, bombed civilian as well as military places,\" Schumer said. \"And it's a violation of the law to do what they did without getting the authorization of Congress.\"   Schumer said Sunday he plans to hold a vote on a war powers resolution this week that would limit Trump's ability to attack Venezuela without Congressional approval.    \"If it's voted positively in both houses, then the president can't do another thing in Venezuela without the OK of Congress,\" Schumer said.    Senator Rand Paul, R-Ky., is the only GOP member publicly supporting the resolution so far. Unlike other measures, this resolution needs a simple majority to pass the Senate — meaning only three more Republicans would have to support it to advance the measure. It is unclear if the measure has Republican support beyond Paul.\n",

On Saturday, Katie Miller, wife of President Trump's deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, posted a picture of the American flag covering Greenland on X. She captioned the photo with the word \"SOON.\"   Then on Sunday, Trump said in an interview with The Atlantic that Greenland could be subject to future U.S. intervention.   \"We do need Greenland, absolutely,\" Trump said. \"We need it for defense.\"   \n   Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement Sunday that the U.S. has \"no right to annex\" territories of Denmark and has told the U.S. to \"stop the threats\" about taking over Greenland.   Jesper Møller Sørensen, Denmark's ambassador to the U.S., responded to Miller's post, saying \"we expect full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark.\"   \"Just a friendly reminder about the U.S. and the Kingdom of Denmark: We are close allies and should continue to work together as such,\" he said.   Greenland has been under Danish control since the early 18th century but was granted home rule in 1979.   Miller's post on Saturday came hours after the U.S. military conducted airstrikes in Venezuela's capital and captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. Trump said at a press conference that the U.S. will \"run\" Venezuela until there is a transition of leadership.   Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in annexing Greenland from Denmark for its strategic location in the Arctic. He appointed Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry as his special envoy to Greenland last month, which sparked diplomatic concerns in Europe.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Steve Inskeep speaks with Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, about the Trump administration's military operation in Venezuela.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Now, President Trump acted in Venezuela without the approval of Congress, asserting that no such approval was needed. Lawmakers now decide how, if at all, to respond. And one of them is Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. Congressman, good morning.JIM HIMES: Good morning.INSKEEP: I was home in Indiana when this strike took place over the weekend, and people in my family said, well, obviously, they can't get permission of Congress in advance in a case like this. It would leak. And I said, well, there is this Gang of Eight, eight top lawmakers, and normally the administration would keep them informed. You're one of the Gang of Eight. Were you informed?HIMES: No. No. In fact, you know, I was woken up by my wife who said, you won't believe what's happening. And to this moment, I have actually not received any outreach at all from the administration. So, look, the decision was taken here, and this whole leak thing is baloney. I don't think the Gang of Eight has ever leaked. But this, you know, obviously, very inconsistent with the idea that Congress has a role to play, when the - you know, probably the role to play when the United States military is engaged. And as a political matter, you know, a little unwise 'cause it's hard to imagine this adventure going, you know, horribly right in the coming months. And, you know, because he - the president did this without any input from anybody else, he owns this 100% now.INSKEEP: Why do you think that there's not a good chance that this could go right?HIMES: Well, point to me in the last generation one incident - one instance of the United States effecting regime change and having everything go well. You just can't, right? You can point to Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya. In some ways, the best, I think, the administration can hope for is a sort of a Grenada situation where, you know, no one sort of people lose track because, I mean, who remembers Grenada back in the early '80s, right? That's the best-case scenario, especially when it's completely evident at this point that the president has no plan. He says we're running Venezuela, but apparently, that means we've got a lot of firepower off the coast and are trying to get the vice president very much a Chavista leader, very much part of the old regime, to do what we want because we've got a lot of guns.INSKEEP: Let me talk that through with you, though. You point out that nation building has not worked well at all for the United States, given the risks of trying to create some brand-new government or install the opposition leader as president, could the U.S. be wise to leave the current government in place and just give some orders?HIMES: Well, that would probably be wise - well, it would certainly be wiser than putting the 50,000 armed forces on the ground that would be required to effect a full regime change. You know, and then, of course, you know, there's all sorts of questions of what happens with the Venezuelan military - a lot of guns there. Huge political risk for the president, right? I mean, President Biden's administration never recovered from the visual image of 12 Marines dying at Abbey Gate in Afghanistan. So huge risk. But, you know, you have to remember the Venezuelan regime has its politics, too. It can't be perceived as a puppet of the American administration, which quite explicitly says it wants their oil. So this is going to be, I think, a lot harder than Donald Trump thinks that it will be.INSKEEP: What should the role be for the opposition, the president-elect, according to the United States, the man who won the election in 2024, or María Corina Machado, the Nobel Prize winner who is the opposition leader?HIMES: Well, that was the fascinating thing to me about the news conference, right? The president said two things that I think probably fatally damaged this adventure. On the one hand, he did something that Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz at their neocon peak would never have done, which is to say this is about oil. I mean, you have to understand how that sounds to Venezuelans and to the rest of the world. This is not about our democracy or our prosperity. It's about the United States taking the oil. And secondly, the president delegitimized probably the single unifying force in Venezuela in the form of Mrs. Machado, who won a Nobel Peace Prize. The president cut the ground out from under her. So, you know, now Venezuelans are thinking, wait a minute, do I get to live with this appalling regime, but now United States gets the oil? You know, I mean, this is just - the president, I think, probably fatally wounded whatever chance this effort had in saying those two things in his news conference.INSKEEP: Briefly, what will your approach be now that the president is also threatening the leader of Colombia and talking again about taking over Greenland, among other things?HIMES: Well, you know, clearly, Congress needs to do something that it has not done because it's been under the control of the president's acolytes for the last, you know, year or so, which is to assert itself, to say we are the legitimate representatives of the people, and you're now talking about using those people on foreign adventures that would have made Teddy Roosevelt blush. So, you know, again, we're in the minority in the House and the Senate, but it is time for this Congress to stand up and say we have a role to play here.INSKEEP: Jim Himes of Connecticut is the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.

Higgins on Saturday said the Trump administration ending TPS for Venezuelans in early 2025 was \"reckless, dangerous, and wrong.\" She also called for President Trump to \"immediately\" reinstate TPS for Venezuelans.   \n   Miami has a large population of Venezuelan expats. Higgins was sworn in as mayor last month, becoming the first Democrat to lead the city in about three decades.   \"The instability unfolding in Venezuela today makes it even clearer that the country remains unsafe for people to return. No one should be forced back into chaos and uncertainty,\" Higgins wrote in a statement. \"They have built lives here, contributed to our community, and deserve the security to remain while their homeland regains stability. This is not just a matter of policy — it is a matter of basic human dignity and safety.\"   \n   The U.S. Supreme Court in May allowed the Trump administration to temporarily strip legal protections from more than 350,000 Venezuelans living in the U.S. under TPS, which protects against deportations and provides work permits to people impacted by war, natural disasters and other circumstances.   \n   In October, the high court granted the administration's request to halt a lower court order that blocked the end of TPS protections for Venezuelans — allowing the administration to move forward with ending the TPS designation for the country.   When asked about Higgins' statement, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the administration ending the program, saying Sunday that decisions are made in collaboration with the State Department and White House.   \"Every individual that was under TPS has the opportunity to apply for refugee status and that evaluation will go forward, but we need to make sure that our programs actually mean something and that we are following the law,\" Noem said during an interview with Fox News.   The Department of Homeland Security also said in a social media post later on Sunday: \"Secretary Noem ended Temporary Protected Status for more than 500,000 Venezuelans and now they can go home to a country that they love.\"   At least 7.9 million people have fled Venezuela's humanitarian crisis, according to the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR.\n",

A hard pinch and a cup of coffee later, and reality set in. But questions remain.   So what does this mean politically, and what should Americans make of what happened?   Here are some takeaways as the dust settles on Caracas:   1. It was an audacious and surprising move for a president who campaigned against American intervention.    Donald Trump, the \"America First\" candidate and president, has turned out to be rather hawkish. In less than 12 months in office this second time around, he's conducted strikes in seven countries — Iran, Nigeria, Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Somalia and, this weekend, oversaw a daring middle-of-the-night raid in Venezuela. U.S. forces captured the country's president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, sending them to New York to stand trial for drug trafficking.   \n   To call the action surprising and eye-opening doesn't quite do it justice, especially considering Trump made his bones in opposition to neoconservatives' \"endless wars\" and nation-building in countries like Iraq and Afghanistan.   On Saturday, Trump said the United States is going to \"run\" the country until he finds a suitable leader.   \"Well, we're gonna be running it with a group,\" Trump said, \"and we're gonna make sure it's run properly.\"   He noted that \"people that are standing right behind me\" are going to run it. That included Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.   Rubio on Sunday tried to walk that back some, describing what the U.S. is doing as a \"quarantine,\" meant to effect \"policy.\"   \n   2. Like Iraq, there have been shifting justifications for removing Maduro.    As the United States was about to commit to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein from Iraq 20-plus years ago now, the Bush administration made different arguments and justifications for intervention that seemed to shift like the sand of the Middle East.   Was it that Saddam Hussein was funding the kinds of terrorists who were responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks? Was it getting rid of a dictator who didn't align with American values? Was it creating a democracy that could be a model for the rest of the Middle East to follow? Or was it that he had weapons of mass destruction that he couldn't be allowed to keep before they resulted in a \"mushroom cloud,\" as then-President George W. Bush warned in 2002?   \n   In the case of Maduro, is it regime change because of a dictator who again doesn't align with American values, combating drug trafficking, leveraging oil or some version of all of the above? Each of those has had their moments as the justification for the Trump administration's saber-rattling.   During Saturday's news conference, Trump stressed oil as a key motivator. He said American oil companies would be going in and modernizing the country's oil production and refinement capabilities. He said the companies would invest billions and \"use that money in Venezuela.\" He said that the \"biggest beneficiary are going to be the people of Venezuela\" and Venezuelan ex-pats in the U.S. It's unclear how that would be managed.   \n   Trump has a long history of saying the United States should \"take the oil.\"   \"You're not stealing anything,\" Trump said of taking oil from Iraq in a 2011 interview with ABC. \"We're reimbursing ourselves.\"   Fast-forward to 2023, when Trump was out of office, talking about Venezuela.   \"We're buying oil from Venezuela,\" Trump said during an event in North Carolina. \"When I left, Venezuela was ready to collapse. We would have taken it over. We would have gotten all that oil. It would have been right next door. But now we're buying oil from Venezuela, so we're making a dictator very rich. Can you believe this? Nobody can believe it.\"   On Sunday, the administration was out in full force defending its actions, pinning the reasoning on drugs, primarily. The White House has repeatedly claimed to be stemming the flow of fentanyl by striking alleged drug boats off the coast of Venezuela, despite the fact that fentanyl isn't largely produced in Venezuela.   Vice President Vance, who has been a vocal critic of U.S. intervention abroad in other cases, took on that critique on social media.   \n   \"[C]ocaine, which is the main drug trafficked out of Venezuela, is a profit center for all of the Latin America cartels,\" he wrote on Sunday. \"If you cut out the money from cocaine (or even reduce it) you substantially weaken the cartels overall. Also, cocaine is bad too!\"   He noted that \"a lot of fentanyl is coming out of Mexico,\" a reason that Trump \"shut down the border.\" That raises questions about what's next, too.   \n   Vance also referenced the oil: \"I understand the anxiety over the use of military force, but are we just supposed to allow a communist to steal our stuff in our hemisphere and do nothing?\"   Rubio, meanwhile, said that this was a law enforcement action to recover fugitives, because of a 2020 indictment of Maduro for the trafficking of cocaine. That, by the way, seems to be part of the administration's rationale for not seeking authorization from Congress.   These explanations are likely more politically palatable to the MAGA base than saying the United States is at war with Venezuela or, as Trump said, that the United States is now running another country — with no clear goals for an exit.   3. Speaking of Rubio, this action certainly seems to point to his increased influence with Trump.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump, CIA Director John Ratcliffe (left) and Secretary of State Marco Rubio (right) monitor U.S. military operations in Venezuela, from Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club on Saturday in Palm Beach, Fla.\n                \n                    Molly Riley/The White House via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Molly Riley/The White House via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Rubio, who is of Cuban descent, has always been more hawkish than Trump on foreign policy, particularly when it comes to Latin America.   During this Venezuela operation, Trump seems to be leaning on Rubio. Rubio was a central figure in the administration's announcement on Saturday and did the rounds on the Sunday shows to defend the action.   \n   In this second term, Rubio has taken on quite a few roles. After the hollowing out of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, Trump made him director of that program, as well as acting archivist of the National Archives, he's Trump's acting national security adviser and the secretary of state, which is also fourth in line to the presidency.   It's all evidence of how far Rubio has come to be able to burrow into Trump's inner circle. That's quite the turnabout from the bitter campaign a decade ago when Rubio was likening Trump to \"third world strongmen\" and a \"con artist\" with \"small hands,\" while Trump was dismissing him as \"Little Marco.\"   \n   4. Right-wing authoritarians are OK, but left-wing dictators are not?   Trump referred to Maduro as a \"dictator\" four times during his news conference Saturday (an \"outlaw dictator,\" \"illegitimate dictator,\" \"now-deposed dictator\" and \"dictator and terrorist\").   But there are lots of other dictators, authoritarians and strongmen in the rest of the world, many of whom Trump has praised through the years.   \n   Trump has allied himself with people like Hungary's Viktor Orbán, Argentina's Javier Milei, rolled out the red carpet for Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman, seems deferential to Russia's Vladimir Putin, and, during his first term, made overtures to North Korea's Kim Jong Un.   Couldn't there be justifications for those leaders' overthrow, too, that an American administration could come up with, following Trump's logic?   It's not a far leap to suggest the difference is politics (and oil).   5. Don't expect MAGA to abandon Trump.    Yes, there's undoubtedly an irony in Trump campaigning against intervention and what he's done in Venezuela. There will be — and already are — voices of opposition in Trump's base.   But dedication to Trump among the faithful runs deep — and there's an entire conservative media infrastructure built to insulate him and give the base talking points.   It started in the early moments Saturday morning after the raid. On Fox News, for example, panelists were pointing to Democrats' arguments of the move being illegal as something to mock and knock down. They focused instead on how few in Venezuela were defending Maduro and on the 2020 indictment against him. One network legal analyst said essentially that Trump's action shows that the long arm of American justice doesn't end at U.S. borders.   Given the hyper-partisan ways in which Americans take in their news, don't expect any sort of a wholesale abandonment of Trump. It's more likely to become a rallying point.    \n   Republicans were already tilting toward action in Venezuela before what happened this weekend. A Quinnipiac University poll from December found, overall, that 63% of people said they were against military action in Venezuela. That included 68% of independents. But 52% of Republicans were in favor.   Plus, remember, this is a group of voters that has a lot of practice with being in favor of a tough, hawkish approach to foreign policy. (See: war, Iraq.) The Republican Party, for decades, was held together by a three-legged stool of fiscal conservatism, cultural conservatism and a hawkish foreign policy.   \n   Trump's approach to economics and foreign policy bucked that tradition and seemed to saw off two of those legs, making for some uncomfortable compromises for the GOP, while culture was the main thing gluing together the MAGA coalition.   So, going back to a hawkish foreign policy seems not that far removed from what the Republican Party has been.   6. Democrats have to be careful with their messaging.   House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries disputed Rubio's insistence that the U.S. actions were \"not an invasion\" on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday.   \"This was not simply a counter-narcotics operation,\" Jeffries said. \"It was an act of war. It involved, of course, the Delta Force. ... We have to make sure when we return to Washington, D.C., [after the holiday recess] that legislative action is taken to ensure that no further military steps occur absent explicit congressional approval.\"   But solely focusing on the legality of the move could be a political pitfall for Democrats. Trump and Republicans are very good at trying to put Democrats in a position of seemingly defending drug dealers and bad people.   Remember, the reason Democrats did well electorally in 2025 is because of the economy, specifically the cost of living. If they do well in 2026, it will likely again be because of that — not whether Trump's incursion into Venezuela was legal or violated international norms, as crassly political as that sounds.   \n   Still, Democrats can't ignore Venezuela and solely focus on affordability, either. They might point out the apparent hypocrisy of ousting Maduro because of drugs while pardoning the former head of Honduras, who was convicted of drug trafficking.   They could also pivot to how this is a distraction from the fact that many people are struggling to buy groceries, homes and health care.   It's about \"surfacing Republican priorities,\" said one Democratic strategist, who asked to remain anonymous because of their role with an outside group.   \n   \"They're more focused on making warfare than fixing health care,\" the strategist said.   7. The real test of the politics of this will be with what comes next.   Americans, including Trump and Vance, have been skeptical of U.S. foreign intervention not because the U.S. military can't pull off regime changes but because of what happens on Day 2 and beyond.   Trump was asked Saturday about the United States' \"mixed track record of ousting dictators without necessarily a plan for what comes afterwards.\"   The president gave a nonspecific and incongruous answer.   \n   \"Well, that's why we have different presidents, but with me, that's not true,\" he said. \"With me, we've had a perfect track record of winning.\"   He went on to cite his administration's 2020 killing of Qassem Soleimani, the former leader of Iran's Quds Force, and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the former ISIS leader. Neither of them was a head of state. He also talked about the U.S. bombings of Iran's nuclear facilities last year.   But Trump did not lay out the plan for what comes next for Venezuela or his foreign policy.   This is the president's most vulnerable point politically in this second term. He is facing his worst approval ratings, is going to be 80 in June and is inching closer to politically irrelevant lame-duck status.   So it might not be surprising that Trump would try to stay in the headlines, like with this Venezuela action, and shift attention away from other, more negative issues for him politically.\n",

When it was clear the U.S. had captured Maduro, the trader made more than $400,000 in profit.   Was the trader just lucky or privy to classified government deliberations? For now, it's impossible to tell.   Online sleuths have attempted to identify this trader with no luck. The account, which originally went by the handle Burdensome-Mix before changing its display name to a string of letters and numbers, joined Polymarket just weeks before making the Maduro trade.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A screenshot of the mysterious Polymarket user's accounts with their recent trades on Maduro's ouster.\n                \n                    NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Most traders on prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi place bets under pseudonyms, not their real names. But if the accounts are linked to cryptocurrency wallets, it is sometimes possible to unmask a user.   \n   Chainalysis, which tracks crypto theft, told NPR it cannot determine the person behind the account, but noted that they are using several U.S. crypto exchanges to cash out, suggesting they are not trying to conceal their identity by using shadowy overseas exchanges, which is typical in crypto fraud schemes.   \"Was it insider trading? Hard to say,\" said Daniel Taylor, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School who studies insider trading and corporate fraud. \"It's easier in hindsight to pick out things that look suspicious than to pick them out in real time.\"   In the case of the person who placed the lucrative Maduro bet, the mystery remains, but it has set off a debate about the potential for insider trading on prediction markets, where financial experts say abuse can go unnoticed by federal regulators.   Unlike the stock market, where the Securities and Exchange Commission polices market activity for potential insider trading, far fewer guardrails are in place to keep prediction markets in line.   Polymarket and its rival, Kalshi, fall under the supervision of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which can enforce anti-fraud rules including instances of insider trading. But the agency has about one-eighth the staff of the SEC, despite Kalshi alone receiving more than $2 billion in trades in a single week.   \n   The president's son, Donald Trump Jr., is an adviser to both Polymarket and Kalshi, which makes some experts skeptical that the agency will ever go too hard on the two companies.   \"Given the conflicted relationship of the First Family,\" said Yale School of Management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, \"CFTC oversight could be compromised.\"   The CFTC, Kalshi and Polymarket did not return requests for comment. Kalshi's terms of service forbid trading with non-public information. Similarly, Polymarket's rules prohibit market manipulation more generally.   The Biden administration cracked down on prediction markets, fighting them in court over allowing bets on U.S. elections and pushing back against sports betting, which is outlawed in nearly 20 states.   Trump's regulators have taken the opposite approach. The Justice Department and CFTC have dropped investigations into prediction markets. Trump's own social media site, TruthSocial, has announced plans to introduce its own prediction market.   There have been other instances of potential insider trading on Polymarket, like when someone netted nearly $1 million by correctly betting on what 22 out of 23 of Google's most-searched terms would be last year.   The University of Pennsylvania's Taylor says even if it can be shown that someone used non-public information to make money on a prediction market, a successful prosecution would hinge on showing harm.   \"How would the U.S. government be harmed by someone trading on advanced warning of the Maduro operation?\" he said. \"If you can't show that you're depriving someone of value, it's going to be a very difficult case.\"   Have information you want to share about the Maduro trade or insider trading on prediction markets?

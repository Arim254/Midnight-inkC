The deal, worth almost $49 billion, comes at a particularly difficult time for Tylenol-maker Kenvue, after the Trump administration linked acetaminophen — the active ingredient in this common painkiller — to autism. The assertions came despite a lack of clear scientific evidence, and Kenvue has called them simply false.   For Kimberly-Clark, the deal adds a new swath of consumer brands. Besides Tylenol, Kenvue also owns other pharmacy mainstays such as Band-Aid, Listerine, Neutrogena and Aveeno.    \n   Kimberly-Clark CEO Mike Hsu said in Monday's announcement, that the two \"iconic companies\" would create \"a global health and wellness leader.\"    Executives from both companies said the combined entity would serve people \"at every stage of life\" and benefit from Kenvue's relationships with dermatologists, dentists, pediatricians and other healthcare professionals.    Kimberly-Clark has been attempting to challenge the dominance of consumer goliath Procter & Gamble, whose business spans all drugstore aisles, including cold and digestion medicines.    And Kenvue has been on the selling block for a while now, ever since it was spun off from Johnson & Johnson in 2023. Its share price collapsed a few months after going public, losing a third of its value since the start of the year before Monday's news.   On Monday morning, Kenvue's stock price jumped around 17%, while Kimberly-Clark's fell about 12%.\n",

Andrew Cuomo talks about Zohran Mamdani's lack of experience, it's impossible to miss the outrage that drives Cuomo as he fights to end his own time in the political wilderness.   \n   \"He is dangerously unqualified,\" Cuomo said Saturday during an appearance in Queens. \"When you are mayor of the city of New York, that is a big job. You are responsible for eight and a half million lives. Mayor of New York City should not be your first job.\"   This would not be a first job for Mamdani, who turned 34 last month. He was once a rapper who performed under the name Mr. Cardamom, a gig Cuomo regularly mocks. But Mamdani was elected as a state assemblyman serving in New York's legislature since 2020.     \n   Still, the difference between the two leading mayoral candidates' resumes is significant.    Cuomo, age 67, led the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development under President Clinton in the late 1990s. In 2006, he was elected New York state attorney general, and he served as governor for a decade beginning in 2011.    Cuomo was often controversial — clashing with Democrats in Albany and Washington, D.C., almost as often as he feuded with Republicans — but he also built a reputation as a leader who tackled big problems and took on large-scale projects.     \n   \"He has governed as a pragmatist, focused on solving problems rather than engaging in ideological or partisan warfare,\" said former NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg, in his endorsement of Cuomo.     \"And he has shown that he can get big things done, including the redevelopment of LaGuardia Airport, the opening of the 2nd Avenue Subway, and the creation of Moynihan Station — all long-stalled projects that he jump-started and completed,\" Bloomberg said.    \n            I care deeply about the future of our city, and since leaving office, it has been difficult to watch its struggles, especially since the pandemic. In sizing up the field in the race for mayor, there is one candidate whose management experience and government know-how stand above… pic.twitter.com/Whqxc8Daql— Mike Bloomberg (@MikeBloomberg) June 10, 2025\n   \n   Cuomo's long run at the top of the Democratic Party's elite — his father was Democratic icon Mario Cuomo — peaked in 2020 during the COVID pandemic. As governor, his folksy, hopeful online webcasts drew national viewership.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Andrew Cuomo, then governor of New York, spoke during a news conference at Grand Central Terminal in New York, U.S., on Thursday, May 27, 2021.\n                \n                    Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images/Bloomberg\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images/Bloomberg\n    \n\n   \n   Cuomo's downfall and his bid for NYC mayor   But questions began to surface about his administration's management of elderly nursing home residents during the pandemic. Cuomo also faced a growing number of accusations of sexual misconduct involving women, including some who worked under his authority.     Cuomo has denied any wrongdoing, but in August 2021, he announced he would resign as governor: \"Given the circumstances, the best way I can help now is if I step aside and let government get back to governing,\" Cuomo said.   \n   It was a stunning downfall, and in the mayoral race, Mamdani has blasted Cuomo for that portion of his track record. \"What I don't have in experience, I make up for in integrity,\" Mamdani said during a mayoral debate.  \"And what you don't have in integrity, you could never make up for in experience.\"   \n   Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, has positioned himself as the progressive in this race, a symbol of change. He would be the city's first Muslim mayor, and he's promised many left-leaning policies — including a rent freeze and free bus service — aimed at improving affordability in the city.     But Cuomo himself has a long list of progressive accomplishments, including criminal justice reforms and victories for same-sex rights, which once earned him staunch support on the left. In 2011, he pushed a bill through New York's legislature legalizing same-sex marriage. In 2013, Cuomo championed the SAFE Act, which was then one of the strictest gun control laws in the U.S.     Cuomo also launched a statewide initiative to downsize New York's prison system, which now holds roughly half as many inmates. Cuomo later campaigned for \"cashless bail,\" a policy he signed into law in 2019.   \"Experience matters and Assemblyman Mamdani doesn't have the same experience compared with Cuomo,\" said J.C. Polanco, a political analyst and professor at the University of Mount Saint Vincent in the Bronx.      But Polanco said in modern populist politics, on the left and right, a deep resume doesn't hold as much sway with voters. \"Experience doesn't count as much,\" he said. \"A bunch of Democrats are saying it doesn't matter.\"    Cuomo himself has acknowledged that Mamdani's hopeful social media messages — which often go viral on platforms like TikTok and Instagram — appear to have captured the imagination of voters in a way his more old-school campaign has failed to do.     \n   Mamdani defeated Cuomo handily in the Democratic Party primary. Polls show Mamdani has led the general election by double-digit margins for weeks.     Now running as an independent, and with time running out, Cuomo has also struggled to talk about his accomplishments, in part because he has tacked aggressively to the right. On the campaign trail in the final days, Cuomo described himself not as a progressive, but as a pro-business, pro-law-and-order centrist Democrat.   \"He is a socialist,\" Cuomo said of Mamdani, during a stop at a shopping mall in Queens. \"Democrats don't believe in socialism, they're not anti-business, they're not anti-wealth, they're not anti-jobs. And they're not anti-public safety and they're not anti-NYPD. They want safe communities.\"\n",

The program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and is a major piece of the nation's social safety net — and it costs about $8 billion per month nationally.   The situation leaves millions with uncertainty about how they will feed themselves. Benefits will be delayed in November regardless of the outcome of the court cases because many beneficiaries have their cards recharged early in the month and the process of loading cards can take a week or more in many states.   \n   Democratic state attorneys general or governors from 25 states, as well as the District of Columbia, challenged the plan to pause the program, contending that the administration has a legal obligation to keep it running in their jurisdictions. Cities and nonprofits also filed a lawsuit.   On Friday, judges in Rhode Island and Massachusetts ruled separately that the administration must continue to pay for SNAP. They both gave the administration leeway on whether to fund the program partially or in full for November.   The USDA has a $5 billion contingency fund for the program, but the Trump administration reversed an earlier agency plan to use that money to keep SNAP running. Democratic officials argue that the administration could also use a separate fund of about $23 billion.   U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell in Providence, Rhode Island, said SNAP must be funded using at least contingency funds, and he asked for an update on progress by Monday.   \n   He said all previous work requirement waivers must continue to be honored. During the shutdown, the USDA has terminated existing waivers that exempted work requirements for older adults, veterans and others.   In Boston, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani ruled the suspension was unlawful and said USDA has to pay for SNAP. Talwani ordered the federal government to advise by Monday whether they will use emergency reserve funds to provide reduced SNAP benefits for November or fully fund the program using both contingency funds and additional available funds.   \n   Advocates and beneficiaries say halting the food aid would force people to choose between buying groceries and paying other bills. The majority of states have announced more or expedited funding for food banks or novel ways to load at least some benefits onto the SNAP debit cards.   To qualify for SNAP in 2025, a family of four's net income after certain expenses can't exceed the federal poverty line, which is about $32,000 per year. Last year, SNAP assisted nearly 42 million people, about two-thirds of whom were families with children.\n",

Today's top stories   President Trump has shown little interest in negotiating with Democrats to end the government shutdown. He spent the weekend in Florida, one of five trips he's taken since the shutdown began. On Air Force One last night, he told reporters it is up to the Democrats to end it. Check the latest news on the shutdown from our coverage here.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump salutes a Marine as he arrives at the White House on Nov. 2 in Washington, D.C.

Unlike past presidents who stayed in Washington to negotiate a deal, Trump hasn't changed his schedule. The GOP-led House of Representatives passed a short-term funding bill in September. The GOP's goal is to apply pressure on Senate Democrats to vote for the House bill.   Two federal judges on Friday ordered the Trump administration to use emergency money to keep the national food aid program SNAP going. The program ran out of money on Saturday, and it is unclear how quickly the administration could restart the program. The administration has argued that using contingency funds for regular SNAP benefits is illegal because they are intended for situations such as natural disasters.    \n   🎧 NPR's Joe Hernandez reports the lapse – affecting 42 million people – is unprecedented for the program. Democratic state officials behind one of the lawsuits argue that stopping benefits will lead to worse food insecurity.📷 Food banks and pantries in the U.S. are scrambling to feed families amid the government shutdown. Here's how they are stepping up to help.   Tomorrow is Election Day, with voters in Virginia and New Jersey choosing new governors. Several cities across the country will also choose new leaders, including New York City, America's largest city. In the final stretch of the race, the face off between Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani and former governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an Independent, could heavily influence the Democratic Party. Early voting has surged compared to previous elections.    🎧 The excitement that Mamdani has garnered in this race has been exciting for a lot of Democrats, not just in the city he is campaigning in, but across the country, says NPR's Brian Mann. However, Mamdani embracing the \"socialist\" label has made many Democratic leaders nervous. Some top Democrats have withheld endorsements, and his support skews heavily toward younger voters.

The courts are weighing in on their legality. But — if successful — they could also fulfill a long-running administration goal of employing America's military to aid in the mass deportation of immigrants without legal status, according to an NPR review of past comments from Trump and his allies. It's a move that would stray significantly from past federal use of the Guard, challenging laws that dictate how the U.S. military can be used domestically. And with the 2026 midterms looming, some experts worry Guard troops could even be used as a tool of systemic voter suppression and intimidation.   \n   Trump has sent troops into four Democratic-led cities and threatened to send them to several more, claiming they are needed to crack down on crime and protect federal immigration facilities and officers. Those deployments, and the White House's rhetoric around them, have regularly conflated violent crime and illegal immigration into a single crisis, blurring the lines around the role of the Guard and federal agents.   \n   Taken one at a time, the deployments can seem random or fickle — Trump will often muse about sending troops into a city, only to back track his comments and focus on a different city days later.   But the president and several others in his inner circle — most notably Stephen Miller, a senior aide to Trump in his first term, and now Trump's right hand man on immigration — have long talked about using the National Guard to help with mass deportations and immigration raids, despite U.S. laws broadly preventing the military from being used for domestic policing. To get around those laws, both Trump and Miller have talked about invoking the Insurrection Act, which allows the president to deploy the military within the U.S. in certain situations.   Legal experts, activists and watchdog groups worry the Trump administration could fundamentally change the way the military is used on U.S. soil, specifically raising concerns about the upcoming 2026 midterm elections and what armed troops on the streets could mean as voters cast ballots.   \n   Laying the groundwork   Much of Trump's campaign ahead of the 2024 election was focused on drumming up anti-immigrant sentiment and pushing his plan for mass deportations. He vowed several times on the campaign trail that he would launch the largest deportation operation in American history.   In his first term, Trump and his administration had similar ambitions, but struggled to scale up infrastructure and manpower needed to carry out the goal.   In a TIME Magazine interview in April of 2024, then-candidate Trump was asked specifically if his plan included the use of the U.S. military.   \"I can see myself using the National Guard and, if necessary, I'd have to go a step further. We have to do whatever we have to do to stop the problem we have,\" Trump responded.   Using the National Guard for immigration enforcement is an idea that Miller had talked about publicly in the years before.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                White House Deputy Chief of Staff for policy and U.S. Homeland Security Adviser Stephen Miller speaks after President Trump signed an order sending National Guard to Memphis, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on September 15, 2025.\n                \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   In 2023, Miller appeared on the late right-wing activist Charlie Kirk's podcast to talk about how mass deportations under Trump's hopeful second term could work.   \n   \"In terms of personnel, you go to the red state governors, and you say, give us your National Guard. We will deputize them as immigration enforcement officers,\" Miller explained. \"The Alabama National Guard is going to arrest illegal aliens in Alabama, and the Virginia National Guard in Virginia.\"   Miller doesn't specify how that would be legal — under U.S. law, the military can't be used for domestic policing unless authorized by the Constitution or Congress. For Democratic-run states that don't comply, Miller said, the federal government would simply send the National Guard from a nearby Republican-run state.   The deployments   In recent months, the Trump administration has deployed Guard troops to states against the wishes of their Democratic governors — including sending troops from Texas into Illinois. The administration said their purpose was to protect federal immigration facilities and officers. Those deployments are tied up in court challenges.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Members of the Texas National Guard stand guard at an army reserve training facility on October 07, 2025 in Elwood, Illinois.\n                \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Scott Olson/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   Miles Taylor, former chief of staff in the Department of Homeland Security during Trump's first term, worked closely with Miller. He's since become a vocal critic of the president and his policies.   \n   Taylor says he's not surprised to see Miller's plan coming to fruition.   \"Trump was deeply deferential to Stephen and I think you've seen that with a vastly more empowered Stephen Miller in a second term,\" says Taylor, an author and commentator.   Taylor says that during Trump's first term, the president wasn't talking publicly about using the U.S. military for immigration enforcement, but it was something that was discussed behind closed doors.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Miles Taylor, former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security during President Trump's first term, holds up his phone outside of the U.S. courthouse in Alexandria, Va., ahead of the arraignment hearing for former FBI director James Comey on Oct. 8\n                \n                    Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"I can remember in meetings with him in the Oval Office, or on Air Force One, or at the border, him starting to bring up this idea of using the United States military to solve the problem,\" he says.   It wasn't something that Trump just talked about. In 2017, The Associated Press reported on a memo it obtained from DHS, outlining a draft proposal to use the National Guard to round up unauthorized immigrants throughout the U.S. At the time, the White House denied it, saying there was no such plan.   Taylor says there very much was — but it was also more than that.   \"It was the invocation of the Insurrection Act to deputize the military to enforce domestic law to basically become a domestic police force,\" he says, noting that this particular idea was something that troubled him and several other staffers.   \n   \"It rocked us to our core,\" he says.   Trump invoking the Insurrection Act would legally allow for the military to act as police on U.S. soil — to carry out immigration enforcement, but possibly other enforcement too, according to legal experts.   NPR asked the White House about potential plans to deputize the Guard for law enforcement and to use the Insurrection Act, but it did not directly respond to those questions, instead criticizing Taylor and NPR. Spokeswoman Abigail Jackson also referenced Trump's \"highly successful operations to drive down violent crime in American cities.\"   \n   Project 2025   The broader themes of these National Guard deployments are also embedded in Project 2025, a conservative action plan written by the Heritage Foundation after Trump's first term that's more than 900 pages long.   Trump has incorporated many of its policies, and authors into his second administration. So much so that the report's architect, Russell Vought, is the head of the White House's Office of Management and Budget.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, in September.\n                \n                    Dominic Gwinn/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Dominic Gwinn/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty\n    \n\n   \n   Matt Dallek, a professor at The George Washington University who studies the American conservative movement, says that Project 2025 essentially opens the door for Trump's National Guard deployments — particularly to Democratic-led cities — without explicitly calling for them.   \"The subtext of Project 2025 is to take any and all steps at the executive level to go into cities and states to enact the priority — which is to root out illegal immigration,\" Dallek says.   The idea of bullying states and cities into following orders from the president is a key part of the text, says David Graham, a journalist for The Atlantic who also wrote a book on the project. So is the use of the military.   \"There is this idea in Project 2025, and among the authors, that the military is just an underused resource for policing immigration,\" Graham says, noting that often illegal immigration is presented as a national security problem. He says the report's authors believe that the U.S. has \"this huge, huge resource of armed people, and we're not doing anything with it, and we need to use it to secure the border.\"   Beyond mass deportation   In recent weeks, Trump has talked about invoking the Insurrection Act often, especially in regard to deploying the National Guard. Earlier this month, he said that he was \"allowed\" to invoke it if the courts deny his deployments in places like Portland, Ore., or Chicago, where prosecutors and federal judges have questioned the need for troops on the ground.   \n   Trump invoking the Insurrection Act to allow troops to help with immigration enforcement is also something that Stephen Miller has talked about.   He told the New York Times back in 2023: \"President Trump will do whatever it takes.\"   That possibility has both legal experts and immigration advocates worried, especially about the implications it could have for Americans at large.   Kica Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center, an immigration rights advocacy group, says it has her worried about the upcoming 2026 midterm elections and what the presence of troops might mean for voters as they cast ballots.   \n   \"What I have said repeatedly is that the path to authoritarianism in this country is being built on the backs of immigrants. They will begin with immigrants. They will not end with immigrants,\" she says.\n",

The commonwealth's gubernatorial race — one of just two held the year after presidential elections — is often seen as a temperature check on how voters feel about leaders in Washington.   Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee and former congresswoman, has maintained a lead in polls since very early in the race over Republican nominee Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.   But this year, while voters' top concerns are energy prices, housing affordability and jobs, the rest of the race has become a referendum on everything from political violence to redistricting.   \n   Here, public media journalists across Virginia take us into each issue.   DOGE and the federal government shutdown   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Former President Barack Obama joins former Congresswoman and Virginia Democratic candidate for governor Abigail Spanberger at a rally on Nov. 1 at Chartway Arena in Norfolk.\n                \n                    Shaban Athuman/VPM News\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Shaban Athuman/VPM News\n    \n\n   \n   The challenges facing Virginia's 320,000 federal workers and hundreds of thousands of federal contractors came long before the Oct. 1 government shutdown. Earlier this year, during Elon Musk's DOGE efforts, thousands of Virginians were laid off.   Democrats in the commonwealth hope that voter anger over the firings and furloughs will carry them to victory on Tuesday night. On the campaign trail, Spanberger talks about sticking up for federal workers in the face of the \"chaos from Washington.\" At a campaign event Thursday, Spanberger put it this way: \"The stakes of this election are serious.\"   As furloughs stretch into a second month, Virginia Republicans have also seen a political opening in the shutdown. \"My opponent, all summer long, has been playing political football with federal workers by trying to say that she loves them more than anyone else,\" Earle-Sears said on the debate stage, and then criticized Spanberger for encouraging Democrats in Congress to resist any funding deal that doesn't include continuing health care subsidies.   But Earle-Sears hasn't shied away from the Trump administration's cuts to the federal workforce. She has said she believes claims of \"waste, fraud, and abuse\" and argues that the impact of layoffs in Virginia will be minimal due to the economic strength she and Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin have stewarded over the previous four years.   \n   Political violence   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Former Del.

Early last month, text messages from 2022 show Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general and a former member of the Virginia legislature, describing hypothetical violence against a political opponent.   Earle-Sears and other Republican candidates have tried to tie the text messages to the assassination of Charlie Kirk, painting Democrats as politically violent.   Spanberger condemned the messages and political violence generally, but didn't withdraw or double down on her endorsement of Jones. \"It is up to voters to make an individual choice based on this information,\" she said in the gubernatorial debate.   Jones' Republican opponent, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, is appealing to Spanberger voters to split their tickets.

Winsome Earle-Sears, Republican candidate for governor, chats with the clerks and minority and majority leadership as they attempt to override her ruling during a special session of the Virginia General Assembly on Wednesday, Oct. 29, at the Capitol in Richmond.\n                \n                    Shaban Athuman/VPM News\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Shaban Athuman/VPM News\n    \n\n   \n   Democrats in the Virginia legislature threw another wrench into the campaign last week by calling a surprise series of meetings after North Carolina became another state to redraw its congressional map to favor the GOP at the behest of President Trump.   On Friday, the Virginia legislature proposed a constitutional amendment that would allow redistricting ahead of the 2026 midterms. Because it needs to be approved by legislators again next year before voters can finalize the amendment next spring, its success depends on Spanberger winning her race and Democrats maintaining control of the House of Delegates.   How much the redistricting plan changes voters' minds is up for debate. Close to a million voters cast their ballots before the Democrats announced their plan, while the redistricting session took delegates off the trail during the final full week of campaigning.   Earle-Sears, who presides over the state Senate in her role as lieutenant governor, was also called back to Richmond. She still managed to hold events around the state, and a press conference on the steps of the Virginia Capitol, while a small crowd held \"Winsome For Governor\" signs.   \n   Spanberger has made few public comments about redistricting, beyond signaling her general support.

The argument over transgender athletes and bathrooms in Virginia schools really took off when Republican Glenn Youngkin made it a focus of his 2021 campaign for governor. Arguably, it helped him become the first GOP governor elected in more than a decade.   But, despite Republicans spending millions on ads around transgender students in 2025, recent polling shows it's a top concern for 3 percent of voters. The economy and countering Trump's policies are at the forefront of most voters' minds.   Spanberger has said she likely leads on the subject because Republicans have been \"villainizing kids.\"   \"Particularly efforts to heavily politicize a group of kids who need a bit of grace, and the adults around them to show thoughtfulness,\" the former congresswoman said.   \"I'm not taking a stand because it's the easy thing to do. Of course, it's not easy. I'm being abused for it,\" Earle-Sears said, comparing her support for cisgender students to the civil rights movement.

California voters are deciding Proposition 50, which would allow the state's Democratic leaders to temporarily bypass California's independent redistricting commission and enact a more Democratic-friendly congressional map ahead of next year's midterm elections.\n                \n                    Gabriella Angotti-Jones for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Gabriella Angotti-Jones for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   LOS ANGELES — Adelaide Stone Van Gessel says she doesn't agree with partisan gerrymandering in practice.   But she voted yes on Proposition 50, a California ballot measure that would allow the state's Democratic leaders to temporarily bypass California's independent redistricting commission and enact a more Democratic-friendly congressional map ahead of next year's midterm elections.   Van Gessel and others who back Prop 50 told NPR the proposal provides the Democratic-leaning state a rare opportunity to directly counteract President Trump and Republican efforts to redraw political maps in their favor in other states.   \"What we're doing is gerrymandering to stop gerrymandering,\" she said. \"And that's not really the best solution, but it is something that we find ourselves in this kind of environment having to do.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Adelaide Stone Van Gessel stands with her dog, Guinness, outside the Oakwood Community Center and voting site in the Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles.\n                \n                    Gabriella Angotti-Jones for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Gabriella Angotti-Jones for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Voting for the one-issue special election concludes Tuesday, with polling showing that Prop 50 is likely to pass. If it does, California's Democratic state leaders can use a new congressional map that makes five U.S. House seats more favorable to the party, offsetting the five districts Republicans shifted their direction in Texas earlier this year.   \n   GOP lawmakers in Missouri and North Carolina have also enacted new maps, and a bipartisan deal reached last week in Ohio tilts that state's congressional map further to the right. Lawmakers in other states, including Virginia Democrats, could join the redistricting fight.   In Southern California, many left-leaning voters approving Prop 50 reported having mixed feelings about the measure, but ultimately felt that allowing a partisan gerrymander is one of the only options they have to stop Trump from shutting out a Democratic win in Congress next year.   \"We can't play the game like decent people anymore,\" said Stephanie Eberstein, who, like Van Gessel, lives in the liberal LA neighborhood of Venice. \"I mean, those rules are out the window. So, we have to do what we have to do.\"   In Orange County, Eva Hernandez agrees.   \n   \"We got to do something,\" Hernandez said. \"Can't just sit back and let things roll like they've been rolling. … California's got to do it. We're a blue state. We got to do what we got to do to counteract that.\"   Republican voters in California fear losing representation   With surveys showing Prop 50 likely to be approved, it appears none of the opposition's arguments against the measure is truly landing in a state that is strongly Democratic.   A number of voters told NPR they're focused on the current proposal, and could not recall how they voted about 15 years ago, when the state's citizen-led, nonpartisan redistricting commission was enacted.   \n   Kathy Brewer voted no on Prop 50. She lives in Rancho Santa Margarita, one of a few GOP-leaning enclaves in Southern California. She told NPR she thinks this special election and redraw are unnecessary.   \"It's a waste of money,\" she said. \"Of good California money that we need.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Betty Roth stands outside of the Rancho Santa Margarita Library in Orange County.\n                \n                    Gabriella Angotti-Jones for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Gabriella Angotti-Jones for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Betty Roth is another no vote. She says that as a Republican she already feels pretty powerless in the state.   Out of the 52 seats California has in the U.S. House, only nine are currently held by Republicans. Roth says she doesn't want the GOP to lose what little representation it has.   \"They're trying to take away the vote from a good portion of the American people by, you know, gerrymandering,\" she said.   But a lot of Democratic voters don't feel much sympathy for this argument.   Aaron Leal, who also lives in Rancho Santa Margarita, says Republicans are trying to rig the midterms in their favor because they aren't sure they can win on policy. He says the party is practically forcing Democrats to react.   \"If one side is going full force pushing their agenda, we cannot bring, as they say, like a knife to a gunfight,\" he said.   Leal says he also likes that the measure is temporary. After 2030, the state would go back to the independent redistricting commission.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Aaron (left), Maria, Evelyn, Isaac and David Leal stand outside the Rancho Santa Margarita Library.

I don't know what you're supposed to do on this, and I'm glad I'm not a politician.\"   Checel wasn't thrilled about Prop 50 but voted in favor of it because it's better than doing nothing, he said.   \n   Other Democrats say they are really excited to see their leaders fight back, including Reina Santiago in Venice.   \"I'm glad that our state is taking the charge against this because somebody has to do something,\" she said. \"The GOP is totally complicit with Trump, and if we let them walk all over us, they'll do it. So that's what this vote is about.\"   And while Jim Lind, who lives in Irvine, agrees with this sentiment, he said he's also pretty sad that this is what politics has become.   \"It's unfortunate that any party, whatever it may be, has to stoop to a lower level to get things done,\" he said. \"You know, all my life I've probably been more idealistic as far as the honesty of people. And it's just not working out.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Reina Santiago stands outside of the Oakwood Community Center in Venice.\n                \n                    Gabriella Angotti-Jones for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Gabriella Angotti-Jones for NPR\n    \n\n   \n",

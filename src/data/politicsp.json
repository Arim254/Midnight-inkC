    "body": "\n      The government shutdown is dragging on, with no serious negotiations between the parties. The House is not in session and most members are back home in their districts, hearing from constituents.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  There are still no serious negotiations in Congress to bring the government shutdown to a close. The House of Representatives hasn't even had a vote in over a month. NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt left the halls of the Capitol to find one member in his Texas district. Barbara, thanks for being with us.BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Thanks for having me.SIMON: I gather you visited Llano, about 90 minutes northwest of Austin. It's represented by Congressman August Pfluger. What did he say to constituents?SPRUNT: Well, he praised Republicans' signature tax and spending bill from earlier this year. It included tax cuts and changes to the Medicaid program, all very popular with this group of about 40 people, including some members of local government. That wasn't a surprise to me. This district went for President Trump in 2024 by 72%. It is a solid red district. He also talked a lot about the shutdown. He said the House did its job in passing a continuing resolution to temporarily fund the government just before they left in mid-September.SIMON: But the House still hasn't returned.SPRUNT: That's right. For now, the speaker isn't bringing the chamber back until Senate Democrats agree to fund the government. And the congressman laid out why he thinks Democrats haven't done that yet. Pfluger said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer needs to look like he's opposing President Trump at every turn.AUGUST PFLUGER: I think he has to look tough to his radical-left base because he's worried about AOC being the next senator from New York, and so he has to be seen as fighting Trump.SPRUNT: Of course, Senate Democrats would put it a bit differently. They say they're trying to force a negotiation on extending ACA subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year. Pfluger, like his party leadership, says they should fund the government first and then negotiate on the subsidies. So I asked voters at this about the town hall. Carlton Johnson (ph), a Republican, said he has big concerns about health care, but Democrats' message just doesn't resonate with him.CARLTON JOHNSON: What I see is the Democrats trying to hold the country hostage to get what they want. Yeah, I think it's very childish.SIMON: Of course, health care is at the center of why the shutdown continues. More and more states will be feeling the consequences, particularly cuts to nutrition assistance. Did that come up?SPRUNT: It did. Here's the congressman.PFLUGER: I think the food assistance is one that I would put at the very highest level of worry. Can you imagine kids not getting the funding they need?SPRUNT: Now, in Texas, over 3 million people use SNAP benefits, and about 10% of households in Pfluger's district, according to an estimate from the U.S. Census. One constituent told me she's very concerned about kids not getting this assistance, but she hopes that food banks can step up.SIMON: Is that even possible?SPRUNT: Well, I called the CEO of the Central Texas Food Bank to ask exactly that question. Here's Sari Vatske.SARI VATSKE: There is no way that we alone can make up for a $44 million food budget shortfall. We are currently spending $1.3 million per month, which is already up from $1.1 million to purchase food to make up for the increased need. So simply put, we need the government to reopen.SPRUNT: Now, she said that if November SNAP benefits are gone for families in Central Texas, what that means is 127,000 households without those benefits.SIMON: And of course, President Trump hasn't stepped forward to try to broker a deal. What did people there have to say about his involvement?SPRUNT: Well, you know, a few people mentioned wanting to see him step in and play a role. Small business owner Mickey Kasarik (ph) is particularly concerned about these health care premiums skyrocketing without an extension of the subsidies. And he said he wonders where the president is in all of this.MICKEY KASARIK: I mean, he wrote \"The Art Of The Deal,\" right? You know, if he's such a good negotiator and does that, why doesn't he say, let's sit down. Let's find something?SPRUNT: He's a Republican, but he's critical of the president. He says that if Trump stepped in to stop the shutdown, it would be a plus in his book. But the president left for a trip to Asia yesterday, so it's looking unlikely that he'll be sitting down at any negotiating table with Democrats and Republicans anytime soon.SIMON: NPR's Barbara Sprunt. Thanks so much.SPRUNT: Thank you, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

But for more than 80 years, the White House movie theater was mostly a place where the first family and their guests went for entertainment.   Demolition began this week of the White House Family Theater — along with the rest of the White House's East Wing where the snug, shoe-box-shaped auditorium was located — to make way for a new $300 million ballroom. It marks the end of an era in American movie theater history.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                An excavator works to clear rubble on Thursday after the East Wing of the White House was demolished in Washington, D.C. The historic White House Family Theater was destroyed as part of President Trump's effort to make way for a new ballroom.\n                \n                    Eric Lee/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Eric Lee/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Since its conversion from a cloakroom by Franklin Roosevelt in 1942, the private, 40-ish-seat theater has screened everything from newsreels and documentaries to westerns and musicals. It has been through several facelifts, most recently ditching cream and red floral curtains, and beige walls and seating for all-round \"movie-palace red\" ornamented with gold molding and dark wood trim following a renovation overseen by first lady Laura Bush in 2004.   \n   \"The best perk of the White House is not Air Force One or Camp David or anything else, it's the wonderful movie theater I get here,\" then-President Bill Clinton told film critic Roger Ebert in a 1999 interview.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                April 14, 1989: President George Bush and first lady Barbara Bush host a screening in the White House movie theater. The first lady is sharing a seat with her grandson Jebbie Bush.\n                \n                    George Bush Presidential Library and Museum/NARA\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        George Bush Presidential Library and Museum/NARA\n    \n\n   \n   Jimmy Carter was also a big fan. In a single term, the 39th president screened at least 400 films between this venue and Camp David, starting with All the President's Men — a movie about the Watergate scandal — soon after he was sworn in. Richard Nixon saw Patton, about the controversial World War II Gen. George S. Patton, multiple times during the Vietnam War. Barack Obama's many screenings at the theater ranged from Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom and Selma to Julie & Julia and Star Wars Rogue One. President Trump's picks have included Finding Dory and Sunset Boulevard. John F. Kennedy, who loved James Bond movies, saw From Russia With Love the day before he was assassinated in 1963.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                U.S. first lady Melania Trump (R) and for education secretary Betsy DeVos host students for a screening of the motion picture 'Wonder' in the White House movie theater in 2018.\n                \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Not all U.S. presidents were film buffs. According to a 1997 New York Times interview with Paul Fischer, who served as the White House's projectionist from the 1950s to the '80s, Lyndon B. Johnson slept through most screenings. (Fischer kept careful logs of all of the movies shown at the theater. A sample from Kennedy's White House years can be seen here.)   \n   \"It was a place for the president to watch what America was watching,\" said Matt Lambros, who authored several books about historic movie theaters, in an interview with NPR. \"To have it destroyed is bulldozing a piece of American history.\"   The White House did not respond to NPR's request for comment, nor confirm reports from other media outlets about plans to build a new movie theater as part of the East Wing's redevelopment.   \"We're just going off of their word that a theater will be rebuilt,\" said Lambros. \"I hope that's the case, and the next hundred years of presidents can enjoy it.\"\n",

Regional observers will monitor the situation to ensure fighting doesn't restart.   \"We did something that a lot of people said couldn't be done,\" Trump said. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet called it a \"historic day,\" and Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said the agreement creates \"the building blocks for a lasting peace.\"   The ceremony was Trump's first event after arriving at the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, hosted in Kuala Lumpur. The trip, which will continue with visits to Japan and South Korea and a potential meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, is an opportunity for Trump to burnish his reputation as an international dealmaker at a time when his tariffs have scrambled the international economy and he's feuding with Democrats over a government shutdown back home.   \n   Trump touched down in the Malaysian capital shortly before 0200 GMT, where he performed his trademark campaign trail dance with local performers and waved an American flag in one hand and a Malaysian flag in the other.   \n   The president signed economic agreements with Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia, some of them aimed at increasing trade involving critical minerals. The U.S. wants to rely less on China, which has limited exports of key components in technology manufacturing.   \"It's very important that we cooperate as willing partners with each other to ensure that we can have smooth supply chains, secure supply chains, for the quality of life, for our people and security,\" said U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.   Trump reengages with a key region of the world   The president attended this summit only once during his first term, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth seemed unfamiliar with ASEAN during his confirmation hearing in January.   But this year's event was a chance for Trump to reengage with a collection of nations that has a combined $3.8 trillion economy and 680 million people.   \"The United States is with you 100%, and we intend to be a strong partner and friend for many generations to come,\" Trump said. He described his counterparts as \"spectacular leaders\" and said, \"everything you touch turns to gold.\"   \n   The summit also allowed Trump to play global peacemaker with Thailand and Cambodia, which have competing territorial claims that result in periodic violence along their border. Some of the worst modern fighting between the two countries took place over five days in July, killing dozens and displacing hundreds of thousands of people, some of the worst modern fighting between the two countries.   Trump threatened, at the time, to withhold trade agreements unless the fighting stopped in a display of economic leverage credited with spurring negotiations. A shaky truce has persisted since then.   \"The fact that Trump was holding the tariff card was actually very, very significant,\" said Ou Virak, president of Phnom Penh's Future Forum think tank. \"That's probably the main reason, if not the only reason, but definitely the main reason why the two sides agreed immediately to the ceasefire.\"   Now, he said, \"there's a ceremony for Trump to be in front of cameras\" so he can be \"seen as the champion that brings an end to wars and conflicts,\" giving him \"more ammunition for his bid for Nobel Peace Prize.\"   Trump has explicitly campaigned for the honor, continuously adding to a list of conflicts that he either helped resolve or claims to have ended.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                U.S. President Donald Trump attends the ceremonial signing of a ceasefire agreement between Thailand and Cambodia on the sidelines of the 47th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Sunday, Oct. 26, 2025.\n                \n                    Mohd Rasfan/POOL AFP/ AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mohd Rasfan/POOL AFP/ AP\n    \n\n   \n   Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim praised the agreement between Thailand and Cambodia during opening remarks at the summit, saying, \"it reminds us that reconciliation is not concession, but an act of courage.\"   Thai foreign ministry spokesperson Nikorndej Balankura described the deal on Saturday as a \"joint declaration\" that will show Thailand and Cambodia \"are committed to renewing their relations.\"   \"It's not an end in itself,\" Nikorndej said. \"Work has just begun.\"   Tariffs are in focus on Trump's trip   Trump is expected to sit down with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva while he's in Kuala Lumpur, but not Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. The U.S. leader is angry with Canada because of a television ad protesting his tariffs, and on his way to the summit, announced on social media he would hike tariffs on Canada because of it.   \n   Another trade war is front and center on Trump's trip — this one, with China. Trump told reporters traveling with him on Air Force One that he was optimistic his meeting with Xi, expected to take place in South Korea, could yield progress on a range of issues. Fentanyl trafficking and soybean sales are among Trump's priorities.   \"I think we have a really good chance of making a very comprehensive deal,\" Trump said. \"I want our farmers to be taken care of. And he wants things also.\"   It remains to be seen whether Trump's dealmaking addresses longstanding issues or puts them off for another day.   U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested Sunday that Washington and Beijing could step back from their confrontation instead of pushing forward with higher tariffs by America and export restrictions on rare earth elements by China.   When asked if the two countries could extend the trade truce from earlier this year, Bessent said: \"I would say yes.\" However, he emphasized that the final decision would be up to Trump.   Trump has expressed confidence about the prospect of finalizing trade agreements with Japan and South Korea, two longstanding allies and trading partners, during the trip.   \"We have deals with a lot of people and they're very good deals,\" he told reporters traveling with him on Air Force One.   One leader who was absent from the summit in Kuala Lumpur is Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Although he was close with Trump during his first term, the relationship has been more tense lately. Trump caused irritation by boasting that he settled a recent conflict between India and Pakistan, and he has increased tariffs on India for its purchase of Russian oil.\n",

The U.S. has yet to finalize trade agreements with Japan and Korea, and tensions between the U.S. and China over trade have escalated in recent weeks, though Trump is insisting he'll be able to make a deal with Xi.   \n   There was also a border dispute between Thailand and Cambodia. That tension has been simmering for years, but erupted over the summer, leaving dozens of civilians and soldiers dead. Both countries agreed to a ceasefire, in part after Trump threatened them with higher tariffs if the fighting continued. A negotiated peace agreement is supposed to be signed at a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Kuala Lumpur.   Trump presides over Cambodia-Thailand peace agreement in Malaysia   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A Cambodian Buddhist monk holds a portrait of President Trump as he takes part in a march for peace in Phnom Penh on Aug. 10, following a border conflict with Thailand.\n                \n                    Tang Chhin Sothy/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Tang Chhin Sothy/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Trump will attend the ASEAN summit for the first time since 2017, where a key component will be presiding over the peace agreement.   For several months, the president has been touting his ability to end \"unendable\" wars around the world, including this conflict in Southeast Asia.   \"I have ended seven unending wars. They said they were unendable. You're never going to get them solved,\" Trump said in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month. \"No president or prime minister, and for that matter no other country, has ever done anything close to that, and I did it in just seven months. It's never happened before. There's never been anything like that.\"   A U.S. official who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity said that they don't expect China to participate in the peace agreement signing ceremony because the U.S. doesn't believe China played a \"significant\" or \"consequential\" role in the peace agreement, though it did take part in the mediations. On Air Force One Friday night, Trump told reporters that the Chinese \"weren't involved\" in the deal but did give credit to Malaysia.    \n   Trump will meet with Japan's new prime minister and talk trade with Korea   South Korea has also recently dealt with its own tumult, having recently elected President Lee Jae Myung, after Lee's predecessor declared martial law and was later impeached.   Lee has negotiated some framework of a trade agreement with Trump, but details of the deal are yet to be finalized, including Korea's pledge to invest $350 billion in the U.S.   Trump will meet with Lee while in Korea — the first time the two have met in person since a recent ICE raid at a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia resulted in the temporary detention of 300 South Korean workers and shocked Koreans back home.   In addition to trade, it's likely that Lee and Trump will also discuss North Korea. Lee recently told CNN he hopes Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un can \"engage in dialogue.\" Trump said Friday that he was open to meeting with Kim.   \"I had a great relationship with him, and he probably knows I'm coming, right?\" he told reporters. \"But, if you want to put out the word, I'm open to it.\"   While in Japan, Trump will sit down with the newly elected Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi — the nation's first female prime minister — and he will be hosted by the emperor.   Trump will also be making remarks at the USS George Washington at the U.S. naval base in Yokosuka.   The Trump-Xi meeting might not move the needle   Finally, Trump's trip will end with a highly anticipated meeting with Xi on Oct. 30 — though Beijing has not yet confirmed the meeting.   There have been months of back-and-forth on tariff negotiations between the U.S. and China that has kept the global economy on edge. Tensions had simmered over the summer when the two countries agreed to de-escalate.   \n   But earlier this month, Beijing caught Trump by surprise, announcing a further limit on exports of rare earths minerals, which the U.S. and other countries rely on for military equipment and other technologies.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                China's President Xi Jinping greets President Trump in June 2019 on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Osaka that year.\n                \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Trump threatened to cancel his meeting with Xi altogether and hike tariffs.   \"This was a real surprise, not only to me, but to all the Leaders of the Free World,\" Trump posted on Truth Social. \"I was to meet President Xi in two weeks, at APEC, in South Korea, but now there seems to be no reason to do so.\"   Despite China's recent moves, Trump spoke positively of his relationship with Xi more recently, and said he expects a \"fantastic\" deal with China.   Experts, though, say the meeting will likely be a moment for both countries to buy time.   \"I'm not sure that either side is fully prepared to climb down from the positions that they've staked out,\" said Ryan Hass, director of the China Center at Brookings, a liberal-leaning think tank in Washington.   He expects the meeting to result in an extension of the \"trade truce\" the U.S. and China agreed to over the summer to \"allow time and space\" for negotiators to finalize a trade agreement.\n",

Still, the Trump administration's claim that domestic terrorism largely comes from the left has flown in the face of data. Federal law enforcement authorities and non-governmental researchers have, for years, found the far right to be the most \"lethal and persistent\" domestic terrorist threat. Among examples they cite are racially motivated mass killings at an African American church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015, a Walmart in El Paso in 2019, and a grocery store in Buffalo, N.Y., in 2022; and the 2018 massacre at a Jewish synagogue in Pittsburgh.   But a recent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) posits that a reversal took place in the first half of 2025. It analyzed roughly 30 years of data and found that between Jan. 1 and July 4 of this year, the number of far-left terrorist plots and attacks outnumbered those from the far right.   \n   \"My hope was to bring some data to the discussion and to try to use the data to understand possible reasons left wing terrorism might be increasing and right wing terrorism might be decreasing,\" said Daniel Byman, director of the Warfare, Irregular Threats and Terrorism Program at CSIS. Byman co-authored the study with Riley McCabe, an associate fellow in the same program.   But the report itself has ignited a firestorm of debate within the field of counterterrorism and extremism research. For many, the conclusions are premature. And ultimately, critics say it does more to reveal the complications around collecting and analyzing data on domestic terrorism than it does to clarify the current state of the problem itself.   \n   A claim that left-wing terrorism is rising — but with caveats   The CSIS study drew from a variety of sources that included information from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data project, the Anti-Defamation League and media reports. Because there is no public, official, unified and comprehensive database of domestic terrorism incidents in the U.S., researchers who wish to analyze trends are required to assemble their own data sets.   \"There are a lot of ambiguities for really anyone who's trying to code terrorist attacks,\" said Byman. \"Coding\" refers to a process by which analysts apply sorting criteria to an incident to determine how it should be categorized. In the CSIS analysis, for example, there was the initial requirement to determine whether incidents even qualify as terrorism.   \"If someone draws a swastika on a synagogue, do you say that's antisemitic terrorism? We tended to focus on risk of life, so that sort of violence would not count,\" Byman explained. \"In a more political context, the arson attacks on Tesla would not count because there doesn't seem to have been any attempt or intent to kill individual people.\"   Additional coding happens after analysts compile their lists of domestic terrorism incidents. In this case, Byman and McCabe were interested in focusing on cases that, in their view, could be attributed to right-wing or left-wing motivations. During the first six months of 2025, they coded five instances as left-wing terrorism, and one as right-wing terrorism.   But Byman said the significance of these findings has caveats.   \"Even the five [left-wing terrorist incidents] we get for the first half of 2025 — let's say that pace continues and it's 10 — that's a small number compared to right-wing terrorism when it was at its peak in recent years,\" Byman said. \"And so the increase to me has to be taken in context.\"   \n   In fact, Byman said that while several news outlets ran with headlines that highlighted a rise in left-wing plots and attacks, that was perhaps the less remarkable finding.   \"The decline in right-wing attacks is actually much more striking,\" he said.   The single act that the CSIS study coded as right-wing terrorism during the first half of 2025 was the assassination of Minnesota state representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the shooting of Minnesota state senator John Hoffman and his wife. Byman surmises the drop-off in frequency of right-wing incidents may be due to a feeling that the Trump administration has operationalized policy objectives, such as increased immigration enforcement, that previously animated violence on the right.   But several experts within the field of counterterrorism and extremism research have raised concerns about the methodology, conclusions and timing of the study.   \"Five is a really low case number\"   For Amy Cooter, deputy director at the Institute for Countering Digital Extremism, the numbers found in the CSIS study are too small to support any robust conclusions.   \"Five is a really low case number to try to make any kind of inference from and try to say that we're having a major increase in any kind of problem,\" said Cooter, who co-authored a critique of the report. \"Compared to historical data, almost any increase in left-wing violence is going to look like a big jump.\"   By contrast, Byman and McCabe's count of right-wing terrorism tallies 144 incidents between 1994 and 2000. That suggests a rate of 12 incidents per six-month period, more than twice what they found in their analysis of left-wing terrorism during the first half of 2025.   \"The primary thing that I'm worried about with that report is how some people are already interpreting that as projecting a real threat from the left, both through the rest of 2025 and through an undefined future period as well,\" Cooter said. \"Not only are five incidents still objectively really small, we know historically we have seen a greater number of incidents that are more reasonably coded as right-oriented.\"   \n   Beyond the distortions that may come from small numbers, others have raised additional red flags about the study.   \"There have been methodological concerns that have been aired with that product,\" said Jacob Ware, research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and an adjunct professor at Georgetown University. \"I think part of the firestorm has been people pointing out individual cases that are included or are not included.\"   The study of domestic terrorism is highly subjective   From decisions about whether a particular incident should be coded as terrorism, to discerning a perpetrator's ideology or politics, whether those beliefs ultimately motivated the violence, and the extent to which mental health issues factored in — researchers may draw different conclusions. In many cases, those determinations simply cannot be made until court cases begin, and evidence relating to the suspect's background and planning are publicly available. As a result, there's surprising variance when it comes to analyzing domestic terrorism.   \n   \"There's a lot of subjectivity that goes into this,\" Cooter said. \"Basically, it's up to teams of researchers deciding their own criteria for what counts or doesn't [in deciding what goes] into a particular dataset.\"   For those reasons, Cooter and Ware said they have different assessments about some of the incidents that the CSIS study included — and excluded — in its analysis.   \"We really need to get statements or justifications, motivations from perpetrators,\" said Ware. \"I don't think we have that in the Charlie Kirk assassination or the Minnesota assassination.\"   The Kirk assassination occurred after the time span that the CSIS analysis examined, but Byman said he considers that killing to be \"a very obvious example\" of an additional act of left-wing terrorism in 2025. Cooter, however, said she believes any coding of the killing, at this juncture, is premature.   \"We're still waiting for more information on the Charlie Kirk shooting, quite frankly,\" she said.   Ware also noted that the CSIS study left off incidents that others might call acts of left-wing terrorism. For instance, it excluded the killing of two Israeli embassy staffers outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., in May. Byman said the CSIS is adjusting how it codes violence committed in the name of Palestinian rights because of particular complexities around that issue.   The study also left out instances where vandals damaged Tesla vehicles and charging stations. There were several such examples of this during the early months of Trump's second term, when Tesla CEO Elon Musk was heading up the administration's efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency.   \n   \"To me, that might qualify as an act of terrorism, if somebody is using incendiary devices against civilian targets for political purposes,\" Ware said.   But the study does count the arson of 11 NYPD squad cars in June of 2025, a case that Ware said would not necessarily have made his list.   Other high-profile instances of violence, including the murder of the CEO of United Healthcare late last year, and two apparent attempted assassinations of Donald Trump in 2024, are further testing frameworks for analyzing domestic terrorism. In the case of the health care executive, the suspect charged with the killing has been celebrated as a kind of folk hero to some on the left. But little is still known about what might have motivated the violence. With the incidents involving Trump, the motives also remain unclear.   \n   Byman said it is reasonable and expected that others might arrive at different conclusions about the same events.   \"If you're changing your coding to try to be more inclusive or less inclusive, does it change your general trends?,\" he said. \"And my take would be, no, we still see the relative increase in left-wing [terrorism], we still see the significant decrease in right-wing [terrorism], although the particular numbers, I would say, can vary depending on different legitimate coding systems.\"   \"Salad Bar Extremism\"   Across the field, counterterrorism and extremism researchers largely agree that in recent years, there has been an increase in violence that may be considered domestic terrorism. Many believe the increase has occurred within both the left and the right. And many agree that it is critical to achieve a firmer understanding of the source of the threat.   \"If, hypothetically, we see 90% of attacks or plots coming from people of a particular political persuasion, it doesn't make sense to evenly divide our resources across the political spectrum,\" Cooter said, \"because that's not going to pick up on the majority of those potential threats.\"   But some experts are questioning whether a left-right framework is sufficient to track the evolving nature of violence in the U.S. Former FBI director Christopher Wray often invoked the term \"salad bar extremism\" to refer to the disjointed assemblage of beliefs that violent actors increasingly seemed to hold. Earlier this year, the FBI established a new coding category called \"nihilistic violent extremism\" to capture a growing phenomenon of non-ideological crimes. And from a lethality perspective, the deadliest incident so far this year occurred on Jan. 1 when a self-radicalized Islamist perpetrator drove into a crowd on New Years Day in New Orleans, killing 14 people.   Ware said that for him, the shift in domestic terrorism is better defined by a change in who has been targeted.   \n   \"Terrorism is getting more personal,\" he said.   In the past, Ware said, domestic terrorists have tended to aim for higher body counts. He pointed to the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, which killed 168 people. But recently, Ware said that attacks have been circumscribed to far fewer victims — even when there was the opportunity to kill more.   \"I think one of the really strange cases where you see this very strongly was the Washington, D.C., Capital Jewish Museum murders,\" he said. \"[The suspect] executed two people in the street and then entered his target without launching further violence. ... It was almost like he felt he'd already achieved his goal with just those two pointblank, horrendous murders.\"   \n   While the CSIS study has set off vigorous discussion and disagreement about the source of terrorism in the U.S., few believe that it will materially impact policy.   \"The administration is going after anti-fascist groups or networks, movements. That's not really where the violence is coming from,\" Ware said. \"So even if the findings are correct, that doesn't mean the administration is doing the right thing with those findings.\"   In fact, since Trump took office in January, some developments have elevated suspicion that this administration may go farther than simply ignoring data. In September, independent journalist Jason Paladino wrote that the Department of Justice appeared to have removed a study that found far-right extremists to be responsible for the most lethal terrorism since 1990. The study is still available through The Internet Archive. The DOJ's Office of Justice Programs did not respond to questions from NPR about this.   Additionally, in March the Department of Homeland Security discontinued funding for the Terrorism and Targeted Violence project at the University of Maryland. That project was the only publicly available centralized data project collecting information about terrorism and targeted violence in the country. Since 2020, that database has provided information used by professionals in areas of homeland security, school safety and violence prevention.   In response to an NPR query about the decision to discontinue its funding, a DHS spokesperson said the project had \"biased and misleading data practices.\" It also said it \"disproportionately focused on right-wing ideologies while downplaying left-wing extremism.\"   Ultimately, as the administration refocuses from terrorism to counternarcotics operations and immigration enforcement, Ware said Americans are increasingly at risk.   \"We are seeing a higher drumbeat of violence across the board and now the onus shifts to the administration to be able to prevent that. And I think that is where the American people should be really concerned,\" he said. \"Whether the violence is coming from the left or the right, the onus is on law enforcement and intelligence agencies to prevent it and to protect the American people. And they are not doing that right now.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      Republicans in Georgia are worried about losing a rare off-year election in November because rural voters might not show up at the polls.   \n\n    ADRIAN FLORIDO, HOST:  Rare off-year elections for two seats on a little-known utility board in Georgia are making Republicans nervous. That's because Democrats have more reasons to come out and vote. Emily Jones of member station WABE reports.EMILY JONES, BYLINE: Some of Georgia's top Republicans gathered in a barn-style wedding venue in Forsyth County, north of Atlanta, recently for a show of party unity and patriotism.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BUBBA MCDONALD: (Singing) And I'm proud to be an American, where at least I know I'm free.JONES: Bubba McDonald led them in song. He's a longtime member of the Public Service Commission, which regulates the state's largest electric utility, Georgia Power. Everyone on the commission is a Republican right now, and state party chair Josh McKoon told the crowd to keep it that way.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOSHUA MCKOON: We are all united in one goal, and that is to send the message that Georgia is closed to the Democratic party.JONES: Georgia hasn't voted for this commission in five years because a lawsuit disrupted the election schedule. Then in June, only 2% of Georgia voters turned out for the party primaries. About twice as many Democrats showed up as Republicans. So now the Republicans are spending time and money, from the governor on down, to get their voters to the polls. Republican state representative Todd Jones says that's key because many counties like Forsyth, which he represents, don't have local elections this year, unlike some of the state's Democratic strongholds.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TODD JONES: The fact is, we have over 100,000 voters who sit not attached to a city, which means they don't have a mayor's race, a city council race - you name it - to get them out. It's our job to get them out.JONES: Ron Ray got the message. This commission is important. It has final say over power bills, which it raised six times in the last three years but froze this year. Democrats want more solar and batteries, saying they're cheaper. Republicans say coal and gas are more reliable.RON RAY: I wasn't aware of how big a deal it was, honestly, until tonight.JONES: He learned about the rally from a Republican email list. He says the PSC wasn't on his radar before, but now he'll go vote.For their part, the Georgia Democrats see a chance for a rare statewide win that could bode well for next year, when they're trying to defend a seat in the U.S. Senate. So state chair Charlie Bailey says they're investing in this race in a way they haven't before.CHARLIE BAILEY: The state party's never spent any money on a PSC race, period.JONES: He says they're running phone banks, sending out thousands of mailers and knocking on doors. This battle over voter turnout is testing the strength of the Republican Party that has run Georgia for the last few decades and gives Democrats a rare shot at statewide victory. But even if the Democrats pull out a win, Georgia State University political scientist Tammy Greer says it might just be a blip.TAMMY GREER: We'll get to the end, and then someone will do a real quick analysis and say it was because of a Democratic wave or whatever that it looks like, rather than, you know, it just so happened because of the way that the calendar fell.JONES: For Democratic Chair Bailey, the fight over these obscure seats is a sign Georgia is still in battleground territory. The state narrowly voted for Biden in 2020 and for President Trump last year by 50.7%.BAILEY: A close election is yet another piece of evidence that this is a battleground. A battleground, by its very definition, can be won and it can be lost.JONES: And both parties have decided they're out to win, this year and next.

    "body": "\n      President Trump's interest in curating his public image is closely linked to how he wields power as president.   \n\n    ADRIAN FLORIDO, HOST:  The East Wing of the White House is gone. President Trump once said that the White House would go untouched during the construction of a massive, privately funded ballroom. The sudden unannounced destruction is the latest example of the president's explicit quest to remake the White House and the presidency in his image.I'm joined now by NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith and senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro to look at how Trump's curated image is part of how he wields power. Hey to you both.TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hello.DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there.FLORIDO: Tam, let's start with you. Images of the demolition at the White House have been pretty jarring for people who see the building as a physical symbol of the U.S. What does the ballroom symbolize for Trump, though?KEITH: Trump often talks about this as the golden age of America - golden because he is back in office. He has an opulent ballroom at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and has long complained that the White House doesn't have a world-class ballroom. He says the ballroom he is building will be one of the most beautiful ballrooms anywhere in the world. He sees this as a necessary element of displaying American greatness to the rest of the world.MONTANARO: You know, and in the end, this very well may turn out to be something beautiful, but it - you know, that's not quite the point. I mean, there have been two big issues. First, there's been no debate, and second, there's very little transparency.And the White House is supposed to be the people's house, and has always been something more humble than exuberant palaces you might see in the Middle East or the very kind of monarchy the American colonies were breaking away from in the first place. All of this really is representative of how Trump has gone about his presidency - unilaterally and with little to no input or consideration from Congress or the public.FLORIDO: I mean, and it's not just the ballroom, right? Trump has made some other physical changes at the White House.KEITH: Yeah, there is so much gold in the Oval Office. It seems like every other day there is some new piece of flare added - always gold. Trump is obsessed with the decor in the White House. Take this from a cabinet meeting earlier this year, where he talked about selecting portraits for the cabinet room.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I love the frame of those pictures. Look at those frames, you know? I'm a frame person. Sometimes I like frames more than I like the pictures.(LAUGHTER)KEITH: And he has a whole bit he delivers about gold leaf.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: And the only question is, do you gold leaf it? - because you can't paint it. If you paint it, it won't look good 'cause they've never found a paint that looks like gold. You see that in the Oval Office.KEITH: Trump is definitely putting his stamp on the White House in a way that is synonymous with the brand he built before he was elected.FLORIDO: You know, you could possibly dismiss all of this as just an interest in aesthetics. But why does it matter beyond the aesthetics of it all?KEITH: This is definitely a metaphor for Trump's approach to his second term in office. He is emboldened and unbound. In the first term, he was at least a little deferential to institutions and the way things have always been done. Like, he didn't make any major changes to the White House then. This time, he is doing what he wants, and that certainly does extend to the aesthetics. In August, Trump even signed an executive order imposing personal style choices on federal buildings, saying they need to be traditional and neoclassical. I spoke with Lynn Vavreck, who specializes in political messaging at USC (ph).LYNN VAVRECK: A real estate developer who puts their name on many, many buildings is legacy-oriented. I think we have some clear signals that that has to be an underlying latent trait.KEITH: She says MAGA - the red hats, the gold, the branding of it all - has been wildly effective. Like, it isn't just a political slogan. It is a social identity, like being a die-hard fan of a football team.FLORIDO: Yeah. And I mean, Domenico, isn't this image curation TV producer Trump? It's sort of just who he always has been.MONTANARO: Yeah, of course. I mean, this is what Trump has always been known for - branding. You know, and that really speaks to who he is and how he's governed. You know, so much of it and his life in business has been about image, the power of positive thinking. You say it's true, and it is.You know, this is someone who took four companies into bankruptcy, and yet, with the help of \"Celebrity Apprentice\" on TV, his name on the sides of all those buildings that he didn't own, you know, he was able to convince a lot of people that he was wildly successful and represented luxury, when that just wasn't his reputation in New York.FLORIDO: And what else is there to it beyond just, you know, projecting power?MONTANARO: Well, in his view, the image becomes the power, you know, whether it's real or not. He's become a lifestyle brand meant to project wealth, power and an old-school masculinity of sorts - the tough guy who people don't mess with and gets the girls. It works for a large segment of the country, but it also has created a polarization because for half the country, his showiness, the braggadocio and lack of humility is a turnoff and something many don't see as what an American president should be.FLORIDO: What have the real-world consequences of all of that been, Tam?KEITH: His image has always been being a winner, and that is why the results of the 2020 election were such a low point for him. He lost, and then to this day, he refuses to acknowledge it. In part, that lack of acknowledgment led to what happened on January 6. Then in 2024, he won, but he still inflates the size of his win and overstates his mandate. He is governing in a way, though, that reflects the self-image he is projecting of dominance, inevitability, invincibility.FLORIDO: On the flip side, though, Tam, Trump - I mean, he really is focused on attacking and diminishing the people who disagree with him. What does he achieve with that?KEITH: Well, just look at this past weekend, where millions of people in thousands of American cities and towns showed up for No Kings protests. That showing contradicted the image that Trump has curated of ultimate power and adulation, so he downplayed the protests. Here he was on Air Force One.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MONTANARO: The demonstrations were very small, very ineffective, and the people were wacked out. When you look at those people, those are not representative of the people of our country.KEITH: Not representative of the people of our country - so essentially, he's saying that those who are against him aren't real Americans.MONTANARO: Yeah. I mean, in truth, Trump's popularity is low, and he's trying to project this image that he's powerful and beloved by all. But just because something looks like gold doesn't make it so.FLORIDO: Domenico Montanaro, Tamara Keith, thanks for swinging by.KEITH: You're welcome.MONTANARO: You got it.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

Yesterday, the Pentagon announced the deployment of the USS Gerald Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, just hours after the tenth U.S. strike on alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific. NPR senior political contributor Ron Elving joins us. Ron, thanks for being with us.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.SIMON: The president said there could also be U.S. land strikes. How serious is the situation now?ELVING: It's as serious as it looks and was meant to look. The world's largest aircraft carrier, with 5,000 sailors, scores of aircraft, eight additional warships. You know, some of these small boat operators may begin to feel a bit outgunned. But you have to wonder if it's really all about the drug runners. Let's accept that the 10 blasted on the high seas so far were carrying drugs and were heading this way, although there have been reports raising questions on both counts. Setting those doubts aside, the sheer size of this naval force suggests something else, something like the, quote, \"gunboat diplomacy,\" unquote, the U.S. has practiced as far back as the early 1900s, pressuring regimes in Central America and the Caribbean.SIMON: President Trump said he's halting trade talks with Canada over an ad in Ontario featuring Ronald Reagan, which, by the way, has subsequently been withdrawn. The president called the ad fake. Was it?ELVING: The voice in the ad is Ronald Reagan's, and the words are from a radio address he gave in April 1987. But the ad is guilty of changing the order of sentences, and that is wrong. The ad also ought to have made clear that Reagan was about to impose a tariff on Japanese semiconductors at the time, despite his own dislike of tariffs and his strong preference for free trade. Now, the Reagan Foundation called this out, published a link to the audio and transcript. And to their credit, the provincial officials in Ontario who paid for this ad in the first place have also published that same link. And everyone who cares ought to check it out. They will find Reagan condemning tariffs in no uncertain terms as a prelude to trade wars and deep economic harm.SIMON: The U.S. government is in its fourth week of a shutdown. More than a million federal workers missed a paycheck yesterday. What could end this - air traffic controllers, Obamacare premiums going up?ELVING: And maybe both. It was the absentee problem among air traffic controllers that ended the last shutdown of the record five-week-long freeze-up in 2019. This time, the Democrats say it's all about health care - premium subsidies for people on Obamacare. Much higher bills are about to hit home for millions of Americans, and they live disproportionately in states that voted for Trump, so there could be some rising tension there. The Republicans in Congress say the Democrats just want to fight. And they say, for their part, there's nothing to negotiate. My guess is that they would be back at the negotiating table on Monday if summoned by the president, but he does not seem to be so inclined.SIMON: Ron, the east wing of the White House was demolished this week to make way for a new ballroom President Trump wants built. Why did the demolition of the east wing seem to strike a chord with so many?ELVING: It's the permanence of the look of it. You know, they knocked down the whole east wing of the White House, carried it off in trucks, with some of it going to a golf course. It's not coming back. And for many people, that is a metaphor for all that's happening in Trump's second term. I have to confess, this is a hard one for people who care about the White House - the tradition, the symbolic value. Just a few days ago, Trump said he was only making some adjustments and modifications to the east wing. Then this week, after demolition had begun, he said architects and engineers needed to take the whole thing down in order to build the ballroom Trump wanted - a ballroom financed not by the people but by Amazon and Apple and Google and Meta, some major government contractors and Wall Street billionaires. The ballroom they build may well be impressive, but what has been lost in this process will not easily be replaced.SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving, thanks so much.ELVING: Thank you, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "\n      In Northern California, congressional districts could be redrawn by a vote on Election Day. Republicans say they're victims of the national redistricting fight, while Democrats blame President Trump.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  In just over a week, voters in California face a question that could determine who controls Congress after the 2026 midterm elections. They're deciding if the state should redistrict, giving Democrats an edge to win five more seats in the narrowly divided U.S. House. Now, this vote comes in response to President Trump encouraging Texas to redraw lines to favor Republicans. CapRadio's Laura Fitzgerald reports from a part of California where Republicans could lose out.LAURA FITZGERALD, BYLINE: Loomis, California, is a suburban town of about 7,000 people outside of Sacramento. It's a red area, represented by a Republican in Congress. But under the redistricting map on the ballot in the November 4 election, voters there would be divided and drawn into districts likely to elect Democrats. Amanda Cortez is a Republican on the town council organizing opposition.AMANDA CORTEZ: We want to keep our communities that are like together, right? And so if we get sucked into Sacramento or, you know, somewhere, we don't share the same needs, right?CORTEZ: This area has lots of single-family homes on either side of a major freeway and faces suburban issues, like traffic getting in and out, rapid development and high gas prices. Mike Murray (ph) also lives in the area, and he's involved in his county's Republican club. He's voting no on the measure, called Prop 50, because he says his future votes for Congress will be swamped by the Democratic votes in nearby Sacramento.MIKE MURRAY: If we wanted to live in an urban community with the problems and the benefits of an urban community, we would. But we choose to live here. And when we choose to live here, we hope that somebody will represent us and our way of life.FITZGERALD: Usually, states redistrict at the start of the decade, when the census comes out, but California Republicans could end up paying the price for the redistricting battle that President Trump has set off around the country now. Murray says, for him, this isn't about national politics or redistricting in other states.MURRAY: My concern has always been on our community and our representation. When things are wrong in other places, doing things wrong here, it's not the way to go. Hey, this is something you teach your kids. Two wrongs don't make it right.FITZGERALD: But Trump did get Texas to write a new map that could flip five more seats to Republican candidates. So California's Democratic leaders say they drew their map to flip five seats for Democrats and counter Texas. Eric Schickler is a co-director at the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California Berkeley. He says opponents to California's redistricting are concerned it'll sideline the state's Independent Redistricting Commission that's helped give their communities a voice.ERIC SCHICKLER: The basic argument made by opponents of Prop 50 is that the nonpartisan process, you know, has worked well for the state. It's given rise to more competitive elections.FITZGERALD: But for proponents, mainly Democrats, it's about Congress and the Trump administration.SCHICKLER: To the extent that voters care about having a check on President Trump - well, you need a Democratic house to do that, is the argument that Democrats are making.FITZGERALD: In the town of Truckee, a blue dot in the same red congressional district as Loomis, Democrats were wrapping up a meeting to organize for Prop 50. Cyan Samone sees redistricting as a chance to counteract Trump's immigration crackdown.(CROSSTALK)CYAN SAMONE: I have a lot of friends who are immigrants from different countries who have left authoritarian regimes. And you see the patterns, and you just don't want to see that happen here. And I don't want to have to see people who fled terrible situations having to run again.FITZGERALD: Her husband, Ben Woodard (ph), says redistricting could mean Democrats are able to elect a representative that'll pay more attention to what his community needs.BEN WOODARD: I think that the Democratic Party representative would do that and would look over our interests, like, you know, the cuts to Medicare definitely impacted rural health care.FITZGERALD: The proponents appear to have the upper hand heading into the November 4 election. It's a state where most voters are Democrats, and they see this election as part of a national struggle.For NPR News, I'm Laura Fitzgerald in Sacramento.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

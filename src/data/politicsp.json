Party leaders, hoping to win back support from some of the working-class supporters who have drifted away from them, have used the moment to remind voters of the recent cuts Republicans have approved to some health care programs.</p>   \n   <p>Republicans are outwardly exuding confidence that the approach will not find traction, reminding the public that Democrats have forced a shutdown. But <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.kff.org/quick-take/more-than-3-in-4-aca-marketplace-enrollees-live-in-states-won-by-president-trump-in-2024/__;!!Iwwt!SCDzOYduWJedwG7jX7Qj5Q2a5wSlrFf3suDuxfJLuzTUSVu4Hd515ofuFeQhnQaZk9CV_53WSDo58w$\" target=\"_blank\">a new KFF analysis</a> shows that 80% of all premium tax credits benefited enrollees in states Trump won.</p>   <h3>Open enrollment for 2026</h3>   <p>The shutdown <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/04/nx-s1-5562517/aca-obamacare-shutdown-trump-naic-health-insurance\" target=\"_blank\">coincides with open enrollment season</a>, as insurers are preparing to send notices revealing next year's premium rates for roughly 24 million people enrolled in ACA coverage. The average enrollee is expected to pay <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/__;!!Iwwt!SCDzOYduWJedwG7jX7Qj5Q2a5wSlrFf3suDuxfJLuzTUSVu4Hd515ofuFeQhnQaZk9CV_50hYhZ6OQ$\" target=\"_blank\">more than double</a> if the tax credits are left to expire. Insurers have also said they'll have to dramatically raise the price of premiums because healthier people will opt out of coverage as it becomes more expensive, leaving a sicker pool of Americans — and less money to cover them.</p>   \n   <p>\"Over the next few days, what you're going to see is over 20 million Americans experience dramatically increased health care premiums, copays and deductibles because of the Republican unwillingness to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the steps of the Capitol on Thursday.</p>   <p>Open enrollment in most states begins on Nov. 1. Some insurers and exchanges have delayed sending notices detailing premium rates for next year because they are waiting to see what unfolds in Washington. For example, Covered California, the state's insurance marketplace, is planning to mail out notices to more than a million enrollees later than usual this year, on Oct. 15.</p>   \n   <p>From her home in Richmond, Va., 31-year-old Natalie Tyer is anxiously awaiting the arrival of her notice. She checks the state's marketplace website daily to see if new rates for her insurance plan have posted.</p>   <p>Tyer has relied on marketplace coverage for over a year now while she works part time for a small, local video production company and pursues a master's degree to become a school counselor. The tax credits help cover $255 of her monthly premium, bringing it down to $53. Since she's generally healthy, if the credits expire and her premiums go up significantly, she might drop coverage altogether.</p>   <p>\"I very well might have to go without health insurance and may have to rely on hope,\" Tyer said.</p>   <p>Democrats' push to center the shutdown on health care affordability, though, runs up against many uncomfortable realities of the federal government's closure, which will leave millions of federal workers without paychecks, hamper some functions of public health agencies, and threaten food assistance payments for low-income mothers, among other effects.</p>   <h3>This isn't the first shutdown over health care</h3>   <p>The ACA, though, has been<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2011/03/24/134766561/happy-birthday-affordable-care-act\" target=\"_blank\"> a political flashpoint since 2010</a>, when Republicans fought against the passage of the landmark health care legislation. A wave of Republican congressional victories soon followed that fight and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/09/20/224422562/house-gop-votes-to-fund-government-kill-obamacare\" target=\"_blank\">spurred a government shutdown in 2013</a>, when the GOP tried to gut the program. Party leaders <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/12/13/570479181/why-do-so-many-people-hate-obamacare-so-much\" target=\"_blank\">again tried to repeal it in 2017</a> to follow through on a Trump campaign promise.</p>   \n   <p>The latest clash — over the billions of dollars in tax credits that Democrats issued during the COVID-19 pandemic to boost enrollment in the ACA — has been simmering for months. Democrats, who wrote the original legislation introducing and then extending them, set the enhanced tax credits to expire at the end of this year. Even some Republicans began warning this summer that letting those tax credits lapse could be detrimental, with Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward issuing a memo that cautioned an extension of the credits could make a difference in next year's midterm election.</p>   <p>Extending the ACA tax credits, which have reduced monthly premiums to as little as $0 or $10 for poorer enrollees and capped the amount middle-income Americans paid to just 8.5% of their income, is also a popular move among many Americans.</p>\n</div>",

It is unclear whether Bisignano's newly created role at the IRS will require Senate confirmation.</p>   <p>The Treasury Department said in a statement that Bisignano will be responsible for overseeing all day-to-day IRS operations while also continuing to serve in his role as commissioner of the Social Security Administration.</p>   \n   <p>Bessent said in a statement that the IRS and SSA \"share many of the same technological and customer service goals. This makes Mr. Bisignano a natural choice for this role.\"</p>   <p>The move to install Bisignano at the IRS adds another layer to the leadership shuffling that has occurred at the agency since the beginning of Trump's term. Bessent was named acting commissioner in August after Trump removed former U.S. Rep Billy Long from the role less than two months after his confirmation, and nominated him as ambassador to Iceland.</p>   \n   <p>The four acting commissioners who preceded Long in the job included one who resigned over a deal between the IRS and the Department of Homeland Security to share immigrants' tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and another whose appointment led to a fight between former Trump adviser Elon Musk and Bessent.</p>   <p>Mike Kaercher, deputy director of the Tax Law Center at the New York University School of Law, points to a possible conflict of interest in Bisignano holding leadership roles at SSA and the IRS. \"Putting the same person in charge of both the IRS and SSA creates a conflict of interest when SSA wants access to legally protected taxpayer data,\" Kaercher said.</p>   \n   <p>With two day jobs, Bisignano joins a number of other Trump administration officials to wear multiple hats, including Bessent, Marco Rubio, Sean Duffy, Jamieson Greer and Russell Vought.</p>   <p>IRS and Social Security advocates expressed concern about the new appointment.</p>   <p>Kathleen Romig, director of Social Security and Disability Policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, pointed to Bisignano being named to a position that appears to avoid congressional approval.</p>   <p>\"If the Trump Admin asked for the Senate's advice & consent, would they really want the same person running the government's biggest program AND overseeing the implementation of the extraordinarily complex new tax law?\" she said on the Bluesky social media app.</p>   <p>And Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for SSA recipients and future retirees, said Bisignano's \"divided attention will create a bottleneck that makes the inevitable problems that arise even harder to correct. Never in Social Security's 90-year history has a commissioner held a second job. Bisiginano's new role will leave a leadership vacuum at the top of the agency, especially since the Republican Senate hasn't even confirmed a deputy commissioner.\"</p>   <p>Bisignano has served as CEO of Fiserv, a payments and financial services tech firm, since 2020. He is a onetime defender of corporate policies to protect LGBTQ+ people from discrimination.</p>\n</div>",

Breyer, who has presided over the state's challenge to the Guard deployment, strongly criticized the Trump administration over the move, calling it illegal and asserting that federal officials did not follow proper protocol for federalizing troops.</p>   <p>The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in California, however, has previously argued that \"a great level of deference\" had to be given to the president's assessment that a situation required military intervention.</p>   \n   <p>In Oregon, after temporarily blocking the federalization of the state's Guard members, U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut ruled that the facts just could not be supported that a military intervention was needed — even if deference was given.</p>   <p>\"As soon as the federalized National Guard deploys to Portland, the state of Oregon will suffer an injury to its sovereignty,\" she wrote Saturday in her <a href=\"https://www.portland.gov/federal/documents/10-4-2025-state-city-v-trump-temporary-restraining-order-granted/download\" target=\"_blank\"><u>order</u></a>.</p>   <p>It's unclear how a federal judge in Illinois will rule regarding the Trump administration's effort to deploy Guard members there. On Monday, U.S. District Judge April Perry <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/06/nx-s1-5563882/illinois-and-chicago-sue-the-trump-administration-over-national-guard-deployment\" target=\"_blank\"><u>declined to immediately block a troop deployment</u></a> and gave the administration until the end of Wednesday to respond to the lawsuit filed by state and city officials.</p>   <p>Vladeck believes it will be up to the courts to check presidential authority on this issue.</p>   <p>And, he said \"sooner or later\" the Supreme Court will have to weigh in on what circumstances support military intervention in American cities.</p>   <p>\"We've been fortunate for 230 years to not have to worry about where the line is between permissible and impermissible uses of those authorities,\" he said. \"That luck has run out, and now we really are at a point where the question is going to be: Do courts have the power to draw a line in the sand? And if so, where is that line?\"<br /></p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div>\n   <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi is testifying before a Senate panel Tuesday amid mounting concerns that the Justice Department under her leadership is being weaponized to go after President Trump's perceived enemies.</p>   <p>Bondi's appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee comes less than two weeks after the department secured an <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/25/nx-s1-5552690/james-comey-indicted\" target=\"_blank\">indictment against former FBI Director James Comey</a> following <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/22/nx-s1-5550132/trump-justice-department-comey-letitia-james-virginia\" target=\"_blank\">public demands from the president</a> to do so.</p>   \n   <p>Comey, who faces one count of making false statements and one count of obstruction of justice stemming from congressional testimony in 2020, is scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday in federal court in Alexandria, Va.</p>   <p>The Comey indictment — and the machinations that led to it — are the latest, and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/22/nx-s1-5550132/trump-justice-department-comey-letitia-james-virginia\" target=\"_blank\">arguably most concerning, example</a> of what many legal observers point to as the politicization and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/06/g-s1-64305/weaponization-doj-trump-bondi-justice-department\" target=\"_blank\">weaponization of the department under Bondi</a>.</p>   <p>Since she took the helm in February, the department has been in almost constant turmoil. Bondi and her top lieutenants have fired prosecutors who worked Capitol riot cases or investigated Trump and pushed out senior officials at the FBI.</p>   <p>The Public Integrity Section, which prosecutes public corruption, has been almost entirely emptied out, while more than 70 percent of the attorneys in the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/19/g-s1-66906/trump-civil-rights-justice-exodus\" target=\"_blank\">Civil Rights Division have departed</a> as well.</p>   \n   <p>At her confirmation hearing, Bondi echoed Trump's assertions that the Justice Department under President Biden was weaponized against Trump and conservatives more broadly.</p>   \n   <p>She vowed that would change under her leadership.</p>   <p>\"The partisanship, the weaponization will be gone,\" she told lawmakers. \"America will have one tier of justice for all.\"</p>   <p>In an appearance on Fox News after Comey was indicted, she told Sean Hannity, \"the weaponization has ended.\"</p>   <p>\"We've made that very clear,\" she said. \"Whether you're a former FBI director, whether you're the head of a former intel community, whether you are a current state or local elected official, whether you're a billionaire funding organizations to try to keep Donald Trump out of office, everything is on the table. We will investigate you and we will end the weaponization. No longer will there be a two-tier system of justice.\"</p>   <p>Traditionally, the Justice Department enjoys a degree of independence from the White House, particularly in investigations and prosecutions to insulate them from partisan politics.</p>   <p>But critics say that firewall has been bulldozed since Trump returned to office and put Bondi and other loyalists in top DOJ jobs. Last month, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/22/nx-s1-5550132/trump-justice-department-comey-letitia-james-virginia\" target=\"_blank\">Trump openly directed Bondi</a> to go after his perceived political adversaries, including New York Attorney General Letitia James, California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff, a Senate Judiciary Committee member, and Comey.</p>   \n   <p>\"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" Trump said in a social media post addressed to Bondi. \"JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\" </p>   \n   <p>Shortly before that post, the president pushed out the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/20/nx-s1-5547837/us-attorney-virginia-resigns-letitia-james-probe\" target=\"_blank\">top federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik Siebert,</a> a career prosecutor Trump tapped for the role earlier this year. Siebert's office was leading investigations into both James and Comey, and Siebert had had expressed concerns about the strength of the evidence in both cases.</p>   <p>Trump then installed <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/21/nx-s1-5549086/trump-nominates-white-house-aide-top-us-prosecutor-probing-letitia-james\" target=\"_blank\">Lindsey Halligan</a>, a former insurance attorney and White House aide with no prosecutorial experience, as U.S. attorney to replace Siebert. She sought and secured an indictment against Comey, overruling career prosecutors who questioned the strength of the case.</p>   <p>After Comey was charged, Bondi posted on social media: \"No one is above the law. Today's indictment reflects this Department of Justice's commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people. We will follow the facts in this case.\"</p>   <p>Since his indictment, several career prosecutors in that U.S. attorney's office have been fired.</p>   <p>A letter signed by nearly 300 former career DOJ employees and released on the eve of Bondi's hearing says the department is failing to uphold the rule of law, keep the country safe and protect civil rights.</p>   <p>\"The administration is taking a sledgehammer to other longstanding work the Department has done to protect communities and the rule of law, too,\" the letter says. \"We call on these leaders to reverse course — to remember the oath we all took to uphold the Constitution — and adhere to the legal guardrails and institutional norms on which our justice system relies.\"</p>   <p>The letter was released by Justice Connection, a group that supports DOJ employees. </p>   <p>DOJ has not responded to NPR's request for comment on the letter.</p>\n</div>",

She oversees research grants aimed at figuring out why some communities are harder hit by kidney disease than others and what can be done about it.</p>   \n   <p>She notes that Black people are four times more likely to progress from the early stages of kidney disease to the end stage, where either dialysis or a transplant is necessary for survival.</p>   <p>She points out that developing interventions to improve health outcomes not only saves lives, it also saves the government money. Anyone who requires dialysis is covered by Medicare at substantial cost to taxpayers, Norton says.</p>   <p>And yet, early this year, the Trump administration canceled hundreds of NIH grants as part of its <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/21/nx-s1-5335599/trump-dei-research-cancer-rural-whites\" target=\"_blank\">purge of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts</a> across the government. Norton was told grants in her portfolio were terminated because they used certain terms the administration had flagged, such as \"structural racism.\"</p>   \n   <p>Grantees sued, and U.S. District Judge William Young, a Reagan appointee, sided with them, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/transcripts/nx-s1-5435776\" target=\"_blank\">finding the terminations unlawful</a>.</p>   <p>\"I've never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable,\" Young said during a June 16 hearing, according to <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.282821/gov.uscourts.mad.282821.143.0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">a court transcript</a>. \"I've sat on this bench now for 40 years, I've never seen government racial discrimination like this.\"</p>   <p>The Trump administration appealed and eventually asked the Supreme Court to step in. Without hearing arguments, a conservative majority on the court <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/08/21/g-s1-84441/supreme-court-nih-grants\" target=\"_blank\">vacated the key part of Judge Young's order</a>, finding the grantees should have brought their case in the Court of Federal Claims.</p>   <h3>Layoffs at NIH targeted communications staff</h3>   <p>Mass layoffs of some 1,300 employees at NIH <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/05/g-s1-58312/hhs-layoffs-rif-cdc-fda-nih\" target=\"_blank\">announced in the spring</a> followed a similar pattern. As part of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/09/nx-s1-5393777/trump-rifs-court-mass-layoff-doge\" target=\"_blank\">a broader ruling</a>, a lower court judge found the layoffs were probably illegal.

Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, in which he called for a military response to protests over George Floyd's murder. In a lengthy <a href=\"https://x.com/jeremymbarr/status/1283058025654366209\" target=\"_blank\">resignation letter</a>, Weiss accused her colleagues of harassment and argued that the <em>Times</em> was too influenced by its left-leaning critics online.</p>   <p>Weiss, along with her sister Suzy Weiss and her spouse Nellie Bowles, started The Free Press as a newsletter (originally titled Common Sense) the following year, <a href=\"https://www.thefp.com/about\" target=\"_blank\">calling it</a> a \"new media company … built on the ideals that once were the bedrock of great American journalism: honesty, doggedness, and fierce independence.\"</p>   <p>The Free Press developed into a full-fledged media company in 2022, expanding its offerings into podcasts and live events. Its investigations and commentaries largely scrutinize political and cultural issues like <a href=\"https://www.thefp.com/p/i-thought-i-was-saving-trans-kids\" target=\"_blank\">gender-affirming health care</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thefp.com/p/david-zweig-covid-lies-school-lockdowns-destroyed-kids-lives\" target=\"_blank\">COVID-19 lockdowns</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thefp.com/p/end-dei-woke-capture\" target=\"_blank\">DEI programs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thefp.com/p/the-witch-trials-of-jk-rowling\" target=\"_blank\">J.K. Rowling's anti-trans views</a>.</p>   <p>It's where then-NPR editor Uri Berliner <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/04/16/1244962042/npr-editor-uri-berliner-suspended-essay\" target=\"_blank\">published his essay</a> arguing the public radio network had lost America's trust (he joined The Free Press as a senior editor mere months later). The publication, like Weiss herself, is also known for its staunchly pro-Israel views, especially in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks and Israel's ensuing war in Gaza.</p>   \n   <p>The Free Press has built a sizable following. It has grown its subscriber base by 86% over the past year to a total of 1.5 million people, <a href=\"https://www.paramount.com/press/paramount-announces-deal-to-acquire-the-free-press\" target=\"_blank\">according to Paramount</a>, and is backed by a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/who-is-bari-weiss-iconoclastic-new-head-cbs-news-2025-10-06/\" target=\"_blank\">slew of big names</a>, including venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, hedge fund tycoon Paul Marshall and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz.</p>   \n   <p>\"As proud as we are of the 1.5 million subscribers who have joined under the banner of The Free Press — and we are astonished at that number — this is a country with 340 million people. We want our work to reach more of them, as quickly as possible,\" Weiss wrote on Monday. \"This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity allows us to do that.\"</p>   <p>The Free Press says it will retain its own brand and operations. And, as <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/06/nx-s1-5561116/bari-weiss-cbs-skydance-free-press\" target=\"_blank\">NPR has reported</a>, Weiss — who has no broadcasting experience — appears unlikely to run the news division at CBS News on a day-to-day basis.</p>   <p>But she will play a key role in shaping the network's editorial direction, at a time when it is looking to expand its appeal among right-leaning viewers. When Skydance Media acquired Paramount, CBS' parent company, in July — a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/24/nx-s1-5477530/paramount-cbs-skydance-sale-fcc-approves\" target=\"_blank\">merger that required Trump administration approval</a> — it promised to embrace a diversity of political and ideological viewpoints.</p>   <p>\"Bari is a proven champion of independent, principled journalism, and I am confident her entrepreneurial drive and editorial vision will invigorate CBS News,\" Skydance Media CEO David Ellison <a href=\"https://www.paramount.com/press/paramount-announces-deal-to-acquire-the-free-press\" target=\"_blank\">said in a statement</a>, calling the move \"part of Paramount's bigger vision to modernize content and the way it connects … to audiences around the world.\"</p>   <p>Here's what else to know about Weiss.</p>   <h3>What is Weiss' background? </h3>   <p>Weiss grew up in a Jewish family in Pittsburgh and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/27/opinion/synagogue-shooting-pittsburgh.html\" target=\"_blank\">had her Bat Mitzvah</a> at the Tree of Life Synagogue — long before the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/10/27/661347236/multiple-casualties-in-shooting-near-pittsburgh-synagogue\" target=\"_blank\">2018 mass shooting</a> that made it the site of the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history.</p>   \n   <p>Weiss attended Columbia University (where, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/04/bari-weiss-the-new-york-times-provocateur?srsltid=AfmBOoq2xEZbNTVw-OigAyMkviTLFK28R1suiaWfH00ZTd6mq_dzb2E8\" target=\"_blank\">she says</a>, she dated future <em>Saturday Night Live</em> star Kate McKinnon). As a sophomore, Weiss was <a href=\"https://www.columbia.edu/cu/current/press2.html\" target=\"_blank\">part of a group of Jewish students</a> who challenged the university to respond to what they perceived as anti-Israel intellectual intimidation in its Mideast studies department.</p>   <p>While a university panel ultimately concluded there was no ongoing problem in the department, the incident gained national prominence and prompted Columbia to revise its process for reviewing complaints against faculty.</p>   \n   <p>It was also a formative experience for Weiss, who became the founding editor of a campus magazine dedicated to politics, culture and Jewish affairs — and went on to write a book called <em>How to Fight Anti-Semitism</em>, which was published in 2019.</p>   <p>After college, Weiss worked as a senior editor at the online Jewish life magazine Tablet before joining the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in 2013 as an op-ed and book review editor. She left in 2017, after President Trump took office. She later <a href=\"https://reason.com/2018/01/28/bari-weiss-it-was-heartbreaking-for-me-t/\" target=\"_blank\">told Reason</a> that she left the job in part because of her employer's resistance to political op-eds that were \"too anti-Trump.\"</p>   \n   <p>\"It was heartbreaking for me to see people who I thought that we sort of shared fundamental values making peace with a candidate who, I mean, just from the most basic perspective ran a campaign on denigrating and demonizing the weakest people in our culture,\" Weiss told the magazine.</p>   <p>The <em>New York Times</em> hired Weiss as a staff editor and writer in the opinion section in 2017, as part of its stated efforts to broaden ideological diversity in its op-ed pages, then led by James Bennet.</p>   <p>\"I've gone in the last year from being the most progressive person at <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, to being the most right-winged person at <em>The New York Times</em>,\" Weiss told the <a href=\"https://jewishchronicle.timesofisrael.com/times-opinion-editor-burgh-native-bari-weiss-talks-news-jews-and-views/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle</em></a> later that year.</p>   \n   <p>Many of Weiss' <em>Times </em>columns garnered controversy — like a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/opinion/cultural-appropriation.html\" target=\"_blank\">2017 defense of cultural appropriation</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/opinion/aziz-ansari-babe-sexual-harassment.html\" target=\"_blank\">2018 defense</a> of comedian Aziz Ansari after he faced <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/01/16/578422491/the-fine-line-between-a-bad-date-and-sexual-assault-two-views-on-aziz-ansari\" target=\"_blank\">#MeToo accusations</a>, a piece questioning whether sexual assault allegations against then-Supreme Court justice nominee <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/msnbc/ny-times-bari-weiss-other-instance-brett-kavanaugh-has-reputation-being-prince-man\" target=\"_blank\">Brett Kavanaugh</a> should be disqualifying and a 2018 attack on liberal intolerance titled \"<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/opinion/were-all-fascists-now.html\" target=\"_blank\">We're All Fascists Now</a>.\"</p>   <p>But the biggest backlash came in June 2020, after the <em>Times</em> ran the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/opinion/tom-cotton-protests-military.html\" target=\"_blank\">op-ed by Cotton</a> — the Republican senator — calling for the military to respond to Black Lives Matter protests with an \"overwhelming show of force.\" Hundreds of <em>Times</em> staffers signed a letter <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/05/870920623/debate-over-racial-justice-coverage-roils-n-y-times-philadelphia-inquirer\" target=\"_blank\">protesting the piece</a>, which an editor's note later said \"fell short of our standards and should not have been published.\" Bennet resigned within days.</p>   <p>Weiss, who defended the op-ed's publication, <a href=\"https://x.com/bariweiss/status/1268628680797978625\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted about the fallout</a> as a \"civil war inside The New York Times between the (mostly young wokes) [and] the (mostly 40+) liberals\" — a characterization that many of her colleagues pushed back on. In July 2020, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/business/media/bari-weiss-resignation-new-york-times.html\" target=\"_blank\">Weiss resigned</a> in a nearly 1,500-word letter to the paper's publisher, citing \"bullying by colleagues\" and an \"illiberal environment.\"</p>   <p>\"The paper of record is, more and more, the record of those living in a distant galaxy, one whose concerns are profoundly removed from the lives of most people,\" she wrote. \"Nowadays, standing up for principle at the paper does not win plaudits. It puts a target on your back.\"</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5918x3717+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2Fff%2F7b2c22824ad2a1216c5d23ac1d6e%2Fgettyimages-1665940862.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5918x3717+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2Fff%2F7b2c22824ad2a1216c5d23ac1d6e%2Fgettyimages-1665940862.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5918x3717+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2Fff%2F7b2c22824ad2a1216c5d23ac1d6e%2Fgettyimages-1665940862.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5918x3717+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2Fff%2F7b2c22824ad2a1216c5d23ac1d6e%2Fgettyimages-1665940862.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5918x3717+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2Fff%2F7b2c22824ad2a1216c5d23ac1d6e%2Fgettyimages-1665940862.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5918x3717+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2Fff%2F7b2c22824ad2a1216c5d23ac1d6e%2Fgettyimages-1665940862.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5918x3717+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2Fff%2F7b2c22824ad2a1216c5d23ac1d6e%2Fgettyimages-1665940862.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5918x3717+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2Fff%2F7b2c22824ad2a1216c5d23ac1d6e%2Fgettyimages-1665940862.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5918x3717+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2Fff%2F7b2c22824ad2a1216c5d23ac1d6e%2Fgettyimages-1665940862.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5918x3717+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2Fff%2F7b2c22824ad2a1216c5d23ac1d6e%2Fgettyimages-1665940862.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5918x3717+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2Fff%2F7b2c22824ad2a1216c5d23ac1d6e%2Fgettyimages-1665940862.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5918x3717+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2Fff%2F7b2c22824ad2a1216c5d23ac1d6e%2Fgettyimages-1665940862.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5918x3717+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2Fff%2F7b2c22824ad2a1216c5d23ac1d6e%2Fgettyimages-1665940862.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5918x3717+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2Fff%2F7b2c22824ad2a1216c5d23ac1d6e%2Fgettyimages-1665940862.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5918x3717+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2Fff%2F7b2c22824ad2a1216c5d23ac1d6e%2Fgettyimages-1665940862.jpg\" alt=\"Bari Weiss walks backstage at a 2023 event.\" />\n        </picture>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p>\n                Bari Weiss walks backstage at a live event in Los Angeles in September 2023.\n                <b>\n                    Francine Orr/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images\n                </b>\n                <b><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>\n            <p><b><b>toggle caption</b></b>\n    </p></div>\n    <p><span>\n        Francine Orr/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images\n    </span>\n</p></div>\n   </div>\n   <h3>How does Weiss identify politically? </h3>   <p>The Free Press frames its coverage as anti-woke and has made its name by criticizing mainstream institutions and experts in industries from media to public health. But it has been relatively measured in its view of the Trump administration, occasionally <a href=\"https://www.thefp.com/p/donald-trumps-revenge\" target=\"_blank\">publishing critical pieces</a> and most recently <a href=\"https://www.thefp.com/p/jawboning-and-jimmy-kimmel-free-speech-censorship\" target=\"_blank\">objecting to its \"coercion\" of ABC</a> to suspend Jimmy Kimmel's show.</p>   <p>Even as Weiss has made a name for herself in part by lambasting progressive culture, her own political views have been somewhat hard to pin down.</p>   \n   <p>Over the years, she has described herself as a \"<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/11/business/media/bari-weiss-free-press.html#:~:text=She%20is%20a%20reformed%20print,the%20lapsed%20or%20wobbly%20Democrat.\" target=\"_blank\">radical centrist</a>\" and a \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjV7EDuL21M\" target=\"_blank\">Jewish, center-left-on-most-things-person</a>.\" In a 2024 <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/bari_weiss_courage_the_most_important_virtue/transcript\" target=\"_blank\">TED Talk</a>, she said she voted for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in one election, and Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden in others.</p>   \n   <p>She went on to characterize her ideological views as pro-choice, pro-Israel and pro-gay marriage, \"so much so that I'm actually in one myself.\" (Weiss married Bowles, a former <em>Times</em> tech reporter, in 2021 — the same year they cofounded The Free Press — and they have two children together.)</p>   <p>But she also acknowledged that she is a frequent target of criticism from fellow liberals.</p>   <p>\"I am, or at least … I used to be, considered a standard-issue liberal,\" Weiss said in the same speech. \"And yet somehow, in our most intellectual and prestigious spaces, many of the ideas I just outlined and others like them, have become provocative or controversial, which is really a polite way of saying unwelcome, beyond the pale, even bigoted or racist.\"</p>   <h3>Why is she returning to legacy media? </h3>   <p>In Weiss' announcement letter, she acknowledges that many people may be wondering: \"Why flee <em>The New York Times</em> only to head back into another legacy institution?\"</p>   <p>She says that while she was \"raised to be a believer in the institutions that built America and that made sense of it,\" she found in 2020 that \"the most important public conversations were happening outside of those places.\"</p>   \n   <p>Things look different five years later, Weiss writes, \"as the gatekeepers of the mainstream have failed one after another\" and new voices — including podcasters and influencers — have come to dominate the media landscape.</p>   <p>Weiss paints a picture of two increasingly powerful extremes — \"an America-loathing far left\" and a \"history-erasing far right\" — and says the majority of \"smart, politically mixed, pragmatic Americans\" who fall somewhere in between are not being well served. She pitches Paramount's embrace of The Free Press as a way to change that.</p>   \n   <p>\"The values that we've hammered out here over the years — journalism based in curiosity and honesty, a culture of healthy disagreement, our shared belief in America's promise — now have the opportunity to go very, very big,\" Weiss writes.</p>   <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/10/06/bari-weiss-free-press-skydance-paramount-cbs-memo\" target=\"_blank\">note to CBS News staffers</a> obtained by Axios on Monday, Weiss laid out the 10 principles that she says have and will continue to guide her journalism.</p>   <p>Those include holding \"both American political parties to equal scrutiny,\" embracing \"a wide spectrum of views and voices so that the audience can contend with the best arguments on all sides of a debate\" and respecting \"our audience enough to tell the truth plainly — wherever it leads.\"</p>\n</div>",

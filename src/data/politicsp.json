The president announced plans for another summit in Budapest in a social media post following a two-hour call where the two leaders discussed the war, trade and the Middle East.   \"At the conclusion of the call, we agreed that there will be a meeting of our High Level Advisors, next week,\" Trump wrote, noting that the meetings will be led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. He said a location will be determined.   \n   \"President Putin and I will then meet in an agreed upon location, Budapest, Hungary, to see if we can bring this 'inglorious' War, between Russia and Ukraine, to an end,\" he added.   \n   Trump boasted that \"great progress\" was made on the call and that he will be discussing it at his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday at the White House.   Trump and Zelensky are expected to discuss the possibility of the U.S. providing Ukraine with long-range missiles.   Trump was widely criticized following his last meeting with Putin over the summer. That summit, in Alaska, did not result in any significant steps toward ending the war. Trump traveled to Alaska calling for a ceasefire before backing down.    Trump also said after the summit that his team would be scheduling a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, which also never took place. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday that Trump still believes a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy is possible.    Asked whether conditions had changed to make a second meeting with Putin more successful, Leavitt said, \"I think the President is always willing to take a chance at a diplomacy.\"\n",

A watercolor rendition of the proposed arch posted online last month by architect Nicolas Leo Charbonneau of Harrison Design, and reposted by the president on his Truth Social account, shows a monument that bears strong aesthetic similarities to Paris' Arc de Triomphe and the Soldiers and Sailors' Memorial Arch in Brooklyn. (Wags have already dubbed the proposed monument from the former real estate developer the \"Arc de Trump.\") The renderings also evoke the neoclassical architectural style favored by George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.   \n   Journalists leaving an Oval Office event Wednesday asked the president who the proposed arch would be built for. He replied: \"Me.\"   On Wednesday evening, at a fundraising dinner in the East Room to benefit his planned $250 million ballroom addition to the White House, the president displayed three differently scaled models of the possible arch – the largest of which would appear to dwarf nearby iconic, existing structures, including the Lincoln Memorial.   \"Whichever one would look good. I happen to think the large one,\" he said.   The proposed arch, which is being discussed as a commemoration of the nation's 250th anniversary next year, would be located in a traffic circle between Arlington National Cemetery and the Lincoln Memorial.   The design of any new federal building or memorial is supposed to be approved by the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, which is currently closed due to the government shutdown.   NPR reached out for comment to the White House, including regarding the CFA's potential involvement and a timeline for construction. The White House referred NPR back to the president's comments at the Oval Office and the fundraising dinner on Wednesday.   Additional reporting by Elizabeth Blair.\n",

The group chat conversations, which NPR has not independently verified, included slurs against gay people and Black people, as well as references to Nazi and white supremacist ideology. Zane Irwin of the Kansas News Service is here to talk about the reactions in his state. Hi, Zane.ZANE IRWIN, BYLINE: Hello.CHANG: So let's just start with the Republican Party leaders in Kansas. What have they said in response to all of this?IRWIN: Well, Kansas GOP leaders were really quick to condemn the comments. They said they don't reflect the beliefs of the Republican Party. As of Tuesday, also the Kansas chapter of the Young Republicans National Federation is inactive. And one of its members has actually been fired from the Kansas attorney general's office over this. I will say another wrinkle in the reaction in Kansas was from Democratic Governor Laura Kelly. She says the state Republican Party kind of set a poor example on this for its young members. For example, the party posted edited photos of her on Facebook in a mustache and a sombrero, with a caption that says she wants to give food assistance to immigrants who lack full legal status. So this report is already stirring up broader conversations in Kansas.CHANG: Clearly. OK, so we are hearing explicit criticism from Kansas Republicans of these group chat messages. But I am wondering, how does that response compare to reaction from Republicans outside of Kansas?IRWIN: You know, for the most part, it's been the same - condemnation. The national Young Republicans group called on those involved to resign. But there's one notable exception. Vice President JD Vance went on \"The Charlie Kirk Show\" to kind of downplay how serious these revelations were. Here's him talking about it.(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE CHARLIE KIRK SHOW\")JD VANCE: The reality is that kids do stupid things, especially young boys. They tell edgy, offensive jokes. Like, that's what kids do. And I really don't want us to grow up in a country where a kid telling a stupid joke - telling a very offensive stupid joke - is cause to ruin their lives.IRWIN: Vance is referring to kids in that clip...CHANG: Yeah.IRWIN: ...But I want to be clear - remember, these are adult men in their mid- to late 20s, and they hold positions of power in state and local government.CHANG: So we're talking about adults. OK, so what do you think all of this says - this whole episode? What do you think it says about what's considered acceptable speech in politics today?IRWIN: You know, there's been a lot of whataboutism (ph) kind of going around in this regard. Republicans have cited this counter example where a Democratic candidate for Virginia attorney general sent texts three years ago that promoted political violence against then-Virginia Republican House Speaker Todd Gilbert and his children. But this kind of rhetoric doesn't come from nowhere. I think some of the ideas in the chat echoed what some national Republican figures have said also. Early in the second Trump administration, for example, when a member of DOGE was found to have made racist remarks, Vance defended him then, too. He said, quote, \"I don't think stupid social media activity should ruin a kid's life.\" And President Trump backed him up on that.CHANG: That is Zane Irwin of the Kansas News Service.

Details from the indictment filed in Maryland's district court charge Bolton with eight counts for the transmission of national defense information and 10 counts of unlawful retention of such information. Each count faces a maximum of 10 years in prison.   In a statement, the Justice Department said Bolton illegally transmitted classified information using a personal email and messaging applications, including U.S. \"intelligence about future attacks, foreign adversaries, and foreign-policy relations.\"   \n   \"There is one tier of justice for all Americans,\" Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. \"Anyone who abuses a position of power and jeopardizes our national security will be held accountable.\"   The charges come about two months after the FBI executed a search warrant at Bolton's suburban Washington home. Court papers said agents recovered documents marked as classified, including references to weapons of mass destruction.   Bolton served in Trump's first term in the White House for just over a year but has since become a sharp critic of the president. He has said he believed Trump would use the Department of Justice to enact a \"retribution presidency.\"   The investigation against Bolton dates back to before Trump's return to office. Bolton's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said the charges in the case were \"resolved years ago.\" He said the charges stem from documents tied to Bolton's personal diaries, and never included classified information.   \"Like many public officials throughout history, Amb. Bolton kept diaries — that is not a crime. We look forward to proving once again that Amb. Bolton did not unlawfully share or store any information,\" Lowell said in a statement.   \n   Bolton was one of the former administration officials whose security clearances Trump stripped when he returned to office. Trump also revoked Bolton's security detail, which was in place because of threats from Iran.   Bolton published The Room Where It Happened in 2020, a memoir about his time in the White House that was critical of Trump's approach to foreign policy and the presidency in general.   The Trump administration sued to try to block the book's publication, alleging that Bolton hadn't gone through the proper clearance process and that his manuscript contained classified information. A judge declined that request, but said Bolton's conduct raised national security concerns. The Biden administration dismissed the lawsuit, and prosecutors dropped a grand jury investigation the following year.   \n   The charges against Bolton follow two other recent indictments, including against former FBI Director James Comey, another Trump critic, on one count of making false statements and one count of obstruction of justice in connection with his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee nearly five years ago.   And a grand jury indicted New York Attorney General Letitia James last week on one count of bank fraud and one count of making a false statement to a financial institution. James, a Democrat, pledged to investigate Trump and won a case against him and his company for inflating the value of some of its properties.   \n   Trump had publicly called on the Justice Department to prosecute James and Comey in a social media post last month; Bolton wasn't included in that post.   The indictments came after the top federal prosecutor in Northern Virginia cast doubt on the evidence against both Comey and James, only to be forced out by the president and replaced with one of Trump's former defense attorneys.\n",

Johnson says the government shutdown is to blame, but he's facing accusations from both sides of the aisle that he's trying to avoid a vote to release the Jeffrey Epstein files. NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales has more.CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Arizona Congresswoman-elect Adelita Grijalva has keys to her office but not much else.ADELITA GRIJALVA: I have no staff. The phones don't work. There's no computer. We don't have a government email.GRISALES: Grijalva won her seat to represent the Tucson, Arizona, border district on September 23 but is still waiting to take the oath of office. Once she's seated, she plans to sign onto a bipartisan petition to release government files on the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Her signature is the last one needed to force a House vote.GRIJALVA: I remember on election night, someone came up to me and said, I don't think they're going to swear you in because of those Epstein files. And I thought, oh, my gosh, that's very much a conspiracy theory. Like, that's not going to happen. And here we are 22 days later.GRISALES: House Speaker Mike Johnson calls claims by Grijalva and others a partisan manufactured effort. He says Republicans are already working on releasing records through the GOP-led Oversight Committee.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE JOHNSON: The bulldogs in Congress are on that committee. And they're all joined together in a bipartisan fashion, digging through and releasing documents.GRISALES: Johnson says he will not swear in Grijalva until the government shutdown is over.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHNSON: This is the process of the House. You do it as soon as you're able to do it.GRISALES: But many in Arizona and beyond disagree, and the state's attorney general threatened legal action for the delays. Democrats have also taken to the House floor and Johnson's office, ramping up their demands this week.(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Swear her in, swear her in.GRISALES: Grijalva is the daughter of her predecessor. The late Raul Grijalva held the seat for more than 20 years until his death in March. She tears up when she considers what her dad would make of the fight over her swearing in.GRIJALVA: I think he would just be kind of laughing (laughter) and scratching his head at, like, my kid is doing, you know, making a splash. Yeah.GRISALES: Grijalva says her dad set a high bar in office with his constituents, one she hopes to follow when she's finally seated.Claudia Grisales, NPR News, the Capitol.(SOUNDBITE OF FAZER'S \"WHITE SEDAN\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Steve Inskeep speaks with Sen. Chris Coons, D- Del., about the ongoing government shutdown and what he's hearing from federal workers in his state.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  We've been reaching out to members of both parties about what it will take to get a funding bill passed. And this morning, we speak with Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee. Senator, welcome back.CHRIS COONS: Thanks, Steve. Great to be on with you.INSKEEP: What are you hearing from federal workers in your state now that we're this far in?COONS: I'm hearing alarm that they're not getting paid, and they don't know when or if they'll be laid off in a politically motivated reduction in force. As Andrea just reported, a federal judge in California has already ruled in a temporary injunction that these politically motivated layoffs led by President Trump and his OMB director should not go forward because they're illegal. You can't use politics to decide who ought to be fired from the federal workforce.INSKEEP: Now, Senator, early in the shutdown, we got a sense that at least some, maybe many federal workers were fatalistic about this. They felt the government was being overrun anyway, that many of them were getting fired anyway, and so the shutdown might as well come. That was one of the opinions that we heard reflected. I'm sure there are many opinions among federal workers. But now that we're more than two weeks in and people are missing paychecks, do you think federal workers still feel that way?COONS: Well, we're in Week 3 of this Republican shutdown because Trump and Thune and Johnson won't come to the table and stop health care costs from skyrocketing next month for millions of Americans. Most of the federal workers I've talked to have said, look, folks have been laid off, off and on this year, back to DOGE in the beginning of the year...INSKEEP: Sure.COONS: ...When Trump handed Elon Musk the keys to randomly lay off people and shut down sections of the government. They feel like we should make a stand and insist on a negotiation with Republicans to avoid...INSKEEP: And you think they still think that...COONS: ...Huge increases in health care costs.INSKEEP: And you think they still feel that way now that they're missing paychecks?COONS: Well, the other thing that's going on here is that President Trump is not following the law in terms of making it clear everyone will get paid when we reopen. That's according to a law that Trump himself signed in his first term. I'll remind you, the last shutdown was the last time Trump was president. There is a path forward here and it has to do with working together to get an extension to the Affordable Care Act that would allow it to keep being affordable for millions of Americans.INSKEEP: Well, I'm glad you're talking about an extension because yesterday we had a Republican on the program, Mike Lawler of New York. And he said something about a one-year extension that he wishes more lawmakers would sign on to. Let's listen to some of that.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)MIKE LAWLER: If you want to solve an issue like the Obamacare subsidies that Democrats put in place for four years and were slated to expire at the end of this year - they knew that they were slated to expire. They passed the bill. And so I have already signed onto legislation to extend the subsidies by a year. And that was part of my point to Hakeem Jeffries. If you're serious about this, if this is the issue you claim it is, then why won't you sign onto this bill with me?INSKEEP: OK, one-year extension. Is there room to make some progress there?COONS: Yes, a one-year extension would avoid significant pain next month for millions of Americans, but it won't do that much. The best path forward would be to reform and extend these tax credits for multiple years because the insurance markets, Steve, don't just work on one year. If the insurance companies that provide Affordable Care Act support for millions of Americans only know they've got a temporary reprieve, they're still going to price in that uncertainty.INSKEEP: Senator...COONS: Here's the bigger point.INSKEEP: Go on.COONS: President Trump ran on lowering costs and making America healthy again. He's not engaging in this. And we need to work together to make Americans healthier and reduce their costs. Right now, Trump is spending more time trying to bail out Argentina than he is trying to reduce health care costs for Americans.INSKEEP: He is talking of bailing out Argentina. I want to ask one follow-up, though, about these tax credits. Republicans have made an interesting point. They've said the tax credits are necessary for people to be able to afford health insurance because health insurance costs keep going up and up because, they say, Obamacare is a failure. It failed to hold down costs, which is one of the goals. In about 30 seconds, is that a failure?COONS: I don't think it is a failure. I do think there's bipartisan things we could do to reduce health care costs, for example, PBR reform. But we need to work together, and we can't do that only after Democrats agree to keep moving forward. Republicans are raising health care costs, and we need them to come to the table with a concrete path forward for avoiding that.INSKEEP: And just to be clear, as a yes or no answer, are there any negotiations going on right now that you know of?COONS: There's conversations but not with the leadership, not with President Trump or Leader Thune or Speaker Johnson.INSKEEP: Got it. Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, thanks very much, as always.COONS: Thank you, Steve.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      The rising cost of housing has driven some New York City residents to leave the Big Apple. For those who remain, affordable housing has become a top issue in the race for mayor.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  New York City has always been expensive, and affordability has become the dominant issue in the city's mayoral race. Rents and home prices are now so high, more low and middle-income residents are leaving the city. David Brand from member station WNYC reports.DAVID BRAND, BYLINE: Juleah Jorge (ph) has spent her whole life in the northern reaches of the Bronx.(SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS CRUNCHING)JULEAH JORGE: Hi.BRAND: Hey, how are you?JORGE: I'm OK. How are you?BRAND: I'm good, thanks.A few years ago, she and her 7-year-old daughter moved into a new apartment on a tree-lined block near where she grew up. She loves it.JORGE: We came out of the house yesterday morning to go to school and it was raining leaves. It was like something out of a movie. It was so pretty.BRAND: But Jorge worries she won't be able to stay. She uses a federal housing voucher to help cover rent, but the program is about to expire. She says she can't afford another place.JORGE: It's very, very expensive. Like, one bedrooms are, like, $3,000 now.BRAND: She says her friends and family are already leaving the city.JORGE: I know people who are going to North Carolina. I know people who are going to Connecticut. I know people who are going to Jersey.BRAND: Most New Yorkers can relate. Rents are reaching absurd heights. In Manhattan, median rent for a two-bedroom is now $5,600 a month, according to listing site StreetEasy. Nathan Gusdorf is executive director of the Fiscal Policy Institute and says it's hurting the city's future.NATHAN GUSDORF: Increasing the affordability is really essential to the long-term population growth and economic growth of the city as a whole.BRAND: Four years ago, a spike in crime and public safety concerns defined the mayor's race and helped carry former cop Eric Adams to victory. But Adams dropped his reelection campaign last month. This time around, it's all about affordability.(SOUNDBITE OF PROTESTERS)UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: Freeze the rent. Freeze the rent. Freeze the rent.BRAND: Zohran Mamdani rallied in the Bronx to tout his affordability plans earlier this month. Mamdani was a little-known state assembly member when he announced his candidacy last year, but he rocketed to victory in the Democratic primary by pledging to freeze rents for tenants in a million regulated apartments. He says rising costs are driving people away.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ZOHRAN MAMDANI: It's the number one reason that New Yorkers are becoming residents of Jersey City, of Pennsylvania, of Connecticut, 'cause they cannot afford this city.BRAND: Mamdani is also pledging to make child care free for families and he wants the government to fund or finance 200,000 new apartments priced for low and middle-income renters. Some of his policy plans require state approval and won't come cheap for taxpayers, but he says they're worth it.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MAMDANI: There is an anxiety that many live with, not knowing if the struggle that they're in that - right now is going to get even worse.BRAND: Winning the Democratic nomination usually guarantees victory in the general election in deep blue New York City. But this year is different. Former Democratic governor Andrew Cuomo is running as a centrist independent with a focus on streamlining new construction by coordinating with developers, labor unions and city agencies. He wants to build new homes much faster.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ANDREW CUOMO: Affordable housing is a crisis because it will stop the young people from coming.BRAND: Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa says the solution is lifting costly regulations for landlords and lowering property taxes.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CURTIS SLIWA: I'm the only candidate who says, we've got to across the board cut the taxes or the flight will continue.BRAND: Last year, the city changed zoning rules to allow for more new housing. But those early efforts will take years to put a dent in the affordability crisis. Back at her Bronx apartment, Juleah Jorge says her true goal is to buy her own multi-family home so she can lease an apartment to a low-income family.JORGE: I want to be the change that I want to see. So I'm hoping that one day I get to that point where I can do that.BRAND: She hopes the next mayor's policies help make that dream a reality.

The call came just one day before Trump is to host Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House. And many Ukraine watchers were hoping that this would be a time when Trump would turn up the heat on Russia. NPR's Michele Kelemen reports.MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: It was less than eight months ago when President Trump berated the Ukrainian president in front of cameras at the White House.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Your country is...PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY: Can I...TRUMP: ...In big...ZELENSKYY: Can I...TRUMP: ...Trouble.ZELENSKYY: Can...TRUMP: Wait a minute.ZELENSKYY: ...I answer?TRUMP: No, no. You've done a lot of talking. Your country is in big trouble.ZELENSKYY: I know.TRUMP: You're not winning.ZELENSKYY: I know.TRUMP: You're not winning this.KELEMEN: Retired diplomat Daniel Fried calls it a low point.DANIEL FRIED: But it also reflected what was a major stream of opinion within the administration. The U.S. has no strategic interests in Ukraine whatsoever, that it is a waste of resources. And there are people in the administration who maintain this position.KELEMEN: But Trump himself is evolving, says Fried, a former assistant secretary of state for Europe, now with the Atlantic Council, a think tank that promotes relations with Europe. The U.S. has gotten NATO to buy U.S. weapons for Ukraine. The Trump administration has resumed intelligence sharing, and Fried says Ukraine has been successful in striking energy infrastructure in Russia.FRIED: President Trump was impressed by Ukrainian successes in deep strikes on Russia and realized that if he's going to back Putin, he's not backing a winner. He's backing somebody who's a potential loser and deceitful.KELEMEN: Trump has repeatedly said he's been disappointed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. He's called Russia a paper tiger. And earlier this week, before his phone call with Putin, Trump said Russia is not only taking big losses on the battlefield, but its economy is suffering too.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: And I'd like to see him do well. I mean, I had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin. But he just doesn't want to end that war, and I think it's making him look very bad. He could end it. He could end it quickly.KELEMEN: Ukraine supporters in the Washington foreign policy establishment say it's time for Trump to impose more sanctions on Russia and give Ukraine the weapons and air defenses it needs. Retired naval officer Mark Montgomery is with the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies (ph). He says President Trump has given Putin the chance to negotiate an end to the war.MARK MONTGOMERY: Sometimes pushing hard for peace means understanding who is the victim and who's the aggressor. Putin is the aggressor. Russia is the aggressor. Russia will not stop unless someone bigger and tougher than them punches them in the nose. That country - for better or worse - that country is the United States.KELEMEN: And President Trump, he says, is in a position to change the course of this conflict. Daniel Fried says Ukraine could offer the U.S. something, too, not just rare earth minerals, as they've been discussing, but also drone technology.FRIED: American capital and Ukrainian know-how combined would help arm the Americans for the new wars of the 21st century, including with China. And that's something Zelenskyy can say. That is a material interest, and cooperation would benefit both sides.KELEMEN: It's a pitch that Zelenskyy made the last time he was in the U.S. at the United Nations General Assembly. At that time, Trump posted on social media that he now thinks Ukraine could take back all of its territory with help from Europe. That was a big change from February when he told Zelenskyy in that fraught Oval Office meeting that the Ukrainians didn't hold any cards.

In the last few weeks alone, prosecutors secured indictments against former FBI Director Jim Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. The White House has signaled more cases may be on the way.   \n   For those defendants, the costs of fighting criminal charges in a high-profile case are enormous, and they can reverberate for years, according to veteran attorneys who represent people in the headlines.   Lisa Wayne has tried 150 cases before juries in the course of her decades-long career. Wayne, now executive director of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said there's \"no golden rule\" when it comes to how expensive the legal bills might be.   The cost depends on what charges a person faces, where they live, how experienced their lawyer is and whether that person needs to hire experts in advance of trial, she said.   \n   \"Most people have to figure out, out of pocket,\" Wayne said. \"And figure out, do they have the savings? Do they have friends and family that can help them? Do they take mortgages on their homes? It can be a very stressful situation for most individuals.\"   Three other longtime criminal lawyers put the estimate at between $1 million and $5 million at a small law firm, to $25 million or more at a large one.   Trump himself spoke about some $100 million in legal fees that he faced after his first term in office, for indictments in two federal cases and state charges in New York and Georgia.   \n   Help from former trial partner or a defense fund   Comey, a former deputy U.S. attorney general and longtime federal prosecutor, turned to his former trial partner for help. Patrick Fitzgerald, who famously led the U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago and went on to a lucrative partnership at the Skadden law firm, came out of retirement to help defend Comey.   In private practice, Fitzgerald likely commanded more than $2,000 an hour for his legal work. Now, he's able to set his own rates and may be working not quite for free, but nowhere near full price.   \n   Then there's Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California. Schiff is a longtime critic who helped investigate Trump during the president's first term in office. Now, Schiff is under investigation for alleged mortgage fraud.   \n   Trump took note in recent remarks from the Oval Office. \"Looks like Adam Schiff really did a bad thing. They have him. Now let's see what happens.\"   The key issue is that Schiff owns homes in both California and Maryland, closer to the U.S. Congress. Schiff's allies have said he accurately filled out mortgage paperwork and consulted with lawyers during that process.   His attorney, Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney in Manhattan, called the allegations of wrongdoing \"transparently false, stale and long debunked.\"   Even so, Schiff created a legal defense fund in August to help cover the legal bills.   The White House said the Justice Department is on the right track with its prosecutions. \"The Trump administration will continue to deliver the truth to the American people while restoring integrity and accountability to our justice system,\" said spokeswoman Abigail Jackson.   \"They should be people that are shamed\"   A driving force behind all these investigations is Ed Martin, a lawyer from Missouri with more experience in politics than in the courtroom. Martin could not win Senate confirmation to serve as U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., after lawmakers expressed concern about his support for people who rioted at the U.S. Capitol nearly five years ago.   \n   Instead, Martin moved to lead a Weaponization Working Group focused on people who have run afoul of Trump.   \"There are some really bad actors, some people that did some really bad things to the American people,\" Martin told reporters as he started his new post. \"And if they can be charged, we'll charge them. But if they can't be charged, we will name them. And in a culture that respects shame, they should be people that are shamed.\"   That's not the way Justice Department policy has worked in the past. Prosecutors are not supposed to speak ill of people they lack enough evidence to charge with crimes — or about those who haven't been charged yet.   \n   \"I can't imagine anything more stressful than being accused by the government and carrying the weight of that as an individual in this country,\" said Wayne, of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.   Where to go \"to get my reputation back?\"   Even if a defendant wins an acquittal, they've been through the wringer, facing emotional pressure on themselves and their entire family.   Consider D.C. lawyer Michael Sussmann. He was investigated by a special counsel in connection with his work for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. A jury in D.C. found him not guilty of making a false statement to the FBI after a two-week trial in 2022.   \n   Outside the courthouse following his victory, Sussman sounded exhausted.   \"Despite being falsely accused, I'm relieved that justice ultimately prevailed in my case,\" he said. \"As you can imagine, this has been a difficult year for my family and me.\"   Back in the 1980s, the former labor secretary under President Ronald Reagan faced fraud charges — only to be found not guilty by a jury.   Raymond Donovan responded: \"Which office do I go to to get my reputation back?\"\n",

Scott Applewhite/AP\n    \n\n   \n   More than three weeks after winning her congressional race, Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva never imagined her fight to get sworn into office would take this long.    The Arizona Democrat has keys to her office, but not much else.     \"I have no staff ... The phones don't work. There's no computer,\" Grijalva says from her sparsely furnished office on Capitol Hill. \"We don't have a government email.\"   That bumpy start to Grijalva's new political career in Washington is courtesy of the same intense, partisan tensions that have come to dominate the 119th Congress.    House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., says he won't swear in Grijalva until the government shutdown is over.    \n   \"This is the process of the House, we'll do it as soon as we get back to business,\" he said.    It's a departure for Johnson, who has previously sworn in new members from both parties within days of winning their races.    The Speaker had previously said he would swear in the winner of the Arizona race as soon as they wanted. He later said the winner should enjoy the \"pomp and circumstance\" that's part of the ceremony, but only available when the government is open.    As a result, Johnson is facing accusations from both sides of the aisle that he's trying to avoid a vote to compel the release of files from the Justice Department's investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.    Grijalva won her seat on Sept. 23rd in a special election to represent the state's 7th congressional district — a border district that includes parts of Tucson.    On the campaign trail, Grijalva promised to sign onto a bipartisan petition to force a vote in the House to release the Epstein files. Hers would mark the decisive 218th signature to trigger that vote — an effort that's been led by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif.    \"I remember on election night, someone came up to me and said, 'I don't think they're going to swear you in because of those Epstein files,'\" Grijalva says. \"And I thought, 'oh my gosh, that's very much a conspiracy theory. Like that's not going to happen.' And here we are.\"   \n   Johnson has called claims that he's trying to delay  Grijalva's swearing in a \"partisan manufactured thing.\"   He says Republicans are already working on releasing records as part of an investigation being led by the GOP-led House Oversight Committee.   \"The bulldogs in Congress are on that committee, and they're all joined together in a bipartisan fashion digging through and releasing documents,\" Johnson told reporters earlier this week.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., arrives to talk to reporters about the government shutdown on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.\n                \n                    J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Johnson's explanations have infuriated Grijalva's supporters. Democrats have taken to the House floor to call for her to be seated. On Tuesday, a group of lawmakers marched to Johnson's office chanting, \"Swear her in.\"    The delay has also angered those hoping for a vote on the Epstein files. Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., has accused Johnson of \"protecting pedophiles,\" and during a tense exchange outside of the Speaker's office last week, said Johnson was delaying the swearing in because he does not want Grijalva to sign the discharge petition. Johnson called the allegation \"totally absurd,\" saying Democrats are \"experts at red herrings.\"     The standoff could be inching its way toward the courts. On Tuesday, after the state certified Grijalva's election results, Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes threatened legal action to try to force the oath of office.    Grijalva is the daughter of her predecessor — the late Rep. Raúl Grijalva, who held the seat for more than 20 years until his death from lung cancer in March.    Grijalva says her dad set a high bar in office with his constituents, one she hopes to follow once she's finally seated.    She tears up when she considers what he would make of her fight to get seated.   \"I think he would just be kinda laughing,\" she said, \"scratching his head at like, my kid is, you know, making a splash.\"   Colorado Public Radio's Caitlyn Kim contributed to this report \n",

PAUL, Minn. — Sen. Amy Klobuchar announced her run for Minnesota governor early Thursday with a video posted on X, following Gov. Tim Walz's recent announcement that he was ending his bid for a third term in the role.   \"Minnesotans, we've been through a lot,\" Klobuchar said in the video, going on to recount several tragedies the state has faced in recent months, including the separate shootings of two American citizens by ICE agents.   \"We cannot sugarcoat how hard this is,\" she said. \"But in these moments of enormous difficulty, we find strength in our Minnesota values of hard work, freedom and simple decency and goodwill.\"    \n   \"I believe we will stand up for what's right and fix what's wrong,\" Klobuchar added before making it official. \"That's why, today, I'm announcing my candidacy for governor of Minnesota.\"   \n            Minnesotans, we’ve been through a lot.And I believe this moment calls for grit, resilience, and faith in each other. I believe we must stand up for what’s right. And fix what’s wrong. Today, I’m announcing my candidacy for Governor. pic.twitter.com/yVnbvmMyxO— Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) January 29, 2026\n   \n   Klobuchar, who won a fourth Senate term in 2024, has racked up double-digit wins in each of her races. In 2020, she ran an unsuccessful presidential campaign among a crowded field of Democratic candidates.   When Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz announced that he would drop his bid for reelection, the idea of Klobuchar entering the race began to emerge.   \"I like my job very much,\" Klobuchar told Minnesota Public Radio on Wednesday, ahead of Thursday's announcement. \"And Minnesota has given me this honor of serving them in the Senate. But I love my state more.\"   Walz faced criticism from state Republicans to President Trump for allegations of rampant social-services fraud on his watch. There is no evidence that Walz took part in the fraud or committed any other crimes, but his political opponents say that he failed to stop the wholesale theft of taxpayer funds during his time in office.   As a sitting governor, Walz was not facing any competition from other Democratic hopefuls. Yet more than a dozen Republicans are in the governor's race, including House Speaker Lisa Demuth, the state's top Republican, businessman Kendall Qualls, state Rep. Kristin Robbins and My Pillow founder and CEO Mike Lindell.   \n   Klobuchar's entrance could upend that GOP field as well, as some of the candidates reassess their chances of defeating a durable statewide official instead of the politically wounded Walz.   Last week, when Klobuchar filed initial paperwork to run for governor, the Minnesota Republican Party called on her to resign from the Senate while she campaigns for another office.   \"Minnesota needs a governor who is all in — not a Washington insider running a gutless political audition,\" Minnesota Republican Party Chair Alex Plechash said in a statement. \"If Klobuchar can't even choose which job she wants, Minnesotans can be confident she won't have the backbone to fix the problems Democrats created.\"   Former Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty is among those who have said Republicans' chances at winning the governor's seat for the first time in 20 years would weaken if Klobuchar joined the race.   \"That's going to fundamentally change the governor's race in Minnesota,\" Pawlenty told MPR News. \"She would be a very, very formidable candidate in that race and so it changes everything.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      The presence of ICE in Minnesota, including the shooting deaths of two U.S. citizens, is rewriting how Democrats and Republicans are messaging ahead of the 2026 midterms.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Ailsa Chang in Culver City, California.JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  And I'm Juana Summers in St. Paul, Minnesota, one of the twin cities at the center of the national political fight over immigration enforcement.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)AMY KLOBUCHAR: Three thousand ICE agents on our streets and in our towns, sent by an administration that relishes division. We cannot sugarcoat how hard this is.SUMMERS: That is U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar in a video she released earlier today, announcing her run for governor of Minnesota. The federal immigration enforcement push here has scrambled political messaging. President Trump has been trying to address concerns over the economy in the lead-up to midterm elections, but Democrats like Klobuchar are pointing to what's happening in Minneapolis. We are here at Minnesota Public Radio, where I'm joined by ALL THINGS CONSIDERED host Clay Masters. Hi.CLAY MASTERS, BYLINE: Hi, Juana.SUMMERS: Let's start, if we can, with Senator Klobuchar. Her name immediately popped up as a potential candidate when the state's governor, Tim Walz, announced that he would suspend his campaign for a third term. And that was, of course, before two U.S. citizens were killed by federal agents in Minneapolis. What does the ICE presence here do for Klobuchar's campaign, if anything?CLAY MASTERS: I mean, still a lot of months until November, and voters have a short attention span, right? I mean, the killings of Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti have brought a lot of awareness to the way the president's immigration policies are being enforced. That seems to be helping Democrats, which could include Klobuchar. Locally here, a Republican running for governor, Chris Madel, ended his governor run, calling what's happening in the Twin Cities and across the state an unmitigated disaster. That's a Republican.Democrats here really haven't had a lot of power to do anything about ICE's presence in the state other than, you know, condemn it publicly. I've asked Senator Klobuchar what her party can do, and she largely talks about having a check on the president. You know, having a chamber in Congress with a Democratic majority would do that, but again, quite a ways off until voters are making that decision.SUMMERS: Now, the Trump administration has been signaling that it is trying to make some changes on the ground here by bringing in Tom Homan. He's the border czar. But does that actually change anything?CLAY MASTERS: I mean, not yet. Homan got here this week after President Trump and Governor Walz had a phone call. Homan replaced Gregory Bovino with Border Patrol, who had been the face of the federal surge. Homan held a press conference this morning in Minneapolis, talking about how he says Minnesota officials need to cooperate if ICE is ever going to leave here.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TOM HOMAN: Matter of fact, I have staff from CBP and from ICE working on a drawdown plan. What does that look like based on the cooperation? What does that look like based on how many targets we have left to find?CLAY MASTERS: But, Juana, I should say there is no real evidence on the streets of de-escalation. Just yesterday, I spoke to Democratic state Senator Doron Clark from Minneapolis about ICE's ongoing presence. That includes ICE agents attempting to enter the Ecuadorian consulate, allegedly without a warrant.SUMMERS: Right.CLAY MASTERS: The mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, who has regularly been tangling with President Trump, responded to Homan's press conference today. Frey says any drawdown of ICE agents is a step in the right direction, but his ask remains the same - Operation Metro Surge must end - and that's a reference to the ramped-up presence ICE has had in Minnesota, which goes back to early December. We should also bring up Maine.SUMMERS: Yeah.CLAY MASTERS: There has also been an increased ICE enforcement presence in that state. Republican U.S. Senator Susan Collins says DHS has told her enhanced operations there have ended.SUMMERS: And last thing, Clay, I do want to bring it back to the midterms again for a moment. Can Republicans really make it about anything but ICE right now?CLAY MASTERS: I mean, President Trump certainly is trying to change the subject. He was in Iowa earlier this week, holding a rally in suburban Des Moines. That state has gone for him in the last three presidential elections, but there are a couple of competitive congressional House seats there this year. He spent the majority of his speech talking about the economy. Republicans want to keep control of Congress, and political arguments over ICE's presence here in Minnesota and the death of two U.S. citizens at the hands of federal agents is not helping them.SUMMERS: Thank you, Clay.CLAY MASTERS: Thank you.SUMMERS: That's Minnesota Public Radio's Clay Masters.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

Under the plan, the Senate will vote on five appropriations bills before the weekend, according to sources familiar with the agreement who were not authorized to discuss details publicly. They will not vote on the sixth bill — which funds the Department of Homeland Security — as it is currently written. Instead, they'll vote on a separate two-week continuing resolution for DHS.   This will allow various federal agencies to be funded, pending House approval, while carving out time for negotiators to make changes to the DHS appropriations bill.    \n   President Trump endorsed the deal on social media, writing he was working with Congress \"to ensure that we are able to fully fund the Government, without delay.\"   \"Republicans and Democrats in Congress have come together to get the vast majority of the Government funded until September, while at the same time providing an extension to the Department of Homeland Security (including the very important Coast Guard, which we are expanding and rebuilding like never before). Hopefully, both Republicans and Democrats will give a very much needed Bipartisan \"YES\" Vote,\" Trump wrote.    After Senate passage, the House will need to pass these bills in order to avoid a lapse in government funding. Because the House is currently on recess until Monday, a short-term shutdown appears all but inevitable.   If the House acts quickly upon returning, the effects of a shutdown could be extremely limited, as most federal offices are closed on the weekend.   Democrats want to see major changes to DHS   In the aftermath of the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis by federal agents on Saturday, Democrats have demanded significant reforms at the Department of Homeland Security and the ongoing immigration enforcement actions led by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).   \n   Democrats are calling for broad changes to the way DHS agents are carrying out their work. This includes barring them from wearing masks, requiring body cameras, setting rules around warrants and creating a uniform code of conduct and use-of-force rules.   \"Until ICE is properly reined in and overhauled legislatively, the DHS funding bill doesn't have the votes to pass,\" Schumer said Wednesday.   The Senate failed to advance the complete six-bill funding package Thursday, as eight Republicans joined with Democrats to prevent the plan from clearing a procedural vote. The final tally was 45 to 55.\n",

The fight over spending could cause a partial government shutdown at the end of the week.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Senate Democrats say they're going to block a government funding package that includes money for the Department of Homeland Security until there are reforms to how immigration agents are working in this country.LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer spoke with reporters in the Capitol yesterday.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHUCK SCHUMER: Senate Democrats are united on a set of common sense and necessary policy goals that we need to rein in ICE and end the violence.INSKEEP: Either lawmakers make some agreement or there will be another partial government shutdown at the end of the day on Friday. In a few moments, we'll speak with Democratic Senator Adam Schiff. We begin with the facts.FADEL: NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales has been following this and joins us now. Good morning, Claudia.CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila.FADEL: OK, so this same package passed with significant bipartisan support last week in the House. But then we saw the killing of Alex Pretti over the weekend in Minneapolis by federal agents. So how did that change what we expect to happen in the Senate?GRISALES: Well, in some ways, it changed everything. The Senate is supposed to vote today to advance this $1.3 trillion package. It's a six-bill package, and one of those funds DHS while the other five addresses other parts of the government. And yesterday, we heard Democrats detail this list of reforms. They want to see input implemented before they support the DHS funding after federal immigration officers shot and killed Alex Pretti in Minneapolis over the weekend.FADEL: So what are they asking for?GRISALES: They want to pass those five other spending bills in the package and leave DHS out while they renegotiate those terms. Schumer told reporters he also wants new rules set around warrants. He wants tightened cooperation with local law enforcement, create a new uniform code of conduct, as well as use-of-force rules. They want more accountability and transparency, including taking off the masks and putting body cameras on. But it's unclear if the Senate can reach a deal on this in time. Otherwise, we could see other parts of the government in addition to DHS, like the Defense Department, Health and Human Services, lose funding starting this weekend.FADEL: And it takes months to negotiate...GRISALES: Right.FADEL: ...These bipartisan funding packages. So is it even possible for them to pass those kinds of changes at this point?GRISALES: Well, it is a tall order. The Senate would need consent from all of its members to split up these bills, perhaps setting up a series of new votes, renegotiate a DHS bill in time to try and pass it.FADEL: And how have Republicans responded?GRISALES: Well, Thune and other leaders maintain they can't split this package up. They know it would be a hard pass in the House. Here's Thune.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN THUNE: I think it's really important, if possible, to do it here, not to have to send it back to the House of Representatives where the future of an appropriations package, I think, would be somewhat uncertain.GRISALES: But we should note, we heard some mixed signals last night.FADEL: OK.GRISALES: Some rank-and-file Republican senators said they're on board. I heard one say at least a bunch of his colleagues would agree to the move. So it's an indicator of how at least some Republicans see this as a high political stakes moment to respond to Pretti's death.FADEL: Are there any other ways they could come to a solution without the risk of this partial shutdown?GRISALES: Well, Thune is one key Republican saying yes. He says Democrats need to work this out directly with the White House. Some suggest that could come in the form of executive orders. So we're watching ongoing conversations between Schumer, other Democrats and the White House for any clues of a different off-ramp. But we should note, many Democrats don't trust something that does not become law, so that sets up this stalemate with no clear solution at the moment.FADEL: That's NPR's Claudia Grisales.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks with Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, about his visit to the immigration facility where a 5-year-old and his father have been detained since last week.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Five-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos is among the detainees at an immigration detention center in Texas. You have probably seen the photo of him being detained in Minnesota last week, that blue beanie hat with bunny ears, that Spider-Man backpack. The Department of Homeland Security says Conejo Ramos and his father entered the U.S. illegally in 2024. Now, the family disputes that and says they came here legally to seek asylum. Well, Texas Congressman Joaquin Castro, a Democrat, visited Liam yesterday at the detention center and joins us now to talk about that visit. Welcome, Congressman.JOAQUIN CASTRO: Good to be with you.CHANG: So how is Liam doing right now?CASTRO: He didn't look well to me, to be honest. Jasmine Crockett and I spent about 30 minutes with Liam and his dad, and his dad said that he'd not been eating well, that he's been sleeping a lot because he's depressed, and asking for his mom and for his classmates and to be back at school. But yeah, he didn't look good.CHANG: I'm so sorry to hear that. What about Liam's father, Adrian Conejo Arias? How is he doing?CASTRO: You know, I think for both of them, it's a kind of trauma being at Dilley. And my sense was that he was trying to hold things together as much as possible for his son. And he's worried about his wife 'cause his wife is four months pregnant and had to go to the emergency room right after Liam was taken in. And, you know, there's obviously a lot of concern for his family.CHANG: Is she doing all right at the moment? Do you know?CASTRO: Yeah, I - right after I finished the inspection of Dilley, the first thing I did was to call Liam's mom. She said she was OK, but, you know, I think a lot of it is folks trying to kind of grin and bear it, so to speak, and deal with what is a real tragedy 'cause these folks did come to the country legally. They had permission to be in the United States while their asylum claim is processed.CHANG: I do want to say that the Department of Homeland Security is maintaining that they came into the country illegally. But you dispute that, yes?CASTRO: Yeah. I mean, our best understanding from their attorney and even in other reporting is that they had applied for asylum.CHANG: With respect to the conditions at Dilley, I want to note that one of your colleagues, Republican Congressman Tony Gonzales, also of Texas, I saw that he told a local station that when he visited the facility, he said the conditions weren't that bad. I'm going to use his words here. Quote, \"To be frank, it is in better condition than some of our schools here in San Antonio.\" What do you make of Gonzales' characterization of Dilley there?CASTRO: Yeah, you know, Tony and I both represent the San Antonio area. And I've not talked to him about this, but, for example, when I went into the medical area in all the exam rooms, there was nobody there. There were so many people that said that they had not gotten their medicine, their medicine was late, that people have some serious food allergies, for example, and that's not being taken into account. So, you know, on the surface, I think you might go there and say, oh, well, yeah, look, everything looks kind of OK. But when you talk to the people and hear what's going on, it's a very different story.CHANG: If we can talk about the larger backdrop, though, you know, the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, President Trump has tried to shake up the leadership there now, replacing the Border Patrol official Greg Bovino with border czar Tom Homan. And Homan said today that he is going to fix the situation in Minneapolis. Are you encouraged to see this change in leadership? Do you think it's a step forward to fixing what's going on there?CASTRO: I don't think it's a step forward to fixing it. I certainly hope it is. I don't think it is. When Tom Homan gets up there and says we're going to start narrowing this operation and pulling some ICE officers out, to me, what that means is they know that they're wrong, they know that they killed two American citizens and they just don't want to admit they're wrong, don't want to admit mistakes and don't want to apologize.CHANG: What specifically do you think needs to change in how immigration enforcement operations are conducted at the moment?CASTRO: Well, I believe that ICE should be disbanded. I believe that it's become an abusive organization. And, you know, don't get me wrong, we still need to have immigration enforcement in the United States of America. I think, you know, we can all agree on that. But it shouldn't look like this, and I don't think it should be done by ICE.CHANG: Then who should it be done by?CASTRO: I think that you've got to create a new organization, a new agency. And remember, ICE was created during the war on terror in the early 2000s, and that's why you see these very intense and brutal crackdowns, because ICE starts with the assumption that everybody's a criminal, and so we're going to treat you like a criminal, including a 5-year-old boy with a backpack and a hat.CHANG: That is Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro of Texas. Thank you very much for your time today.CASTRO: Great to be with you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Scott Applewhite/AP\n    \n\n   \n   With the government on the brink of a partial shutdown, the Senate is scrambling to keep funding flowing and address bipartisan distress over President Trump's immigration enforcement tactics.   But even with an agreement to fund the government, a short-term partial shutdown appears all but inevitable. The Senate still needs to vote on a plan announced by Senate Democrats, and then the House, which is in recess until Monday, needs to sign off, too.   The agreement reached Thursday night and endorsed by Trump will fund much of the government through the end of September and temporarily fund the Department of Homeland Security for two weeks while lawmakers negotiate provisions to rein in federal immigration agents.   \n   Just a week ago, Congress was on track to approve nearly $1.3 trillion in spending for defense, health, transportation, housing and more before government funding expires Friday at midnight.   But the second deadly shooting of a U.S. citizen in Minneapolis by federal immigration officers on Saturday upended those plans, as Democrats pledged to withhold support for the funding package without policy changes on immigration enforcement.   And unlike the shutdown standoff last fall over expiring health insurance subsidies, more Republicans acknowledged that what was unfolding in Minneapolis was an inflection point that could not be ignored.   Democrats are demanding changes to how immigration officers carry out arrests and incidents are investigated, as well as mandating the use of body cameras and other reforms.   Some of the recommendations could attract Republican support. But there is still an arduous road ahead for any of them becoming law.   Why some Republicans are alarmed   In an era when congressional Republicans rarely criticize the Trump administration, the killing of 37-year-old Alex Pretti in Minneapolis sparked unease from unexpected corners of the caucus.   \"Initial rushes to judgment did not meet the standard that Americans should expect from their government officials,\" Sen. Ted Budd, R-N.C., wrote on social media, referring to remarks by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and others who had swiftly labeled Pretti a \"domestic terrorist.\"   \n   \"Enforcing our immigration laws makes our streets safer. It also protects our national security,\" Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., wrote in a statement the day after the shooting. \"But we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble.\"   Several Republicans called for hearings and an independent investigation; DHS leaders are expected to testify in back-to-back oversight hearings next month and Noem is now due to testify in March. Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., more frequent Trump critics, have called for her resignation.   Tillis told reporters that the images coming out of Minneapolis were souring the public on the Trump administration's handling of immigration more broadly.   \"It is regrettable that the issue that Republicans always lead on, we're losing on,\" Tillis told NPR.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., speaks to reporters at the Capitol on Thursday. Tillis says the images coming out of Minneapolis have soured the public on the Trump administration's immigration policy.\n                \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   And despite initially resisting Democrats' demands to split the homeland security funding bill from the overall spending package, key Republicans eventually softened to the idea.   \"If the pathway exists that we get these five bills done and then we have time to continue to review Homeland [Security], I'm here for it,\" said Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., an appropriations committee member.   But divides continue to persist within the Republican Party.   \"We're not going to keep ICE from doing their job,\" said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla. \"The American people wanted the president to enforce law and order and ICE is doing their job.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., says Republicans are \"not going to keep ICE from doing their job.\"\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican who sits on the homeland security committee, said he did not see a need for any further policy changes. He noted that the current DHS funding bill awaiting a vote already includes additional funding for body cameras and oversight.   \"I don't see one that's needed above and beyond what's already there,\" Lankford said.   What Democrats want: judicial warrants, masks off and cameras on   Democrats secured a handful of wins in the current version of the spending bill, such as reducing funding for immigration enforcement and reducing capacity at detention centers. But in the wake of Pretti's death, they say further reforms are needed.   \n   Senate Democrats have outlined three buckets of policy changes they are pursuing.   Democrats want rules around the kinds of warrants immigration officers can use to enter homes and an end to so-called \"roving patrols\" when officers conduct broad searches and stops of people they suspect of being in the country illegally.   An ICE memo unveiled in a whistleblower complaint first reported by the Associated Press last week detailed how Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were using administrative warrants as opposed to judicial warrants, which are signed by a judge.   These administrative warrants, according to the whistleblower report, are signed by immigration agents and deportation officers.   In a letter to DHS, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said these kinds of warrants are an unlawful method of entering private residences. Administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance, have defended the approach as lawful, saying administrative warrants are still warrants.   The broad authority DHS is using has alarmed some Republicans.   \"I am not a big fan of administrative warrants. I think warrants to enter someone's house should be Fourth Amendment warrants,\" said Senate Homeland Security Committee Chair Rand Paul, R-Ky.   Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, had called for an end to the large-scale operation in her state, which resulted in the arrest of over 100 people in what ICE dubbed, \"Operation Catch of the Day.\"   \"I have been urging Secretary Noem and others in the Administration to get ICE to reconsider its approach to immigration enforcement in the state,\" Collins said in a statement, writing that she had spoken to Noem and the operation there was no longer ongoing.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem speaks during a news conference following the death of Alex Pretti. Noem and other administration officials have faced criticism, including from some Republicans, for accusing Pretti of domestic terrorism.\n                \n                    Al Drago/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Al Drago/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   But Democrats want guardrails to prevent similar \"roving\" operations in other places.   Democrats want to make it easier to pursue legal action against immigration officers and \"independent investigations\" into ICE and other federal enforcement misconduct.   Democrats have previously raised questions about the efficacy of DHS oversight mechanisms to investigate employee misconduct and critics have pointed out that the department, which houses ICE, is investigating itself in the most recent deadly incidents.   \n   In the aftermath of the shooting of Renee Macklin Good, the 37-year-old killed by an ICE officer earlier this month, the Federal Bureau of Investigations and ICE announced they would run parallel investigations and not conduct a joint investigation with state officials.   The move prompted backlash from local officials, like Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who argue that the investigation may not be fair since agency leaders were already defending the officers' conduct.   Democrats want to mandate that agents display clearer identification, not cover their faces and wear body cameras.   DHS leaders have defended the use of masks arguing that there is an increased threat of doxxing and physical threats to identified agents and their families.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A member of the U.S. Border Patrol confronts the driver of a vehicle that was following them on Jan. 29, in Minneapolis. Democrats want immigration officers to not cover their faces and wear body cameras, among other changes.\n                \n                    Stephen Maturen/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Stephen Maturen/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Body camera requirements have also come into focus after the two shootings in Minneapolis. DHS has long said it does not have enough body cameras for every single agent.   To address concerns about the lack of body cameras, the current version of the DHS spending bill, which has already passed the House, includes $20 million for cameras for ICE and Customs and Border Protection. But the bill only mandates the money be spent — it does not mandate the use of the cameras.   \"Funding them without wearing them means nothing,\" Blumenthal told NPR.   Why Democrats feel emboldened    After a record 43-day shutdown last fall, many Democrats were weary of even a short funding lapse.   But that environment changed this week. Even five of six Democrats who broke with their party to end the last stalemate now said the risk of another shutdown was something they were willing to take on.   \"ICE is out of control, Donald Trump is out of control,\" said one of those Democrats, Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada. \"Our Constitution, not a suggestion, our Bill of Rights, not a suggestion.\"   \"I think if we're fighting for these reforms, we're exactly where the American people want us to be,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who early on urged his colleagues to oppose homeland security funding.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Healthcare workers attend a vigil for VA nurse Alex Pretti at VA NY Harbor Healthcare System Thursday in New York City.\n                \n                    Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Drew Hammill, who worked for former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who as the House minority leader helped direct Democrats' strategy during the 2018-2019 shutdown over border wall funding, said the debate over ICE tactics cuts much closer to home for most Americans.   \n   \"From a debate about a distant wall to your own neighborhood, your own backyard, the safety of your community — that's a different scenario,\" Hammill said. \"Voters want and expect a fight. And I think this is one of the few opportunities with a lawless president to have any impact.\"   Republican Capitol Hill veteran Antonia Ferrier says her old boss, former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, used to describe shutdown standoffs as box canyons — narrow gorges with no exit on the other end. \"You're making demands and there is no way out,\" Ferrier said.   But she says Democrats may feel emboldened because this moment is spurring anger and passion on both sides of the aisle that strikes at something more fundamental about the direction of the country in a way that the health subsidies debate did not.   \"What I think we're seeing right now is markedly different,\" she said. \"It was a very significant inflection point, and I think now there is just so much attention and outrage that many Republicans agree there has to be some kind of changes made.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Ailsa Chang talks with Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin about the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis and the impasse over Department of Homeland Security funding on Capitol Hill.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Lawmakers in Washington are once again at an impasse over how to keep the government open. At the center of that conflict is funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Senate Democrats want to carve off that DHS money from the broader spending package, and they want new limits on immigration agents, like a prohibition on masks and a requirement that officers carry ID. We called up Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin earlier today, and I asked him whether he even agrees that ICE needs these sort of reforms.RON JOHNSON: Well, what I agree is that we needed to secure our border. What I believe is that what we're dealing with right now is the enormous mess created by President Biden and Democrats who opened up our border, allowed millions of people to flood in this country. Where ICE is doing enforcement actions, just like they've always done - under the Obama administration, the Biden administration - where they're doing these enforcement actions and local police are cooperating, there's no violence. There's no problem. We're just enforcing the law. The problem in Minneapolis is we have a governor and a mayor who are resisting and trying...CHANG: You don't think that ICE needs any reforms then? There should be no changes on the federal government side when it comes to immigration agents.JOHNSON: When you ask that question, when Democrats focus on that, they're focusing on the wrong problem. The root cause of this problem is the border they opened up, the millions of people, including criminals, that they've allowed to flood in this country, and now law enforcements has to take care of that problem. But (inaudible)...CHANG: So what changes do you think need to be seen for law enforcement...JOHNSON: Well, first of all...CHANG: ...To better take care of this problem that you have identified, that you have characterized?JOHNSON: The first change was we secured the border. It has to remain secure. The second change is there are people that need to be apprehended because they're criminals, murders, rapists, sex, human and drug traffickers that need to be apprehended and either jailed or deported. And that right now is what these sanctuary cities and people like Mayor Frey and Governor Walz are resisting, and that have led to the tragedy. Had there not been an organized effort to resist those law enforcement actions, those two individuals in Minneapolis would still be alive.CHANG: President Trump has tried to shake up the leadership for the federal immigration crackdown in Minneapolis. He's replaced the Border Patrol official Greg Bovino with border czar Tom Homan. Homan said today that he is going to, quote, \"fix the situation there.\" Do you believe it is possible to fix the situation in Minneapolis with this change in leadership?JOHNSON: If Governor Walz and Mayor Frey would cooperate with ICE rather than resist them, rather than send people into harm's way to create these types of martyrs, yeah. I think it can be fixed. Again, I personally - I want to target the criminals. You know, I don't want right now...CHANG: I understand that, Senator.JOHNSON: ...ICE targeting other people who are here working and contributing to society. But there are a lot of criminals. There are a lot of criminals that have been let in that need to be apprehended and jailed and deported.CHANG: OK. You keep shifting blame to the mayor in Minneapolis and the governor in Minnesota. Can you tell me specifically...JOHNSON: That's where it lays.CHANG: ...What you want to see from - well, what do you need to see from them that's - specifically to fix the situation in Minneapolis?JOHNSON: Do what other governors and mayors have done. Cooperate with ICE. Cooperate with federal law enforcement when they're carrying out completely legal enforcement actions. Cooperate with them. Don't resist. Don't send to your citizens in harm's way to resist them and protest against them. Cooperate. When you arrest an illegal immigrant, hold them for detention...CHANG: And what are state and local officials supposed to...JOHNSON: ...So that ICE can pick them up and in jail, rather than have to engage in these...CHANG: What are state and local officials supposed to do if they see federal immigration agents doing unlawful actions, such as fatally shooting people when it's not in self-defense, when there is no imminent danger in that situation, there's no weapon being wielded right in the face of the federal agent?JOHNSON: Their open borders, their lack of cooperation created this circumstance for that tragedy. So they should've cooperated on the front end. Right now, there will be a thorough investigation in terms of exactly what happened, and I'm just saying I've got a great deal of sympathy for those ICE officers who are under constant threat. How would you like to be in law enforcement and everybody - all of a sudden, you've got people who are opposed to what you're trying to do, showing up. You don't know whether they're armed, whether they're just, you know, brandishing cameras. You don't know. You're going to be on hair-trigger alert, and that's what caused that tragedy.CHANG: There are still legal requirements for when any law enforcement officer can use lethal force. It's not just if they don't know if the person is armed or not. Last question, going back to the federal spending package, Democrats at least - at the very least, they just want to split DHS funding from the rest of the spending package to keep the government open. Do you agree with that idea?JOHNSON: Then they will never fund DHS. So this is a ploy. I mean, they'll do it. They'll convince people like you that, oh, they're just being very reasonable. This is a way that they can defund DHS, just like they want to defund the police to disastrous consequences. So no, I can't support that effort.CHANG: Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, thank you very much for joining us.JOHNSON: Have a good day. Take care.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

I'm not prepared to spend another dime on ICE unless there's just a massive set of reforms that include things like ending these indiscriminate sweeps of cities, the deployment of mass numbers of ill-trained ICE troops to places that mayors and governors don't want them, the continued wearing of masks. The masks should be gone. They should be wearing bodycams and have ID. We also want to make sure that there's compliance with the law when it comes to warrants. There should be arrest warrants. If you're going to go into someone's home, you need a judicially signed warrant. None of these administrative warrants signed within DHS. There's going to have to be a lot of wholesale reforms, including an end to the excessive use of force and accountability - real investigations with the participation of state and local police.INSKEEP: We heard John Thune there say that he's reluctant to write those provisions into law, wants you to work something out with the White House, some kind of executive order. What do you make of that?SCHIFF: That's a no-go. I mean, there's absolutely no trust in this administration. And even though the president sounds like he is backpedaling at the moment, you know, that changes from hour to hour. He made some mitigating statements, and then they - he followed them with, again, more attacks on Alex Pretti, more lies about Alex Pretti. So there's no trust in this president. So I think in order for this to work, there's going to have to be real written statutory limits on what ICE and the Customs and Border Protection could do.INSKEEP: Is Senator Thune effectively telling you who's in charge here? Republicans in Congress are going to defer to him anyway.SCHIFF: Well, I don't know. Many Republicans are speaking...INSKEEP: I mean to Trump, of course, is what I mean. But go on, please.SCHIFF: Yeah. Well, look, ultimately, Republicans in Congress have a statutory and a constitutional duty themselves, and that duty is not to do whatever the person or the president wants. It's to do their constitutional duty. So they need to rise up and grow a spine and make sure that we put an end to the murder of people in our streets. You're hearing some Republicans speak out and differ with the president. But whether that will continue, you know, past his prologue, I'm not optimistic. But in this moment, we're going to insist on real changes to ICE. Otherwise, they're certainly not going to have my vote.INSKEEP: You've just made an argument for lawmakers not necessarily doing what the president wants but following their duty. And this raises another question about people in the executive branch. We have some news here, Senator. On Wednesday, we're told the FBI served a search warrant at the election headquarters in Fulton County, Georgia, which includes most of Atlanta. They're looking for ballots from the 2020 election. What do you make of the FBI taking such a step seemingly in support of President Trump's baseless theory that he won in 2020?SCHIFF: Americans really need to, you know, wake up to what's happening here. If they're going to use the FBI unlawfully to do an investigation to once again prove nonexistent fraud from an election the president continues to lie about, then what are they prepared to do in the midterm election? What abuse of power will they use? Will they invoke the Insurrection Act and station police outside of polling stations or military outside of polling stations to try to intimidate people? Will they seize ballots, as they're trying to do in Georgia now? If they'll do that over a past election, will they do that over a present election? So this needs to be a wake-up call, I think, for all of us.On the January 6 Committee, I handled the hearing that looked into Georgia. I still remember vividly that call the president made where he badgered the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to find 11,780 votes that didn't exist. If he was willing to do that then, what more is he willing to do in this much more lawless administration to try to overturn the results or prevent people's vote from counting?INSKEEP: Senator, I'm glad you mentioned the elections coming this fall. A few days ago on this program, we had Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, on. And she described Democrats - really smart Democrats, in her opinion - being around the tabletop, making plans for what might go wrong, what might happen and how to respond. Can you talk to me a little bit about that? What are Democrats doing, so far as you know, to prepare for whatever you think might happen this fall?SCHIFF: We are doing exactly that, which is making all the contingency plans we can. But I'll say this - I was part of the same effort four years ago during the last election, when we came up with about a thousand things that might go wrong in the election except the one that did, which was the insurrection.INSKEEP: Got it.SCHIFF: We never anticipated a mass attack on the Capitol. So I'm circumspect about everything we can anticipate. Look, a lot is going to count on whether our institutions hold, whether our military refuses to execute illegal orders, whether our Republicans are willing to defend our democracy or whether they're still going to go along with a president who simply wants to accumulate more power. There are no, you know, magic buttons to push here. Ultimately, I think it's going to count on the most important player in the political process, and that is our citizens, to make sure they overcome every hurdle to vote - and they're going to try to put hurdles in the way - and to insist that their votes count. That's the best protection we have.INSKEEP: I'm really interested to hear you say that before the 2020 election, you tried to game out what might go wrong and didn't figure out the thing that ultimately did go wrong, in your opinion. I'm just curious if you understand the state of play now. Are Democrats, for example, lining up lawyers, getting ready to make legal arguments? Is there something you can do other than going to court if something wrong, in your opinion, is taking place?SCHIFF: Yes. We are doing exactly that, and litigation is a big part of the strategy, as it was during the previous contested election. I think the challenge is the Supreme Court has never been trustworthy. It certainly isn't now, and litigation has its limits. We counted on a lot of state and local officials - Republican state and local officials to do their duty, which they did. People like Brad Raffensperger and others who said no to the president when the president was asking them to do things illegally, like Rusty Bowers, the Republican speaker in Arizona. Will Republican local elected officials - elections officials - again refuse to do things that are unethical and illegal? That was an important check that we're not sure we will have this time.INSKEEP: Adam Schiff is a Democratic senator from California. Senator Schiff, thanks very much for the time. Really appreciate it.SCHIFF: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF ROB FORD EXPLORER'S \"SPIRIT OF THE SPEED EDITION\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Senators have reached a deal they hope will avoid a lengthy government shutdown and allow time to negotiate reforms to the Department of Homeland Security.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  All right, the Senate is scrambling to finalize a deal that will keep funding flowing to much of the government and address bipartisan distrust over President Trump's immigration enforcement tactics. But even as senators say that they have an agreement to do that, a partial government shutdown is still all but inevitable, at least for a short time. NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas joins us now from the Capitol. Hi, Sam.SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa.CHANG: OK, so what exactly has been agreed to at this point?GRINGLAS: OK, so Congress already approved several spending bills. This deal focuses on six of them that have not been approved yet, but these bills that are left account for huge swaths of the government, including the Pentagon, Health and Human Services and Homeland Security, which includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection. So what the Senate is going to do is vote to fund almost everything through September. But Homeland Security funding will be extended only for two weeks, and that'll allow lawmakers to negotiate some guardrails for federal immigration enforcement. Senate Republicans and Democrats are on board, and President Trump tonight posted that he is too.CHANG: OK, so there is a deal, but, Sam, that usually means a shutdown is averted. So explain why that is not the case here.GRINGLAS: The deadline to do all of this is at midnight tomorrow, but the House has to sign off again once the Senate completes its work because they sent all the spending bills over to the Senate tied together, and so the House has to approve this plan too. The problem is that the House is on recess until Monday, and it's not clear if they could come back any earlier. So funding to all the agencies in the middle of this is going to stop, at least for a little bit.CHANG: At least for a little bit. That's where we are. OK, so do we know what the actual impact of even a very short shutdown would be?GRINGLAS: So you know how I mentioned that a handful of spending bills were already done? That means, for example, the Department of Agriculture is funded, and so food aid won't be affected this time around. But at stake right now are still some really key agencies like the Pentagon and Health and Human Services. Though if the shutdown is short, it is less likely that we're going to see, you know, federal workers missing paychecks like we did last time.CHANG: Absolutely. OK, explain more about, like, why did Republicans come around to a deal, and why were Democrats willing to risk a shutdown?GRINGLAS: You know, just a week ago, Congress was on track to easily approve all these final spending bills. But the second deadly shooting in Minneapolis by federal immigration officers really upended that. You know, Democrats, who still had heartburn from the shutdown last time over health subsidies in the fall - including those who voted with Republicans to end it - now said that they would be willing to withhold their support for the funding without these policy changes to immigration enforcement. Democrats think the public is on their side here and that the issue has captured their attention, you know, even more than that health debate did last fall.CHANG: Yeah.GRINGLAS: And, you know, more Republicans have also acknowledged that what was unfolding in Minneapolis just couldn't be ignored and saw their party losing ground on an issue that they felt like they used to really own.CHANG: OK, so once the House approves this plan, that leaves - what? - just two weeks before Homeland Security funding runs out again.GRINGLAS: Yep.CHANG: Am I right?GRINGLAS: Yep, yep. So lawmakers will have this very short window then to agree on some, you know, knotty policy questions like should the law expressly require immigration agents have judicial warrants? Should officers be required to wear body cameras? And how should incidents be investigated, and how should officers be held accountable? So a lot to wrap up in just two weeks.CHANG: Yeah. That is NPR's Sam Gringlas. Thank you so much, Sam.GRINGLAS: Thanks, Ailsa.(SOUNDBITE OF DELUSIONALPATH AND RETROCANON'S \"V12 (432HZ)\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The Jan. 29, 2025, directive targeted antisemitism on campus and launched investigations at five schools — later widened to 60.   But within weeks of the executive order, federal agencies started withholding billions of dollars in contracts and grants from several high-profile schools and pressuring them to align their policies more closely with Trump's on a range of issues that extended beyond antisemitism.   \n   Elite universities soon began reaching settlements, starting with the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University in July. Harvard University was a notable exception, challenging the administration's actions in court. In September, a federal judge ruled in Harvard's favor that the government illegally froze more than $2 billion in federal grants and contracts, a decision the government is appealing. Despite Harvard's victory, more schools agreed to deals.    Some universities paid the government millions of dollars; others paid nothing but agreed to policy or personnel changes. But a common theme has emerged over the past year: The administration is seeking to alter the culture at these powerful institutions, barring them, for instance, from supporting programs aimed at diversity, equity and inclusion.   \n   Loading...\n   What is the administration's goal? And can it do that?    Universities have stressed that reaching a settlement doesn't mean they admit to any wrongdoing. But the deals have called for colleges to agree to policy changes, like adopting definitions of gender as laid out by the president's executive orders, affecting everything from campus housing to athletic programs.   \"In just a year, President Trump has completely transformed American higher education by restoring merit, enforcing civil rights, and eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse,\" White House spokesperson Liz Huston told NPR in an email. Huston said the Trump administration \"will keep holding even more [higher education institutions] accountable over the next three years — to promote academic excellence and maintain America's advantage for generations to come.\"   \n   But Trump's use of federal funds to force changes has raised questions from constitutional scholars about whether his tactics violate the law.   \"What I find striking and disturbing about what's happened here,\" says Thomas Berry, the director of constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, \"is that the federal government started by simply pausing all of this funding\" without proving its allegations.   Berry says that Cato doesn't love the idea of private universities being dependent on federal funds. But he also says the government shouldn't use that relationship to meddle in how schools would normally operate.   \n   \"To me, it's a blatant violation of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine of the First Amendment,\" says Berry.   The idea behind that doctrine is that a government can't say someone has to give up a constitutional right such as free speech or they won't get a benefit — like federal money.   Echoing Berry's point, Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors, says, \"Six or seven [Supreme Court] rulings from 1920 onwards all held that the federal government cannot use purse strings to control speech.\"   \n   The government has formal processes to enforce civil rights statutes and court rulings, but Berry says the Trump administration isn't using those tools. Instead, he says, the administration seems to be channeling Trump's history of filing lawsuits to accomplish his business and personal goals.   \"Trump has such a long history as a private citizen of suing individual people or individual entities and dealing with them one at a time,\" he says. \"But it's concerning when it's from the federal government.\"   \n   The American Association of University Professors has sued the Trump administration in several venues over its withholding of funds and grants. Its president, Wolfson, is blunt in characterizing the settlements.   \"It was extortion.\"   He also says the government's actions are unconstitutional and undermine academic freedoms, while endangering research projects that can benefit the American public.   Still, the government secured significant payments and concessions from a slate of well-regarded universities in 2025:   Northwestern University:    The Illinois school agreed in late November to pay $75 million to the government over three years to unlock some $790 million in frozen federal money and end civil rights investigations by several agencies.The Trump administration had accused Northwestern of allowing antisemitism to spread on campus, related to protests against Israel's attacks on Gaza.Northwestern's interim president, Henry Bienen, said that the university had been paying some $40 million every month to maintain research and that the deal was \"the best and most certain method\" to restore federal funding. A legal battle would likely have lasted for years, he said.Policy changes that Northwestern agreed to included terminating the Deering Meadow Agreement, a 2024 pact with demonstrators under which the university had, among other things, provided temporary space for two Middle Eastern and Muslim student groups.   \n   Cornell University:    Faced with losing more than $250 million in federal funds, Cornell announced a deal with the government on Nov. 7. The government closed civil rights investigations that focused on Cornell's compliance with antidiscrimination laws in its admissions procedures.Cornell will pay a total of $60 million over three years: $30 million to the government and $30 million for \"research to strengthen U.S. agriculture,\" according to the university's president, Michael Kotlikoff.Cornell also agreed to use guidance from the Justice Department \"as a training resource to faculty and staff.\" That July 2025 memo from Attorney General Pam Bondi equates DEI programs to \"discriminatory practices.\"   University of Virginia:    UVA's interim president, Paul Mahoney, signed a deal with the Justice Department on Oct. 22, months after then-President Jim Ryan resigned. Ryan had said the federal government threatened to gut funding if he remained. The university received more than $400 million in federal research funds in the 2024 financial year. The Justice Department had opened seven investigations into UVA in nine weeks, many of them related to the school's response to Trump's order to end diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.UVA isn't required to pay a fine or set up an external monitor of its practices. The school affirmed it will follow civil rights laws, and it also agreed to adopt Bondi's guidance on what constitutes discrimination.   Brown University:    On July 30, Brown University agreed to pay $50 million over 10 years to local workforce development organizations. The deal emerged after the White House said it would freeze $510 million of federal funding due to allegations of antisemitism on Brown's campus and the school's diversity, equity and inclusion work.Under the deal, Brown also pledged to adopt definitions of \"male\" and \"female\" as laid out in a Trump executive order, and to not consider race in its admissions and programming.   Columbia University:    In late July, the White House and Columbia University said the university would pay some $221 million to resolve several investigations, as NPR reported. The school previously said the government suspended \"the majority\" of $1.3 billion in federal research funding.The settlement calls for Columbia to pay $200 million over three years related to the administration's allegations of discriminatory practices, and $21 million to settle an investigation into workplace harassment related to the college's Jewish employees.Among other measures, the settlement stipulates that Columbia won't consider race in admissions, programming or hiring, will provide a demographic and academics breakdown of all rejected and admitted students, and will review its international admissions process.   \n   University of Pennsylvania:    On July 1, the school, Trump's alma mater, reached an agreement that included revising records related to a transgender swimmer's results, as well as its policies on transgender athletes, after the Trump administration froze $175 million of federal funding. In 2022, Lia Thomas, a transgender athlete at Penn, won high-profile swimming titles at the women's Ivy League championships.\n",

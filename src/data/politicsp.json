Some faced state prosecutions, while others were never charged.   A proclamation published on Martin's personal X account late Sunday listed 77 people who received \"full, complete, and unconditional\" pardons, including Rudy Giuliani, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, and Sidney Powell, a former Trump attorney who spread conspiracy theories about ballot fraud after Trump lost the 2020 election.   \n   Powell is one of four pardon recipients who previously pleaded guilty in a Georgia court after being indicted for trying to subvert the 2020 election results in Georgia.   The pardons are largely symbolic as none of the names listed were ever charged with federal crimes. Dozens of people listed were charged in multiple swing states that were the center of unfounded claims of election fraud, including Georgia, Nevada, Arizona and Wisconsin. Presidents do not hold the power to pardon state crimes.   \n   The proclamation appeared to have been signed on Friday. It also made clear that Trump was not among those being pardoned. Trump has previously said he had the \"absolute right\" to pardon himself – a claim that remains untested. The Supreme Court granted the president broad immunity for official acts committed during his presidency.   In a statement to NPR, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"These great Americans were persecuted and put through hell by the Biden Administration for challenging an election, which is the cornerstone of democracy,\" adding: \"President Trump is putting an end to the Biden Regime's communist tactics once and for all.\"   In January, Trump pardoned some 1,500 Jan. 6 rioters who participated in the siege on the U.S. Capitol four years ago. Among those pardoned were Enrique Tarrio, the former Proud Boys chairman, who was convicted of \"seditious conspiracy\" and sentenced to 22 years in the federal penitentiary.   \n   This latest string of pardons, while symbolic, appears to be part of Trump's longstanding efforts to rewrite history and amplify his false claims that the 2020 election, which was won by Joe Biden, was stolen. Pressed about those false claims in a 2022 interview with NPR's Steve Inskeep, Trump repeatedly attempted to cast more misinformation about his election loss, before abruptly ending the call.\n",

As the administration started sending troops into several Democratic-led cities this summer, some members of the Ohio guard began expressing concern in a Signal group chat.\n                \n                    Al Drago/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Al Drago/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   As President Trump calls for National Guard deployments across the U.S., a small contingent of Ohio guard members has been quietly expressing concern in an encrypted group chat.   The administration started sending troops into several Democratic-led cities this summer, citing the need to crack down on violent crime and protect federal immigration facilities. The Ohio guard members now say they're alarmed at the turn the country is taking. They're even questioning their potential role in it.   \n   \"I really went to a dark place when they sent the troops to [Los Angeles], and then eventually [Washington, D.C.], and now, Chicago. This is just not what any of us signed up for, and it's so out of the scope of normal operations,\" says J, a member of the Ohio National Guard who spoke to NPR on condition of anonymity.   In the summer, Trump sent troops into Los Angeles as anti-ICE protests escalated. He then deployed guard troops into D.C., where around 2,300 still regularly patrol streets. Then a torrent of plans for deployments came — Chicago, Portland, Memphis, cities in Louisiana and Missouri. Many of them remain embroiled in legal limbo.   In Ohio, J and several other members have taken to that group chat to discuss the deployments and the accompanying anxiety they've felt. J, as well as members C and A — all part of the same unit — agreed to talk to NPR on the condition that they are only identified by their first initials, because they are not authorized to talk to the press and fear retribution for expressing their opinions.   \"I have been on two humanitarian-esque missions with the guard, which were awesome, doing the things you see on the commercial, helping these communities,\" says J. \"And then you want me to go pick up trash and dissuade homeless people in D.C. at gunpoint. Like, no dude. It's so disheartening every time I see another city — and I just wonder, 'who's going to stand up to this?'\"   \n   It's a sentiment that's building with guard members elsewhere.   In recent weeks, more than 100 active military members have reached out to About Face, a nonpartisan nonprofit made up of current service members and post-9/11 veterans to be a resource for those who might be questioning their deployments, according to the organization.   \"In the military culture, it's really easy to feel like if you have questions or dissent, you're the only person who thinks that,\" says director Brittany Ramos DeBarros, a combat veteran who served in Afghanistan.   \n   The group has started an information campaign, specifically targeting members of the National Guard around the country — using flyers, posters, even billboards — encouraging them to reach out if they're having doubts.   \"We take very seriously making sure that people do understand what they could be facing if they follow their conscience,\" says DeBarros. \"But the thing we also help people think through is, what is the cost of not following your conscience? Because as Iraq and Afghanistan vets in particular, many of us are living with that cost every day.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                With the White House in the distance, National Guard troops patrol the Mall as part of President Donald Trump's order to impose federal law enforcement in the nation's capital, in Washington, Aug. 28, 2025.\n                \n                    J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n    \n\n   \n   NPR reached out to both the White House and the Pentagon for this story.   \"Our great National Guardsmen signed up to defend the nation and serve the American people,\" wrote Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson in a statement. \"We are proud of the work they have accomplished this year, and we are confident in their collective ability to carry out any and all orders by President Trump, the Department of War, and state leaders.\"   White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson defended the deployments, saying Trump was using his \"lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel.\" Jackson lashed out at Democratic leaders, saying they'd failed to stop violent attacks on law enforcement.   The group chat   The group chat with the Ohio National Guard members — set up on the encrypted messaging app Signal — began amid the flurry of executive orders President Trump signed as he took office. Some of them affected the military. The members say they needed a space to process it.   \n   \"It's not even necessarily expressing opinions or anything. It's just expressing questions about things that come out,\" says A.   They say the chat is active every day, with members sharing information and news articles they come across. In recent months, that chat has grown to a dozen members of their unit, and it's become largely focused on Trump's rhetoric around the National Guard and his deployments of troops to several cities.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump gestures while walking across the South Lawn of the White House, Sunday, Nov. 2, 2025.\n                \n                    Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Ohio's Republican Gov. Mike DeWine has agreed to send troops to support the administration's efforts; there are about 150 in DC right now.   That voluntary directive has come to this unit. None of the three took it. They say the orders themselves were uncharacteristically vague.   \"What exactly are we going to be doing? Are we going to have leave? And those answers aren't very clear — but in the past, it's always been very clear,\" says A. \"Anywhere that we go, there's crucial information that we get about the why behind it. And whenever we don't get that, especially for these city moves, members ask questions.\"   Growing anti-guard sentiment   A joined the guard to pay for college. J was looking for direction in life. And C felt the pull of the benefits that the guard offers and to serve her country. All three have served for years, even decades.   The three say they are grappling with whether to leave the guard, and end their military careers.   \"The only reason I want to finish my current contract is just because I feel like there's weight to what I do and say right now, and I just want to use that to do some good,\" says J.   C says she has been proud of her military career and how she has served — noting that she's served on missions that she didn't necessarily agree with before. But she worries these deployments could change that. She says she's spent a lot of time thinking about what line she won't cross.   \n   \"I've been in therapy. Lots of therapy has taken me to the point where at least I can be okay if I have to say goodbye. That sucks. Is this tarnishing my service? Is it undoing everything I thought I was fighting for?\" she says.   The three say they've felt anti-guard sentiment from some of their community and in their civilian lives.   \"Everything that has been happening is so counter to doctrine, and so counter to what we've been taught,\" C says.   Their thoughts   The Trump administration has publicly talked about using the National Guard to help with mass deportations and immigration enforcement — something broadly illegal under US law. That bothers the three guard members.   \"There is no way I would participate in that,\" says J. \"I just think when everything is said and done, people are going to have to answer for what we're seeing now, and I don't want to be any part of it.\"   A also says he's been wrestling with what he'd do if made to participate.   \"I think, like, establishing those boundaries with yourself: What am I willing to do? What am I willing to give up? And where do I draw those lines?\" he says.   The idea of troops patrolling U.S. streets — even if they're only picking up trash — is also problematic for the Ohio guard members.   \n   \"It's kind of like fearmongering. People who don't see people in uniform every day, you send 50 of them out to walk their street, it's going to send a message,\" J says.   DeBarros, the director of About Face, says she knows the tactic well.   \"In Afghanistan, we used to regularly carry out what are called presence patrols, where there was no purpose or mission other than to be present in the space and normalizing that we were there,\" she said. \"Letting people know, oh, if you act up, we are here, and we're watching.\"   \n   C has been thinking a lot about what she's willing to give up and the potential consequences.   \"I swore an oath to the Constitution, not a person,\" she says. \"I just really, really implore my peers and everybody outside looking in, to just think about that. Really think about that, and think about what that means. And if there are questions, ask them. Keep talking.\"\n",

The United Nations annual climate summit, called COP30, begins Monday and is expected to last about two weeks.   This year, the U.S. will not play an active role in the talks. According to a White House statement to NPR, no high-level officials will attend COP30 — breaking a long-standing tradition.   During the previous Trump administration, U.S. delegates participated in the talks. Now, the administration has taken a stronger anti-climate stance, calling efforts to limit global warming a \"hoax.\"   \n   \"President Trump will not jeopardize our country's economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries,\" says White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.   President Trump began to de-prioritize climate in January, when he withdrew the U.S. from the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. In that accord, countries agreed to try to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally less than 1.5 C (2.7 F). The planet is currently on track to warm roughly 2.8 C (5 F) over preindustrial levels by 2100, according to a recent U.N. climate report.   Since the Paris Agreement, the U.S. developed policies to cut climate pollution in ways that would lower future warming. But the Trump administration's sweeping rollbacks to climate policy are affecting those efforts, as well as communities' ability to cope with climate risks, like lengthening extreme heat seasons and increasingly destructive wildfires or floods. Climate experts worry that because the U.S. is setting an example, other countries might pull back on climate goals, too.   If all U.S. climate efforts were discontinued, the U.N. report estimates, the planet could warm by an extra 0.1 C — a small fraction of the total change to the planet, but a chunk that could still have significant real-life impacts.   \n   \"Each fraction of a degree matters for communities facing floods, drought, and heat extremes,\" says Ko Barrett, deputy secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization.   Here are six major shifts in U.S. climate policy initiated by the Trump administration.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                During his two terms in office, President Donald Trump has taken steps to roll back or weaken environmental and climate policy. This term, the administration has made significant changes, from cutting federal support for renewable power to dismantling climate research efforts at agencies like NOAA.\n                \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Rolling back longstanding policies to target climate pollution   In March, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to target more than two dozen rules and policies in what the agency called the \"most consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history.\"   One key component of the administration's efforts focuses on attempting to reverse the \"endangerment finding,\" a legal basis for many of the country's climate policies.   In 2009, the EPA labeled carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses a danger to public health and welfare. But legal challenges from fossil fuel interests and their allies delayed the finalization of rules to rein in greenhouse gas pollution. Now, the Trump administration wants to eliminate that 2009 endangerment finding, which could make it easier to roll back other climate regulations.   In July, Trump's EPA argued that the country's climate pollution is not harming people and doesn't need to be regulated in the way courts and previous administrations have chosen to do it.   Reconsidering limits on climate pollution from power plants   In June, the Trump administration announced plans to repeal limits on greenhouse gas emissions and other airborne pollutants from the nation's fossil fuel-fired power plants. If the proposal survives expected legal challenges and is finalized, it would eliminate controls on the second-largest source of climate pollution in the U.S., behind transportation.   The administration argues U.S. coal and gas-fired power plants are responsible for about 3% of global greenhouse gases that are heating the planet. It says that number is declining — it was 5.5% in 2005. So, the administration argues, reducing it further would provide little benefit to public health. That ignores that the U.S. is responsible for nearly a quarter of the climate pollution in the atmosphere today–more than any other nation, historically.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                During the Biden administration, the Environmental Protection Agency developed rules to reduce carbon emissions and mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants and other pollution sources. Now, several of those rules are being rolled back or reconsidered under the Trump administration.\n                \n                    Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Withdrawing support for renewable energy technologies    The Trump administration is taking steps to open up more areas of U.S. land and ocean to increased oil and gas exploration. At the same time, it has been dismantling federal support for wind and solar industries, which it falsely labels as risky and unreliable.   \n   The new GOP spending law ends federal tax incentives for wind and solar, throwing into limbo thousands of projects. The Trump administration has also canceled more than $13 billion in funds for green energy projects and tried to halt offshore wind projects already under construction. Energy experts say it's too early to know the full impact of these policies, but in the first half of 2025, U.S. renewable investment fell by 36%, according to data from BloombergNEF.   The Trump administration is also targeting subsidies for consumers to buy climate solutions like rooftop solar, efficient heat pumps, and electric vehicles. And it ended a $7 billion grant program for local solar projects. Federal incentives for rooftop solar, heat pumps, and insulation go away Dec. 31. Tax credits for electric vehicles ended Sept. 30.   Cutting climate-preparedness grants nationwide   The Trump administration has also cancelled grants for climate and environmental initiatives around the country. Grant recipients, contractors and activists say the moves have thrown into doubt the government's standing as a reliable partner.   Funding cuts have targeted a range of energy projects, as well, from transmission lines to research on capturing carbon from the atmosphere. Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the moves would set back American innovation and competitiveness.   Democratic lawmakers warn that cancelling Energy Department funding risks driving up utility bills and slowing economic growth at a time when new data centers and factories are expected to increase electricity demand for the first time in decades.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A tropical analysis meteorologist works at his station at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida, in May 2025.

One of the administration's targets was the National Climate Assessment, which is the most influential and widely-used source of information about how climate change affects the United States. In April, the Trump administration dismissed those who were working on the next edition of the report. In July, the federal website that hosted the most recent edition went dark.   \n   The administration also slashed funding for climate science research at agencies like NOAA, NASA, and even USDA. The cuts have affected long-standing data collection efforts and datasets, like NOAA's Billion Dollar Disaster analysis, which keeps track of the ballooning costs of climate-worsened disasters like wildfires, hurricanes, hailstorms, and floods. The database was discontinued in May.   Lowering federal support for disaster relief and preparedness   As wildfires, hurricanes and storms get more intense, disasters that exceed more than a billion dollars in damage are on the rise. Many communities rely on federal support to prepare, including building flood protection projects, improving evacuation planning and fortifying hospitals and other vital infrastructure. The Trump administration has cancelled more than $4 billion in grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, leaving many communities scrambling to replace that funding and prevent damage from worsening hazards. The Trump administration has said it wants states to take over disaster preparation.\n",

Today's top stories   A bipartisan group of senators reached a deal last night to reopen the government and end the longest shutdown in U.S. history. The vote on the first procedural step was 60 to 40, with seven Democrats and one independent joining most Republicans on the measure. The agreement would fund the government through Jan. 30.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) speaks to reporters following a vote on Capitol Hill on Nov. 9, 2025, in Washington, D.C. The Senate convened for a rare Sunday session in an attempt to end the government shutdown.\n                \n                    Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Along with the stopgap measure to fund the government, the Democrats who defected received a promise of a vote on health care, NPR's Claudia Grisales tells Up First. Some of the Democrats who voted no were furious about the defection. Sen. Elizabeth Warren stated that the defection was a terrible mistake and that the American people want them to fight for health care. The Senate has several hurdles to clear before the measure can be passed, and even then, it will need to pass the House.   The Trump administration now has two days to increase SNAP benefits from 65% to 100% after a federal appeals court refused a request to pause a lower court's orders to do so. The administration could ask the U.S. Supreme Court to get involved in the matter for the second time in just a few days. Another battle is unfolding involving states that have already paid out full benefits after a federal judge ordered it, but before the higher court said 'not so fast,' NPR's Tovia Smith says.    \n   🎧 Much of these legal battles could be rendered moot with the expectation that when the government reopens, Congress can appropriate SNAP funding for the fiscal year. Smith says there is no certainty as to when families will receive the benefits after the shutdown ends, but in the past states motivated to get benefits flowing did so within a matter of days. When speaking with Americans who receive SNAP benefits, Smith has heard a sense of relief from some that they could soon receive the funds, and others have been cautiously hopeful.   World leaders are gathering in Brazil for the United Nations' annual climate summit, COP30, to negotiate the ongoing response to climate change. The event is expected to last about two weeks. This year, the United States will not take an active role in the discussions.    🎧 Some world leaders may be relieved that the U.S. might not show, as some are concerned that its presence could hamper the talks, according to NPR's Julia Simon. The U.S. is the second biggest polluter and will eventually need to come on board to help reach the climate goals. When it comes to tackling climate change, there are two major driving forces: politics, as exemplified by this summit, and economics, says Simon. The green economic transition is where a lot of good news for the planet is currently happening, from electric vehicles to solar power.   \n   Cost of living   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Getty Images/Emily Bogle/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   NPR's series Cost of Living: The Price We Pay is examining what's driving price increases and how people are coping after years of stubborn inflation.    The price of electricity has increased 40% since February 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The rise in demand for electricity is partly due to the proliferation of new data centers that support the growing artificial intelligence industry. Additionally, the price of natural gas, which is used to generate electricity, has gone up. Here's what else we know:    💡 Demand for electricity is expected to grow 2.2% this year and 2.4% next year, according to the Energy Department.💡 Utilities projects that building new power supplies and a more resilient grid will exceed a trillion dollars over the next five years. If data centers receive a price break, residential customers may take on some of their costs.💡 Electricity costs can be reduced by adjusting consumption times and locations. The highest rates occur during peak demand, such as on the hottest days of summer.   Listen to why AI is partly to blame for your electricity bill going up.

A study published in 2024 found that one of the strongest predictors of a child's screen time is their parents' screen time. While it can be challenging for parents to limit screen time due to much of the work to manage the home being online, practicing moderation can set a positive example.    \n   📱 If you are with your family and would prefer to be off your device, ask yourself if that task is urgent. If it is not, save that to-do for another time.📱 Focus less on assessing the quantity of your screen time, but the quality. After your observations of what is actually beneficial, identify how you can make healthier tweaks to your screen time.📱 Create device-free zones in your home and schedule. Many parents ban devices during mealtime. You can also implement this rule during a movie night or on vacations.

    "body": "\n      Senate lawmakers voted late Sunday on a measure that would reopen the government, with enough moderate Democrats joining Republicans to support the initial vote.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  A group of Senate Democrats have defected to agree to a deal with Republicans to end the government shutdown.STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  In a few moments, we will speak with one of the Democratic senators who voted to reopen the government. This measure received 60 votes in the Senate last evening - exactly enough. John Thune, the Republican leader, is looking to work through Senate procedures in days to come.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN THUNE: I am optimistic that after almost six weeks of this shutdown, we finally - we'll finally be able to end it.INSKEEP: Most Democrats still voted no, saying the agreement gives them no assurance on their central demand, which was extending subsidies for health insurance.FADEL: NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales has been following this and joins us now. Good morning, Claudia.CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila.FADEL: OK. So for weeks, we've seen fits and starts of talks, blame games, both sides dug in. Now this group of rank-and-file Senate Democrats is breaking with leadership to move this deal forward. What's actually in the agreement?GRISALES: Well, the package includes a stopgap measure to fund the government through the end of January. It also includes full-year appropriations funding plans for some federal agencies and services. It will pause planned cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, and also reverses federal worker layoffs installed by the Trump administration during the shutdown and protects the workforce from more cuts for a few months, to the end of January. Democrats who defected also got a promise of a vote on health care. As you remember, the party has fought a Republican stopgap measure to reopen the government to address expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies that's spiking premiums, but they didn't quite get there.FADEL: OK, but that was the main demand, right? I mean, how...GRISALES: Right.FADEL: ...Did this group of Democrats get to yes if they didn't get their top demand to protect Affordable Care Act credits?GRISALES: Right. They've been separately negotiating with Republicans for some time now, and they said that they could not get this deal from Republicans. They were pretty adamant. So the impacts and the chaos growing for federal agencies or workers, and then we saw flight delays and cancellations across the country - this also created new pressures for Democrats, these who defected. And the group also argued that growing numbers of people were being hurt, and the plan includes a long list of wins for their party. So in the end, seven Democrats and one independent joined Republicans to get this plan across this key procedural hurdle.FADEL: But they broke with leadership, right? And most Democrats voted no. And what did the rest of the party say then about what they did?GRISALES: Well, some were pretty furious. This defection came after an hourslong meeting for Senate Democrats. And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who voted no - he argued that regardless of the outcome, Democrats have put a spotlight on health care.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHUCK SCHUMER: We are going to fight legislatively, fight back home, fight in the courts and bring this fight in the elections.GRISALES: You could also say there's a political calculus here with Schumer and other leaders voting against this deal. They're hoping they're insulated from blowback from their party, but that remains to be seen after Democrats left that meeting last night. I heard the angriest response from Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren. She said this was a terrible mistake. And when she was asked if Schumer did a good job leading the caucus on this, she said, I think the American people want us to stand and fight for health care. Obviously, that is not happening. So this was always going to be an ugly ending. Democrats could come out of this pretty bruised, but some would argue Republicans will not be left unscathed either.FADEL: So what happens next? When can travelers expect to see their flights resume and people's food benefits to be paid in full?GRISALES: Well, the Senate still has a few more hurdles before final passage. But if that happens, the House will take it up in the coming days, and we could see those flights and food benefits get back to business in the coming week or so.FADEL: That's NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales.

    "body": "\n      After 40 days and 40 nights, a bipartisan group of Senate Democrats and Republicans reached a deal to reopen the government. But some oppose the deal because it doesn't reduce health care costs.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  After 40 days of a government shutdown, the longest in U.S. history, there was movement in Congress to end it. Late last night, seven Senate Democrats and one independent broke with party leadership and voted with Senate Republicans to pass a bill that would eventually fund the government through January. The House would still need to come back into session and pass new legislation in order to end this shutdown. And many Democrats there are opposed to the deal. In a few minutes, we'll hear from Representative Ritchie Torres of New York about why he calls it a surrender. But we start with NPR's Luke Garrett, who was on Capitol Hill and at the White House yesterday and joins me now. Good morning.LUKE GARRETT, BYLINE: Good morning.FADEL: What's in the deal, and how did it come together?GARRETT: So, in short, moderate Democrats broke rank and made a deal with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and the White House. Senators Jeanne Shaheen, Angus King and Maggie Hassan led the negotiations for the last few weeks, according to a source familiar but not authorized to share these details publicly. And the agreement is set to do three things. First, fund the government until January 30. The second part of the deal is passage of an appropriations package that reverses all government shutdown firings and supports food stamp funding through next September. The deal also assures a vote on the Affordable Care Act by the second week of December, but that's not part of the actual legislative text. And it's this last point that has many Democrats opposed to the deal and, frankly, frustrated.FADEL: Yeah. I mean, that was their main demand. What have we heard from them, and what are they saying?GARRETT: So Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, for one, is really disappointed and does not support this among - with many other Senate Democrats. They oppose it, because, as you said, this deal doesn't include direct language on the health care tax credit. It's the very reason Democrats voted to shut down the government for weeks now. Many House Democrats are also weighing in. Representative Greg Casar of Texas posted on X, this deal is a, quote, \"betrayal\" and a, quote, \"capitulation\" because it doesn't directly and immediately reduce these health care costs.FADEL: So how are these dealmaking Democrats that voted with the Republicans responding to this?GARRETT: So late last night, these Democrats really held a press conference explaining themselves. Senator Shaheen of New Hampshire said they got the best possible deal out of the GOP.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEANNE SHAHEEN: Republicans control the White House, the Senate and the House. And they made clear over a period of weeks, including just this week, that this was as far as they would go as part of the shutdown talks.GARRETT: When asked why now, after blocking government funding for 40 days, Maine Senator Angus King said waiting just wasn't working. Bottom line, these Democrats said they believe the shutdown was hurting the country too much, and they got real concessions you know, from Republicans. But they're betting big that enough Republicans will cross the aisle in December to pass an extension on health care tax credits. That's definitely not a certainty.FADEL: Yeah. OK, given this deal, how close is a reopening of the government? And that would mean food benefits flowing again, air traffic controllers getting paid.GARRETT: So after arriving back at the White House last night, Trump said he was hopeful the shutdown would end soon. Here he is after stepping off Marine One.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It looks like we're getting close to the shutdown ending. You'll know very soon.GARRETT: But the reality is there's still several procedural steps to get through, you know, this process, even in the Senate. And the House hasn't approved it yet, either. The lower chamber is set to vote on reopening the government later this week, but we haven't heard one word from Speaker Mike Johnson, who earlier this week said, you know, he made no promises about a health care vote. So we're at least a few days away from flights restarting as normal and food benefits getting back on track.FADEL: That's NPR's Luke Garrett.

U.S. pardon attorney Ed Martin posted the pardons on X, clearing people for, quote, \"conduct relating to their efforts to expose voting fraud.\" Rudy Giuliani and former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows are among those named in the proclamation. And joining us now to talk about this is NPR voting correspondent Miles Parks. Hi, Miles.MILES PARKS, BYLINE: Hey, Leila.FADEL: OK. So this pardon applies to at least 77 people. Are there any other notable names here?PARKS: Yes. So many of the names will be familiar, both to people who were paying attention after the 2020 election and to anyone who monitored the many investigations into the January 6 riot. Attorneys Sidney Powell, Kenneth Chesebro, Jenna Ellis and John Eastman are all named. And then the rest of the names are names you may not have heard of. These are people who met oftentimes in secret after the election in 2020, to make up alternate slates of electors that could have potentially impacted the correct certification of the presidential election in 2020. Importantly, though, none of these people have actually been charged with federal crimes. Many have been charged in state court, but a federal pardon has no impact on those cases.FADEL: OK. So where do the cases stand against the people who have been charged in their states?PARKS: So many of them have run into roadblocks.FADEL: OK.PARKS: In Michigan, a month or two ago, a judge recently dismissed charges against 15 people there who signed false electoral certificates. The case in Georgia was severely undermined after a court ruled that the DA's office should be removed from that case. And then the biggest case of all here, that did get tossed, was in federal court. That was the federal election interference charges that were dropped against President Trump after he was reelected. So all of this adds up to a landscape where very few people have faced criminal repercussions for the plot to overturn the 2020 election, and these pardons just kind of guarantee that.FADEL: OK. It's been five years, and President Trump still seems very focused on the 2020 election and claiming it was fraudulent. Where does this go from here?PARKS: I mean, looking forward, Trump and people in his circle are using their claims about election fraud as justification for all sorts of federal election policies that frankly would have been unheard of under many other Republican presidents, considering how ardently that party has fought for states to have control over their elections, not the federal government. We've seen the Justice Department make unprecedented requests for election data, as well as to investigate local voting machines, and the president has tried to enact change with executive orders, with an executive order in March that mostly at this point, has been blocked by the courts. But I should note that today's pardon does seem to indicate that the president is still taking cues from the, you know, fraud-focused, the election denial wing of the Republican Party.FADEL: Right.PARKS: For instance, Cleta Mitchell, who's a Republican attorney who's built a sort of grassroots network of election integrity groups across the country, she'd been posting on X a bunch recently, explicitly asking for these pardons. And this morning, she called the news an answer to those prayers.FADEL: Has the White House said anything about these pardons yet?PARKS: White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has confirmed the pardons in a statement to NPR. She said, \"these great Americans were persecuted and put through hell by the Biden administration for challenging an election, which is the cornerstone of democracy,\" end quote. I should note that no one in the administration in the five years since this election has provided proof that the election was actually tainted by widespread fraud, and numerous audits and investigations have confirmed the results of the 2020 election.FADEL: Right, of course. NPR's Miles Parks. Thank you, Miles.PARKS: Thanks, Leila.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Steve Inskeep speaks with Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada about the latest efforts in the Senate to end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Democratic Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada was among eight Democrats and independents who voted in favor of the deal to end the shutdown. She had, in fact, voted to open the government sooner. Senator, good morning.CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: Good morning.INSKEEP: What, if anything, did Democrats gain from the past six weeks of the government shutdown?CORTEZ MASTO: Well, let me just say a couple of things. One, and as you pointed out, I was one that have voted that we shouldn't have shut it down. But let me just say this. I can honestly say that the Democrats are united in this fight, which is a fight against the bad policies of this administration and to address the looming health care crisis that we have. You know, Jacky and I are fighting for Nevadans, and we have different tactics about doing it, but this is a fight to ensure that people have access to health care and can afford it.We are seeing people in our states - premiums are increasing already. And so there are many people that rely on this health care. I know families that need this health care because of children with rare diseases. And so it is important that we continue this fight. And let me just say this. Democrats are united that we need to get this done because we are seeing this in our states and all states across the country, including in Republican states. And if Republicans choose not to come to the table to address this issue, then they own the disastrous premium increases that this will bring. And they have to be responsible to their constituents why they are not addressing the affordability issue that is an issue in this state for many families and individuals across the country.INSKEEP: You mentioned Jacky. Of course, you mean Jacky Rosen, your fellow Nevadan...CORTEZ MASTO: Correct.INSKEEP: ...Senator who had been voting differently on this. It sounds like, though, based on your votes, you did feel that the Democrats picked the wrong tactic, the wrong fight.CORTEZ MASTO: No. Listen, I'm not going to criticize my colleagues because we are all in this fight against the bad policies of this administration. Everybody's going to have a way of fighting in their states and showing that fight, and we have to. It's - what this administration is doing with the tariffs - and a failure to - lack of - address the affordability issue in this country is important. We - I see it in my state all the time. And this administration said on Day 1 that they were going to address the cost and have done nothing.And I've got small businesses closing. I've got people that can't afford groceries at the grocery store or clothes for their kids when they get ready to go to school. And now we have a health care crisis that we could address simply by coming to the table and passing these subsidies, but the Republicans and this administration refuse to do so. And let me just be very clear...INSKEEP: I just want to ask though...CORTEZ MASTO: But let me just be very clear...INSKEEP: Very quickly.CORTEZ MASTO: ...Because these are the policies of this administration. They would rather harm people. They would rather make sure that people can't access SNAP programs, essential funding and food, just to harm individuals to prove a point and play politics. That's where the Democrats are here.INSKEEP: I want to acknowledge that in this battle, you've had an opportunity to raise these issues. It's created a lot of political conflict and a lot of news stories, and there's been a lot of discussions. So you did get that out of this. However, elsewhere in the program today, we spoke with Congressman Ritchie Torres of New York. He's in the House of Representatives. He is not at all in favor of this agreement. And I said, well, we're going to hear from Senator Cortez Masto, who's voting for it. What question would you have for her? And here's what he said.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)RITCHIE TORRES: I would ask, why does the deal fail to extend the tax credits for 24 million Americans? I mean, that was the whole objective that Democrats were pursuing. By that standard, it's not mission accomplished. It's mission failure.INSKEEP: Is he right?CORTEZ MASTO: Again, it goes back to this idea of where we think our tactics can be as still fighting for Americans. Let me just - let me counter that with this. Governor Spanberger just won - governor-elect - in Virginia.INSKEEP: Right.CORTEZ MASTO: And she won on the issue of affordability. And she said the government needs to be open. And she focused on the affordability issue not because the government was shut down. So we can still - and this is a misnomer, and I just have to say this so many times. We can have the government open, fight for people to make sure that our kids are not dragged into losing access to SNAP - essential SNAP funds and meals, or seniors lose their meals. We can make sure they have those and still fight on the affordability issue. And by the way, this is on the Republicans. We've got a vote in December...INSKEEP: Right.CORTEZ MASTO: ...To decide whether or not they're going to be with us to address this issue on the premium tax credit. Now they're going to own it. They can step up to the plate and help us address this issue for Americans across the country who are losing access to health care or they could be a part of the problem.INSKEEP: You've been talking to Republicans. Do you think that any of them might vote with you in December?CORTEZ MASTO: We're going to find out. Let me say, we're going to find out. There's - we will find out. Part of the agreement that we entered into, and you heard it, was leader Thune said he would come to the table on a health care once the government was open, and now he's got to follow through. He gave us a December date. And now they've got to follow through. And the American public will see where, at the end of the day, Republicans lie. Do they really care about this issue, or do they want to cause more affordability issues for Americans across the country?INSKEEP: I want to ask about the side issues that are part of this agreement. There are some appropriations bills that go through. There's a provision that furloughed workers will be paid, which, under the law, they already should have been paid. Fired workers will be rehired. Mass firings will not continue. These are the agreements, but it now goes to the administration, which has taken the view that any restriction on the president's power to fire people is unconstitutional and that they will ignore it. That has been their position in the past. Given that, is that part of the agreement worthless?CORTEZ MASTO: Well, that's like saying, Steve, then, because - and I agree with you. This administration is lawless, and they ignore everything. But then that's like saying, then we shouldn't just do anything. Then we shouldn't do our jobs here, and we shouldn't appropriate. We shouldn't come together to demand certain things in the appropriations bills or demand from our Republican colleagues any type of guarantee from them that they will stand united with us because the administration's not going to be there. Then we might as well just shut down and give them everything. So this is part of holding Congress' role here and our Republicans accountable. They've said that they're going to stand with us on these issues and fight for federal workers. And now they're - we'll see if they stand true to that.INSKEEP: Oh.CORTEZ MASTO: They've got to be a part of the solution and be a backstop to this administration.INSKEEP: You think that the Republicans who are voting with you here will not only agree to these measures, but actually try to do something if the administration ignores them?CORTEZ MASTO: I am telling you that what the Republicans have agreed to is just what you talked about - the rifts and the reductions in force and to protect that workforce. If they go back on their word in this agreement, then the American public will know where the Republicans who are control in Congress - where they stand. Do they really care about Americans at the end of the day and addressing the affordability issue and making sure people have jobs?INSKEEP: Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada. It's a pleasure talking with you. Thank you so much.CORTEZ MASTO: Thanks, Steve.INSKEEP: Have a good morning.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The Syrian president entered the building through West Executive Avenue, adjacent to the White House, rather than on the West Wing driveway used for other foreign leaders' arrivals. He left the White House about two hours later and greeted a throng of supporters gathered outside before getting into his motorcade.   It marked the first visit to the White House by a Syrian head of state since the Middle Eastern country gained independence from France in 1946 and comes after the U.S. lifted sanctions imposed on Syria during the decades the country was ruled by the Assad family. Al-Sharaa led the rebel forces that toppled Syrian President Bashar Assad last December and was named the country's interim leader in January.   \n   Trump and al-Sharaa — who once had ties to al-Qaida and had a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head — first met in May in Saudi Arabia. At the time, the U.S. president described al-Sharaa as a \"young, attractive guy. Tough guy. Strong past, very strong past. Fighter.\" It was the first official encounter between the U.S. and Syria since 2000, when then-President Bill Clinton met with Hafez Assad, the father of Bashar Assad.   White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday's visit is \"part of the president's efforts in diplomacy to meet with anyone around the world in the pursuit of peace.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa looks on during a press conference in Ankara, Turkey, Feb. 4.\n                \n                    Francisco Seco/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Francisco Seco/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Trump, a Republican, has recently said that al-Sharaa is \"doing a very good job so far\" and that a \"lot of progress has been made with Syria\" since the U.S. eased sanctions.   \n   One official with knowledge of the administration's plans said Syria's entry into the global coalition fighting the Islamic State group will allow it to work more closely with U.S. forces, although the new Syrian military and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the country's northeast had already been fighting the group.   Before al-Sharaa's arrival in the U.S., the United Nations Security Council voted to lift sanctions on the Syrian president and other government officials in a move that the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Mike Waltz, said was a strong sign that Syria is in a new era since the fall of Assad.   \n   Al-Sharaa comes into the meeting with his own priorities. He wants a permanent repeal of sanctions that punished Syria for widespread allegations of human rights abuses by Assad's government and security forces. While the Caesar Act sanctions are currently waived by Trump, a permanent repeal would require Congress to act.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Motiah Boustany, of Charlestown, W.Va., holds a banner depicting Syria's President Ahmed al-Sharaa outside of the White House, as al-Sharaa meets with President Donald Trump, Monday, in Washington.\n                \n                    Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n    \n\n   \n   One option is a proposal from Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, that would end the sanctions without any conditions. The other was drafted by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a hawkish Trump ally who wants to set conditions for a sanctions repeal that would be reviewed every six months.   But advocates argue that any repeal with conditions would prevent companies from investing in Syria because they would fear potentially being sanctioned. Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, likened it to a \"hanging shadow that paralyzes any initiatives for our country.\"\n",

It comes after recent clemency grants from Trump to former U.S. Rep. George Santos and an ex-CEO of a cryptocurrency exchange.   \n   While former President Joe Biden still holds the record of 4,245 clemency actions, Trump's second-term pardons and commutations are notable for their political and personal connections to the president, says Bernadette Meyler, a professor of constitutional law at Stanford University.   \"There's more of a sense of the insider pardon than we've seen previously,\" Meyler said.   In mid-October, Trump commuted the prison sentence of Santos, the disgraced New York Republican who pleaded guilty to wire fraud and identity theft last year.   Days later the president handed a full and unconditional pardon to Changpeng Zhao, the former CEO of Binance, who pleaded guilty to money laundering charges. Binance has ties to the Trump family's cryptocurrency business, but Trump said in an interview with 60 Minutes that he does not know who Zhao is.   \n   U.S. presidents are given broad authority to nullify convictions or sentences for federal crimes without the involvement of Congress or the Supreme Court. The legal principle is a holdover from English law, in which the king had what was known as the \"prerogative of mercy\" as early as the seventh century.   While Trump has granted clemency to a wide range of people convicted of federal crimes, from nonviolent drug offenders to white-collar criminals, his first term in office was also marked by several notable pardons of political allies and grants of clemency to people whose cases were advocated for by celebrities or friends. Both of those trends have been amplified during his second term, Meyler said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Former U.S. Rep. George Santos arrives at federal court in Central Islip, N.Y., for sentencing on April 25. His sentenced was commuted by Trump in October.\n                \n                    Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n    \n\n   \n   \"He's much more explicit about making political statements through the use of the pardon power,\" Meyler said of Trump's second-term pardons and commutations. She said that includes granting clemency for people who have supported his political career as well as public statements he's made about why a particular crime shouldn't be punished.   Trump's pardons align with his politics …   Trump is by no means the first president to show leniency to a political ally. President Bill Clinton pardoned Mark Rich, a former hedge-fund manager whose ex-wife had donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Democratic National Committee, the Clinton Presidential Library and Hillary Clinton's New York Senate campaign. And President George W. Bush commuted the sentence of Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney.   \n   During his first four years in office, Trump pardoned his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, commuted the sentence of his friend and political confidant Roger Stone and pardoned Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law, Jared.   In his second term, Trump \"has taken the same norm-busting approach to pardons as he has in other areas,\" Jeffrey Crouch, a professor of American politics at American University, told NPR via email.   \n   Crouch pointed to Trump's move on inauguration day this year to pardon some 1,500 defendants (and commute the sentences of several others) convicted of taking part in the Jan. 6, 2021, siege on the U.S. Capitol in support of Trump's effort to overturn his electoral loss the previous fall. For comparison, Trump granted a total of 238 acts of clemency in his first term, according to the Pew Research Center.   Crouch said many presidents have waited until the \"lame duck\" period at the end of their terms to issue potentially controversial clemency grants — but not Trump. \"He did not shy away from granting early or controversial pardons and commutations in his first term, either.\"   Politics have always been entwined with the U.S. clemency process, but past presidents have often used pardons as a way to heal political divisions. George Washington pardoned some of those involved in the Whiskey Rebellion, while Jimmy Carter granted a blanket pardon to people who had evaded service in the Vietnam War.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Trump pardoned former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, who pleaded guilty to money laundering charges, in October. Binance has ties to the Trump family's cryptocurrency business, but Trump said in an interview with 60 Minutes that he doesn't know who Zhao is.\n                \n                    Jason Redmond/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jason Redmond/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The Trump administration has used clemency to benefit some of its political backers. In May, Trump pardoned former Virginia Sheriff Scott Jenkins, an ardent Trump supporter who was convicted of taking bribes from local businessmen in exchange for auxiliary deputy badges. The day the pardon was announced, U.S. Pardon Attorney Ed Martin posted on X: \"No MAGA left behind.\" And when Trump pardoned Santos earlier this month, the president said on social media that Santos had \"the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\"   \n   The founders envisioned impeachment as one check on what is otherwise a nearly absolute presidential power, but Trump has faced virtually no criticism from fellow Republicans for his pardons and commutations.   Past presidents have also taken flak from voters for their clemency decisions. Gerald Ford's approval rating fell by more than 20 points after he pardoned Richard Nixon in 1974, and he lost the presidential election two years later to Carter.   … and his political frustrations   While Santos and Jenkins are both Trump supporters, they also fall into another category of criminal that comes up with some regularity in Trump's clemency choices: public officials of both parties convicted of corruption.   \n   Trump in February issued a full pardon for former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, after having commuted Blagojevich's prison sentence during his first term as president. Former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld received his own pardon in May following his conviction on federal bribery and attempted extortion charges in 2022. Both men are Democrats.   Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington said in June that Trump had pardoned a total of 16 former elected officials convicted of corruption charges.   Meyler, the Stanford professor, said Trump, who has characterized his own recent prosecutions as politically motivated, may view the cases of political corruption against other politicians as similarly unjust.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich signs an autograph outside his Chicago home after speaking to the press about his pardon from President Trump in February.\n                \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Scott Olson/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   \"Maybe it's not too much of a stretch to think that Trump feels that he was prosecuted for similar kinds of offenses and then is kind of looking out at the landscape of political figures who have been prosecuted and, you know, potentially identifies with the plight of some of them,\" she said.   In an emailed statement to NPR, the White House contrasted Trump's approach to the clemency process with former President Joe Biden's, alluding to criticism from Trump and his allies over Biden's use of an autopen to issue pardons and sign other official documents. (In June, Trump ordered an investigation into Biden's use of the autopen.)   \n   \"It's not difficult to be more involved in the pardon process when your predecessor was an autopen,\" said White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson. \"President Trump has exercised his constitutional authority to issue pardons and commutations for a variety of individuals.\"   \n   Jackson also alluded to the lame-duck pardon Biden granted to his son Hunter, as well as Biden's commutations of 37 federal death row prisoners. Biden said he made those commutations due to his objections to capital punishment at the federal level — and his worry that Trump would lift the moratorium he put on federal executions.   \"And the only pardons anyone should be critical of are from President Autopen, who pardoned and commuted sentences of violent criminals including child killers and mass murderers – and that's not to mention the proactive pardons he 'signed' for his family members like Hunter on his way out the door,\" Jackson added.   What is the clemency process under Trump? Getting his ear may help   Though it's not the only path to securing a pardon or commutation, the official process for seeking clemency is to submit a formal application to the U.S. pardon attorney.   \n   Martin, the current pardon attorney, was appointed by Trump after the president withdrew his nomination to be the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia in the face of Republican opposition. The Trump administration fired the former pardon attorney, Liz Oyer, in March after she refused to restore the gun rights of actor and Trump supporter Mel Gibson, who had been convicted of domestic violence.   Mark Osler, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas, said it's unclear whether the formal process is currently resulting in clemency grants in any significant numbers. \"Right now we know that there's still a mailbox, and that there are petitions going into that mailbox,\" he said. \"What we don't know is what happens after that.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                In 2018, Trump commuted the sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, after she served 21 years in prison for cocaine trafficking. He later pardoned Johnson and made her his \"pardon czar.\"\n                \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   Osler said concerns about the clemency application process — or lack thereof — predated Trump's second term. He said Biden also issued pardons to political allies and personal connections he thought Trump may target, including his son Hunter.   \n   \"So those norms were being strained and broken before Trump took office, but he certainly has continued that trend,\" he said.   Osler, who runs a clinic where he and his students file petitions for people seeking clemency, said it's raising questions among those seeking clemency about their odds of success by following the traditional path to obtain a pardon or commutation.   \n   \"I think people are focusing very much on how upset they are about who's receiving grants,\" he said. \"But we need to focus as well on who's not getting grants — those people who have done a long term in prison, who have rehabilitated themselves, often done incredible things in prison. And they're being ignored in their plea for mercy.\"   Trump appointed Alice Johnson as his \"pardon czar\" in February. Johnson was pardoned for a nonviolent drug offense by Trump during his first term after her story got the attention and advocacy of celebrities such as Kim Kardashian.   Johnson said she was going to \"fight for those who are still incarcerated, who don't have a voice like I have right now.\" She told Fox News in May that she'd sent more than 100 clemency petitions to the White House and \"over 46 people really were able to get a second chance in life.\"\n",

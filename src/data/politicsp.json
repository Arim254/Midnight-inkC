But his remarks weaved wildly to include grievances he first raised behind closed doors in his first term in 2018 — and later denied saying — asking why the U.S. doesn't have more immigrants from Scandinavia.   \"Why is it we only take people from s—-hole countries, right?\" Trump said onstage. \"Why can't we have some people from Norway, Sweden, just a few?\"   \n   Trump said he objected to taking immigrants from \"hellholes like Afghanistan, Haiti, Somalia and many other countries.\" He added for emphasis that those places \"are a disaster, right? Filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime.\"   Tuesday's gathering in the swing state — and in a competitive House district — was an official White House event, yet it seemed more like one of his signature campaign rallies that his chief of staff said he would hold regularly ahead of next year's midterms. But instead of being in an arena that could draw several thousand attendees, it was held in a conference center ballroom at the Mount Airy Casino Resort in Mount Pocono, a small town of about 3,000 residents.   Voters starting to blame lasting inflation on Republicans   Following dismal results for Republicans in last month's off-cycle elections, the White House has sought to convince voters that the economy will emerge stronger next year and that any anxieties over inflation have nothing to do with Trump.   \n   He displayed a chart comparing price increases under his predecessor, Joe Biden, to prices under his own watch to argue his case. But the overall inflation rate has climbed since he announced broad tariffs in April and left many Americans worried about their grocery, utility and housing bills.   \"I have no higher priority than making America affordable again,\" Trump said. \"They caused the high prices and we're bringing them down.\"   As the president spoke, his party's political vulnerabilities were further seen as Miami voters chose Eileen Higgins to be their first Democratic mayor in nearly 30 years. Higgins defeated the Trump-endorsed Republican Emilio Gonzalez.   \n   The president's reception in the county hosting his Tuesday rally showed he could still appeal to the base, but it was unable to settle questions of whether he could hold together his 2024 coalition. Monroe County flipped to Trump last year after having backed Biden in 2020, helping the Republican win the swing state of Pennsylvania and return to the White House after a four-year hiatus.   As home to the Pocono Mountains, the county has largely relied on tourism for skiing, hiking, hunting and other activities as a source of jobs. Its proximity to New York City — under two hours by car — has also attracted people seeking more affordable housing.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Donald Trump speaks at the Mount Airy Casino Resort in Mount Pocono, Pa., Tuesday, Dec. 9, 2025.\n                \n                    Matt Rourke/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Matt Rourke/AP\n    \n\n   \n   In Monroe County, people agree that prices are a problem   But what seems undeniable — even to Trump supporters in Monroe County — is that inflation seems to be here to stay.   Lou Heddy, a retired maintenance mechanic who voted for Trump last year, said he's noticed in the past month alone that his and his wife's grocery bills have risen from $175 to $200, and he's not sure Trump can bring food prices down.   \"Once the prices get up for food, they don't ever come back down. That's just the way I feel. I don't know how the hell he would do it,\" said Heddy, 72.   But Suzanne Vena, a Democratic voter, blames Trump's tariffs for making life more expensive, as she struggles with rising bills for food, rent and electricity on a fixed income. She remembers Trump saying that he would stop inflation.   \"That's what we were originally told,\" said Vena, 66. \"Did I believe it? That's another question. I did not.\"   The area Trump visited could help decide control of the House in next year's midterm elections.   Trump held his rally in a congressional district held by first-term Republican Rep. Rob Bresnahan, who is a top target of Democrats. Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti, a Democrat, is running for the nomination to challenge him.   \n   Speaking to the crowd before Trump, Bresnahan said the administration was working to lower costs, but voters \"aren't asking for partisan arguments — they're asking for results.\"   It's not clear if Trump can motivate voters in Monroe County to show up in next year's election if they're worried about inflation.   Nick Riley, 38, said he's cutting back on luxuries, like going out to eat, as he absorbs higher bills for food and electricity and is having a hard time finding a good deal on a used car. Riley voted for Trump in 2020, but he sat out the 2024 election and plans to do so again next year.   \"We're all broke. It doesn't matter whether you support Republicans or support Democrats,\" Riley said. \"We're all broke, and we're all feeling it.\"   Trump to start holding more rallies before midterm elections   White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said on the online conservative talk show \"The Mom View\" that Trump would be on the campaign trail next year to engage supporters who otherwise might sit out a congressional race.   Wiles, who helped manage Trump's 2024 campaign, said most administrations try to localize midterm elections and keep the president out of the race, but she intends to do the opposite of that.   \"We're actually going to turn that on its head,\" Wiles said, \"and put him on the ballot because so many of those low-propensity voters are Trump voters.\"   \n   The challenge for Trump is how to address the concerns of voters about the economy while simultaneously claiming that the economy is enjoying a historic boom.   Asked on a Politico podcast how he'd rate the economy, Trump leaned into grade inflation by answering \"A-plus,\" only to then amend his answer to \"A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.\"   Trump says economy is strong, but Americans should buy fewer dolls   The U.S. economy has shown signs of resilience with the stock market up this year and overall growth looking solid for the third quarter. But many Americans see the prices of housing, groceries, education, electricity and other basic needs as swallowing up their incomes, a dynamic that the Trump administration has said it expects to fade next year with more investments in artificial intelligence and manufacturing.   \n   So far, the public has been skeptical about Trump's economic performance. Just 33% of U.S. adults approve of Trump's handling of the economy, according to a November survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.   But Trump indicated that his tariffs and other policies were helping industries such as the steel sector. He said those industries mattered for the country as he then specifically told Americans that they should buy fewer pencils and dolls from overseas.   \"You don't need 37 dolls for your daughter,\" he told the crowd. \"Two or three is nice.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      President Trump weaved through topics at a rally in Pennsylvania Tuesday night, calling affordability a Democratic \"hoax\" and sharing his grievances about immigrants.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Trump told a rally crowd in Pennsylvania Tuesday night that he has no higher priority than making America affordable again.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They caused the high prices, and we're bringing them down. It's a simple message.(CHEERING)TRUMP: If I had one message tonight - you know, this is being covered, like all over the world. This is crazy, 'cause I haven't made a speech in a little while. You know, when you win, you say, oh, I can now rest.FADEL: He talked about a whole lot of other things, too.MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  And NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith is here to help us decipher what the president had to say. Good morning, Tam.TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning.MARTIN: So did the president have some new message or some policy prescriptions for Americans who are upset about the high cost of living?KEITH: The banners on the stage said, lower prices, bigger paychecks. And that was the message in essence. Trump insists prices are coming down and brought up on the stage a handful of people who stand to benefit from the tax cuts he signed into law earlier this year. There were no new policies and not a lot of new material, but if you go to see the Village People, you'd be disappointed not to hear \"Y.M.C.A.\" So Trump spent much of this 90-minute speech going through the greatest hits, talking about how members of his Cabinet are straight out of central casting, denigrating Somali immigrants, weaving all over the place, joking about how it would be boring if he stuck to the teleprompter, and occasionally making it back to the economy.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Lower prices, bigger paychecks. We're getting inflation, we're crushing it. And you're getting much higher wages. I mean, the only thing that's really going up, big, it's called the stock market, and your 401(k) is going up.MARTIN: OK. That might be true. Stock values are up. But a lot of people, actually, more than a third of Americans, don't have money in the stock market.KEITH: Yeah. And as our friends at marketplace always say, the stock market is not the economy. A recent Fox News poll found three-quarters of voters view the economy negatively, and 2-to-1, they blame Trump for the current economy rather than former President Biden. The economy used to be Trump's strength, but at the moment, it's a major weakness, and Democrats are certainly making the most of it. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro posted on social media that Trump spent his speech, quote, \"telling Pennsylvanians not to believe what they can see with their own two eyes - the skyrocketing cost of living and rising prices at the grocery store.\"MARTIN: So how is the president squaring the sour mood that voters are in with his pitch that he has ushered in a golden age for this country?KEITH: He's not really. Take this from an interview he did this week with Politico's Dasha Burns.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DASHA BURNS: I wonder what grade you would give your economy.TRUMP: A-plus.BURNS: A-plus?TRUMP: Yeah. A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.KEITH: You know, Trump typically has strong instincts for appealing to his base, but he does risk looking out of touch here.MARTIN: And how does he respond when confronted with those concerns?KEITH: Last night, yet again, he mocked the preoccupation with affordability.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: They have a new word. You know, they always have a hoax. The new word is affordability.KEITH: He says that he inherited a mess. In other words, don't blame me, blame the former guy. And he says things are already cheaper. In particular, he talks a lot about gas prices. According to GasBuddy, prices are down about 8 cents on average a gallon from a year ago. But that's not really enough savings to make up for higher grocery prices and utility bills and health care costs.MARTIN: That is NPR's Tamara Keith. Tam, thank you.KEITH: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Eileen Higgins is also the first Democrat in the position in nearly 30 years.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Miami has a new mayor-elect, and a history-making one at that, when voters there elected the city's first female mayor last night, Eileen Higgins, a former county commissioner. She's also the first Democrat to hold the seat in nearly 30 years. She beat Republican Emilio Gonzalez, who had the support of President Trump. For more on this, we turn now to Joshua Ceballos with member station WLRN. Good morning, Joshua.JOSHUA CEBALLOS, BYLINE: Good morning, Michel.MARTIN: So tell us more about last night's election results. I understand you were at the Higgins watch party last night. What was it like?CEBALLOS: Yeah. It was a really exciting moment. I mean, Eileen Higgins won by 19 percentage points against her opponent, Emilio Gonzalez. I was there at the watch party at the Miami Woman's Club, and there was, like, palpable excitement. You could tell that people felt this was a huge moment not just for the city, but for the rest of the country. Even though this was just a local mayors race, it is being celebrated nationally as a big win for Democrats.MARTIN: You know, the mayor's office is technically nonpartisan. At least, the race is technically nonpartisan. So were there local issues that dominated, or was it always a national race?CEBALLOS: Yeah. I mean, funny enough, the candidates were pretty close on platform. They both talked about bringing order to City Hall, which has had a reputation for being pretty dysfunctional because of some political drama. They both talked about addressing Miami's high cost of living, which I think was top of mind for a lot of voters I spoke to throughout the election. And Higgins ran on bread-and-butter issues at the local level - affordability, transit, protecting the local environment. But she also made certain nods to more national and statewide issues, like protecting the LGBTQ+ community and being a home for migrants. Gonzalez has not held elected office, so there wasn't a legislative record he could point to, but his platform included rolling back property taxes, which is a line that local Republicans in Florida have been pushing.MARTIN: How are both parties reacting to this? So let's start with the Democrats.CEBALLOS: Yeah. The party sees this as a huge win and a real response to President Trump's policies, particularly on immigration. After Higgins' victory, I spoke with Laura Kelley, who's the chair of the Miami-Dade Democratic Party. She said this win was a rebuke of Trump and a sign that the Democratic Party is not dead in Florida.LAURA KELLEY: It speaks to the moment. It speaks to what the country is feeling. And I hope that our elected representatives in Tallahassee and in Washington, D.C., are listening to us in Miami and in Miami Beach and they make different choices.CEBALLOS: Both candidates tried to run a fairly nonpartisan race, but they couldn't help things becoming pretty partisan when Trump endorsed Gonzalez. My colleague Daniel Rivero was at Gonzalez's watch party, and local Republicans told him they believe this is a bad sign for their party going into the next year's midterm elections.MARTIN: You know, Miami is a majority Latino city. It's, like, something like 70% Latino. Does this say anything about the Latino vote writ large? Does this signal anything about a wider trend heading into these midterms next year?CEBALLOS: That is the big question. You know, experts I spoke to were watching this race to see if the Latino vote would shift from being overwhelmingly Republican after the first year of President Trump's new term. Many pockets of Miami were staunch Trump supporters in the last few elections. But - so this may result - this result might signal a turn. There's a sense that president's immigration policies, like ICE detentions and rising cost of living, have perhaps soured some voters on Trump. And I should note that this - that Eileen Higgins is the first non-Hispanic to hold the office since 1996.MARTIN: That is Joshua Ceballos with WLRN in Miami. Joshua, thank you.CEBALLOS: Thank you very much.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Affordability was a huge theme of Trump's campaign and is top of mind for the GOP as he heads to Pennsylvania for a rally. How are Pennsylvanians feeling, and can the GOP salvage its economic message?   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  Life has gotten very expensive for Americans - food prices, utility bills, health care costs. So it is no surprise that affordability is becoming a campaign centerpiece for Democrats and Republicans as we start looking ahead to next year's midterms. President Trump is in the most important swing state in the country, Pennsylvania, today to try to take those issues head on, but this is a topic that in recent weeks, the president has struggled to address.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You use the word affordability. It's a Democrat hoax. They're the ones that drove the prices up.DETROW: Trump is in Monroe County, a place in northeastern Pennsylvania that backed President Biden in 2020, then swung to Trump in the 2024 election. So how are swing voters in a swing state feeling about all of this? We called up Christopher Borick, professor of political science at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and the director of the college's Institute of Public Opinion. Welcome to the show.CHRISTOPHER BORICK: Hey. Thanks, Scott.DETROW: You are the person to call when we want to know about public opinion in Pennsylvania. So let's start with kind of the basic numbers that you are seeing. How are Pennsylvanians feeling about the economy? How are they feeling about President Trump?BORICK: Yeah. Not surprisingly, Scott, they mirror lots of what we see nationally. Pennsylvanians are not in a good mood regarding the economy, the direction of the nation as a whole. And that's reflected in their appraisals of President Trump. His job approval numbers are in the low 40s, which, again, mirror what's happening nationally. It's not the same environment that he found just a year ago in the commonwealth when he was able to carry the state for the second out of three attempts here.DETROW: In terms of the numbers you're seeing, approval ratings, things like that, how much has changed or how little has changed over the past 12 months?BORICK: Well, as you know very well, Pennsylvania is a state that's always on the margin when it comes to presidential elections, and often just the smallest changes are really impactful. And so last year when the president carried Pennsylvania, he did so by, you know, a little over a point, almost two points. And therefore, his margin of error, if you will, in terms of staying above water, isn't that great. And so if you lose even 5- to 10% of the voters in the state, it's significant. And if you look at where his polls are now compared to where they were a year ago, there has been loss. And most of that loss is in terms of his handling of areas that were once a strength.DETROW: Yeah.BORICK: And those strengths are economic matters where he's seen the biggest decline in terms of how the public views him.DETROW: He, just like Joe Biden before him, would blame the economy on Donald Trump. Trump is regularly blaming the economy on Joe Biden. We are a year into this administration. Do you have any sense from what you're seeing and hearing of the limits of that kind of message?BORICK: I think it's very limited, Scott, the ability to really convince people a year in almost to his administration that this is largely the impact of the cards that he was dealt when he came into office. I think the president has got to really difficult time making that case. It's going up against what people feel and Pennsylvanians feel. And right now they don't feel good. They don't feel good about lots of things. They don't feel good about electricity prices. They don't feel good about housing prices in the area. They certainly don't feel good about health care. And while the president can craft a message that targets the Biden-era impacts, I think it's just - it's not necessarily reaching the audience in a way that's mattering for him.DETROW: You know, it's such a static political country. You talk about the fact that Pennsylvania is always on the margins, but it's a state that went for Trump, went against Trump, went for Trump again. What is the best way to think about the voters who have gone back and forth and what draws their attention, what turns them off, what wins their support?BORICK: Yeah. Scott, it's a group that I think is longing for something and not always easily defined. As you said, they've vacillated now in Pennsylvania, in places like Monroe County, Northampton County, the eastern side of the state, over the last three elections. And I think they're searching for something that's not necessarily always easily attainable. And right now, who's ever in power seems to be paying a price for that longing. It's hard to make a case, right? It's hard to make a case to voters who aren't happy that you are really doing a good job. Biden struggled. Trump struggled before him, and now Trump is struggling again. It's a big challenge to convince unhappy voters that you're doing a job that's, you know, serving their best interest.DETROW: That's Christopher Borick, professor of political science at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania, also the director of the college's Institute of Public Opinion. Thank you so much.BORICK: Hey. Thanks, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, is one of the three branches of the Homeland Security Department that deals with migration.   Traditionally, its more than 20,000 employees have focused on the various ways people can lawfully immigrate and stay in the U.S. — be that applying for asylum, a green card, citizenship, work visa, or another legal pathway.   \n   Since January, administration officials have taken an axe to that traditional mission by encouraging early retirements, shuttering collective bargaining agreements and drastically cutting back on programs that facilitate legal migration. New job postings lean into the rhetoric of hiring \"homeland defenders\" and tackling fraud.   During his Senate confirmation, USCIS director Joseph Edlow proclaimed that \"at its core, USCIS must be an immigration enforcement agency.\"   The efforts come as President Trump seeks to curb illegal immigration but also reduce legal ways to get to the U.S. and stay here, especially for certain nationalities.   It's rocking the agency from the inside, crushing morale and prompting resignations, according to current and former agency employees.   \n   With the recent changes, at least 1,300 people took the \"Fork in the Road\" resignation offer for federal employees, while others have left on their own. (Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection employees were not allowed to take the offer.)   And it's catching immigrants and their families, lawyers and advocates off guard.   \"'Am I going to get arrested?' … That's a question, regardless of their past,\" said Eric Welsh, an immigration attorney in California who helps his clients apply for various USCIS programs.   \"There really is a lot more fear and there is a lot more concern about, should we do it at all?,\" Welsh said, about people applying for legal status.   \n   Rapid changes after deadly shooting   The changes have been rapid. In recent weeks, the White House said it would re-review all approved refugee claims under the Biden administration.   After an Afghan national was charged for shooting two National Guard members in late November, the administration also halted processing green card and citizenship applications from nationals of 19 countries, including Afghanistan, and ordered retroactive reviews of already-approved applications.   \n   \"I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover,\" Trump wrote on social media after the shooting. \"Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.\"   USCIS stopped processing many immigration applications entirely, including for asylum.   \"USCIS' role in the nation's immigration system has never been more critical,\" Edlow, its director, said in a statement last week announcing a new vetting center that will conduct interviews and re-review already approved immigration applications.   \"Under President Trump, we are building more protective measures that ensure fraud, deception, and threats do not breach the integrity of our immigration system.\"   Recent policies come after a swath of other changes this year. Policy memos have emphasized that the priority for refugees is admitting those who can easily assimilate into the country, with the target demographic being white Afrikaners from South Africa.   The White House also capped refugee admissions for this fiscal year at 7,500, the lowest since the modern refugee program started in the 1980s.   \n   The agency has unveiled a longer, tougher citizenship test. It has also moved forward with a rule that would allow officers to consider an immigrant's legal use of public benefits, such as food stamps and healthcare, as a reason to deny status.   Reports of arrests and detention following routine USCIS interviews and appointments have increased fear among immigrants.   \"They're reaching deeper into the weeds of immigration policy, and they may be more successful in slowing legal immigration, which at least some members of the Trump administration have stated is their goal,\" said Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute. \"That's a pretty different stance towards immigration than we've seen over recent decades.\"   \n   In Trump's first term, the changes did not significantly curb legal migration, but that may be changing.   \"Some people, if they have a green card, might just wait to naturalize and see if they can wait for a new administration,\" Gelatt said.   USCIS leans into enforcement and policing tactics   The new administration has prioritized the agency's law enforcement work.   For example, USCIS has promoted a new role: \"homeland defenders.\"   It is unclear exactly what these positions are responsible for. USCIS said they will be \"interviewing aliens, reviewing applications, and identifying criminal or ineligible aliens.\"   The posting also specifies this position is expected to provide direct support to CBP and ICE, two agencies leading the effort to arrest, detain and deport immigrants.   The roles also seem to cater to those with backgrounds in traditional law enforcement, contrary to a background in immigration law and administrative government work that is more typical for USCIS.   \n   USCIS said it received some 35,000 applications for the role of \"homeland defender\" and has made \"hundreds\" of job offers, including to former law enforcement officials and veterans, according to a November USCIS press release.   \"USCIS is cutting bureaucratic red tape to hire fiercely dedicated, America-first patriots to serve on the frontlines and hold the line against terrorists, criminal aliens, and bad actors intent on infiltrating our nation,\" the release stated.   It also created USCIS special agents, who have law enforcement authority to carry firearms, and investigate, arrest and prosecute immigration cases. In the past, much of this would be the work of ICE or CBP, according to the release announcing the new workforce.   \"Certainly the immigration enforcement side of things that are happening has sent a message that anybody who isn't a citizen in the United States could be arrested and put into ICE detention and potentially deported,\" Gelatt said. \"That has a real chilling effect on people's willingness to interact with the government generally, and with USCIS as well.\"   \n   USCIS workers defend past enforcement   The changes are having an impact inside the agency, as workers feel out of the loop about the direction and pace of changes.   Michael Knowles was an asylum officer for 34 years and currently serves as the executive vice president of the union that represents 15,000 USCIS employees. He says morale is some of the lowest he's seen in his tenure, thanks to the termination of the union contract, a haphazard back-to-office mandate that has employees working in makeshift desks, and a lack of communication from agency leadership.   \"There are questions about what will be our mission, what will be our focus? And to that extent, we are alarmed by rhetoric,\" Knowles said. He said the agency has always enforced the nation's immigration laws when it processes applications.   \n   One USCIS refugee officer who recently departed the agency after nearly a decade said the speed of the changes \"overwhelmed\" employees, and recent changes were the last straw. The person spoke to NPR on the condition of anonymity out of concern of retaliation from the agency they hope to return to.   USCIS staffers say they have always worked hard to ensure people don't get benefits they do not qualify for, and also look for people who may be breaking the law.   So employees were upset by the administration's implication that they hadn't been doing their jobs properly for the last five years, after the White House announced all refugees admitted under in the Biden era must be reinterviewed.   \"It's going to cause a lot of confusion. It's going to cause a lot of chaos. It's going to cost a lot of money,\" the employee said. \"It seems impossible.\"   USCIS said it has paused the approvals while it \"works to ensure that all aliens from these countries are vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,\" the agency said in an emailed statement.   \n   Not \"an adversarial office\"   Beyond policy and rhetoric changes, there's been subtler signs of transformation.   Signs inside USCIS offices urge people to leave the country, mirroring the tone of a detention center, rather than that of an immigration office, according to Welsh and other lawyers.   \n   \"USCIS is not designed to be an adversarial office,\" he said. \"They're not the enforcers. They're not looking to reduce.\"   Now, he said, his clients are concerned with needing to have proof of a good moral character by providing church attendance or charitable donation history, for example.   \"It's now certainly not the kind of friendly atmosphere that we used to experience with the agency,\" Welsh said.   \n   Lawyers fear all the changes would further curb legal migration of the kind the U.S. had previously welcomed.   \"We have borders and we have benefits. So for people who deserve them or people who have earned them for various reasons, we provide them,\" Welsh said. \"If we just go into a pure enforcement mindset, then there's no happy place to be.\"   The agency did not respond to a question about whether immigrants will be deterred from pursuing legal pathways to permanent status.   \"The safety of the American people always come [sic] first,\" the agency said in its statement.\n",

These federal workers, including many attorneys, investigate family complaints of discrimination in the nation's schools as part of the department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR). They were terminated by the Trump administration in a March reduction-in-force, but the courts intervened, temporarily blocking the department from completing their terminations.   \n   That left 299 OCR employees, roughly half of its staff, in legal and professional limbo – because the department elected to place them on paid administrative leave while the legal battle plays out rather than allow them to work. Court records show 52 have since chosen to leave.   On Friday, an unknown number of the remaining 247 staffers received an email from the department. That email, which was shared with NPR by two people who received it, says that, while the Trump administration will continue its legal battle to downsize the department, \"utilizing all OCR employees, including those currently on administrative leave, will bolster and refocus efforts on enforcement activities in a way that serves and benefits parents, students, and families.\"   \n   Staff were instructed to report to their regional office on Monday, Dec. 15.   In a statement to NPR, Julie Hartman, the department's press secretary for legal affairs, confirmed that the department \"will temporarily bring back OCR staff.\"   \"The Department will continue to appeal the persistent and unceasing litigation disputes concerning the Reductions in Force,\" Hartman wrote, \"but in the meantime, it will utilize all employees currently being compensated by American taxpayers.\"   The department did not clarify how many staffers it was recalling or why it was recalling them now, after keeping them on paid administrative leave for much of the year.   \n   \"By blocking OCR staff from doing their jobs, Department leadership allowed a massive backlog of civil rights complaints to grow, and now expects these same employees to clean up a crisis entirely of the Department's own making,\" said Rachel Gittleman, president of AFGE Local 252, a union that represents many Education Department employees. \"Students, families, and schools have paid the price for this chaos.\"   The department did not respond to a request to share the current size of OCR's complaint backlog, but one department source who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by the Trump administration, told NPR that OCR now has about 25,000 pending complaints, including roughly 7,000 open investigations.   \n   Gittleman said the administration's decision to keep these OCR attorneys on paid leave \"has already wasted more than $40 million in taxpayer funds— rather than letting them do their jobs.\"   NPR could not independently verify that cost.   In October, the administration attempted to fire another 137 OCR staffers, though they were reinstated as part of a deal to end the government shutdown.   In all, just 62 employees at OCR have not received a termination notice at some point this year — about 10% of the office's January headcount.   Two days before the department notified staff they were being recalled, NPR reported on the impact these OCR cuts have had on students with disabilities and their families.   Maggie Heilman told NPR that she filed a complaint with OCR in 2024, alleging that her daughter, who has Down syndrome, was denied her right to a free, appropriate public education at school. OCR began investigating in October 2024, but it was disrupted repeatedly by the aforementioned staff cuts. Heilman's case remains one of the roughly 7,000 open investigations.   Of the administration's decision to try to cut many attorneys who protect students' civil rights, Heilman said, \"it's telling families with children like [my daughter] that their hurt doesn't matter.\"   Since Trump took office, public data shows that OCR has reached resolution agreements in 73 cases involving alleged disability discrimination. Compare that to 2024, when OCR resolved 390, or 2017, the year Trump took office during his first term, when OCR reached agreements in more than 1,000 such cases.\n",

    "body": "\n      As lawmakers debate extending federal Affordable Care Act subsidies, some states are trying to protect coverage for residents whose health care premiums could skyrocket if the tax incentives expire.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  In three weeks, federal subsidies that make it less expensive for people to buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act will expire. Congress is scheduled to vote on a proposal from Democrats to extend those subsidies this week, but it's not expected to pass. While Congress debates what policy could come next, Colorado and a few other states are trying to keep health care costs in check themselves. Here's John Daley of Colorado Public Radio.JOHN DALEY, BYLINE: Chelsey Baker-Hauck has a lot on her plate.CHELSEY BAKER-HAUCK: Well, today, I am hooked up to an IV all day and all day yesterday, getting my immunoglobulin infusion.DALEY: She spoke to me from a medical clinic in Denver. She's been battling long COVID, a heart condition and an autoimmune disease that requires treatment every two weeks.BAKER-HAUCK: Yeah. It's - I'm a lifer.DALEY: One stressor she didn't need is uncertainty about her health coverage. Baker-Hauck runs a consulting business and gets the enhanced federal tax credit to help pay for the insurance she buys through Colorado's marketplace. Last year, she paid $239 a month after getting a $313 tax credit. If Congress does not renew the subsidies, the cost of the insurance she's now shopping for is set to rise sharply.BAKER-HAUCK: It's a lot more, yeah. It's a lot more. It's more than twice what I was paying last year.DALEY: In anticipation, Colorado took steps to help protect coverage for those like Baker-Hauck.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KYLE BROWN: Today, members, we're here to proudly present House Bill 25B-1006.DALEY: Lawmakers met in a special session over the summer called by Governor Jared Polis. The Democratic majority introduced legislation. It aims to blunt the impact of the loss of the federal subsidies. Here's co-sponsor Lindsay Gilchrist.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LINDSAY GILCHRIST: This bill will provide $100 million to prevent, as best we can, the massive cost increases Coloradans will otherwise face.DALEY: It paved the way for a $100 million interest-free loan from a trust fund of unclaimed property to help reduce premium costs for consumers. Democrats passed it, over the objections of Republicans like Representative Dusty Johnson, who didn't like the way the state would pay for it.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DUSTY JOHNSON: We are passing the buck by robbing Peter or robbing the people of Colorado because this is their dollars, not government dollars. This is the people's dollars that they have the right to claim back.DALEY: But state leaders say if the enhanced tax credits aren't renewed, it'll be a disaster for the state's health system and will drive more people to become uninsured. Colorado is not the only state to take action, says Matt McGough, a policy analyst with KFF, an independent health policy group.MATT MCGOUGH: States are just trying to fill in where they can.DALEY: Democratic-led states, some with strong state marketplaces like California, Maryland and Massachusetts, have also tried to help their residents. They're offering state-funded premium assistance, like Colorado, or leaning on state programs that help soften the blow for insurance companies dealing with high-cost claims. Or, McGough says, they're ramping up consumer outreach.MCGOUGH: But everything that they're doing is a drop in the bucket of what the federal government has done and is rolling back this year.DALEY: And none of these state efforts are permanent, he says.MCGOUGH: From my understanding, a lot of these are just emergency measures, one-time fixes that provide a gentle landing.DALEY: Insurance customer Chelsey Baker-Hauck says she's grateful to state leaders for the help, which would save her $80 a month.BAKER-HAUCK: This is a step in the right direction. I mean, $80 is a lot for me right now, so that adds up.DALEY: Meanwhile, she's already cutting back on spending to cope with the much higher health insurance costs she fears.BAKER-HAUCK: One of the things I've been doing is stopping medications, especially the ones that I have to pay out of pocket for.DALEY: Baker-Hauck says it's unfortunate, but for now, she doesn't have a choice.For NPR News, I'm John Daley in Denver.(SOUNDBITE OF THEE SINSEERS & JOEY QUINONES' \"SI LLORARAS\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Michel Martin asks Anne Applebaum, a Pulitzer Prize winning historian and staff writer for The Atlantic, about President Trump's transatlantic relationships and recent comments about Europe.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  For more on President Trump's relationship with Europe, we're joined by Anne Applebaum. She is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and historian, a staff writer for The Atlantic who's reported from all over the world, and she's with us now. Good morning, Anne.ANNE APPLEBAUM: Morning.MARTIN: So what stood out to you in the president's remarks about Europe?APPLEBAUM: I think what stands out about the national security strategy is that Trump has given up on identifying America's rivals as Russia and China. He's given up on the idea that we play a role in the world to protect democracy, to spread freedom, even to increase prosperity of Americans by arguing for open trade. And instead, he has decided on a policy of undermining and disparaging allies. And I think that's going to prove very dangerous in the long term.MARTIN: So Trump has criticized Europe before. I mean, in both of his administrations, mainly about what he said was inadequate military spending. How is this different?APPLEBAUM: Well, first of all, it's different because Europe is spending on the military. And not only that - Europe is now the main supporter, almost sole supporter of the Ukrainians. I mean, all the weapons and money going into Ukraine this year have come from Europe, so that's not a criticism you can make anymore. Civilizational erasure is more of a - it's a far-right idea. I mean, it's actually way to the right of most European far-right parties. It's an idea that Europe is somehow fundamentally intellectually and emotionally and physically flawed and won't survive. And that's a - that's an existential attack that you can't fix by, you know, spending more on weapons or by having a better diplomatic relationship or by flattering the president.Trump has clearly got this impression from some of the people around him who - some of whom believe this or have been promoting these ideas for domestic reasons as part of a domestic debate in the United States for a long time. And of course, it grotesquely misreads what Europe is. It misunderstands even immigration. It misunderstands that, you know, European countries are - on any list you look at, have the highest living standards, are the safest places to live, have the highest education, have the - you know, have the best environmental policies. I mean, these are - this is a very attractive and powerful part of the world. And if the United States is now going to set itself against it and try to tear it apart, as I said, that will eventually have terrible results for the United States.MARTIN: So on Monday, Leila - my colleague Leila - spoke with Alexandra de Hoop Scheffer, the president of the German Marshall Fund of the United States. Let's listen to what she had to say.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)ALEXANDRA DE HOOP SCHEFFER: What you are seeing live today is a new transatlantic bargain, where Europeans are accepting and integrating the idea that the transatlantic relationship is going to be more transactional, more conditional.MARTIN: It sounds to me like she's saying that the president just finally said the quiet part out loud and that Europe has seen this coming and is already kind of adapting to this idea. Do you think that that's accurate?APPLEBAUM: If the relationship is going to be more transactional, that's - and neutral, that's maybe the best possible outcome. But the NSS that was written implies that the U.S. will be actively seeking to dismantle European institutions and will be playing a role inside European politics, inside the domestic politics of European countries, which is - in a contradictory way is exactly the opposite of what it said it would be doing in the autocratic world, especially in the Middle East. And that would be a - as I said, that will backfire.MARTIN: Yes. That's what I also want to ask you. How do you think Europe's going to respond to this if that is in fact the case?APPLEBAUM: It will be a very negative response, and of course, that response is happening now. I mean, I don't know that people are going to say it in public. But a very wide range of European leaders, including many on the right, will be distressed by this. European Union means a lot to the economies of Europe. The idea that the U.S. would play a role in breaking it up will be perceived very negatively. And it's - you know, and of course, that will have consequences for Europe's willingness to help the U.S. in other situations and in other spheres.MARTIN: What do you think this perspective that's outlined in this national security strategy and in the president's remarks - what does this mean for Ukraine?APPLEBAUM: I mean, it's not good for Ukraine because it seems to favor Russia. So almost everything in the document reflects Russian strategy. The Russians also talk about a decline in Europe. They also want to break up the EU. They also seek to downplay the role of the U.S. in Europe. They also want to break up America in Europe. And so unfortunately, this document is very good for Russia.MARTIN: Before we let you go - we only have 20 seconds here - are you surprised by any of this?APPLEBAUM: No, I'm not entirely surprised. I mean, this is language that's been kicking around in the American far right for many years. And I heard it before the election, and I'm not surprised to hear it now.MARTIN: That's Anne Applebaum. She's a staff writer for The Atlantic and a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian. Anne Applebaum, thank you so much.APPLEBAUM: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The 29-year-old lives in the Dallas-Forth Worth area and usually votes early, which he did as recently as Texas' Nov. 4 constitutional election.   So he was disturbed last month to open a letter from his local election office in Denton County, calling into question whether he was eligible to vote at all.   \"We have received information from the Texas Secretary of State reflecting that you might not be a United States citizen,\" read the notice.   The notice said he needed to provide proof of citizenship — such as a copy of a U.S. passport, birth certificate or naturalization certificate — within 30 days. Otherwise, his registration would be canceled, though it said he could be immediately reinstated if he showed that documentation at a later date.   \n   Nel, who was born in South Africa, became a U.S. citizen as a teenager, more than a decade ago. Yet he is one of 2,724 people Texas Secretary of State Jane Nelson identified in October as \"potential noncitizens\" on Texas voter rolls. Nelson came up with the tally after running the state's entire voting list — more than 18 million voters — through a federal data system known as SAVE that the Trump administration has overhauled this year.   The tally of 2,724 potential noncitizens is about 0.015% of the state's voters.   Nelson's office directed county election officials to investigate the flagged voters, including by sending out the notice Nel received. The list of voters has not been publicly released.   \"I was confused because I have a passport. I've been voting for almost 10 years. Why is this happening now?\" Nel recalled in an interview with NPR. \"My first thought was something is going on in terms of wanting to adjust and change who is registered to vote.\"   \n   Other eligible Texas voters received the same notice, though official numbers are not yet known.   Their experience underscores concerns election experts have had about the reliability of SAVE, which the Trump administration has turned into a controversial citizenship lookup tool. While the changes to SAVE have made the tool more accessible to states, the overhauled system has been widely criticized for being rolled out without public notice, congressional input or transparency about its accuracy.   President Trump has long made exaggerated claims about the prevalence of noncitizens voting in U.S. elections and his critics have expressed concern the revamped SAVE could be used to continue to push false election narratives.   \n   47 million voters have had their data run through SAVE   Originally a data system that searched numerous Department of Homeland Security and immigration-related databases to check if foreign-born individuals are eligible for government benefits, the Trump administration has transformed SAVE into a tool that it claims can verify most Americans' citizenship or show if someone is listed as deceased.   As of May, SAVE is linked to Social Security Administration data, and can be queried with a name, date of birth and the last four numbers of a Social Security number. More recently, it has been linked to the State Department's U.S. passport database so people can be looked up with a passport number.   \"SAVE is a secure, and reliable way for user states to verify the citizenship or immigration status of individuals registering to vote,\" U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement to NPR. \"The program is doing exactly what it is supposed to do – providing states with an easy-to-use tool to stop aliens from hijacking our elections. USCIS urges all states to adopt SAVE and join us in safeguarding the voting rights of American citizens.\"   More than 47 million voters have been run through SAVE, according to the agency. States that have announced their results so far have not identified large numbers of suspected noncitizens casting ballots. Louisiana found 79 likely noncitizens voted in elections going back to the 1980s, Tennessee referred 42 potential noncitizens who cast ballots to the FBI, and Indiana said it found \"at least 21\" noncitizens who voted.   While officials in states like Texas have praised the new SAVE tool, the Justice Department has been suing other states to get access to their voter rolls. Some state election officials have asked DOJ and DHS to clarify whether one goal is to upload state voter lists to SAVE.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon speaks during a news conference on Sept. 29.\n                \n                    Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"We've checked 47.5 million voter records, we have found 260,000 plus dead people enrolled,\" said Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon in a video released last week. \"And finally that there are several thousand noncitizens who are enrolled to vote in federal elections.\"   \n   NPR asked both the DOJ and USCIS whether the numbers Dhillon cited were confirmed noncitizens, or potential noncitizens. DOJ declined to comment and USCIS did not respond to that question.   In a Monday appearance on Newsmax, Dhillon speculated the number of noncitizens on voter rolls could be six figures or higher.   Voting experts have warned that known accuracy issues with SAVE will lead to eligible voters like Anthony Nel being wrongly flagged by the system and potentially disenfranchised, while the problem SAVE seeks to solve — noncitizens voting in federal elections — is incredibly rare.   A \"giant omnibus database\"   There are also questions about whether SAVE's overhaul complies with federal privacy laws, particularly given that it uses sensitive Social Security data for a new purpose. Last month, the judge overseeing a federal lawsuit to reverse the project's updates said she was \"troubled by the recent changes to SAVE and doubts the lawfulness of the Government's actions.\"   But the Trump administration is taking steps to expand SAVE further and add additional data sources so it can be queried with driver's license numbers. Plans include accessing driver's license data from a private entity known as Nlets that helps law enforcement agencies share information across states.   At the end of October, DHS released a belated public notice about SAVE that said data could be shared with other government agencies and \"other entities\" with DHS agreements for purposes that include monitoring or auditing voter registration records.   Election officials are raising concerns about the security of voters' data, which, once uploaded to SAVE, is retained for 10 years.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon testifies during a congressional hearing on Sept. 27, 2023.\n                \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"I don't think most people, most Americans, think that if they give to an elections administrator for voter registration purposes, sensitive data like a full or partial Social Security number, that it's going to end up in some sort of giant omnibus database in Washington, D.C., that can be easily shared with God knows who for God knows what reason,\" Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon told NPR. \"And that is apparently what is going on here.\"   \n   Last week, Simon and 11 other Democratic secretaries of state signed a public comment opposing changes to SAVE that was among thousands of mostly critical comments. The secretaries expressed concern that USCIS has failed to release data on the tool's accuracy for identifying noncitizens.   \"What you don't want out of the system is innocent people to be fingered as illegal voters,\" Simon said. \"And there's a real capacity and concern here that that's going to happen in really large numbers.\"   Removed from the voter rolls   When Nel plugged his own name and birthday into Denton County's online voter registration lookup recently, the system no longer showed him as registered.   He has not yet had a chance to visit the county office and show his passport, and more than 30 days have passed since the notice was mailed. While the county would accept a passport copy over email, mail or fax, he does not feel comfortable sending a copy of a sensitive document and prefers to handle the transaction in person.   Denton County confirmed to NPR that Nel's voter registration was canceled because he has not yet proven his citizenship.   There is not yet any official data on how many eligible Texas voters like Nel were flagged by SAVE but Denton County election director Frank Phillips told NPR that so far out of the 84 flagged registered voters he sent notices to, 14 have proven their citizenship.   The county determined that another 14 people were registered in error because they had indicated on registration forms they were not citizens. The county has canceled their registrations. None had voted.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The courthouse in Denton, which is the county seat for Denton County.\n                \n                    Desiree Rios for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Desiree Rios for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Fifty-five people in Denton County besides Nel have also had their registration canceled after not responding to the notice, including five people whose notices came back as undeliverable, according to Phillips.   Texas election code instructs officials to cancel a voter's registration if they do not respond to such notices in 30 days or if the mail is returned with no forwarding address.   \n   Nel was surprised voters are removed from the rolls after a single mailed letter, with no other follow up.   \"There's no confirmation that someone received the letter,\" Nel said. \"There are probably tons of people out there that have no idea that they're no longer registered to vote.\"   That concern is shared by voting rights advocates.   Danielle Lang, an attorney with nonprofit Campaign Legal Center, said even if a notice arrives at the voter's address, \"They may never open them. Election mail notices and things like that are not a very reliable way of getting voters to engage.\"   While Nel has a U.S. passport, which he showed to NPR, he worries other naturalized citizens may not have the documents they need on hand to prove citizenship. Without a U.S. passport, Nel would have needed his South African birth certificate and one of his parents' naturalization certificates.   A survey last year commissioned by the University of Maryland's Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement and the advocacy group VoteRiders found that in Texas, 7% of adult citizens do not have easy access to citizenship documents. The number went up to 12% for those under 30.   Nel pointed out it takes time for people to get documents once they request them and there are fees. \"It's almost like they're adding barriers for these naturalized citizens to maintain their voter registration,\" he said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Nel, who was born in South Africa, became a U.S. citizen as a teenager and has a U.S. passport.\n                \n                    Desiree Rios for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Desiree Rios for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   An \"unfiltered and unvetted\" list of voters   To use SAVE, the Texas secretary of state's office signed an agreement with USCIS that says the state will \"institute additional verification\" if SAVE does not identify a registered voter as a U.S. citizen, and if the voter still cannot be verified, to contact them to obtain proof of citizenship.   Nelson tasked officials in 177 counties with investigating the flagged voters.   \"Even though the data we received from SAVE is considered a strong match, we directed counties to treat them as weak matches in order to ensure that counties conducted their own investigation,\" Nelson wrote in a November email to Travis County officials. \"Such investigations can include notifying the voter and requesting proof of citizenship directly from the voter.\"   \n   Chris McGinn, the executive director of the Texas Association of County Election Officials, said the state did not tell counties what their investigation must entail so the approach has varied by county.   \"The state said, 'Here, check these people out. They're potentially noncitizens,' without any real strict guidance on what the process should be or what resources they should use to do the research,\" McGinn said.   McGinn has been in touch with 112 counties and learned that while some are trying to gather more information, most relied on sending out mailed notices, and the response rates to those notices were low.   He said it appears more than half of the flagged registered voters were inactive and had never voted, and many may have been registered in error when they got a driver's license.   \"The biggest takeaway is that the narrative that noncitizens are registered en masse and affecting elections is just false,\" McGinn said.   \n   Officials in Travis County, where Austin is located, last week wrote a searing public comment about the use of SAVE in Texas, labeling the list of potential noncitizens that the secretary of state gave counties \"unfiltered and unvetted\" and alleged it was \"another bad faith attempt to remove voters from the rolls, including many people who likely previously demonstrated their citizenship in a transaction with the State of Texas.\"   Travis County officials found a quarter of the voters SAVE flagged in their county had registered to vote at the Department of Public Safety, which issues driver's licenses. Voters who register at DPS are supposed to show proof of citizenship and those documents stay on file, though it is also possible that some of those registrations were in error.   The secretary of state's office did not cross-check SAVE results with DPS records to check for evidence that any of the flagged voters had previously proven their citizenship before sharing the list with counties, according to a statement the office gave the nonprofit news outlet Votebeat. The secretary of state's office did not respond to NPR's request for comment, but DPS officials told Travis County in an email that it was \"not involved\" in creating the secretary of state's list.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Travis County Tax Assessor-Collector Celia Israel speaks at her inauguration ceremony in Austin on Jan. 3.\n                \n                    Jay Janner/American-Statesman/USA Today Network via Reuters\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jay Janner/American-Statesman/USA Today Network via Reuters\n    \n\n   \n   Celia Israel, Travis County's Democratic tax assessor-collector and voter registrar, said she has been asking the secretary of state's office and DPS to help her access DPS records since late October.   \n   \"I don't see anything wrong in asking them to do some more research before I burden a voter,\" Israel told NPR.   Top of mind for Israel is a past episode in 2019 when the secretary of state at the time claimed to have identified 95,000 potential noncitizens on the voter rolls but the list wound up including a significant number of naturalized citizens.   Israel is worried about the possibility of voter suppression efforts ahead of midterm elections and sees this process with SAVE as a test.   \"We're living at a time in which the folks who are running this country are denying election results and using tools like this to tamp down the vote and discourage the vote,\" Israel said. \"We've got a big election coming up next year. So this to me is also a note to how we could deal with this in a larger fashion next year.\"   A known defect in SAVE   Nel was born in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, now known as Gqeberha, and immigrated to Texas with his family when he was just 8. He quickly settled into his new life, riding a yellow school bus to school and celebrating holidays like Halloween and Thanksgiving. His parents became U.S. citizens when he was a teenager, and he acquired American citizenship, too, since he was a minor with a green card.   \"I consider myself more of an American than I do a South African,\" Nel told NPR. \"I have passion for the United States.\"   But cases like Nel's, of foreign-born children who acquired citizenship from parents who naturalized, are known to stump SAVE.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                \"I consider myself more of an American than I do a South African,\" Nel told NPR.\n                \n                    Desiree Rios for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Desiree Rios for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   USCIS' own fact sheet warns that \"if an individual with acquired citizenship has not received a Certificate of Citizenship from USCIS (e.g., some foreign-born children of U.S. citizens) or is not designated as a U.S. citizen in [Social Security Administration] records, SAVE may not be able to confirm that individual's U.S. citizenship.\"   \n   The sheet goes on to say, \"In these circumstances, SAVE returns the case to the user agency for review of their information for data entry errors or to seek additional information from the individual.\"   Furthermore, a Privacy Impact Assessment DHS published at the end of October acknowledges, \"due to misspellings of names, transposed numbers or incomplete information, the SAVE program may produce inaccurate results.\"   The assessment says that SAVE has a multistep review process, but when the system is queried with Social Security numbers — which is what states use to check voter rolls — it \"does not allow for a second and third step review.\"   Voting rights advocates have also raised concerns about the completeness of Social Security Administration's citizenship records and the accuracy of data matches using just the last four digits of a Social Security number.    Nel was frustrated to learn that SAVE is known to not be able to identify U.S. citizens like him, and the only effort to contact him was a single letter.   In his own career in higher education he has set up information systems and said it would never be permissible to put out a product with a known flaw.   \"When something doesn't work, we don't release it,\" Nel said. \"We don't allow people to use a system that doesn't work.\"\n",

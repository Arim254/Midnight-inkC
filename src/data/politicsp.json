    "body": "\n      Indiana lawmakers rejected a push from President Trump to redraw congressional maps to favor Republicans. The vote is a significant rebuke for Trump.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  President Trump continues to pressure Republicans to redraw congressional maps and states across the country. But in Indiana, Republican lawmakers voted against a plan to do just that. Our friends at the NPR POLITICS PODCAST broke down what this all means. Here's senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro, senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith and political correspondent Sarah McCammon.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)DOMENICO MONTANARO: I mean, it's probably the biggest pushback he's gotten within his party in the time that he's really been on the political stage, I would say, in many respects. There were many Indiana Republicans who were willing to go along with this plan to try to squeeze out two more seats from Indiana to try to help Republicans retain control of the house. That's what this was really all about. But voters in the state just didn't want it. They'd seen significant pushback. A lot of these lawmakers were receiving threats as well from the right and still rejected what was being proposed.TAMARA KEITH: People were doxed. People had pizza show up at their home. They had swatting. There were large protests organized by allies of President Trump at the state capitol. They were under intense pressure, and they didn't like it. State Senator Spencer Deere is among those who voted against it.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SPENCER DEERY: And as long as I have breath, I will use my voice to resist a federal government that attempts to bully, direct and control this state or any state. Giving the federal government more power is not conservative.KEITH: And that's a federalism argument, right? It's saying, we're the state of Indiana. We should be able to decide what we want to do. And the president and the speaker of the House and the vice president and all of the people who are lobbying on this shouldn't tell us what to do.SARAH MCCAMMON: President Trump is in a vulnerable place. His poll numbers are down. He wants more Republicans in Congress for the rest of his term. And yet here was a group of Republicans who were willing to vote against it.MONTANARO: I do think that it's interesting nationally, considering this pushback that Trump has gotten, and maybe he wouldn't get that kind of pushback if he was more popular. The fact is, Trump is at the Nader of his popularity in the second term. He's in the 30s, according to a lot of polls. Recent AP-NORC poll, for example, had him at 36% approval rating, which was even lower than our poll was last month - the NPR/PBS News/Marist poll - and not by much, and he only had a 31% approval rating when it came to handling of the economy. So people are kind of, in some respects, looking past Trump, and I kind of wonder what this is going to mean more broadly when we see Trump off the national stage and sort of that, you know, big piece of the dam, the big brick in the dam is removed.KEITH: President Trump used the best leverage that he's had throughout his political career, which is to say, If you cross me, if you don't do the thing that I want you to do, then I'm going to primary you - I'm going to support someone else to run against you in the Republican primary, and I'm so all-powerful that you will lose your job. And 21 Senate Republicans in the state of Indiana said, all right, you can try. It has worked in the past. The question is whether that power, that ability to strike fear in members of his own party is waning because he is definitionally a lame duck.MCCAMMON: President Trump likes to win. This was a big loss for him. What is he saying about it?KEITH: Oh, he is saying the thing that he says when he loses, which is, oh, you know, I didn't really care that much.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, we won every other state. That's the only state - it's funny 'cause I won Indiana all three times by a landslide, and I wasn't working on it very hard. Would have been nice - I think we would have picked up two seats if we did that.KEITH: Oh, no, he was working on it very hard. The speaker of the House was working on it very hard. The vice president was working on it very hard. And President Trump has said, in no uncertain terms, that he believes the fate of his presidency, the fate of the country is on the line because if Republicans lose control of the House of Representatives, which seems entirely possible, then he's going to have a miserable last two years in office.MONTANARO: Republicans have a really, really narrow majority in the House, just a few seats more than Democrats. So every seat here is going to matter. So to say, I wasn't that focused on these two seats, that's just not the case.I mean, they want every single seat that they possibly can get to be able to have the advantage to build in some cushion because right now, Democrats have a significant advantage. The wind is completely at their backs. And they are also redistricting, doing this mid-decade redrawing, in places like California, potentially Virginia, which could offset a lot of these Republican-pushed changes.State like Louisiana and Florida, which are controlled by Republicans, are going to try to squeeze out some more seats on their own. But again, those could be offset by Virginia while California offsets Texas, and we're talking about all this work, millions of dollars spent, for nothing really.MCCAMMON: For a wash, potentially.MONTANARO: Right.KEITH: And let me just add the other factor here, which is, when you take a seat that is really super safe and you draw it to make two seats, neither of them are as super safe as before.DETROW: For more insights and analysis, you can listen to the NPR POLITICS PODCAST on the NPR app or wherever you get your podcasts.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

The DOJ is also suing one Georgia county, seeking records from the 2020 election.   The department has now filed suit against 18 states — mostly Democratic-led, and all states that President Trump lost in the 2020 election — as part of its far-reaching litigation.   For months, the Justice Department has been demanding certain states turn over complete, unredacted copies of their voter registration lists, including any driver's license numbers and parts of voters' Social Security numbers.   In court filings, the DOJ says it wants this personal information to check if states are following federal law on keeping accurate voter rolls.   \n   But most states have refused, citing privacy restrictions.   The latest states to be sued are Colorado, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Nevada, the Justice Department announced Friday.   \"At this Department of Justice, we will not permit states to jeopardize the integrity and effectiveness of elections by refusing to abide by our federal elections laws,\" Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon said in a statement. \"If states will not fulfill their duty to protect the integrity of the ballot, we will.\"   \n   In recent days, Dhillon has additionally touted the number of voter records run through a citizenship lookup tool housed within the Department of Homeland Security.   The Justice Department has also filed a lawsuit against Georgia's Fulton County. The administration is trying to force local election officials to turn over all ballots and other records from the 2020 election that Trump lost.     Fulton County has been at the center of baseless claims by Trump and allies that the 2020 election was rigged against him.    The DOJ legal action against Fulton County follows the dismissal last month of the high-profile election interference case against Trump and his allies that was originally brought by county prosecutors.   \n   Officials in Colorado are among those pushing back on the administration's pursuit of voter data.   \"We will not hand over Coloradans' sensitive voting information to Donald Trump. He does not have a legal right to the information,\" Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat who's running for attorney general, said in a statement. \"I will continue to protect our elections and democracy, and look forward to winning this case.\"   The Justice Department's lawsuit against Colorado comes as Trump on Thursday announced on social media he was pardoning Tina Peters, a former Colorado county clerk who's serving a nine-year sentence after a conviction for granting unauthorized access to voting equipment, as part of an effort to investigate the 2020 election.   \n   Trump's pardon seems to be primarily symbolic, as Peters was convicted on state, not federal, charges. The power to issue a pardon for state crimes rests with Colorado's governor.   The Department of Justice in recent days also announced a review of Colorado's prisons.

The third-generation Black row crop farmer estimated picking almost 1,300 pounds of cotton, an average of 50 bushels of soybeans, and an average of around 155 bushels of corn on 2,500 acres of his farmland in northeast Louisiana.   But with U.S. commodities facing steep retaliatory tariffs overseas, he says he and many other farmers can't sell their crops for enough to cover the loans they take out to fund the growing season.   The tariffs, Davis said, are making it almost impossible to survive.   \n   \"To have that kind of yield and still not be able to pay all your bills, that tells you something is broken in the farming industry,\" Davis said.   In order to plan for next year, farmers need relief now, Davis said. At a recent meeting with his banker, the bank projected 2026 revenues in order to secure crop loans, and the cash flow math wasn't adding up — the farm's expected income wasn't enough to cover operating loans once input costs, equipment notes, land rent and insurance premiums were factored in.   \n   The Trump administration announced just this week  a new $12 billion package of one-time bridge payments for American farmers like Davis, aimed at helping them recover from temporary market disruptions and high production costs.   \"This relief will provide much needed certainty as they get this year's harvest to market and look ahead to next year's crops,\" Trump said during a White House roundtable event. \"It'll help them continue their efforts to lower food prices for American families.\"   Davis says that type of help can't come soon enough.    \"Without bailouts, it is hard to make crop loans work on paper,\" he said in an interview with NPR on Monday.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                James Davis asks a question at a panel on farm finances at the National Black Growers Council conference in New Orleans on Dec. 10, 2025. Davis is a third-generation Black row crop farmer who said that despite having the best year he's ever had in his farming career, he's still struggling to pay his bills.\n                \n                    Drew Hawkins/Gulf States Newsroom\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Drew Hawkins/Gulf States Newsroom\n    \n\n   \n   At the same time, however, the Trump Administration dismantled decades-old USDA programs designed to assist Black farmers by eliminating the \"socially disadvantaged\" designation, including programs like the 2501 Program, which many Black row-crop farmers rely on for access to credit, technical assistance, and conservation support that are otherwise difficult to secure at county-level USDA offices. The USDA did not respond to requests for interviews or comment.   \n   Those supports, experts said, were designed to help smaller farmers and farmers of color remain on the land.   Welcome relief may not come in time   The Farmer Bridge Assistance Program accounts for up to $11 billion of the newly announced package, and offers proportional payments to farmers growing major commodities, including row crops like soybeans, corn and cotton.   Payments are expected to begin by February of next year, and are designed to offset losses from the 2025 crop year.   \n   For many farmers, that isn't soon enough. While the bridge payment may help with crop loans, there are immediate bills due for many in the coming weeks.    \"This needs to show up like Santa Claus underneath the Christmas tree, to be honest with you,\" said PJ Haynie, a fifth-generation Black farmer with rice operations in Virginia and Arkansas and chairman of the National Black Growers Council, which met in New Orleans this week for its annual conference.   \"Our landlords want their money by the end of the year — our seed and input and chemical and equipment companies that we have to make payments by the end of the year,\" he said.   Some farmers may have relationships with bankers and companies that will work with them and extend payment deadlines a few months, Haynie said — others don't. And farmers are grateful for any support they receive, but, Haynie said, the one-time bridge payments aren't enough.   \"They still won't make us whole because of the losses that we've incurred because of the markets, the tariffs, the trade,\" he said. \"But every dollar helps.\"   Farmers already face challenges like unpredictable weather, pests and stagnant commodity prices, as well as rising input costs including machinery and fertilizer purchases. \"We plant and we pray,\" as Haynie put it. Tariffs have only compounded those challenges.   Black farmers face additional challenges   Black farmers like Haynie and Davis make up less than 2% of all U.S. farmers — and Black row-crop farmers, like those at this week's conference, are an even smaller slice of that.   \n   \"Our herd is small,\" Haynie said, \"and if we can protect the herd, the herd will grow.\"   Black farmers have asked the federal government for loan relief and other assistance for decades. A century ago, Black farmers owned at least 16 million acres of land. Today, Haynie said they hold around 2 million.    \n   Following the Civil War, Black Americans were promised \"40 acres and a mule\" by the federal government, but many say that promise never came to pass.   Over the course of the past 100 years, the amount of Black-owned farmland dropped by 90%, according to Data for Progress, due to higher rates of loan and credit denials, lack of legal and industry support and \"outright acts of violence and intimidation.\"   Advocates say the inability for Black farmers to get a start, and later the sharp drop in farming population, is in part due to what they call USDA's discriminatory lending practices, and often specific loan officers' biases. The agency is the subject of an ongoing discrimination class action lawsuit by Black farmers and additional litigation due to those and other allegations.   Much of that history plays into how Black farmers approach the Trump administration.   \"The Black row crop farm community needs the support of the administration,\" Haynie said. \"I can't … buy an $800,000 combine to sell $4 corn. The math doesn't math on that.\"   All farmers — \"Black or white\" — are responding to the same depressed prices, he said. But Black farmers, he argues, already a small percentage of total U.S. growers, and often operating at a smaller scale, have less buffer to absorb sudden market shocks.   As farmers look at their projected costs next year, economists say they're also navigating deep uncertainty in global markets.   \"I think that a lot of farmers are still very much looking at the next year with some trepidation, thinking that their margins will continue to be very, very tight,\" said Joseph Glauber, a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington D.C.   \n   U.S. trade with China — historically the top buyer of American soybeans and other row crops — has not rebounded to pre–trade war levels despite a new agreement. Meanwhile, Glauber said, countries like Brazil have expanded production dramatically, seizing market share during the trade war and becoming the world's top soybean exporter — a long-term structural shift that U.S. growers now have to compete against.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Finis Stribling III (left) and John Green II (right) take a break during the National Black Growers Council conference in New Orleans on Dec. 10, 2025. Both Stribling and Green were plagued by bad weather at the start of this year's growing season, and both said tariffs have only made things harder.\n                \n                    Drew Hawkins/Gulf States Newsroom\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Drew Hawkins/Gulf States Newsroom\n    \n\n   \n   He added that crops grown in the Mississippi River Delta, such as cotton and soybeans, have been hit especially hard by low prices and retaliatory tariffs.   Finis Stribling III farms 800 acres of cotton, rice, corn, soybeans and wheat in Arkansas and Tennessee. At the National Black Growers Council's conference, he told NPR 2025 was another year of what he calls \"farming in deficit.\"   \"We had too much rain early, then drought,\" he said. \"And when you finally get a crop in the field, the price support isn't strong enough to cover the cost of production.\"   Sitting next to him during a lunch break at the conference, another Arkansas row crop farmer John Lee II, put it bluntly: \"What I'm worried about is next year. What do we do in 2026 when we go to the bank to try and get a loan? I'm concerned about the notion of going to the bank this upcoming year and not being able to get a loan because we can't make the loan cash flow.\"   Both also said the new tariff relief will help — but not nearly to the degree many outside agriculture may think.   \"From the outside looking in, non-farm community, you say $12 billion seems like a lot of money,\" Stribling said. \"But when you look at the cost of production and the money that's spent in agriculture, $12 billion is really just a drop in the bucket. It's almost like putting a Band-Aid on a bullet wound.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      Fred Upton, a former Republican congressman from Michigan, discusses the Senate's failed health care votes and the political fallout of rising insurance premiums.   \n\n    MILES PARKS, HOST:  Without an extension of federal subsidies, Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act - also known as the ACA - could see their monthly costs skyrocket in January. This week, two bills to avoid those premium hikes died in the Senate. And last night, Speaker Mike Johnson unveiled a last-minute Republican plan, which Democrats called, quote, \"completely unserious.\"So why is it so hard to get bipartisan consensus on health care? Former Republican Congressman Fred Upton from Michigan has spent a lot of time thinking about just that question. Back in 2017, he was part of a committee that tried and failed to come up with an alternative to the ACA. I called Upton to try to make sense of the current negotiations on the hill.FRED UPTON: First of all, you recall just about two weeks ago, the Trump administration was going to unveil their own health care proposal that they thought was going to work, and it got shot down before it was even presented. They said, you can't possibly do that. You can't possibly extend the ACA subsidies. That would be wrong. And so they pulled it back. You know, we didn't see any proposal come out from the administration.You've got about 15 or 20 Republicans in the House - Brian Fitzpatrick from Pennsylvania, Don Bacon from Nebraska - and others that have been willing to say, let's work together. Let's find some Democrats and work together on a proposal. And they've been shopping with the speaker and others. They've actually got, I think, a fairly sound proposal. I'd be with them if I was still in the Congress. But you've got 15 Republicans or so that are willing to work with the Democrats to actually get something done, and they know that in the short term - the next year or two, until you get a replacement peace (ph) - you got to continue these subsidies versus fall off the cliff on January 1.But that's run into real - we'll call it resentment, real opposition for sure, among the hardcore conservatives in the House. They don't want anything to do with it. They want to repeal - you know, let's have yet another vote to repeal Obamacare. So they're not going to budge.PARKS: Do you think this is going to matter in the midterms?UPTON: It will matter. It's going to matter big time. And for the Democrats, it's going to play out, I think, pretty well. They'll be able to point not only to the 20 million that are going to have pretty sizable increases in the reduction in the - of the subsidy. And without a resolve, you, the voter - you're going to be angry. And so, you know, we've seen already just some of these special elections. The mayor of Miami - last week, it flipped after 30 years from a Republican to a Democrat. We're seeing these special elections.So yeah, the warning signs are there for a bad situation for Republicans, and this is going to add to it because Congress didn't deal with the crisis that's upon them, and it's going to hit the pocketbooks of millions and millions of people.PARKS: I also wonder if this just means that this affordability message is also not going away in terms of, is that going to be, in your eyes, the main storyline of the 2026 midterms?UPTON: Well, it will be. I mean, you've got energy costs. I mean, I'm looking at electricity costs going up, certainly in my state. You know, most of the grocery store items that you see, it's like, holy cow, it wasn't like this a few months ago. You've got coffee prices that are up, and we're all glad the tariffs are coming off on coffee and bananas, things that we don't produce here.So yeah, it's going to be a tough election with affordability being one of the top issues, as well as the health care needs, and, you know, people are grousing. So there's time. I'm still - you know, I'm a Republican. I'm still an optimist. I'm a Cubs fan. And, you know, (laughter) we'll see what happens.PARKS: That's former Congressman Fred Upton, a Republican from Michigan. Thanks so much for joining us.UPTON: You bet.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Time is running out for Congress to act. Once the subsidies for Americans who buy health care plans through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expire at the end of the year, millions of Americans' premiums will skyrocket.   Democrats have been pushing to extend those enhanced tax credits to prevent premiums from doubling or more.    \n   The enhanced subsidies began in 2021 to make ACA marketplace plans more affordable for more Americans. The marketplace came out of the health reform President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010 that Republicans have long criticized.   House members have just four days left in the session before their holiday recess begins on Dec. 19. The Senate's recess begins Dec. 20.   Friday's proposal from House Republicans includes measures that would allow small businesses to join together to buy insurance plans for their employees and put in place new requirements for pharmacy benefit managers in an effort to lower drug costs.   Starting in 2027, federal payments, known as cost-sharing reduction payments, would aim to lower premiums for some low-income Americans. Health plans that provide abortion coverage would be excluded.   A vote on the package is expected next week, House Speaker Mike Johnson said.   \"House Republicans are tackling the real drivers of health care costs to provide affordable care, increase access and choice, and restore integrity to our nation's health care system for all Americans,\" Johnson said in a statement.   Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries blasted the proposal Saturday.   \"Mike Johnson just released a toxic Republican Healthcare plan that hurts everyday Americans,\" Jeffries wrote on X. \"It fails to extend the ACA tax credits that expire this month. And is a deeply unserious proposal.\"   \n   A Democratic-led proposal in the Senate to extend the subsidies for ACA plans for three years was joined by a handful of Republicans but failed to pass this week, as did a separate plan backed by Senate Republicans. Both bills failed to attract enough support to clear the chamber's de facto 60-vote threshold.   \n   President Trump has advocated for giving money to people to pay for health care costs instead of tax credits for ACA plans.   \"I want to see the billions of dollars go to people, not to the insurance companies,\" Trump said late Friday during a White House event. \"And I want to see the people go out and buy themselves great health care.\"   The Republicans' plan in the Senate included a proposal for people to get up to $1,500 in health savings accounts for Americans earning less than 700% of the federal poverty level, but the House Republican proposal does not include that language.   In the Senate GOP's proposal, the savings accounts, which cannot be used to pay for premiums, would have been paired with high-deductible insurance plans. Such health plans have an average deductible cost of around $7,000, according to an analysis from KFF, a  health policy organization.   Democrats opposed the Senate GOP bill, arguing it would not help Americans pay for health care premiums. They also objected to language that would have put restrictions on abortion and gender-affirming care.   Meanwhile, some Republicans have warned that ending ACA subsidies could cost their party the midterm elections, citing worried communications from their constituents. A number of Republicans in the House are seeking ways to extend subsidies, including by working to force a vote on the House floor over the objections of party leaders.\n",

Today's top stories   A federal judge freed Kilmar Abrego Garcia from immigration detention yesterday. Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in March due to what Immigration and Customs Enforcement called an \"administrative error.\" He was eventually brought back and detained in the U.S. A federal judge ruled that the government failed to produce a lawful order for his removal from the U.S. This decision came just as lawmakers were questioning Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem about President Trump's compliance with court orders.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Kilmar Abrego Garcia (R) and his wife Jennifer Vasquez look on as his supporters address the press as he arrives at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Baltimore, Maryland, on Aug. 25, 2025.\n                \n                    Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Roberto Schmidt/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 The White House says it will appeal this decision, according to NPR's Ximena Bustillo. Abrego Garcia's lawyers say the ruling is an extraordinary victory, not only for their client, but also for due process. Democrats invited family members of people who were deported or put in detention to the hearing as examples of the impact of immigration enforcement. Noem said she believes immigrants who entered the U.S. under former President Biden pose the biggest threat to national security. Noem's department is reopening the cases of refugees admitted under the Biden administration and is calling for a review of asylum applications.   \n   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the Ukrainian people would need to speak through a referendum for his country to surrender territory, which the U.S. wants Ukraine to do as part of a peace deal with Russia. Zelenskyy and other Europeans are working to offer answers and alternatives to pressure from Trump's bid to end the war.    🎧 Zelenskyy is engaging with the Trump administration's most painful proposals to show that Ukraine is negotiating in good faith, NPR's Joanna Kakissis tells Up First. Giving up territory has been a red line for Ukrainians. Zelenskyy says he is examining the possibility of elections over the next 90 days or a referendum on giving up parts of eastern Ukraine to help end the war. Ukraine has not held elections because the country is under martial law due to the Russian invasion, and the constitution forbids elections during wartime, Kakissis says. Public opinion polls show that most Ukrainians think holding elections now is a terrible idea.   The Indiana Senate voted 31 to 19 yesterday against the congressional redistricting that the president called for to help Republicans win next year's midterm elections. The defeat comes in a state where 40 of the 50 members of the Senate are Republicans. It marks the first time members of Trump's own party voted against his redistricting campaign. The nationwide effort to reshape the midterm elections in the GOP's favor has succeeded in Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina.    \n   🎧 Indiana State Sen. Spencer Deery said redistricting for political gain opposed his conservative values, and he would fight to prevent the federal government from bullying a state. Other state lawmakers said their constituents didn't want the new map. Ben Thorp of the NPR network station WFYI says Republicans still appear to have \"tilted a couple more seats their way than Democrats.\" Texas helped the GOP possibly win five more seats; Missouri and North Carolina's efforts created one more seat each. California Democrats have countered by tilting five seats their way. The question now is whether Republicans in other states will follow suit on Trump's wishes for redistricting, Thorp says.

Consider using a great rug or similar option until you can afford a proper redo of the desired area.🏡 Need temporary pieces while you save? Try yard sales and thrift stores for secondhand items that may be less expensive and of higher quality.🏡 When looking for new colors for your walls, make sure to consider your skin tone.

And President Trump faces pushback from within his own party on redistricting and strikes against what the administration says are drug boats. NPR's national political correspondent Don Gonyea joins us to go through all of this. Thanks for being here, Don.DON GONYEA, BYLINE: It's a pleasure.SCHMITZ: So, Don, on health care, these enhanced subsidies are broadly popular, according to polls. Why is it so hard to agree on a fix?GONYEA: Well, the Affordable Care Act has always been a place where Democrats and Republicans butt heads. It's been that way since the law was passed in Obama's first term. But this current fight over whether to extend existing subsidies gets to the core of these differences, and it will have a great impact on how much health insurance costs Americans who rely on the ACA. So Republicans would rather have health savings accounts or give money directly to individuals to use on the health care of their choice. And we're just at an impasse. Last night, House Speaker Mike Johnson unveiled a last-minute Republican plan. It would enhance employer-sponsored health care plans. Democrats skeptical. Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called it completely unserious. But I guarantee you, Democrats will keep this issue front and center in the midterms.SCHMITZ: Now, President Trump in an interview with Politico this week rated his own performance on the economy.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: A+++++.SCHMITZ: That's a good grade. And then at a rally...GONYEA: Right.SCHMITZ: ...In Pennsylvania, he said, Americans can, quote, \"give up certain products.\" We can get by with fewer pencils and dolls. Those are two consumer products I would not have thought to put together. Don, is this messaging working?GONYEA: Well, poll after poll shows Americans are worried about inflation and affordability. As a result, Trump's approval ratings on the economy give him very low scores in that area. People are unhappy about the cost of a grocery store visit, about affording day care and on and on. And they see inflation as a big worry. But the president is, as we heard, taking a hard line, denying that affordability is anything other than a hoax that Democrats are pushing as a political issue. So he describes one economy. Americans describe a completely different place.SCHMITZ: The House passed a $900 billion defense policy bill this week. Tucked inside this bipartisan legislation is a provision that would require the Pentagon to share with lawmakers unedited video of the strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific. Now, do you think Congress is starting to show some willingness to push back against this administration?GONYEA: It is on certain issues, including this one. Many questions have been raised regarding these strikes on alleged drug boats off the coast of Venezuela, particularly the one in September, where a second strike killed two survivors of the initial attack. It's still just a small number of Republicans pushing back and demanding more answers. But still, there are some. And I should underscore here that these requirements now to share the video recordings were actually just one piece of that major defense funding bill, and that bill passed by a wide margin.SCHMITZ: Let's go on to redistricting. Indiana Republicans voted down a gerrymandered map favored by Trump despite threats from the president. Does this say something about Trump's hold on the party or is it more specific to that state?GONYEA: We've seen some GOP pushback on redistricting elsewhere as well, but this is a deep red state. Republicans hold seven of the state's nine congressional seats. The president wanted them to redraw the district lines to set up a potential clean sweep of all nine in next year's elections. But lawmakers looked at the map and said, look, we just did this four years ago, so it is a setback for the president.SCHMITZ: NPR's Don Gonyea. Don, thanks.GONYEA: All right. It's my pleasure.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Some Republicans are pushing back.   \n\n    ROB SCHMITZ, HOST:  Since the shooting of two members of the National Guard in Washington last month, President Trump has clamped down on immigration from Afghanistan. The administration has paused programs Afghans can use to legally come to the U.S., including visas, and has stripped temporary permissions to stay from Afghans who are already here. Among those impacted are Afghan citizens who helped the U.S. during the war. As NPR's Ximena Bustillo reports, some Republicans think these restrictions have gone too far.XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Shawn VanDiver is the founder of #AfghanEvac, an organization that advocates for Afghans who supported the U.S. military. He's been tracking how these wartime allies have been impacted by Trump's immigration policies.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SHAWN VANDIVER: Halting asylum decisions, suspending visa processing for Afghans, rereviewing every refugee admitted under the last administration, while fast tracking others they see as more desirable.BUSTILLO: Some of these changes came after the deadly shooting of a National Guard member allegedly by an Afghan national. The policy changes have highlighted a rift within the GOP over who should be allowed into the United States. Some Republicans still want to extend a legal pathway. Here, Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina talking about the aftermath of the shooting.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)THOM TILLIS: It's unfortunate that it happened, but that by itself can't be a reason to shut down any consideration going forward or even reconsidering some of the other ones.BUSTILLO: Others like Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine agree with the Trump administration that there needs to be more vetting but not that the program should be shut down.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SUSAN COLLINS: There are Afghan citizens who acted as guards, drivers, interpreters, cooks for our troops. So I think the answer is more intensive and careful vetting.BUSTILLO: And others, like Republican Senator James Lankford, who sits on the Homeland Security Committee, say it's not Congress' job to intervene.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JAMES LANKFORD: Primarily that's an executive branch issue. The vetting process does exist and is out there. It's just a matter of its execution at this point or making...BUSTILLO: The suspected shooter was approved for asylum earlier this year, but it's unclear what additional vetting could've helped. He had previously worked for a unit of the CIA. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says the Afghan national had been radicalized after coming to the U.S. A spokesperson for the department told NPR the safety of the American people always comes first when asked about the policy changes. Still, some advocates, like VanDiver, say Congress is not doing enough to stand up for America's allies after a long war.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)VANDIVER: Instead of asserting its constitutional role, Congress has allowed itself to be sidelined, failing to provide meaningful oversight. The vacuum they have left is being filled with fearmongering, not facts, politics, not policy.BUSTILLO: Some lawmakers had added a bipartisan provision to the national defense policy bill that would've brought back a State Department office that relocates Afghan refugees, but House GOP leaders pulled it out of the bill that they voted on this past week.Ximena Bustillo, NPR News, Washington.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

A US District Court judge denied a preservation group's effort to put a pause on construction, but left the door open to a revised filing.   Trump celebrated with a social media post, writing \"Great news for America, and our wonderful White House! The Judge on the case of what will be the most beautiful Ballroom anywhere in the World, has just thrown out, and completely erased, the effort to stop its construction.\"   That's not exactly what Judge Richard Leon's opinion said.   \n   The National Trust for Historic Preservation argued the president hadn't followed proper procedure in tearing down the East Wing of the White House and soliciting private donations to fund the $300-million ballroom. In his opinion Leon wrote that he wasn't making a determination on the merits because of the way the suit had been framed. He concluded, saying that if the group were to amend its complaint \"the Court will expeditiously consider it and, if viable, address the merits of the novel and weighty issues presented.\"   The group responded with disappointment, but said they would continue pushing to halt construction.   \"While we are disappointed that the Court did not issue the preliminary injunction, we were pleased that Judge Leon ruled that the National Trust has standing to bring this lawsuit, as we have asserted from the start,\" Carol Quillen, president and CEO of the National Trust, said in a statement. \"We are also pleased that he encouraged us to amend our complaint—specifically, to assert that the President has acted beyond his statutory authority—and we plan to do so promptly.\"   The planned ballroom is designed to seat 1,000 guests and has long been a dream project for Trump. It generated massive controversy and public pushback, but recently got approval from the Commission of Fine Arts, an architectural review panel now packed with Trump allies. The commission voted to give it a final signoff despite not seeing the final design. It had received more than 2,000 public comments, which according to staff were 99% negative.   \n   The White House is also seeking approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, which will review ballroom plans at its next meeting on March 5. It is also dominated by Trump appointees and not expected to give final approval until April.   \"The Ballroom construction, which is anticipated to also handle future Inaugurations and large State Visits, is ahead of schedule, and under budget,\" Trump said in his post. \"It will stand long into the future as a symbol to the Greatness of America!\"\n",

    "body": "\n      In California, the two candidates with the most votes in the primary advance to the general election, regardless of party. That's an issue for Democrats who have nine major candidates for governor.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  California Governor Gavin Newsom knows he's widely considered a potential presidential candidate in 2028 because Newsom is term-limited. Something like a small army of Democrats is hoping to succeed him, but the party is worried that the state's unique primary system is leading to something unthinkable - a general election between two Republicans in the nation's largest blue state. Guy Marzorati from member station KQED has this report.GUY MARZORATI, BYLINE: Democratic activists bustled around San Francisco's massive Moscone Center convention hall last week, campaign workers setting up booths and hanging banners for the California Democratic Party Convention. The three-day event was a premiere showcase for the Democrats vying to be the state's next governor.RYAN PARVIZSHAHI: Right now, we have a pretty crowded field with Democrats running to replace Gavin Newsom.MARZORATI: Ryan Parvizshahi, a California political consultant, ran through some of the top names.PARVIZSHAHI: Eric Swalwell. He's a congressman out here in the Bay Area.MARZORATI: There's Tom Steyer, a billionaire philanthropist.PARVIZSHAHI: Matt Mahan, who's the mayor of San Jose.MARZORATI: Xavier Becerra, the former attorney general. Antonio Villaraigosa, the former mayor of LA.PARVIZSHAHI: And Katie Porter, former congresswoman.MARZORATI: And that's just on the Democratic side. There's also two leading Republicans - commentator Steve Hilton and Chad Bianco, the sheriff of Riverside County. In California, Democrats and Republicans appear on the ballot together in the primary. The two candidates who receive the most votes move on to the general election. A poll this week from a think tank, the Public Policy Institute of California, found three Democrats - Porter, Swalwell and Steyer - in a virtual tie with Republicans Hilton and Bianco.MARK BALDASSARE: No telling, at this point, who the top two candidates are going to be...MARZORATI: That's Mark Baldassare, the survey's director.BALDASSARE: ...And whether they're going to be Democrats or Republicans that are going to be running for governor in November.MARZORATI: The fractured vote means that, yes, two Republicans could advance to the general election in California.NANCY TUNG: You know, it's not a negligible concern.MARZORATI: Nancy Tung is the chair of the San Francisco Democratic Party.TUNG: Because, you know, the Republican vote is going to be split two ways versus the Democratic vote that could be split - I mean, we have nine major candidates. It could be split into pieces.MARZORATI: The idea of electing a Republican governor, which California hasn't done in 20 years, is starting to worry Tung.TUNG: If we don't have somebody in the top two, then that seems like a future that I don't want to acknowledge.MARZORATI: But other Democrats are less concerned. State party Chair Rusty Hicks says candidates can take clear steps to stand out.RUSTY HICKS: Those who are able to raise the resources to communicate a message, those who land significant endorsements and supporters.MARZORATI: By the time voting begins in May...HICKS: My guess is we're not going to have the same number of candidates truly competing for the support of California voters.MARZORATI: But candidates can't wait that long to get their names off the ballot. The deadline for that is next month. For NPR News, I'm Guy Marzorati in San Jose.(SOUNDBITE OF MINUTEMEN'S \"COHESION\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Legislators in most states want to regulate artificial intelligence and curb the sprawling, electricity-hungry data centers that make AI possible in the first place.   Big tech has \"scrambled the typical ideological alignments of the left and the right,\" says David Primo, a professor of political science and business administration at the University of Rochester in New York. \"Conservatives and liberals are saying, 'Well, here's an opportunity for us to stop what we think is a problem.'\"   \n   And while the two parties remain far apart on many issues — like tax policy, Primo says — it's not just big tech that has Republicans and Democrats aligned.   Regulating artificial intelligence   Ron DeSantis of Florida and Kathy Hochul of New York, two governors on opposite sides of the political spectrum, sound a lot alike when it comes to reining in AI.   DeSantis, a Republican, is backing legislation in Florida called the Artificial Intelligence Bill of Rights. The proposal, working its way through the state Senate, makes it illegal to use a person's name, image or likeness without their consent, requires anyone under 18 to have parental permission to engage with companion chatbots and mandates that bots remind users they're not talking to humans.   \"I really fear that if this is not addressed in an intelligent and proper way, you know, it could set off an age of darkness and deceit,\" DeSantis said when proposing the bill package. Tech companies have to be regulated, he says, because they have prioritized profits over user safety.   New York already requires chatbots to identify themselves as non-humans. This year, Hochul is pushing to further limit them. She wants to ban chatbots within social media apps for kids under 18. Other proposals would limit the way bots can interact with young people.   \n   \"We're going to disable certain companion features. You've heard about these, right?\" she asked an audience gathered at her high school alma mater earlier this year.   \"Under our proposals, we're removing that burden from parents and placing the responsibility where it belongs — on the shoulders of the app companies and the platforms themselves.\"   Late last year, Trump issued an executive order trying to prevent states from regulating AI on their own. But Republicans and Democrats in states are pressing ahead anyway. Nearly every state has a proposal to regulate AI. They range from requiring humans to oversee AI decisions about employees to blocking AI surveillance that could be used to set different prices for consumers.   Data center pushback    As the public's appetite for AI grows, so does the need for more data centers to handle the massive computing demands. That's a concern in states because data centers require substantial amounts of electricity and water to operate.   In Florida, lawmakers are raising issues about effects on the power grid and water use, and the possibility of passing higher utility costs along to residents, which the Republican-led state Senate is working to address. DeSantis says he thinks many of the arguments in favor of data centers, such as the idea that they'll drive job creation or lower property tax rates, are largely overblown.   South Dakota wants to make sure the state can't overrule local governments when it comes to regulating data centers. Oklahoma is also considering bills to limit the impact of data center growth.   As with the AI debate, Trump and most states have found themselves on opposite sides of the data center fight, too. Trump has largely been supportive of their growth, but says tech companies have to pay their own way. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, the president said, \"We're telling the major tech companies that they have the obligation to provide for their own power needs; they can build their own power plants as part of their factory.\" His administration wants to require tech companies building new centers to pay more for electricity to control price increases affecting consumers.   \n   Democratic lawmakers in New York and Maine are proposing a temporary ban on data centers, as are Republicans in Oklahoma.   The bill in New York is fairly new, but Hochul has announced the state's Public Service Commission will take a close look at the issue to ensure that data centers are \"paying their fair share.\"     In Colorado, a proposal would require data centers to use renewable energy for their operations. And many states, led by Republicans and Democrats alike, are considering expanding nuclear energy to help power AI.   Tech companies are opposing many of these proposals and putting money into political campaigns. They say it would be impossible to follow different laws in each state and that regulations could stifle innovation that could benefit the public.   Housing   Nationwide, the rising cost of housing is also a concern for both parties. In Florida, a bill to loosen restrictions on accessory dwelling units received full bipartisan support in the state Senate. DeSantis wants to address the affordable housing crisis by cutting property taxes. That isn't sitting well with Democrats in the state who say they worry about the impact on local governments. They say decreasing property insurance rates would be a better path.   Lawmakers in New York and other states are trying to streamline environmental regulations. Dozens of states are considering proposals to cut building regulations, strengthen tenants' rights and improve conditions in rental housing. In other words, when it comes to housing, lawmakers across the political spectrum are embracing ideas usually popular with one party or the other.\n",

The Republican-led committee subpoenaed Clinton, and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, to appear in its investigation into convicted sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.    The former president will take questions Friday from the committee.   In a short press conference following the deposition, Hillary Clinton said she wished the proceedings had been public and that she and her attorneys have asked for transcripts and videos to be available as soon as possible.   \n   \"It was disappointing that they refused to hold a public hearing so I wouldn't have to be out here characterizing it for you,\" she told reporters outside the Chappaqua Performing Arts Center in New York where the hearing took place. \"You could have seen it for yourself. We had asked for that. We think it would have been better for the committee and its efforts to gather whatever information they are seeking.\"    Lamenting what she called \"repetitive\" questioning, Clinton said she would not appear before the committee again, even if the deposition were public.    \"I don't know how many times I had to say I did not know Jeffrey Epstein. I never went to his island, I never went to his home, I never went to his offices,\" she said. The former president, her husband Bill, did have a friendship with Epstein and photographs of him appear in the Epstein files. Bill Clinton has not be accused of wrongdoing.    Clinton said by the end of the hearing, Republicans were asking her off-topic questions about UFOs and the pizzagate conspiracy theory that falsely claimed some high-profile Democrats were involved in a child sex-trafficiking ring.    In a preview of what lawmakers may hear from former President Bill Clinton Friday, Hillary Clinton said she was confident that Bill Clinton knew nothing about Epstein's criminal history and that her husband's relationship with Epstein ended \"several years before anything about Epstein's criminal history came to light.\"    \n   She added Epstein was given a sweetheart deal when he was initially charged and convicted in 2008 of soliciting sex from underage girls in Florida.    \"I think it is fair to say that the vast majority of people who had contact with him before his criminal pleas in '08, they did not know what he was doing,\" Clinton said, \"and I think that that is exactly what my husband will testify to tomorrow.\"    Committee Chair, Kentucky Republican Rep. James Comer, said he hopes to have the video publicly available within the next 24 hours. The transcript, Comer said, will be published once Clinton's attorneys approve it, which are the standard rules of a deposition.    Despite a brief interruption shortly after the proceedings started, when Clinton halted the deposition after a photo from inside the room was posted by a conservative influencer on X, the questioning ultimately continued with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.    Speaking after the deposition, Comer and his fellow Republicans said it was  productive and that Clinton answered most of their questions but that it \"was a shame\" that it took months to get the Clintons to agree to testify.    \"I think we learned a lot. There were a lot of questions that we asked that we, you know, weren't satisfied with the answers that we got, but we will continue to move forward,\" Comer said.    Comer said there were a number of times Clinton responded with \"I don't know, you'll have to ask my husband.\" And that is exactly what he plans to do on Friday.   \"We have a lot of questions for her husband tomorrow, and I'm confident that deposition will last even longer than this one,\" Comer said.\n",

The rules slash requirements for security and environmental protections.\n                \n                    Idaho National Laboratory/Collage by Joan Wong for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Idaho National Laboratory/Collage by Joan Wong for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   The Department of Energy has made public a set of new rules that slash environmental and security requirements for experimental nuclear reactors.   Last month, NPR reported on the existence of the rules, which were quietly rewritten to accelerate development of a new generation of nuclear reactor designs.   The rule changes came about after President Trump signed an executive order calling for three or more of the experimental reactors to come online by July 4 of this year — an incredibly tight deadline in the world of nuclear power. The order led to the creation of a new Reactor Pilot Program at the Department of Energy.   \n   Commercial nuclear reactors have historically been regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which is known for its public process. The Energy Department rules had applied to a small number of experimental reactors on government property. The pilot program extends that authority to a larger set of experimental commercial designs. It also expands where those reactors can be built: several are under construction outside of the department's national laboratories.   To help facilitate Trump's deadline, Energy Department officials rewrote the internal rules. It shared the rules with ten companies who were part of the pilot program, but the rewritten rules, and even their existence, was not known to the public until NPR obtained copies of them.   The rules are now public on the Energy Department's Idaho Operations Office website, located at Idaho National Laboratory, which is running the Reactor Pilot Program for the department. The website also contains standards and policy documents that were revised for the program.   \n   The department notified NPR of their publication in response to a Freedom of Information Act request calling for their release.   \"DOE has recently completed the process of making these Nuclear Energy Orders and Standards publicly available to ensure broad public access,\" the Department of Energy wrote to NPR in a letter on Wednesday.   \"The U.S. Department of Energy posted the [Nuclear Energy] Orders earlier this year,\" an Energy Department spokesperson wrote to NPR in a separate statement. \"They collectively demonstrate the tremendous strides the Department has made under President Trump's leadership to modernize the DOE authorization process while maintaining safety and security standards.\"   \n   \"This is long overdue,\" said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"The public has the right to understand what the directives are that DOE is using to authorize these experimental reactors.\"   The rules, known as orders, define requirements for almost every aspect of the reactors' operations — including safety systems, environmental protections and site security.   NPR's review of the rules found substantial changes that experts warned had the potential to undermine safety, security and environmental protections at the new reactors. The orders slashed hundreds of pages of requirements for training guards and securing nuclear material. They also loosened protections for things like groundwater.    Loading... \n   In total, the new orders cut 750 pages from the earlier versions of the rules, according to NPR's analysis. That means roughly two-thirds of the original pages were eliminated.   In a statement responding to NPR's story in January, the Department of Energy said that early copies of the rules were shared with the companies as part of an \"iterative effort\" to develop a framework to \"expedite our review process while maintaining safety and security standards.\"    Loading... \n   (The orders seen by NPR in January were not marked as drafts and had the word \"Approved\" clearly displayed on their cover pages.)   In the month since NPR's original story, companies involved with the reactor program have rushed ahead with construction of their experimental designs. Two companies, Antares Nuclear and Radiant Industries, have announced they had completed a crucial step known as a Preliminary Documented Safety Analysis with the Energy Department regulators. Both companies say they are on track to start up their reactors this summer. A third called Aalo says it has completed its Final Design Review and hopes to finalize construction this summer.    Meanwhile, California-based Valar Atomics flew their reactor prototype on a military C-17 transport to Utah earlier this month. The Pentagon is looking to deploy small reactors to military bases as part of a separate program known as project Janus.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                An experimental reactor built by Valar Atomics sits inside a C-17 Globemaster. The Pentagon recently transported the reactor without its nuclear fuel from California to Hill Air Force Base in Utah.\n                \n                    Defense Department/Via X\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Defense Department/Via X\n    \n\n   \n   Lyman says he continues to be concerned that the new rules and tight deadlines threaten safety.   \n   \"My concern is that, in the rush to fulfill President Trump's order, they are slashing the procedures that would normally be used to ensure the safety and security case for these reactors,\" he said.   \n   But administration officials like Secretary of Energy Chris Wright remain bullish that the program can safely spark nuclear innovation.   \"Before July fourth of this year, we will have multiple nuclear reactors critical,\" Wright said at a public event on February 15 at Hill Air Force Base in Utah. \"That's speed. That's innovation. That's the start of a nuclear renaissance.\"   Contact Geoff Brumfiel on Signal at gbrumfiel.13\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks with Sen. Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, about his continued efforts to limit President Trump's ability to use military force through war powers resolutions.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, BYLINE: It's in Article 1, Section 8, Clause 11 where the U.S. Constitution empowers Congress, not the president, to declare war. Of course, anyone versed in recent U.S. history will know that U.S. presidents have authorized plenty of military action without Congress signing off first. One timely example - last year, the U.S. struck three nuclear sites in Iran, joining Israel in its fight against the country. And right now, the U.S. has massively built up military forces in the Middle East. This week, the U.S. is also conducting diplomatic talks with Iran, which could end in a nuclear deal or could end with more violence.In the Senate, Democrat Tim Kaine of Virginia and Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky have filed a war powers resolution to prevent the president from attacking Iran without congressional approval. Senator Kaine joins us now. Welcome back to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.TIM KAINE: Ailsa, great to be with you. Thanks.CHANG: Great to have you. So when do you expect to vote on this resolution?KAINE: Ailsa, it will happen early next week. Even as I sit here talking to you, it's being negotiated, but it will be in the first couple of days of next week when we're back in session Monday.CHANG: OK, but I have to ask because previous votes on war powers resolutions - like over Venezuela, over last year's strikes on Iran - they have failed. Almost all Republicans have voted against them. So why does this moment feel any different to you?KAINE: Well, first, whether they succeed or fail, we shouldn't be at war without a vote, and so members of Congress should be held accountable. Secondly, we learn, and particularly in the Venezuela vote. In the Senate, we actually got enough votes - Democrat plus some Republicans initially - and then a few Republicans got convinced to change their minds in some subsequent votes. But it changed the president's behavior. After the first vote, within a few hours he canceled a second strike on Venezuela. And he also agreed finally to have a public hearing to send Secretary Rubio up to discuss what, in fact, was the mission, what were the goals, what would success look like.And so I very much learned from that effort, even though we ultimately were not successful, that forcing a vote and a debate on these matters brings it more to the public's attention, where the public can decide whether a mission's in the national interest. And it can even change the behavior of the administration.CHANG: But I want to share a statement from a fellow Democrat. This is Congressman Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, who's opposed to an equivalent war powers resolution in the House. And he writes, quote, \"this resolution would restrict the flexibility needed to respond to real and evolving threats and risks, signaling weakness at a dangerous moment.\" What do you say to your colleague there about that?KAINE: I'm on the Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee, and I'm in the classified facility all the time hearing about risks, and I hear nothing whatsoever about any risks right now that Iran poses to the United States that are at a sufficient level that we should allow a president to take our sons and daughters into war without a debate by Congress.CHANG: Well, during the State of the Union address, President Trump said that Iran is developing missiles that may soon be able to reach the U.S. and that Iran is restarting its nuclear program. How much has the Trump administration shared evidence of those claims with lawmakers like you?KAINE: Well, let's take both. So how about the nuclear program? First, we had controlled Iran's nuclear program by a diplomatic deal that we entered into with our allies, with adversaries like China and Russia and Iran. President Trump tore up the deal. President Trump, after a 12-day bombing campaign by Israel over the summer, used U.S. assets to bomb Iranian nuclear sites and claimed that the Iranian nuclear program was obliterated. That was just six months ago. So now all of a sudden, their nuclear program poses such a threat that we can't even have a debate and vote in Congress? It makes no sense.With respect to the missiles, they are developing missiles, which they may use at some time against the United States. There's so many hypotheticals in there, and the overmatch we have is such that Iran knows this. If they were to use a missile against the United States, which they haven't, it would be a catastrophe for them.CHANG: OK, but given what you know now about the situation in Iran and whatever threat they do or might pose to the U.S. militarily, what would you want to see the U.S. military do at this point? Is there anything justifiable in your mind right now?KAINE: I would say, provide defense support to nations in the region. But we shouldn't commit our own children to yet another war in the Middle East when 25 years of war in the Middle East has produced so little for this country and so little for the region.CHANG: OK. As we mentioned, there is a U.S. delegation in Geneva right now...KAINE: Yes.CHANG: ...In talks with Iran. What about concerns that this debate in Congress about limiting presidential power - what about concerns that that might reduce the U.S.'s leverage in those diplomatic talks? Could they?KAINE: Well, you know, a war is a good idea or a bad idea, and if it's a bad idea, I don't think you should bluff it to try to, you know, get the upper hand in a negotiation. It's a bad idea, in this case, in my view. That - but the fact of the discussions even today is one of the reasons why even though my resolution was ripe for voting this week, we decided a few days out in the future, likely next week, would be preferable. Let that negotiation proceed.CHANG: Yeah.KAINE: Let's do all we can to do what we did 10 years ago and find a diplomatic deal to avoid the need for war.CHANG: You oppose the Trump administration's claiming of powers that you believe belong to Congress constitutionally. You also oppose war - war with Iran and the repression by the regime in Iran. So then, what is your larger preferred path forward here when it comes to the regime there?KAINE: Well, look, I do think the tools that we have, the sanctions tools and others, have made a huge impact on the regime. And it's put the regime in a place, as was the case in 2016. The regime came to the table and negotiated the nuclear deal not because of the threat of war. What was real was the sanctions' effect on the Iranian economy. That brought them to the table. We reached that deal. But then we also maintain the ability to use sanctions against Iran for nonnuclear activity - missiles, you know, crackdowns on human rights.CHANG: Right.KAINE: So I think we should try to return to that. Let's get a deal on the nuclear program and then use these other tools that we have to try to deal with nonnuclear activities that are causing instability in the region.CHANG: Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, thank you very much for joining us, and happy birthday.KAINE: Hey, thanks so much.

Two years ago, Republican Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama accepted what is often called the worst assignment in politics — rebutting the president's State of the Union address.   The televised response, broadcast live from Britt's tidy kitchen in Montgomery, was the Alabama freshman's introduction to a national audience, and what many viewers saw was an over-the-top firebrand, parodied as a \"scary mom\" by actress Scarlett Johansson on Saturday Night Live.   \"The American dream has turned into a nightmare for so many families,\" Britt said in the speech.   \n   Standing in as her party's pick to rebut the president, ahead of his reelection bid no less, is a daunting task for any up-and-coming politician, but even some Republicans described Britt's performance with words like baffling and bizarre.   Colleagues say this initial caricature of Britt as a hyper-partisan MAGA mom is simply untrue. In the Senate, Britt has been building a different reputation — as a bipartisan dealmaker.   Now Britt is helping negotiate changes to how immigration agents operate after the deadly shootings of two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis as Democrats refuse to fund the Department of Homeland Security without reforms. The department has now been shut down for more than 10 days.   And at a time of deep polarization, this moment is testing how far Britt, and other lawmakers, are willing to go to tackle knotty policy problems captivating national attention.   A front row seat   Veteran Alabama political columnist Steve Flowers first met Britt when she was a teenager attending a prestigious girls leadership program. Flowers was so impressed, he called up his old friend, Alabama's long-serving Republican senator, Richard Shelby.   \"And I said, 'Shelby, I just met a young woman who's got U.S. Senator or governor written all over her.\"   \n   Britt went to work on Capitol Hill for Shelby, who for years was the top Republican on the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, a group so bipartisan in nature that Hill veterans are known to joke about three categories of lawmakers — Republicans, Democrats and appropriators.   Shelby taught young aides that your word is your bond and making deals across the aisle hinges on trust, and often, genuine friendship. Shelby and his counterpart on the committee, former Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., were like brothers, Flowers said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Vice President Kamala Harris swears in Katie Britt for the 118th Congress on Jan. 3, 2023. At 40 years old, Britt became the youngest Republican woman elected to the Senate.\n                \n                    Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"Quite frankly, it's the ingredient that is necessary for any of that to come together,\" says Dayne Cutrell, a former Shelby staffer who overlapped with Britt. \"Not only does she see it because of who she is, but she had a front row seat to somebody that was able to do it for years to the benefit of the state.\"   Cutrell remembers when Britt eventually became Shelby's chief of staff, she made a point of meeting with all 99 other Senate chiefs. \"And not only did she do it, she did it in like two weeks,\" Cutrell said.   When Shelby retired after 2022, Britt, at 40 years old, became the youngest Republican woman elected to the Senate. In her Capitol Hill office, Britt displays a gold-framed handbill from Shelby's first campaign for the Alabama Senate in 1970. Her desk was once Shelby's – and before that, Lyndon B. Johnson's.   \"Now that she is a member, she is the same person that wants to know not just you as an individual, but your family and what makes you tick and why it's important,\" Cutrell said.   \"Anybody can go sit in a corner\"   That's in part why Britt was able to help bring Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., onto a deal to end the record-long government shutdown last fall, despite deep opposition from others in his party. The pair already had a relationship from drafting legislation on affordable child care.   \n   \"I was testing ideas with her, and when it looked like things might break down, [she would say] 'Hey come on let's keep talking.' We may disagree, but I'll get a read on where's the caucus, where's the White House likely to be on this, and that's helpful,\" Kaine said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Britt speaks on the phone at the National Prayer Breakfast in the Kennedy Caucus Room on Capitol Hill on Feb. 05. Britt says her constituents sent her to Washington to find compromise. \"Anybody can go sit in a corner,\" she says.\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   At a time when compromise seems to have little political upside, why wade in? Britt says that is what her constituents sent her to Washington to do.   \"Anybody can go sit in a corner,\" Britt said in an interview. \"Two-year-olds do it best, and we have a lot of people that are taking their ball and sitting in the corner. And I just think it's too critical of a moment in our country's history to do that.\"   A delicate balance    For many members, the latest inflection point in the country was the Trump administration's aggressive immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.   For Britt, it was the viral image of a five-year-old boy in a bunny hat and Spiderman backpack being detained by federal officers there that she could not shake — so much so that she raised questions about the incident with the administration.   There were reports that federal officers were using the boy to lure other potential targets for arrest. Britt's office scheduled a call with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, first reported by The New York Times. Britt said Noem assured her that was not true.   And Britt has refrained from mentioning the boy in her public remarks, instead focusing on criticizing Democrats for refusing to fund the Department of Homeland Security amid negotiations.   \"I'm over it,\" Britt told her colleagues recently on the floor. \"Everybody on that side of the aisle knows that ICE and CBP will continue to be funded. They're going to continue to enforce the law just as they should. Who's going to pay the price? It's the TSA agent, it's the person working at FEMA.\"   \n   That message has frustrated Democratic negotiators who were already irked when Britt called their demands a \"ridiculous Christmas list.\"   \"My wish is for my Republican colleagues to be just as upset as they are about what is going to happen at TSA or FEMA as for the children that are being traumatized right now,\" responded Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., Britt's counterpart on the appropriations subcommittee on homeland security.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., talks to Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., during a March 29, 2023 hearing on Capitol Hill.\n                \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Murphy and Britt worked together to negotiate the homeland security funding bill that was set to pass with bipartisan support before the deadly shootings in Minneapolis.   Senate Republicans have signaled that much of the back and forth so far has been directly between Democrats and the White House — and there have been few signs of progress in recent days.   Democrats and Republicans say Britt's appeal as an emerging mediator comes not only from trust she has built across the aisle, but also with her party's leadership in the Senate and the White House.   Maintaining all three is a delicate balance.   In 2025 Britt voted in line with President Trump 100% of the time on legislation he took a position on, according to Congressional Quarterly.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Britt listens as President Trump speaks in the Oval Office on Oct.16, 2025. Britt has been a reliable vote for the president's agenda, but criticized a racist video posted on his social media.\n                \n                    Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   But she was one of a few Republicans to criticize a racist video posted on President Trump's social media, which depicted former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama as apes. Britt said the video \"should have never been posted to begin with, and is not who we are as a nation.\"   Trump saw the critical comment as disloyalty, according to CNN, a report Britt's office called \"fake news.\"   Ideologues and facilitators    Flowers, the Alabama columnist, sees two types of senators: idealogues: \"You may have one who will be a Fox News-chasing publicity hound who wants to be known as a right-wing fire eater,\" he said.   And facilitators, like Shelby. \"That's what Katie's role will be: bring home the bacon, get things done for Alabama, as well as voting conservative,\" Flowers said.   \n   Flowers says it is not as easy to be a facilitator as it was in Shelby's day. He said he hopes Britt won't be pulled away from her approach as she steps further onto the national stage.   \"I think it is harder now to do that, but maybe she can balance it,\" Flowers said. \"She doesn't owe Trump anything. She'll be there long after Trump's gone.\"\n",

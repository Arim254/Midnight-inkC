In an unprecedented gathering, almost 800 generals, admirals and their senior enlisted leaders have been ordered into one location from around the world on short notice.\n                \n                    Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is ordering troops to watch or read his speech last month at Quantico, Va., when he declared the \"woke\" military is gone, decried \"fat generals\" and ordered women in the military to meet the \"highest male standards\" for physical fitness.   The memo, obtained by NPR, calls for servicemembers to complete the \"Warrior Ethos Tasking,\" which includes a link to the video and updated policy memorandums, by the end of the month. The policy memorandums lay out in detail his plans to enhance physical fitness, grooming standards and military readiness.   The memo states, \"All commanders must document the completion of the Warrior Ethos Tasking in a Memorandum for Record.\"   \n   When asked for comment, a Defense Department official, not authorized to speak publicly, said by e-mail, \"The Secretary's speech was for the whole force and this memo just reinforces that guidance.\"   \n   Hegseth spoke on Sept. 30 to hundreds of generals and admirals who were ordered from commands all around the world to an auditorium at Marine Base Quantico.   'Era of Defense Department is over'    Walking back and forth on a stage, with a massive American flag as a backdrop, Hegseth declared, \"Today we end the war on warriors.\" He said \"the era of the Defense Department is over,\" said the new name will be the Department of War, and indicated the Pentagon would shift to a more aggressive culture.   Hegseth, a 45-year-old Army National Guard veteran and former Fox News host, said the U.S. military has promoted too many leaders for the wrong reasons based on race, gender quotas and \"historic firsts.\"   \"Frankly, it's tiring to look out at combat formations, or really any formation, and see fat troops. Likewise, it's completely unacceptable to see fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon,\" Hegseth said.   \"Today is another liberation day, the liberation of America's warriors,\" Hegseth said. \"You are not politically correct and don't necessarily always belong in polite society. We are purpose built.\"   \n   The generals and admirals all sat stone-faced as Hegseth spoke. And then they continued that stoical stance when President Trump then addressed them.   \"I never walked into a room so silent before,\" Trump said. \"If you want to applaud, you applaud. You can do anything you want.\"   But a source not authorized to speak publicly tells NPR that before both speeches, and before the cameras were turned on, Joint Chiefs Chairman General Dan Caine told the assembled officers they were to treat the speeches as if they were at the State of the Union, where the Joint Chiefs also show no emotion, keeping with the military's traditional nonpartisan position.\n",

The formation of the group touches off a new chapter in a partisan battle over public health measures that has been heightened by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s advisers declining to recommend COVID-19 vaccinations, instead leaving the choice to the individual.   \n   Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in an email that Democratic governors who imposed school closures and mask mandates, including for toddlers, at the height of the pandemic, are the ones who \"destroyed public trust in public health.\"   \"The Trump Administration and Secretary Kennedy are rebuilding that trust by grounding every policy in rigorous evidence and Gold Standard Science — not the failed politics of the pandemic,\" Nixon said.   The initial members are all Democrats   The Governors Public Health Alliance bills itself as a \"nonpartisan coordinating hub,\" but the initial members are all Democrats — the governors of 15 states plus Guam.   Among them are governors of the most populous blue states, California and New York, and several governors who are considered possible 2028 presidential candidates, including California's Gavin Newsom, Illinois' JB Pritzker and Maryland's Moore.   \n   The idea of banding together for public health isn't new for Democratic governors. They formed regional groups to address the pandemic during Trump's first term and launched new ones in recent months amid uncertainty on federal vaccine policy. States have also taken steps to preserve access to COVID-19 vaccines.   The new alliance isn't intended to supplant those efforts, or the coordination already done by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, its organizers say.   A former CDC director is among the advisers   Dr. Mandy Cohen, who was CDC director under former President Joe Biden and before that the head of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, is part of a bipartisan group of advisers to the alliance.   \n   \"The CDC did provide an important backstop for expertise and support,\" she said. \"And I think now with some of that gone, it's important for states to make sure that they are sharing best practices, and that they are coordinating, because the problems have not gone away. The health threats have not gone away.\"   Other efforts have also sprung up to try to fill roles that the CDC performed before the ouster of a director, along with other restructuring and downsizing.   The Governors Public Health Alliance has support from GovAct, a nonprofit, nonpartisan donor-funded initiative that also has projects aimed at protecting democracy and another partisan hot-button issue, reproductive freedom.\n",

U.S. forces have destroyed at least five boats since early September, killing 27 people, and four of those vessels originated from Venezuela.   Asked during an event in the Oval Office on Wednesday why he had authorized the CIA to take action in Venezuela, Trump affirmed he had made the move.   \n   \"I authorized for two reasons, really,\" Trump replied. \"No. 1, they have emptied their prisons into the United States of America,\" he said. \"And the other thing, the drugs, we have a lot of drugs coming in from Venezuela, and a lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in through the sea.\"   Trump added the administration \"is looking at land\" as it considers further strikes in the region. He declined to say whether the CIA has authority to take action against President Nicolás Maduro.   Trump made the unusual acknowledgement of a CIA operation shortly after The New York Times published that the CIA had been authorized to carry out covert action in Venezuela.   Maduro pushes back   On Wednesday, Maduro lashed out at the record of the U.S. spy agency in various conflicts around the world without directly addressing Trump's comments about authorizing the CIA to carry out covert operations in Venezuela.   \"No to regime change that reminds us so much of the (overthrows) in the failed eternal wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and so on,\" Maduro said at a televised event of the National Council for Sovereignty and Peace, which is made up of representatives from various political, economic, academic and cultural sectors in Venezuela.   \n   \"No to the coups carried out by the CIA, which remind us so much of the 30,000 disappeared,\" a figure estimated by human rights organizations such as the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo during the military dictatorship in Argentina (1976-1983). He also referred to the 1973 coup in Chile.   \"How long will the CIA continue to carry on with its coups? Latin America doesn't want them, doesn't need them and repudiates them,\" Maduro added.   The objective is \"to say no to war in the Caribbean, no to war in South America, yes to peace,\" he said.   \n   Speaking in English, Maduro said: \"Not war, yes peace, not war. Is that how you would say it? Who speaks English? Not war, yes peace, the people of the United States, please. Please, please, please.\"   In a statement, Venezuela's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday rejected \"the bellicose and extravagant statements by the President of the United States, in which he publicly admits to having authorized operations to act against the peace and stability of Venezuela.\"   \"This unprecedented statement constitutes a very serious violation of international law and the United Nations' Charter and obliges the community of countries to denounce these clearly immoderate and inconceivable statements,\" said the statement, which Foreign Minister Yván Gil posted on his Telegram channel.   Resistance from Congress   Early this month, the Trump administration declared drug cartels to be unlawful combatants and pronounced the United States is now in an \"armed conflict\" with them, justifying the military action as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States.   The move has spurred anger in Congress from members of both major political parties that Trump was effectively committing an act of war without seeking congressional authorization.   On Wednesday, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said while she supports cracking down on trafficking, the administration has gone too far.   \n   \"The Trump administration's authorization of covert C.I.A. action, conducting lethal strikes on boats and hinting at land operations in Venezuela slides the United States closer to outright conflict with no transparency, oversight or apparent guardrails,\" Shaheen said. \"The American people deserve to know if the administration is leading the U.S. into another conflict, putting servicemembers at risk or pursuing a regime-change operation.\"   The Trump administration has yet to provide underlying evidence to lawmakers proving that the boats targeted by the U.S. military were in fact carrying narcotics, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the matter.   The officials, who were not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the administration has only pointed to unclassified video clips of the strikes posted on social media by Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and has yet to produce \"hard evidence\" that the vessels were carrying drugs.   \n   Lawmakers have expressed frustration that the administration is offering little detail about how it came to decide the U.S. is in armed conflict with cartels or which criminal organizations it claims are \"unlawful combatants.\"   Even as the U.S. military has carried out strikes on some vessels, the U.S. Coast Guard has continued with its typical practice of stopping boats and seizing drugs.   Trump on Wednesday explained away the action, saying the traditional approach hasn't worked.   \"Because we've been doing that for 30 years, and it has been totally ineffective. They have faster boats,\" he said. \"They're world-class speedboats, but they're not faster than missiles.\"   Human rights groups have raised concerns that the strikes flout international law and are extrajudicial killings.\n",

The races are often seen as a test of voter sentiment, but just weeks out from the election, two late-emerging issues in Virginia may be reshaping that state's contest.   Abigail Spanberger, a former member of Congress, is the Democratic candidate, and Winsome Earle-Sears, the Republican candidate, is the commonwealth's current lieutenant governor.   Democrats are hopeful that history may be on their side. The party in power in the White House typically loses the race for governor in Virginia. That trend, plus frustrations over the government shutdown and the Trump administration's effect on the state's large federal workforce, could propel them over the finish line.   \n   Meanwhile, Republicans may have received a boost from reporting on violent text messages sent in 2022 by the Democratic candidate for attorney general, first published in the National Review..   The stakes of the election are high. Governors have become key figures in either supporting the Trump administration's policies or opposing them. The parties' successes or failures at the top of the ticket are likely to impact down-ballot races.   Democrats focus on the economy and the federal workforce    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Democratic candidate for governor, former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, addresses a small get-out-the-vote rally on the first day of early voting outside the Eastern Government Center on Sept. 19, 2025, in Henrico, Va.\n                \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   In the one-and-only candidate debate in the race, Spanberger highlighted the rising cost of living in Virginia and voter anxiety over the Trump administration's cuts to the federal workforce, themes her campaign has hammered for months.   That's for good reason: federal cuts are having a significant impact in Virginia, home to about 320,000 federal workers, and many others who work on federal contracts. During the government shutdown, many workers are feeling the squeeze through furloughs or working without pay.   And since July, about 11,000 Virginia-based federal jobs have been lost, according data from the University of Virginia's Weldon Cooper Center for Public Policy. That doesn't include laid-off federal workers who live in Virginia but work in D.C.   The Trump administration's decision to lay off thousands more federal workers during the shutdown, a move now paused in court, has put many Virginia Democrats in a mood to fight. At a town hall earlier this month in Northern Virginia, dozens of federal workers and contractors told Congressman Suhas Subramanyam, a Democrat, they wanted him to continue the shutdown and stand up to Republicans in Washington. After the event, several voters told NPR they were feeling motivated to participate in the Virginia election.   \n   \"There's not much I can do on a federal level, but on a state level, I do have some influence,\" said Marsha Peltz. She said her son lost his job in the federal government in the spring. \"So I'm encouraging my neighbors, please go out and vote, please volunteer.\"   The upheavals in government employment and contracting have created a \"very, very damaging environment for Republicans\" in the Virginia November election, said Stephen Farnsworth, a professor of political science at the University of Mary Washington. Spanberger, he noted, has led in most public polling by close to 10 points throughout the race.   \"A year ago, the economy was a great benefit to Republicans when they could talk about the Biden economy,\" Farnsworth said. \"But a year later, with a Republican governor and a Republican president, the Democrats are the ones who have the advantage in the economic conversation.\"   Spanberger is doing all she can to capitalize on the moment, calling out Earle-Sears for continuing to seek Trump's endorsement.   \"My opponent refused to call on President Trump to stop this chaos. Virginians saw with their own eyes that Winsome Earle-Sears' loyalty to Donald Trump will always come first, no matter the cost to Virginians and their families,\" the Spanberger campaign said in a statement after news of a fresh wave of federal layoffs broke. \"That's not leadership — that's betraying the people of Virginia who she was elected to serve.\"   Earle-Sears has been broadly supportive of Trump's cuts to the federal workforce. She says the commonwealth should be able to weather the job losses because of the Youngkin administration's focus on job creation in the private sector. She has criticized Spanberger for not calling on Virginia Democrats in Congress to end the shutdown.   \"So my opponent, all summer long, has been playing political football with federal workers by trying to say that she loves them more than anyone else,\" Earle-Sears said on the debate stage. \"Let me tell you what love looks like. It looks like Abigail calling Senators Kaine and Warner and telling them, 'Go back, do your job, and vote against a government shutdown.' \"   \n   Republicans decry violent text messages   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Virginia Republican candidate for governor, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, arrives on stage before addressing supporters during a primary night rally at the Hippodrome Theater on June 17, in Richmond, Va.\n                \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Win McNamee/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   The Earle-Sears campaign is seeking to capitalize on news of a series of violent text messages from Democratic candidate for Attorney General Jay Jones. In the messages, which were sent to a Republican member of the House of Delegates in 2022, Jones describes the then-Republican speaker of the House of Delegates hypothetically being shot in the head with two bullets. The National Review reported Jones also said he wanted the Republican's children to die in order to compel him to move on policy. Jones has apologized for what he said in the messages, expressed remorse and said the messages were unacceptable   Virginia Republicans say the scandal is an indicator of what they believe is Democrats' tolerance for political violence, a potent argument to energize conservative voters still reeling from the assassination of right-wing political activist Charlie Kirk.   \"It's going to fire up a whole lot of infrequent, probably right-of-center to conservative voters that are not Republican consistent voters,\" said Zack Roday, a partner at Republican-leaning strategic communications firm Ascent Media.   Virginia Republicans, President Trump, and multiple law enforcement associations have called for Jones to drop out. Spanberger and other prominent Democrats have condemned the messages, but have not said he should leave the race.   Early voting is well underway, with more than 400,000 votes cast.   Roday said the issue also calls into question Spanberger's leadership and principles.   \"This is a crisis for Democrats to handle, and they have no answer for it,\" he said.   At the gubernatorial debate, Spanberger repeated her condemnation of the messages but refused to retract her endorsement of Jones, saying Jones is running his own race and voters should decide what to do with the information.   It's not clear yet how significantly the news could impact the top-of-the-ticket contest, though Republicans are doing all they can to ensure that it will. The Earle-Sears campaign is now running ads tying Spanberger to Jones, featuring a clip of Spanberger telling a group of supporters to \"let your rage fuel you\" — a quote she has used on the stump as part of a larger call to supporters to volunteer for her campaign. The Republican ad concludes, \"Reject insanity. Vote Republican.\"   \n   Debate over transgender students in public schools   Roday also pointed to \"a narrative shift\" in the race as Earle-Sears has ramped up calls to ban transgender students from girls' sports, bathrooms, and locker rooms in public schools. She's criticized Spanberger for supporting \"boys and men in girls' spaces\" and showed up at school board meetings in blue school districts in Northern Virginia to protest gender-expansive policies.   \"We, as women, want our private spaces. There's nothing hard about that,\" Earle-Sears told reporters following an appearance at a Moms for Liberty event in Fairfax County.   That message is appealing to voters like Ursula Baukol, a self-described \"moderate conservative\" and federal contractor who attended the gathering.   \"It just seems that now there's more of a push … of the schools to over-insert themselves in the whole sort of sexuality issues,\" she told NPR. She said she believes Virginia schools are sharing content about sexuality and gender too early.   Spanberger has called for the state government to stay out of decisions about who uses what bathrooms and locker rooms, arguing that's best left up to parents, teachers, students, and their school districts. While she's generally avoided transgender issues on the campaign trail, she's also sought to portray Earle-Sears' record on same-sex marriage as out of step with Virginians' support for marriage equality. At the debate, Spanberger brought up written comments from Earle-Sears expressing that she was \"morally opposed\" to same-sex marriage.   \"That's not discrimination!\" Earle-Sears responded. Her campaign said afterward that she believes marriage equality to be \"settled law.\"   Focusing on transgender students may help with Republican turnout, but it's not clear how important it is to voters overall. Virginia voters tend to agree with Earle-Sears about girls' spaces, but they put the debate far down on the list of top issues in the race, according to polling from The Washington Post and George Mason University. The economy claimed the top spot.\n",

In the last few weeks alone, prosecutors secured indictments against former FBI Director Jim Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. The White House has signaled more cases may be on the way.   \n   For those defendants, the costs of fighting criminal charges in a high-profile case are enormous, and they can reverberate for years, according to veteran attorneys who represent people in the headlines.   Lisa Wayne has tried 150 cases before juries in the course of her decades-long career. Wayne, now executive director of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said there's \"no golden rule\" when it comes to how expensive the legal bills might be.   The cost depends on what charges a person faces, where they live, how experienced their lawyer is and whether that person needs to hire experts in advance of trial, she said.   \n   \"Most people have to figure out, out of pocket,\" Wayne said. \"And figure out, do they have the savings? Do they have friends and family that can help them? Do they take mortgages on their homes? It can be a very stressful situation for most individuals.\"   Three other longtime criminal lawyers put the estimate at between $1 million and $5 million at a small law firm, to $25 million or more at a large one.   Trump himself spoke about some $100 million in legal fees that he faced after his first term in office, for indictments in two federal cases and state charges in New York and Georgia.   \n   Help from former trial partner or a defense fund   Comey, a former deputy U.S. attorney general and longtime federal prosecutor, turned to his former trial partner for help. Patrick Fitzgerald, who famously led the U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago and went on to a lucrative partnership at the Skadden law firm, came out of retirement to help defend Comey.   In private practice, Fitzgerald likely commanded more than $2,000 an hour for his legal work. Now, he's able to set his own rates and may be working not quite for free, but nowhere near full price.   \n   Then there's Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California. Schiff is a longtime critic who helped investigate Trump during the president's first term in office. Now, Schiff is under investigation for alleged mortgage fraud.   \n   Trump took note in recent remarks from the Oval Office. \"Looks like Adam Schiff really did a bad thing. They have him. Now let's see what happens.\"   The key issue is that Schiff owns homes in both California and Maryland, closer to the U.S. Congress. Schiff's allies have said he accurately filled out mortgage paperwork and consulted with lawyers during that process.   His attorney, Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney in Manhattan, called the allegations of wrongdoing \"transparently false, stale and long debunked.\"   Even so, Schiff created a legal defense fund in August to help cover the legal bills.   The White House said the Justice Department is on the right track with its prosecutions. \"The Trump administration will continue to deliver the truth to the American people while restoring integrity and accountability to our justice system,\" said spokeswoman Abigail Jackson.   \"They should be people that are shamed\"   A driving force behind all these investigations is Ed Martin, a lawyer from Missouri with more experience in politics than in the courtroom. Martin could not win Senate confirmation to serve as U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., after lawmakers expressed concern about his support for people who rioted at the U.S. Capitol nearly five years ago.   \n   Instead, Martin moved to lead a Weaponization Working Group focused on people who have run afoul of Trump.   \"There are some really bad actors, some people that did some really bad things to the American people,\" Martin told reporters as he started his new post. \"And if they can be charged, we'll charge them. But if they can't be charged, we will name them. And in a culture that respects shame, they should be people that are shamed.\"   That's not the way Justice Department policy has worked in the past. Prosecutors are not supposed to speak ill of people they lack enough evidence to charge with crimes — or about those who haven't been charged yet.   \n   \"I can't imagine anything more stressful than being accused by the government and carrying the weight of that as an individual in this country,\" said Wayne, of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.   Where to go \"to get my reputation back?\"   Even if a defendant wins an acquittal, they've been through the wringer, facing emotional pressure on themselves and their entire family.   Consider D.C. lawyer Michael Sussmann. He was investigated by a special counsel in connection with his work for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. A jury in D.C. found him not guilty of making a false statement to the FBI after a two-week trial in 2022.   \n   Outside the courthouse following his victory, Sussman sounded exhausted.   \"Despite being falsely accused, I'm relieved that justice ultimately prevailed in my case,\" he said. \"As you can imagine, this has been a difficult year for my family and me.\"   Back in the 1980s, the former labor secretary under President Ronald Reagan faced fraud charges — only to be found not guilty by a jury.   Raymond Donovan responded: \"Which office do I go to to get my reputation back?\"\n",

Republicans and Democrats appear no closer to an agreement to reopen it. The Senate again tried — and failed — Wednesday to advance a bill to reopen the government. It was the chamber's ninth attempt since the shutdown began on Oct. 1 to vote on a short-term funding bill passed by the House.    The Trump administration has been following through on threats to slash the size of government during the shutdown, laying off thousands of workers late last week. A hearing in federal court today considered the legality of those layoffs; the judge overseeing the case issued a temporary restraining order directing the Trump administration to pause RIF notices to federal employees who are members of two unions, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME).   \n   Read the latest on a case brought by some fired federal workers to pause the latest wave of shutdown layoffs.   President Trump has said he plans to fire more federal workers en masse while the shutdown continues and will specifically target what he called \"Democrat programs.\"    While active military members were set to miss their first full paycheck on Wednesday, over the weekend President Trump said he \"identified funds\" to ensure the active military gets paid. The Defense Department will use \"approximately $8 billion\" of unused research and development funding from last year to pay service members if the government doesn't reopen by Oct. 15, according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly. That would likely only cover one pay cycle and military families are already seeking additional assistance from food banks and other groups to help with paying bills.   As the shutdown drags on, here's the latest on what we know.      Jump to state-specific impacts.      Why did the federal government shut down?    A partisan argument over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces led to the current shutdown. Some 24 million people — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans.     \n   Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the heath care of undocumented immigrants. That is not true.   Democrats in the Senate refused to vote for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP spending and tax bill that passed over the summer.    Read more about more on the debate over these subsidies here.    Plus, why Democrats are casting the government shutdown as a health care showdown.   — Selena Simmons-Duffin, NPR      What about WIC and SNAP benefits?   Among the first to feel the pinch during this shutdown could be the 7 million mothers and young children who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) food program. Funding was estimated to run out after about two weeks. But USDA has distributed money from the previous fiscal year, helping at least some states. And the White House has said it will use tariff revenue to keep WIC afloat, though has provided few details. When asked for more information, the White House referred NPR to USDA, which did not reply to a query. Trump's budget proposal earlier this year had looked to cut WIC funding.   Lucia Graves of Lebanon, N.H. told NPR she is counting on the benefits to help feed her family, especially as the cost of groceries is on the rise. But continued access if there's a prolonged shutdown will likely depend on states filling the gap, if their budgets allow.   Beyond WIC, the country's much larger food aid program — the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (or SNAP, previously known as food stamps) — is funded through October. That's because the debit-like cards people use to buy food are loaded a month in advance, so benefits will continue for October. But in a memo seen by NPR, USDA last week told state agencies to hold off paying for November benefits for lack of sufficient funding, \"until further notice.\"    \n   — Jennifer Ludden, NPR   And what about school lunches?   Some state agencies say they may not have the funds to reimburse schools providing free and low-cost meals.   Diane Pratt-Heavner, a spokesperson for the School Nutrition Association, says some agencies have told her organization they don't have the money to pay schools back for meals during the shutdown.   \"There is a strong commitment on both sides of the aisle to make sure that kids have access to healthy meals at school, so we are hopeful that the administration and Congress will act before this becomes an issue.\"   Before the shutdown, USDA released a contingency plan outlining funds states could tap into to cover any gaps. A USDA spokesman did not directly answer NPR when asked whether the agency intends to advance funding to state agencies should the shutdown persist. Instead, the spokesperson blamed the Democrats for \"causing real harm to American farmers, ranchers, and rural communities.\"   — Kadin Mills, NPR      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A United States Postal Service (USPS) mail box stands in Manhattan on Aug. 5, 2020 in New York City. Mail services will not be affected by the government shutdown.\n                \n                    Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   USPS is 'open for business as usual'   \"U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted in the event of a government shutdown,\" according to a statement by USPS. The postal service is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual.      IRS furloughs nearly half its staff   A contingency plan from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS' approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees were issued reduction in force, or RIF, notices on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9.   The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year's tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data.    \n   — Scott Horsley, Andrea Hsu and Stephen Fowler, NPR      Teachers and schools won't be directly impacted, but federal education functions might   Eighty-seven percent of Department of Education employees have been temporary furloughed, as detailed in agency shutdown contingency plans.   Layoffs particularly gutted the office responsible for overseeing special education, according to multiple sources within the department. The RIF affects the dozens of staff members responsible for roughly $15 billion in special education funding and for making sure states provide special education services to the nation's 7.5 million children with disabilities.   In addition, many Department of Education employees who were furloughed were surprised to see  a message blaming Democrats for the government shutdown inserted into their out-of-office replies. A federal workers union is suing the Trump administration for inserting the language into employees' out-of-office email messages.   — Shannon Bond and Cory Turner, NPR   The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 2026 went live as scheduled. As WPR's Corrinne Hess reports, the U.S. Department of Education says that student financial aid programs will continue, despite the shutdown.      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Greg Freeman, a National Park Service ranger closes the entrance gate due to the government shutdown at the Everglades National Park Shark Valley on Oct. 1 in Florida. Shark Valley remains open to visitors who park outside the entrance gate and walk in, although with limited staffing.\n                \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   National Parks are a mixed bag   Across the country, the National Park Service (NPS) have brought their operations to a halt.    As KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported, a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails \"will generally remain accessible to visitors\" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided.   Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services.   The The National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities also closed on Sunday. \"All the animals at the Zoo and at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, Virginia, will continue to be fed and cared for,\" the Smithsonian said. \"A shutdown will not affect our commitment to the safety of our staff and standard of excellence in animal care.\"   \n   The zoo's animal cams, however, are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown.   — Alana Wise, NPR      Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue   Social Security, VA and other benefits will continue. But on Friday, employees at Social Security field offices said the government shutdown has left them unable to carry out an important service for some recipients. As NPR's Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These official letters act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits.   As NPR's Scott Horsley reports some furloughed employees at the Labor Department are coming back to work, in order to complete the September inflation report, which is a key ingredient used to calculate the cost of living adjustment that Social Security recipients will receive next year.    Read more on how a fight over health policy led to the government shutdown from NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin.   But some fair housing offices have been gutted as part of the shutdown RIFs   More than 300 Housing and Urban Development employees received layoff notices over the weekend, according to a tally by AFGE National Council 222, a union that represents HUD workers. A HUD spokesperson says the layoffs are to \"align programs\" with the Trump administration's priorities. The agency did not provide specifics, but a union tally finds nearly a third of those cut are people who investigate allegations of housing discrimination.    HUD union steward Paul Osadebe says the layoffs appear to gut some entire offices — in Atlanta, Kansas City, Fort Worth and Denver. They come on top of previous major cuts to HUD's fair housing staff.   — Jennifer Ludden, NPR      There could be missed paychecks and lost jobs   Perhaps the biggest impacts will be felt by federal workers who are set to miss their first full paycheck during the government shutdown later this month. President Trump on Saturday said he had \"identified funds\" to make sure the active military does not miss its Oct. 15 paycheck, but absent a breakthrough in Congress it remains unclear how the military would be paid beyond that.    \n   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that roughly 750,000 federal employees would be furloughed each day of the shutdown.   Here's the latest breakdown on temporary furloughs during the government shutdown by agency.   Wildfire and other emergency response personnel, for example, will continue to work, but in many cases without pay.    In addition to furloughing employees, thousands of employees across several federal agencies began receiving RIF notices last week.   Last week, Trump appeared to publicly back a draft White House memo that includes an argument for denying workers pay, despite a 2019 law intended to ensure federal employees are compensated after a shutdown. When pressed on the legality of such a move, Trump said, \"What the law says is correct, and I follow the law.\"   Ian Morgan is a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland and the leader of a local federal worker union. He told WAMU's Jenny Abamu he wants any budget deal to include protections for federal workers and the services they provide. Morgan also wants Congress to guarantee back pay for federal contractors he works closely with — many of whom will not receive pay while the government is shut down.   Read more about how federal workers are finding their voice during the shutdown.       ICE will mostly continue uninterrupted   Immigration cases and enforcement are proceeding as usual during the government shutdown, with a few small exceptions. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the employees in the Office of Detention Oversight, which inspects immigration detention centers, is currently not working. \"We hope Democrats will open up the government swiftly so that this office can resume its work,\" McLaughlin said.   Customs inspection and immigration law enforcement are considered \"essential\" functions that will continue during any lapse in appropriations, though workers may not get paid until the shutdown is over.   \n   The U.S. Coast Guard, which is housed within DHS, will continue to be paid, according to a social media post from Secretary Kristi Noem, from funds appropriated in the reconciliation bill earlier this year.   — Ximena Bustillo, NPR      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                An air traffic control tower is seen following the government shutdown at the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport on Oct. 1 in Austin, Texas.\n                \n                    Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   If you're flying soon …   Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees are considered \"essential workers\" and have to stay on the job.   Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages disrupt flights across the country.    Air traffic controllers helped to end the last government shutdown, and could help end this one as well. A \"slight increase\" in sick leave at two facilities on the East Coast threw some major airports into chaos.   Read more on what a shortage of air traffic controllers could do to bring an end to the shutdown from NPR's Joel Rose.      \n   The impact of the shutdown looks different in different parts of the country   Some states across the country are uniquely positioned to feel the impact of the government shutdown. Reporters from the NPR Network are digging into the ways the government shutdown is playing out in their region.   Here's what we know so far about how the shutdown is affecting specific communities across the country:      Alaska   The U.S. Transportation Department says it has secured funding to continue the Essential Air Service program, subsidizing routes to 65 Alaska communities and more than an additional 100 communities nationwide, through Nov. 2. [Alaska Public Media]About 15,000 federal employees live in Alaska, one of the highest percentages of federal employees when compared with other states. President Trump's threat that federal employees could receive termination notices increases the uncertainty around how this crucial workforce to Alaska's economy could be affected. [Alaska Public Media]   For more on the impact in Alaska, head to Alaska Public Media.      \n   Arizona   Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs said she would not spend state funds to keep Grand Canyon National Park open should the government shutdown. [KJZZ] Social services in Grand Canyon Village are gearing up to support non-essential employees at Grand Canyon National Park, including food pantry resources. [KNAU]Sen. Ruben Gallego said the shutdown would also not affect federal relief money to communities in the Miami-Globe area after torrential monsoon rains caused flash flooding in the region [KJZZ]Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport joined a handful of other airports across the country that have refused to display a video from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blaming Democrats for the government shutdown. [KJZZ]      California   The shutdown of the federal government has brought the full or partial closure of many National Park Service sites across California: Muir Woods is fully closed. Alcatraz Island is slated to stay open. Other sites like Point Reyes National Seashore and Fort Point have partial closures, with some parking lots blocked or bathrooms locked. Even some park staff said they didn't learn the plan until Sept. 30 — the afternoon before the government shut down. Yosemite is open, but with lots of changes for visitors. [KQED]      Colorado   Sites and lands in Colorado operated by the National Park Service are open, but \"some services may be limited or unavailable,\" according to the agency's website. [Colorado Public Radio]In Colorado, the federal government employs thousands of workers at climate or land-management agencies. An EPA spokesperson told CPR News that the agency is operating under its shutdown plan, which would furlough thousands of employees. [Colorado Public Radio]Unemployment claims from Colorado's federal workers are surging amid the U.S. government shutdown. Stephanie Rogers, a Colorado-based microbiologist with the Food and Drug Administration, told CPR she filed for unemployment the day after the shutdown started. [Colorado Public Radio]      Connecticut   Connecticut will continue federally funded food assistance programs for state residents during the government shutdown, Gov. Ned Lamont said on Wednesday. But he said the state's reserve money for SNAP, the food assistance program for low-income families, will run out by the end of the month. [WSHU]Connecticut has a $2.5 billion budget surplus this year — its second largest in history. Advocates are asking Lamont to consider using it to help offset the federal shortfall. [WSHU]      Georgia   For federal workers living paycheck to paycheck, one option to get through being furloughed could be filing for unemployment insurance, Georgia Labor Commissioner Barbara Rivera Holmes said. The employees will have to pay the benefits back once the shutdown ends and they receive back pay, but the benefits can help them make ends meet while they are not being paid. [GPB]Georgia farmers could also face delays in block grant funding and commodity data they rely on during the time-sentitive season of planting and harvesting. [NPR]      Kansas   Kansas farmers face several uncertainties, as payments from some federal programs are in limbo. In addition, nearly half of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's employees will be furloughed, and many offices will be closed. [KCUR]During the last two shutdowns, the USDA did not publish its monthly crop reports. This comes at an inconvenient time as Midwest farmers are in harvest season. [KCUR]   For more on the impact in Kansas City, head to KCUR.      Louisiana   The National Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP, is managed by FEMA and provides flood insurance to those who don't have a private option. It has grown in size as most homeowner's insurance policies across the U.S. have dropped flood damage entirely. It covers nearly half a million Louisianans. Policyholders with expiring contracts could lose coverage and funds to pay claims have dropped $30 billion due to the shutdown. [WWNO/WRKF]   For more on the impact in Louisiana, head to WWNO/WRKF.      Illinois   Three workers who spoke with the Chicago Sun-Times said they haven't been furloughed, but they've dealt with uncertainties and fragmented coordination since the federal government shut down Oct. 1 on top of a year of uncertainty. [Chicago Public Media]      Maine   Even though much of the staff of Acadia National Park in Maine has been furloughed, it was a popular weekend at the park. [Maine Public]       Missouri   Families enrolled in the Missouri WIC program — which provides supplemental food, nutrition education and support to low-income women and children — will not be immediately impacted by the shutdown. [St. Louis Public Radio]The Gateway Arch and Old Courthouse in downtown St. Louis are temporarily closed, with National Park Service work largely on hold. [St. Louis Public Radio]      New Hampshire   There are more than 5,000 civilian federal employees in New Hampshire, at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, the Manchester VA Medical Center, the White Mountain National Forest, the Berlin federal prison, the passport processing center at Pease and at other federal agencies. How the shutdown might affect them isn't entirely clear. [NHPR]The White Mountain National Forest will remain open, but some say earlier staff cuts are hampering critical activities. Firefighting and disaster response activities will also continue, according to federal officials. [NHPR]On Oct. 7, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., the veteran appropriator who has helped broker past bipartisan deals, told NPR, she has been working behind the scenes with senators from both parties to \"find common ground.\" [NPR]   For more on the impact in New Hampshire, head to NHPR.      North Carolina   After the federal government shutdown cut staffing and services at Great Smoky Mountains National Park, local governments and nonprofits in the region stepped up to foot the bill and keep the park open during the peak fall season. The funds should keep the park open through Oct. 19. [WUOT]      North Dakota   The state-owned Bank of North Dakota is partnering with local banks and credit unions to provide short-term low interest loans to federal government employees and members of the armed services stationed in North Dakota, if they experience financial hardship because of the federal government shutdown. [Prairie Public]   For more on the impact in North Dakota, head to Prairie Public.      Oklahoma   With the federal government shut down, National Park rangers are not present at the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum. Victims, family members and first responders are stepping in to educate visitors on the location's story.⁠ [KOSU]      Oregon   The federal government program used to subsidize commercial flights in Pendleton got a last-minute reprieve from grinding to a halt due to the partial government shutdown. But as of Wednesday, immediate answers on how that might affect Eastern Oregon's only commercial airport are in short supply. The municipally operated Eastern Oregon Regional Airport in Pendleton holds the only Essential Air Service (EAS) contract in the state, a federal program that helps rural airports operate. [OPB]      Pennsylvania   Tens of thousands of Pennsylvania-based federal workers furloughed during the government shutdown may be eligible for unemployment compensation through the state Department of Labor & Industry. [WITF]      Tennessee   After the federal government shutdown cut staffing and services at Great Smoky Mountains National Park, local governments and nonprofits in the region stepped up to foot the bill and keep the park open during the peak fall season. The funds should keep the park open through Oct. 19 [WUOT]On Oct. 7, the FAA notified local officials in Nashville that flights in and out of Nashville International Airport (BNA) would be reduced Tuesday afternoon due to a shortage of air traffic controllers during the government shutdown. Nashville's airport was back to normal by Wednesday morning. [WLPN]      Texas   U.S. Customs and Border Protection employees who inspect cargo at the 32 other official ports of entry are among the essential federal workers who must remain on the job unpaid. The longer the shutdown lasts, the greater the risk of cargo backups at these Texas ports due to unpaid employees calling in sick. [Houston Public Media]      Utah   In Ogden, Utah, about 10 percent works for the IRS, and when federal workers stop getting paychecks, impacts are felt quickly and broadly. (KUER)      Washington   On Oct. 6, state officials say they have enough to cover WIC for the next two weeks. Seattle and King County have partnered to dedicate nearly $2 million to provide one-time vouchers to an estimated 30,000 clients in King County who rely on WIC. [KUOW]The Employment Security Department says the 80,000 federal workers in Washington State may qualify for unemployment benefits. [OPB]      Wyoming   On Oct. 3, Gov. Mark Gordon said Wyoming will cover gaps in funding to federally funded state employees who are in the state budget \"in the short-term.\" [Wyoming Public Media]   For more on the impact in Wyoming, head to Wyoming Public Media.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Michel Martin asks Michigan Rep. Lisa McClain, the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, about the ongoing government shutdown and the prospects for a resolution.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  As you might imagine, we've been reaching out to lawmakers from both parties as the shutdown continues. Today, we have Republican congresswoman Lisa McClain of Michigan. She is the chair of the House Republican Conference, which is responsible for communicating the party's message to members. She's with us now. Congresswoman, welcome. Thank you so much for joining us.LISA MCCLAIN: Oh, thanks for having me.MARTIN: So you've called on Michigan's two Democratic senators to help end the government shutdown. We've heard from Sam's piece that there aren't really any public talks going on, but what about privately? Are there any communications back and forth there?MCCLAIN: You know, there are communications. You know, there's always communications. You don't necessarily see those in, you know, out in the media. But people are trying to talk. People are, you know, voicing their concerns, and, you know, I know it appears that both sides are pretty dug in, and I think they are. But at the end of the day, we got to get a resolution to move forward.MARTIN: Any Democrats you think could be persuaded to join the Republicans in passing what we're calling - what's been called the clean continuing resolution?MCCLAIN: Yeah. I think there will be. I think Saturday is - after they get through Saturday, I think the temperature will die down a little bit...MARTIN: Why Saturday?MCCLAIN: ...And people will be - oh, there's that no kings rally that...MARTIN: Oh.MCCLAIN: ...Everyone is, you know, having. And we just - we got to stop the games. We got to stop the showmanship, and we got to get back to working for the American people. And that, I think, is my frustration is our strategy was when we passed the Clean CR, typically, and I think this piece gets really lost, the party who's in charge - and both sides do it, Michel - when you pass a CR, the parties in charge puts a lot of extra policies in there, usually partisan policies. And then what happens is you go to the negotiation table and you're like, all right, I'll take this out, I'll add this in. What we did was a totally different strategy. We said, we're not going to do any gimmicks. We're not going to play any games. We are literally going to pass the exact Clean CR that everybody voted for under the Democratic spending levels in March. We didn't put one policy writer in there. And that's why everyone's like, well, why aren't you negotiating? We have nothing to negotiate...MARTIN: Well...MCCLAIN: ...Because we didn't play any games to begin with.MARTIN: Well, let me just jump in here because the Democrats argue that the issue here - the timing is really relevant here. The issue is that these health insurance premiums...MCCLAIN: Yes.MARTIN: ...Which people get under the Affordable Care Act will rise. Now, about half a million people in your state...MCCLAIN: You're right.MARTIN: ...Have health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, premiums will rise...MCCLAIN: You're 100% right.MARTIN: ...Without these subsidies. So my question to you is how do you want to address that? How do you want to address that?MCCLAIN: This is why - this is - exact reason why we passed the Clean CR. No games, no gimmicks. We can get government to work how it is supposed to work. Not backroom deals. But if you pass the Clean CR, that's why we put it on the table - right? - we can negotiate. We can go through committees. We can have these debates. We don't need to have the American people held hostage because of this.MARTIN: OK, but with Republicans in control of both houses of Congress and the White House, why doesn't the caucus address this issue one way or another?MCCLAIN: We are.MARTIN: What's the Republican proposal to address this premium increase?MCCLAIN: Well, we actually have proposals to address the premium increase...MARTIN: What is it?MCCLAIN: ...That's why...MARTIN: What is it?MCCLAIN: ...We need to open the government up...MARTIN: What is it?MCCLAIN: ...So we can...MARTIN: Give me the headline.MCCLAIN: Well, the head - there's not a headline. And the reason why there's not a headline is because since 2010 when we put Obamacare in, I mean, it doesn't work, right? Obamacare was supposed to fix healthcare, and it's done the exact opposite. We've seen this...MARTIN: OK, the president - OK, but in the first...MCCLAIN: But let me finish.MARTIN: In the first trump term...MCCLAIN: But let me finish.MARTIN: ...You have both houses of Congress...MCCLAIN: OK.MARTIN: ...And the White House. In this Trump term, both Houses of Congress and the White House, how do you want to fix it?MCCLAIN: Do you want me to answer...MARTIN: Yes, please.MCCLAIN: ...Or are you going to interrupt me again?MARTIN: Yes, Ma'am.MCCLAIN: (Laughter).MARTIN: I'm definitely going to want you to answer.MCCLAIN: So what I would say is, this isn't a silver-bullet fix. I mean, premiums since Obamacare has been put in, we've had to subsidize it, right? And the only people who are getting rich on this are the insurance companies, and the American people are suffering. So this is going to take just a quick second. It's not going to be done in 30 seconds with more subsidies. It's going to take some time to overhaul. And that's why we need to get back to work. Trust me, if there was a silver-bullet fix, we would do it. But as you know, we have a very diverse conference, right? So what works in one area may not work for another. And that's why this is so critical that we get back to work. But this isn't a healthcare fight. This is a funding fight. This isn't an AG bill fight or a transportation and infrastructure fight. This is a funding fight. So let's deal with the funding, open up the government, and then let's fix what is wrong.MARTIN: Before we let you go, there are about 30,000 federal civilian employees in Michigan. What are you hearing from constituents who are worried about the president's threat to continue laying off furloughed federal workers?MCCLAIN: Yeah. They're really worried.MARTIN: I think you have about 8,000 in your district alone.MCCLAIN: Yeah. We do, and they're frustrated because we shouldn't be in this position to begin with. That's why the Democrats need to stop using the federal workers as political pawns and open up the government. We could have fixed this, and we should never have been in this situation to begin with. But here we are because Democrats are continuing to play games with the American people. Listen...MARTIN: I...MCCLAIN: ...President Trump - go ahead.MARTIN: No - sorry, we're almost out of time.

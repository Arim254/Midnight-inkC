Trump said he wants to control Greenland at any cost and the White House has not ruled out taking the island by force.   U.S. Vice President JD Vance will meet Denmark's foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt in Washington on Wednesday to discuss the Arctic island, which is a semiautonomous territory of the United States' NATO ally Denmark.   \n   Tuuta Mikaelsen, a 22-year-old student, told The Associated Press in Nuuk that she hoped American officials would get the message to \"back off.\"   Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen told a news conference in the Danish capital Copenhagen on Tuesday that, \"if we have to choose between the United States and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark. We choose NATO. We choose the Kingdom of Denmark. We choose the EU.\"   \n   Greenland is strategically important because as climate change causes the ice to melt, it opens up the possibility of shorter trade routes to Asia. That also could make it easier to extract and transport untapped deposits of critical minerals which are needed for computers and phones.   Trump also said he wants the island to expand America's security and has cited what he says is the threat from Russian and Chinese ships as a reason to control it.   But both experts and Greenlanders question that claim.   \"The only Chinese I see is when I go to the fast food market,\" Lars Vintner, a heating engineer told AP. He said he frequently goes sailing and hunting and has never seen Russian or Chinese ships.   His friend, Hans Nørgaard, agreed, adding \"what has come out of the mouth of Donald Trump about all these ships is just fantasy.\"   \n   Denmark has said the U.S. — which already has a military presence — can boost its bases on Greenland. For that reason, \"security is just a cover,\" Vintner said, suggesting Trump actually wants to own the island to make money from its untapped natural resources.   Nørgaard told AP he filed a police complaint in Nuuk against Trump's \"aggressive\" behavior because, he said, American officials are threatening the people of Greenland and NATO. He suggested Trump was using the ships as a pretext to further American expansion.   \n   \"Donald Trump would like to have Greenland, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin would like Ukraine and (Chinese President) Xi Jinping would like to have Taiwan,\" Nørgaard said.   Mikaelsen, the student, said Greenlanders benefit from being part of Denmark which provides free health care, education and payments during study.   \"I don't want the U.S. to take that away from us,\" she said.   Ahead of Wednesday's meeting, Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenland's minister for business and mineral resources said it's \"unfathomable\" that the United States is discussing taking over a NATO ally and urged the Trump administration to listen to voices from the Arctic island's people.\n",

House Republicans are seeking testimony from the Clintons about their past ties with Jeffrey Epstein.\n                \n                    Melina Mara/The Washington Post via AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Melina Mara/The Washington Post via AP\n    \n\n   \n   The Republican-led House Oversight Committee has announced plans to hold former President Bill Clinton, and possibly former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in contempt of Congress.   The committee subpoenaed the Clintons for testimony related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, but the pair say they will not testify.   House Oversight chairman James Comer, R-Ky., announced the move after President Clinton declined to appear for a scheduled Tuesday deposition. The committee was seeking testimony from Hillary Clinton on Wednesday.    \"No one's accusing the Clintons of any wrongdoing,\" Comer told reporters. \"I just find it odd not only that they didn't show up, but that the Democrats on the committee so concerned about getting to the bottom of the Epstein investigation didn't even bother to show.\"   \n   Among the files released by the Justice Department are photographs of Epstein traveling with President Clinton, who has said he knew nothing of the financier's crimes and cut ties with him years ago.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., speaks to reporters after former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, refused to appear for a deposition as part of the panel's investigation into Jeffrey Epstein at the Capitol on Tuesday.\n                \n                    J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n    \n\n   \n   In a Tuesday letter to the committee, the Clintons called the subpoenas legally invalid and said they have already provided in writing what little they know.   They said the push is designed to embarrass political rivals, writing, \"Every person has to decide when they have seen or had enough and are ready to fight for this country, its principles and its people.\"   Democrats on the oversight committee, who signed off on the subpoenas as part of a larger list, have noted that most of the other people have not been forced to testify.   University of Kentucky Law professor Jonathan Shaub says the congressional subpoena is a key oversight tool, but, \"In recent decades, it's become more and more about scoring political points or exposing embarrassing material for the other side and less about getting information that Congress actually needs to legislate.\"   Shaub, an expert on the Constitution's separation of powers, says if a contempt resolution passes the full House and the Justice Department prosecutes the Clintons, it could spark a legal battle with larger implications because there is relatively limited case law when it comes to congressional contempt resolutions.   \n   \"When you have cases like this, where there's very little, if any, veneer of a legislative interest, it could end up undermining oversight power at a time where Congress has ceded so much authority to the executive branch,\" Shaub said.   Meanwhile the Justice Department has yet to release millions of pages of files pertaining to Epstein, weeks after the December deadline set by Congress.   \"WHERE ARE THE EPSTEIN FILES,\" Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., the Oversight committee's ranking member wrote Tuesday on social media.   Contempt of Congress charges can be a powerful, albeit rarely used tool. After failing to cooperate with Democrats for their investigation into the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, two close allies of President Trump, Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro, were sentenced to prison. Each served four months in prison. \n",

NPR wasn't able to independently confirm the scale of the grant cancellation. The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) didn't respond to a request for clarification.   \"We are definitely looking at severe loss of front-line capacity,\" said Andrew Kessler, head of Slingshot Solutions, a consultancy firm that works with mental health and addiction groups nationwide. \"[Programs] may have to shut their doors tomorrow.\"   \n   Kessler said he has reviewed numerous grant termination letters from \"Salt Lake City to El Paso to Detroit, all over the country.\"   Ryan Hampton, the founder of Mobilize Recovery, a national advocacy nonprofit for people in and seeking recovery, told NPR his group lost roughly $500k \"overnight.\"   \"Waking up to nearly $2 billion in grant cancellations means front-line providers are forced to cease overdose prevention, naloxone distribution, and peer recovery services immediately, leaving our communities defenseless against a raging crisis,\" Hampton said. \"This cruelty will be measured in lives lost, as recovery centers shutter and the safety net we built is slashed overnight. We are witnessing the dismantling of our recovery infrastructure in real-time, and the administration will have blood on its hands for every preventable death that follows.\"   Copies of the letter sent to two different organizations and reviewed by NPR signal that SAMHSA officials no longer believe the defunded programs align with the Trump administration's priorities.   The letter points to efforts to reshape the national health system in part by restructuring SAMHSA's grant program, which \"includes terminating some of its … awards.\"   According to the letter, grants are terminated as of yesterday, Jan.13, adding that \"costs resulting from financial obligations incurred after termination are not allowable.\"   \n   The National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors sent a letter to members saying it believes \"over 2,000 grants [nationwide] with a total of more than $2 billion\" are affected. The group said it's still working to understand the \"full scope\" of the cuts.   This move comes on top of deep Medicaid cuts, passed last year by the Republican-controlled Congress, which affect numerous mental health and addiction care providers.   Kessler told NPR he's hearing alarm from care providers nationwide that the safety net for people experiencing an addiction or mental health crisis could unravel.   \"In the short term, there's going to be severe damage. We're going to have to scramble,\" he said.   Regina LaBelle, a Georgetown University professor who served as acting head of the Office of National Drug Control Policy during the Biden administration, said the SAMHSA grants pay for life saving services.    \"From first responders to drug courts, continued federal funding quite literally save lives,\" LaBelle said.  \"The overdose epidemic has been declared a public health emergency and overdose deaths are decreasing. This is no time to pull critical funding.\"   Requests for comment from SAMHSA and the Department of Health and Human Services were not immediately returned.    This is a developing story.\n",

The speech, which comes amid polling showing his handling of the economy at a historic low, lasted just more than an hour. He touted plans to crack down on fraud, freeze federal payments to states with sanctuary cities and cap credit card fees at 10% for a year. He also teased further proposals to come on health care and housing.   \n   \"It's unfair,\" Trump said in Detroit on credit card interest rates. \"The rates are too high to provide further relief to hardworking Americans.\"   But Trump spent much of his time blaming Biden for inflation rates and criticized the fed chair, Powell, whom the Justice Department is targeting in a new investigation. Trump told NBC News on Sunday he had nothing to do with the probe, but he has been criticizing Powell for months for not lowering interest rates and has been threatening to fire him.   In his remarks, Trump referred to Powell as \"that jerk\" and said he would \"be gone soon.\"   Michigan was Trump's first domestic trip since a slew of international news – capturing Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro; threatening military action against Iran after rising protests; threatening to seize Greenland; trying to move forward in the Gaza peace deal; ongoing negotiations to end the Russia-Ukraine war – has been the president's main focus for weeks.   But in the U.S., even a majority of the president's own supporters remain increasingly concerned about high costs and affordability. It's an issue that was critical for Democrats' successes in the 2025 elections in Virginia and New Jersey and expected to remain top of mind for midterm elections later this year.   \n   Last month, Trump's approval rating on the economy hit a new low of 36%, according to a NPR/PBS/Marist poll. The poll showed voters feel like they are struggling to make ends meet and are most concerned about high costs.   The president previously addressed his economic agenda in an Oval Office speech and said his administration was \"making progress\" on lowering costs but \"it's not done yet.\"   In recent weeks, the White House has been touting lower gas prices and a dip in mortgage rates as economic wins. The president also shared that he'll address a plan for more affordable housing during a trip to Davos, Switzerland, next week.   Trump said tariffs were \"one of the biggest reasons\" for what he said is his successful economy.   \"The Trump tariffs have delivered us trillions of dollars of new investment, unprecedented new partnerships on new minerals, rare earths, defense and artificial intelligence and historical levels of foreign military sales,\" Trump said.   The president specifically said his 25% tariff on foreign automobiles is helping Michigan.   \"I am standing up for the American autoworker like no president has stood up before,\" he said.   Before his remarks, Trump visited a Ford facility that manufactures the F150 pickup truck.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Rob Schmitz speaks to former National Security Adviser John Bolton about the protests in Iran.   \n\n    ROB SCHMITZ, HOST:  The protests began about two weeks ago in the markets of Tehran. They've since spread to other cities and towns, a nationwide uprising against the authoritarian government of Iran. That authoritarian government has responded how it has in the past, with violent crackdowns. Human rights groups now say thousands of protesters have been killed. The protest prompted President Trump, who last year directed the bombing of nuclear sites in Iran, to threaten military force. And today, President Trump announced on social media, I have canceled all meetings with Iranian officials until the senseless killing of protesters stops. Help is on its way.To understand this moment, earlier today, I spoke with Ambassador John Bolton, who helped shape the pressure campaign on Iran during Trump's first term as national security advisor. I asked him if he thought this was the beginning of the end for the Iranian regime.JOHN BOLTON: I think the regime is at its weakest, most unpopular point, really since coming to power in 1979. What you're seeing now is largely driven by the economic situation in the country, which is really in very, very bad shape and has been for quite some period of time. But there are many other factors here. The young people are dissatisfied. They know they could have a different kind of life. The female half of the population has been unhappy for over two years since the murder of Mahsa Amini. And there are ethnic tensions, as well. This regime is a lot weaker than it looks, but it does control a monopoly of force. So I think the opposition needs the regime to fragment at the top. They could certainly help it, but I think help from outside, as well, would be critical at this point.SCHMITZ: And I want to go into that. You know, what happens if this regime falls? Theoretically, it could lead to a more democratic Iran, but I don't need to tell you that there are plenty of examples in the Middle East where a power vacuum has led to civil war and general chaos. What do you think would happen?BOLTON: Well, let's define regime, which is not just the ayatollahs, but it includes the revolutionary guards. This is, at this point, as much a military dictatorship as it is a theocracy. So we've got to get rid of the revolutionary guards or at least the commanders who are really the ones who follow the Islamic Revolution. Iran is a sophisticated, well-educated population. I think that probably there would be some interim government maybe led by people in the military temporarily. But I don't think it would last very long. I think they would want to give a chance for the people to try and express their views very quickly. It's hard to see you're going to get a regime worse than this one, which is the principal sponsor of international terrorism and pursuing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles that threaten Israel, threaten our Arab neighbors, threaten us, ultimately. I think we know where the population is going here, and I think it's the right direction.SCHMITZ: So you do see a scenario where the Iranian military, the Revolutionary Guard - it could turn and maybe side with protesters?BOLTON: Well, I think it would fragment. I think the regular military is a possibility, too. I think the rank and file in both the military and the Revolutionary Guard know how terrible economic conditions are in the country. Their family members, their friends - they see it every day. So I'm not thinking necessarily the highest-ranking generals will turn...SCHMITZ: OK.BOLTON: ...But colonels, maybe one-star generals, yeah. I think they could split. And then I think the troops will not fire on the demonstrators.SCHMITZ: Now, President Trump said Sunday we are looking at some very strong options. He was referring to military force. What's your read on this? Is this part of President Trump's negotiating strategy with Tehran, or do you think the president is referring to U.S. missile strikes on Iran?BOLTON: Well, I think that possibility is certainly there. You know, for years, people said, oh, you can't attack the Iranian nuclear weapons program. The Iranian people will rally to the side of the regime. Well, we did attack the Iranian nuclear weapons program, and now the Iranian people are in the streets saying death to the ayatollahs. So I think use of military force against targets like headquarters of the Revolutionary Guard, against the nuclear program, clearly targets that show to the opposition we're with them. And Trump has been tweeting today saying, you know, Iranian patriots, keep protesting. Take over your institutions. That's exactly what we ought to be doing.SCHMITZ: Now, you're making a parallel of Iranian nuclear sites, but, you know, this is a regime that has tentacles throughout the country. Can the U.S. really bomb this regime out of power?BOLTON: I don't think that's the objective, although we could certainly do a lot of damage beyond what we and the Israelis did during the 12-day war. And it's the encouragement it would give to the opposition that we will be dismantling, at least partly, the regime's ability to repress them. Now, he is saying in Venezuela to the opposition, don't take over the institutions. We'll let Delcy Rodríguez control them - just completely contradictory. The Venezuelan opposition should be taking over the institutions in Venezuela, if Trump could get his head screwed on straight. He's telling the Iranians, go out into the streets and risk getting killed, but he's not willing to do that in Venezuela.SCHMITZ: If the first step is indeed diplomacy and not bombing or cyberattacks, if the U.S. and Iran conduct negotiations, what would they be negotiating?BOLTON: I don't have any idea what we would negotiate with this regime. I think it would be a waste of oxygen. And, you know, Trump always talks about meetings. Everybody wants to meet with Donald Trump. We know that. I think it's the regime playing for time. I think it's a reflection of their conclusion that their situation is very serious, and they're desperate to avoid American kinetic action.SCHMITZ: Now, I need to ask you while we have you, you've been a major Trump critic since you left his first administration. You've recently been indicted on federal charges related to mishandling classified information. You've pleaded not guilty. What is next in this situation for you?BOLTON: Well, I can't really get into the specifics of that. I'd love to be able to discuss it, but this is, unfortunately, just not the time.SCHMITZ: Ambassador John Bolton, former national security advisor, thank you so much.BOLTON: Thanks for having me.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

    "body": "\n      \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n   LIBERTY COUNTY, Ga. — What brings Greg Reyes to this Walmart south of Savannah are the low prices. He and his wife keep a close eye on their limited budget; she's retired and he's disabled. Their grocery list is always the same. But the prices have been changing.   \"I used to pay like $40 a year ago, and now we're paying like $60,\" Reyes says. In his bags today are some chicken, turkey and beef. Other things simply had to go. \"We don't buy ice cream no more because it's expensive,\" Reyes says. \"It's kind of sad, but we have to do it like that.\"   \n   The cost of living in the U.S. rose 2.7% in December compared with a year before, according to Tuesday's federal data. That's a steady slowdown after a yearslong stretch of intense inflation, but still painful. The past year also brought a global trade war, as President Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on nearly all imports. And the world continued to grapple with extreme weather, from droughts to downpours.   All of this is showing up in our shopping carts.   \n   Since 2018, NPR has tracked the prices of dozens of items at this suburban Walmart superstore. Walmart is America's most popular retailer and the world's largest, which gives it the power to negotiate with suppliers for some of the lowest and most stable prices.   Here's what we learned on our latest price-check visit, in December. (Or skip the analysis to see the full details of NPR's shopping cart.)   Prices in NPR's basket rose 5% on average last year   Almost half the items on NPR's shopping list got more expensive in 2025, including shrimp, Oreo cookies, Coca-Cola and Dove soap. Some price increases, notably on items made in China and Vietnam, appear to be tariff related. Other price hikes had to do with weather events affecting harvests of crops such as cacao and coffee beans.   \n    Loading... \n   Just under a quarter of the items on NPR's list got cheaper, including eggs, milk and Cheerios. And many packaged foods stayed the same after years of price hikes.   As affordability became Americans' top concern, big brands began to worry about shoppers switching to store-label competitors or skipping some purchases altogether. To entice weary shoppers, NPR found, Walmart offered more discounts in December than it had in previous years.   A few disclaimers about our method:   We went through almost every aisle in this Walmart to come up with the 114 items. (The full table is below.) To account for possible changes in package sizes, we focused on the price per unit, whether it was an ounce of salsa or a square foot of aluminum foil.NPR reached out to the producers of all the items on our list that changed in price. Most companies did not respond. The few that did — including Kikkoman and Campbell's — noted that Walmart, as the retailer, has ultimate control over the prices that shoppers see on shelves.A Walmart spokesperson said in a statement: \"We remain dedicated to providing our customers Every Day low prices, with the goal of having the lowest price on a basket of goods over time.\" A store, for example, might extract deals from suppliers or charge slightly more for several items in order to sell something else at a break-even price or even below cost.   Tariffs loom over store shelves    Loading... \n   With tariffs being the biggest story in retail in 2025, signs of their impact inevitably showed up in Walmart's aisles. Though it's hard to pin any price increase on tariffs with certainty, the through line was noticeable.   Some of the biggest price jumps were on items imported from countries saddled with hefty tariffs: Walmart's store-brand paper folders made in China (up 46%), swai fish fillets from Vietnam (up 34%), Farberware's plastic measuring spoons made in China (up 19%) and Schwinn's infant bike helmet, which used to be made in China but is now made in Vietnam (up 18%).   Walmart, Farberware and Schwinn did not comment on the impact of tariffs to NPR, but several other companies did. Dole, whose canned pineapple from Southeast Asia got 25% more expensive, cited weather-related crop shortages and tariffs on goods imported from the region.   \n   Reynolds Wrap, whose aluminum foil rose in price by 13%, called out \"historic and sustained cost increases over the past year, driven by tariffs, global supply pressures, rising energy costs, and limited availability.\" Much of U.S. aluminum comes from Canada, and these imports now face a 50% tax.   Walmart in May warned that new tariffs would lead to higher prices, as Trump threatened 145% tariffs on goods from China. The White House later paused, changed up and even rolled back some of its trade plans, namely on food items. By August, Walmart officials said tariff costs were rising \"each week,\" although the company was able to mitigate many of them. In November, incoming Walmart CEO John Furner said tariffs brought \"less impact\" than expected early in the year.   \n   Climate chaos roiled many industries    Loading... \n   Some of the items with the worst price hikes are repeat offenders: coffee, beef and chocolate. They, too, were affected by tariffs — such as beef and coffee coming from Brazil — but the main culprit was the weather.   At this Walmart, the price of Maxwell House ground Colombian coffee rose by 46% in 2025 and its breakfast K-Cups by 34%. The costs of Hershey's and Lindt chocolates jumped around 26%. A pound of ground beef went up 30%, and the store now prominently displays a cheaper option: a blend of beef and ground pork.   The cost of coffee beans has soared as climate change has brought erratic rainfall patterns, floods and droughts to farmlands. Cacao harvests, too, have come up short for three years straight; West African farmers, who grow most of the world's supply, have dealt with extreme weather, changing climate patterns and disease in their aging trees. And the U.S. beef supply is at its lowest in decades, driving cattle prices to record highs, in part because of drought.   Kraft Heinz (which owns Maxwell House), Hershey and Lindt & Sprüngli in statements all cited the unprecedented higher costs of key raw materials, adding that they've also absorbed or offset part of those costs.   Shrinkflation continues in the laundry aisle   When inflation peaked after the COVID-19 pandemic, some manufacturers stealthily raised prices by shrinking their products — shampoo, paper towels, chips and candy — while charging the same or slightly more. In 2022, for example, NPR's Walmart visit found that Dove soap bars had shrunk by a quarter of an ounce, while rising in price by a few cents. (Dove maker Unilever did not comment.)   Last month, NPR spotted one case of shrinkflation: Tide laundry detergent. But the company says it's actually efficiency.    Loading... \n   NPR first spotted Tide selling less laundry detergent per bottle in 2022: The amount of liquid had shrunk to 92 ounces from 100 ounces before the pandemic, and the price had risen by a dollar. After that, the cost stayed the same, but the contents shrank to 84 ounces in 2024 and then to 80 ounces in December.   The label continuously promised enough detergent for 64 loads of laundry.   Procter & Gamble, which makes Tide as well as Head & Shoulders shampoo (whose price rose almost 18%), told NPR that both products saw \"meaningful upgrades\" in the past year. Tide specifically got the \"most significant upgrade to its liquid formula in over 20 years,\" according to the company, with a \"boosted\" level of active cleaning ingredients and updated dosage instructions.   \"The result is superior cleaning performance in a smaller dose,\" a Procter & Gamble representative said.   Good news! Some things are cheaper    Loading... \n   The biggest price drop finally came for eggs after record highs earlier in the year due to the persistent bird flu. By December, the price of a dozen eggs at Walmart dropped 30%. The cost of butter also dipped, by almost 16%, thanks to a glut in dairy production.   And as inflation-weary shoppers tighten their belts, brands have started doing something they rarely do: lowering prices. PepsiCo (maker of Lay's, Cheetos and Tostitos) last month said it would cut prices to boost sales. General Mills (maker of Cheerios, Betty Crocker and Annie's) also confirmed it plans to discount roughly two-thirds of its offerings. NPR's price check found Cheerios costing 19% less than a year ago.   A Walmart spokesperson also told NPR that the chain has added more discounts (or \"rollbacks,\" in Walmart parlance) than it had in the past two years. The company cited 13,000 of them in the first three quarters of 2025, of which about 2,000 became permanent price cuts.   Loading...\n",

The Environmental Protection Agency under President Trump is taking a new approach to regulating air pollution. In a reversal from previous policy, the EPA will not put a dollar value on potential health benefits from regulations. Critics say that could make it easier to roll back regulations.\n                \n                    J. David Ake/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        J. David Ake/AP\n    \n\n   \n   For years, the Environmental Protection Agency has assigned a dollar value to the lives saved and the health problems avoided through many of its environmental regulations.   \n   Now, that has changed. The EPA will no longer consider the economic cost of harm to human health from fine particles and ozone, two air pollutants that are known to affect human health. The change was written into a new rule recently published by the agency. It weakened air pollution rules on power plant turbines that burn fossil fuels, which are sources of air pollution of many types, including from fine particles, sometimes called soot.   The EPA writes in its regulatory impact analysis for the new rule that, for now, the agency will not consider the dollar value of health benefits from its regulations on fine particles and ozone because there is too much uncertainty in estimates of those economic impacts.   \n   EPA press secretary Brigit Hirsch clarified that the agency is still considering health benefits. But it will not assign a dollar amount to those benefits until further notice, as it reconsiders the way it assesses those numbers.   Health experts worry that the move could lead to rollbacks of air pollution rules, which could result in rising pollution levels, leading to more health risks for millions of Americans.   \"I'm worried about what this could mean for health,\" says Mary Rice, a pulmonologist and air pollution expert at Harvard University and the director of Harvard's Center for Climate Health and the Global Environment. \"Especially for people with chronic respiratory illnesses like asthma and COPD, for kids whose lungs are still developing, and for older people, who are especially susceptible to the harmful effects of air pollution on the heart, lungs and the brain.\"   Fine particles, known as PM2.5, come from a variety of sources, including power plants that burn fossil fuels like coal and gas. Long-term exposure to fine particle pollution is known to cause significant health risks, from higher rates of asthma to more heart attacks to dementia, and even premature death. Cleaning up pollution from fine particles has, by the agency's previous estimates, saved more than 230,000 lives and billions of dollars per year in recent years.   \n   The policy shift could facilitate further rollback of air pollution regulations, says NYU environmental law expert Richard Revesz. The economic costs to industry of implementing air regulations are still quantified, at least in the new rule. But if the benefits aren't assigned a similarly concrete dollar amount, he says, it is easier to ignore them. \"It looks good only because you ignore the main consequence of the rollback, which is the additional negative impact on public health,\" he says. \"By just saying we are assuming no harm doesn't mean there is no harm.\"   The health costs of air pollution    Decades of research have shown that exposure to pollution, such as fine particles, damages people's health. The landmark Harvard University Six Cities study, which ran from the 1970s until the 1990s, showed unambiguously that living in more polluted areas shortened people's lives. Since then, hundreds of research analyses — including many produced by EPA scientists — have linked risks to people's lungs, hearts, and brains with fine particle pollution. And reducing that pollution can have near-instantaneous health benefits: After the closure of a polluting coke plant in Pennsylvania, for example, cardiovascular and respiratory problems dropped dramatically in the surrounding population.   \n   A 1981 executive order from President Ronald Reagan required agencies like the EPA to consider the costs and benefits of major regulations such as the Clean Air Act. So alongside evolving evidence about the health risks of exposure to air pollution, the EPA began to figure out how to assess both.   The cost estimates were relatively straightforward: What would it cost industry to upgrade their equipment and processes to comply with a rule? The benefits were slightly trickier. The agency developed sophisticated ways to estimate how many lives would be saved and health problems avoided from lower pollution, driven by tighter regulations. The EPA also developed economic models that could estimate how much money such changes would save the American people.   \n   Most estimates routinely came up with high economic benefit-to-cost ratios, says Rice, the Harvard pulmonologist. \"The Clean Air Act is often cited as having benefit-cost ratios of upward of 30 to 1,\" she says. \"The economic return is so great that even small reductions in pollution, across millions of people, translate into very large savings.\"   A 2014 U.S. Supreme Court case clarified that agencies like the EPA had to take both benefits and costs into account in their regulatory processes. But the courts have \"not waded into the question of how exactly [EPA] should do that,\" says Jeffrey Holmstead, an EPA expert and lawyer at Bracewell, LLC and former leader of the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation during the George W. Bush administration. \"So, yes, they do have to consider both, but there is no legally enforceable requirement for them to do it in any particular way,\" he says. That leaves it up to the agency's discretion, Holmstead says, whether to forgo an economic benefits calculation, as long as the EPA still assesses the health benefits in some way.   \n   Other EPA regulations, he says, assess the health benefits without assigning a specific dollar value, like some of the rules concerning hazardous air pollutants, which are associated with significant but more uncertain health risks.   However, \"you can't do a sophisticated cost-benefit analysis without trying to monetize both the costs and the benefits,\" Holmstead says. \"This will be the first time in a long time that EPA hasn't tried to provide a monetary benefit to reducing at least PM 2.5 and ozone.\"   The move to not consider economic benefits marks a major policy change, says NYU legal expert Revesz. \"It's extraordinarily unusual,\" he says.   Not just air pollution    Revesz points out that under the Trump administration, the EPA has made moves to reconsider the economic benefits of regulations in other areas, as well.   \n   In its proposal to roll back vehicle emissions standards, for example, the EPA did not assess the potential economic benefits to consumers who switched to electric vehicles instead of choosing gas-powered cars. It also explicitly declined to calculate societal economic benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and significantly lowered the estimates of the health savings from tighter rules. The EPA did the same in its efforts to roll back the endangerment finding, which has been in place since 2009. That finding concludes that the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere poses serious risks to public health and well-being.   Revesz says that makes three ways the EPA used to consider economic benefits to Americans from regulations. And now the \"EPA has said that it's going to ignore all three of them,\" he says.   EPA administrator Lee Zeldin wrote in a 2025 statement that his priorities at the agency were to \"lower the cost of buying a car, heating a home and running a business.\"\n",

Today's top stories   President Trump delivered a speech yesterday at the Detroit Economic Club. He touched on the U.S. economy but also meandered into other topics. The president has started traveling around the U.S., addressing a top concern for voters: affordability. The economy is expected to be one of the main issues in this year's midterm elections.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump speaks at the Detroit Economic Club in Detroit, Michigan, on Jan. 13, 2026.\n                \n                    Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Throughout his speech, the president would change topics mid-sentence and insulted more than half a dozen politicians, including former President Joe Biden, NPR's Tamara Keith tells Up First. Trump said the economy is great and boasted about the low cost of groceries. He also stated that \"affordability\" is a fake word by Democrats, but Keith says the riffs of the term risk undercutting his message. The president said he plans to outline a proposal at the World Economic Forum next week to reduce home prices by removing private equity companies from the U.S. housing market.   The Department of Labor's latest inflation report showed that inflation, overall, neither improved nor worsened from November to December.    \n   🎧 Natural gas prices have risen more than 10% over the last year, the Labor Department reports. This affects nearly half of the U.S., which uses natural gas for heating, resulting in higher heating bills, NPR's Scott Horsley says. A significant amount of natural gas is used to generate electricity, which in turn drives up prices. Grocery prices were also up sharply last month. Most forecasters believe the Fed will hold interest rates steady when policymakers meet later this month, as inflation remains higher than the central bank's target.   At least six federal prosecutors in Minnesota have quit after Justice Department leaders pressured them in the investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Macklin Good. Rather than focusing on the federal agent who shot Good last week in Minneapolis, political leaders wanted the prosecutors to find dirt on her widow. The resignations have disrupted other federal investigations, including one into social services fraud.    🎧 The resignations amount to a big loss of career DOJ talent who prosecuted several major cases, Minnesota Public Radio's Matt Sepic says. The DOJ leaders pressured the prosecutors to look into Good's widow, Becca Good, for ties to activist groups, which is not illegal, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. This source also informed Sepic that they are concerned that Trump's focus on immigration has drawn resources away from the fraud investigation.   \n   Deep dive   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                People wait outside immigration court in October 2025 in San Francisco.\n                \n                    Minh Connors/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Minh Connors/AP\n    \n\n   \n   The Trump administration plans to close the San Francisco Immigration Court by the end of the year. The announcement comes as immigration judges have spent the last year facing pressure to expedite their caseloads and streamline deportations. Teresa Riley, the chief immigration judge, sent an email about the closure to court employees and judges last week. The email also explained that all personnel will now transfer to the Concord Immigration Court, approximately 30 miles away. San Francisco's immigration court has been among those hit by the Trump administration's push to fire judges.    ➡️ The Trump administration fired nearly 100 judges in 2025, according to an NPR count cross-referenced with the judges' union and several individual courts.➡️ The U.S. is starting this year with fewer than half the judges from a year ago. At least two courts — in Aurora, Colo., and in Oakdale, La., — have no judges left, just the court supervisor.➡️ With fewer judges and courts, immigrants are seeing their cases pushed back as far as 2030. Lawyers say the delays make their clients more susceptible to arrests and deportations.

Movement can boost a person's mood and can actively relieve symptoms of depression, according to a new study. Scientists evaluated 73 randomized controlled trials involving around 5,000 people with depression, with many of them also having tried antidepressant medications. The findings highlighted \"that exercise is one of the most evidence-based tools for improving mood,\" says psychiatrist Dr. Stephen Mateka. This is how exercise mirrors some of the effects of medication:    🚴 Exercise improves neurotransmitter function, like serotonin and dopamine. This benefit aligns with the way the medicine provides relief.🚴 Physical activity can trigger the release of brain growth factors. This is contrary to how depression can decrease neuroplasticity, making it harder for the brain to adapt and change.🚴 Prescribed exercise can be hard to start for someone with depression. However, light to moderate movements can benefit you as much as an intensive workout.   \n   3 things to know before you go   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Cartoonist Scott Adams poses with his a life-size cutout of his creation, Dilbert, in 2014.\n                \n                    Lea Suzuki/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Lea Suzuki/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Scott Adams, the controversial cartoonist behind Dilbert, has died at age 68.

Court employees and judges at the San Francisco Immigration Court received a short email last week letting them know that their court at 100 Montgomery Street will be shutting its doors by the end of the year. All personnel will be transferred to the Concord Immigration Court, about 30 miles away, according to the email sent by Teresa Riley, the chief immigration judge, and obtained by NPR.   Courtrooms at the Department of Homeland Security's San Francisco detention facility located a 630 Sansome St. will remain. But the closure of the main courthouse is expected to add to the workload on immigration judges as they already face pressure to move through their caseloads faster and to streamline deportations.   \n   \"At first it was a message that you better fall in line or you're going to get fired,\" said Jeremiah Johnson, a former immigration judge who worked in San Francisco's court until his termination last year. Now, \"it's a message that your court is going to be closed.\"   \n   San Francisco's immigration court has been among those particularly hit by the Trump administration's push to fire judges. According to a count kept by NPR, 12 judges and a court supervisor received termination notices last year. Several others retired or left, leaving the court with just four immigration judges and one supervisor to hear cases as of the beginning of this year — down from 21 at the start of 2025.   The closure of the court came as a surprise to many current and former employees at the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), which is part of the Department of Justice. The employees spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. EOIR spokesperson Kathryn Mattingly says the move to Concord \"would be more cost-effective.\"   The judges who remain in the court this year now face some 120,935 immigration cases, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse data as of September. Those cases will be transferred to the court in Concord over the course of the next year, or be heard remotely, Mattingly said.   \n   The Concord court opened in early 2024 specifically to help ease the pressure on the San Francisco court, which was one of the busiest immigration courts in the country, hearing cases from migrants in Portland through California's Central Valley.   Concord's court itself has also shed judges and other employees, and already has a growing backlog of immigration cases.   \n   Firing push nationwide   The situation in California isn't unique. In total, the Trump administration fired nearly 100 judges in 2025, including both newer judges and those with more experience, according to NPR's count cross-referenced with the judges' union and those in several of the individual courts. That number includes assistant chief immigration judges, or courthouse supervisors who also have their own dockets.   The year-end string of layoffs included at least 19 experienced judges who had been with the agency for years, NPR has identified.   The result is that courts across the country are starting 2026 with fewer than half the judges from a year ago as judges were fired, resigned or were reassigned. At least two courts — in Aurora, Colo., and in Oakdale, La., — have no judges left, just the court supervisor.   Those courts haven't closed yet, but observers expect similar moves to shrink the number of immigration courts and adjudication centers in the country, which currently number 76.   \n   With fewer judges and courts to hear them, immigrants are seeing their cases pushed back as far as 2030. Many of these immigrants have already waited years for their chance to make their case before a judge. Lawyers say the delays make their clients more vulnerable to arrests and deportations, as part of the administration's push to broaden the scope of arrests.   Jordan Weiner is an immigration lawyer in San Francisco and the interim executive director of La Raza Centro Legal, a legal and advocacy group. She saw court backlogs grow during the COVID-19 pandemic, and she sees the shutting of San Francisco's court as another \"mass delay event.\"   \n   Weiner has 10 cases in the San Francisco Immigration Court; all have been pushed back due to the termination of judges. One of her clients has been in the U.S. for nearly a decade. That case has already been pushed to 2027 and she anticipates it will be postponed again once it goes to the judges in Concord.   \"Of course people are scared to go to immigration court because of the arrests — and closing down San Francisco Immigration Court isn't going to help,\" Weiner said. \"That doesn't give a lot of confidence in the system.\"   \n   Hiring more judges   EOIR is planning to bring on new classes of immigration judges at least every quarter to make up for those who were fired or left. But it's unclear whether they would fully make up for the shortfalls.   The agency launched a new hiring campaign in November that seeks to recruit \"deportation judges\" — rather than \"immigration judges.\" The agency did not respond to questions over how many applications it has received in the first few months of the hiring campaign.   Fired judges also worry that the administration's rounds of terminations favors those who had immigration defense experience. This, they said, gives the perception that immigration courts are favoring outcomes in line with President Trump's goal of mass deportations.   \"You're weakening the rule of law by not having immigration judges; you're having deportation judges,\" Johnson, the former immigration judge in San Francisco, said.   \n   Immigration judges typically come from a variety of backgrounds, including immigration enforcement and immigration defense. But of the judges fired between February and October last year, most had experience in immigration defense, an NPR investigation found.   The DOJ also promoted 10 judges to be courthouse supervisors. An NPR analysis of those judge's background and records show eight have prior experience working for the Homeland Security Department.   \n   Temporary military judges brought in   The Trump administration has also moved forward with temporary judge positions. The Pentagon in September authorized up to 600 military lawyers from the Judge Advocate General's Corps, or JAGs, to serve as temporary immigration judges. One class of 25 was already onboarded and a second was expected to begin their training as soon as this week, NPR has learned from two sources not permitted to speak publicly.   These judges are also not exempt from the pressures from this administration to more quickly adjudicate cases and to streamline deportations.   \n   JAG judges currently on the bench issued removal orders at a higher rate than other judges did, according to an analysis of court data by the legal nonprofit Mobile Pathways.   \n   Those who don't comply may already be facing consequences. One JAG judge, Christopher Day, a U.S. Army Reserve lawyer, had granted asylum and relief from immediate deportation at a higher rate than his other JAG counterparts, according to EOIR data compiled by Mobile Pathways.   Day has been removed from his post, per EOIR's website.   EOIR declined to comment on personnel matters.\n",

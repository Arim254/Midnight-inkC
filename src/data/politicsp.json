During an interview with YouTuber Brian Tyler Cohen, Obama said many Americans \"find this behavior deeply troubling.\"   \"There doesn't seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office,\" Obama said in the interview, which was posted on YouTube Saturday.   \n   \"There's this sort of clown show that's happening in social media and on television,\" Obama added, describing much of the noise around Trump's presidency as a \"distraction\".   Obama's response follows outrage over the video, which depicted Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the clip, saying \"please stop the fake outrage.\" Trump refused to apologize for the social media post, telling reporters \"I didn't make a mistake\" aboard Air Force One.   The video, which was posted at the beginning of Black History Month, has since been deleted. The White House blamed a staffer for \"erroneously\" posting the video clip.   Obama also shared his thoughts on the immigration crackdown and protests in Minnesota and elsewhere around the country, telling Cohen they have left a good number of American people saying \"we're going to live up to those values that we say we believe in.\"   \"It is important for us to recognize the unprecedented nature of what ICE was doing in Minneapolis, St. Paul, the way that federal agents, ICE agents were being deployed, without any clear guidelines, training, pulling people out of their homes, using five-year-olds to try to bait their parents, all the stuff that we saw, teargassing crowds simply who were standing there, not breaking any laws,\" the 44th president said.   \n   Obama called the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis last month \"a heartbreaking tragedy\" and said it was \"a wake-up call to every American, regardless of party, that many of our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault.\"    He also said that the Trump administration has given explanations for the deaths of Pretti and Renee Good, a 37-year-old woman killed by an immigration agent, \"that aren't informed by any serious investigation.\"\n",

We'll get back to the original footprint,\" Homan said, speaking on CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday. Exceptions beyond that footprint, he said, will include agents who will remain to finish investigating allegations of fraud related to day care funds as well as the anti-ICE protest that had disrupted service at a church, where a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official is a pastor.   \n   Homan said an additional security force — described in size only as \"small\" — will stay to \"respond to when our agents are out, and they get surrounded by agitators and things got out of control.\"    \"They'll remain for a short period of time, just to make sure the coordination, the agreements we have with local state law enforcement stay in place, and they respond to a public safety threat when needed,\" Homan said, adding that he hoped that contingent of security forces \"can be removed fairly quickly.\"    \n   On Thursday, Homan announced the conclusion of the Trump administration's \"Operation Metro Surge,\" which sent thousands of immigration agents into the state. This drew extensive protests, as agents shot and killed two U.S. citizens.    On CBS on Sunday, Homan was also asked about the shutdown at the Department of Homeland Security that began this weekend after lawmakers failed to agree on agency funding as Democrats push for policy changes. Homan repeatedly said he was not a part of those negotiations, though he also took issue with some of the Democrats' demands, including calls to prohibit ICE agents from wearing masks to conceal their faces.    \"I don't like the masks either,\" Homan said, but also echoed the Republicans' argument that revealing officers' identities would would make it easier for people to dox them. \"The masks right now are for officer safety reasons.\" ICE has not shared details of violence or attacks related to exposure of agents' identities.\n",

    "body": "\n      President Trump seems to lose some of his grip on his base as the Department Of Homeland Security shuts down amidst resistance to changes to immigration enforcement.   \n\n    AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:  Funding for the Department of Homeland Security ran out yesterday morning, and we're now in a shutdown. If it keeps going, the shutdown could upset travel plans, immigration enforcement and disaster relief. This all happened after Democrats demanded a range of new restrictions on immigration agents, and Republicans resisted. NPR senior national political correspondent Mara Liasson is with us now to talk about that and more. Good morning, Mara.MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Ayesha.RASCOE: So even though DHS is technically in a shutdown, the work is ongoing because 90% of its employees are considered essential and have to keep working. So this whole thing, in many ways, is, like, symbolic, right? Like, it's a standoff on immigration policies.LIASSON: That's right. ICE itself has a lot of appropriated money already, so it can continue its work, but it's become very unpopular, including with some of Donald Trump's own supporters. People tell pollsters they like the idea of a secure border. They like the idea of deporting undocumented immigrants with criminal records. But they don't like watching American citizens be killed or children be detained or law enforcement going into people's homes without warrants. And Democrats have pushed back and are asking for a set of reforms that include needing a warrant or having a badge with an ID number on it. And those reforms are pretty common for police departments all over the country.RASCOE: It sounds like Trump is maybe getting a bit of pushback from his own base. Is he losing a grip on his party?LIASSON: I wouldn't go that far, but he certainly is getting pushback from a number of areas. Six Republicans in the House joined Democrats to vote against his tariffs on Canada. A number of grand juries are refusing to indict, as Trump's prosecutors have asked them to. He had to back down on the Epstein files, where when Republicans joined Democrats to vote for them to be released, he got a lot of criticism, even from Republicans, about a racist tweet that he posted. So - and his approval ratings are dropping, and it's a midterm year. So even Donald Trump is not immune from the laws of political gravity, and he is seen as a liability by some Republicans in swing districts.RASCOE: Well, speaking of the midterms, Trump says he wants to nationalize the midterms this year and change the way they're run. Here he is on the Dan Bongino podcast earlier this month.(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE DAN BONGINO SHOW\")PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The Republicans should say, we want to take over. We should take over the voting in at least many - 15 places. The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting.RASCOE: Now, I mean, constitutionally, though, that is not allowed, right? Am I wrong on that?LIASSON: That's right. I mean, Donald Trump has said they should cancel the elections. He has said we shouldn't even have elections. But the Constitution gives states the power to conduct elections. So election experts say canceling the elections would be pretty hard, but there are a lot of things they worry that he can do to undermine the voting. He's already commandeered voter rolls in a bunch of states. He, in the past, has said he wouldn't honor results of an election unless he wins. That's what January 6 was all about when he sent his supporters to the Capitol to try to decertify the election results. But he could challenge voters. He could try to disqualify them, claim that they're not U.S. citizens. So election experts are worried that Donald Trump is laying the groundwork to challenge the results of future elections.RASCOE: Well, switching gears a little bit. Some U.S. lawmakers are in Munich for the Munich Security Conference this weekend, where Europeans are making it clear that U.S. values are becoming increasingly distant from their own values, especially when it comes to NATO, which Trump has threatened to leave. But Secretary of State Marco Rubio, he struck a different tone yesterday, right?LIASSON: That's right. Unlike JD - Vice President Vance's speech at the last Munich conference, where he scolded Europeans for sidelining far-right parties and limiting free speech, Rubio had a slightly different message. He said that the U.S. and Europe belong together. He said the U.S. wants a strong Europe, even though he also criticized Europe's immigration policies. So I would say Rubio came to Munich with a different tone, if not difference in substance.RASCOE: That's NPR senior national political correspondent Mara Liasson.

He struck a less aggressive tone than Vice President JD Vance did in lecturing them at the same gathering last year but maintained a firm tone on Washington's intent to reshape the trans-Atlantic alliance and push its policy priorities.   Kallas alluded to criticism in the U.S. national security strategy released in December, which asserted that economic stagnation in Europe \"is eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilizational erasure.\" It suggested that Europe is being enfeebled by its immigration policies, declining birth rates, \"censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition\" and a \"loss of national identities and self-confidence.\"   \n   \"Contrary to what some may say, woke, decadent Europe is not facing civilizational erasure,\" Kallas told the conference. \"In fact, people still want to join our club and not just fellow Europeans,\" she added, saying she was told when visiting Canada last year that many people there have an interest in joining the EU.   \n   Kallas rejected what she called \"European-bashing.\"   \"We are, you know, pushing humanity forward, trying to defend human rights and all this, which is actually bringing also prosperity for people. So that's why it's very hard for me to believe these accusations.\"   In his conference speech, Rubio said that an end to the trans-Atlantic era \"is neither our goal nor our wish,\" adding that \"our home may be in the Western hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe.\"   He made clear that the Trump administration is sticking to its guns on issues such as migration, trade and climate. And European officials who addressed the gathering made clear that they in turn will stand by their values, including their approach to free speech, climate change and free trade.   British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Saturday that Europe must defend \"the vibrant, free and diverse societies that we represent, showing that people who look different to each other can live peacefully together, that this isn't against the tenor of our times.\"   \n   \"Rather, it is what makes us strong,\" he said.   Kallas said Rubio's speech sent an important message that America and Europe are and will remain intertwined.   \"It is also clear that we don't see eye to eye on all the issues and this will remain the case as well, but I think we can work from there,\" she said.\n",

Of those, Jamaat won 68, a record high. It had never before won more than 18 seats. The student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) won six and the remainder went to minor parties.   The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won a landslide 212 seats, giving it the two-thirds majority and setting Tarique Rahman, who hails from a powerful political family, on course to become prime minister. Developments in Bangladesh are being closely watched beyond its borders. It is the world's eighth-most populous country and second-largest garment exporter after China, supplying major brands to Europe and the United States - a position the BNP will be keen to protect.   \n   The country's other major party, the Awami League, was banned from taking part in the polls. Its leader, former autocratic prime minister Sheikh Hasina, fled the country after the deadly 2024 student-led uprising that toppled her government and paved the way for this vote.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                People offer Friday prayers on a road outside a mosque a day after the national parliamentary election in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Friday, Feb. 13, 2026.\n                \n                    Anupam Nath/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anupam Nath/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Jamaat-e-Islami's leader, Shafiqur Rahman, who is not related to the BNP's Tarique Rahman, initially claimed there had been irregularities during voting. He later conceded defeat and said in a statement: \"We recognize the overall outcome and we respect the rule of law. We will serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition, holding the government to account.\"   A surprising result after decades on the periphery   Jamaat's result has come as a shock to many, in part because the party opposed Bangladesh's independence in 1971 and sided with Pakistan during the war.   \n   At the time, its leaders were accused of committing widespread atrocities, including rape, torture and murder — accusations the party has consistently rejected.   Some of its senior members were tried and found guilty of those crimes in a specially formed court from 2010 to 2013, when the Awami League was in power. Some were given death sentences, while others received life imprisonment. Jamaat maintains that the trials were politically motivated.   The party was also banned at various times, most recently by the Awami League in 2023. The ban was lifted following the 2024 uprising, allowing Jamaat to reemerge as a major electoral contender.   \n   \"Many voters are young, and they don't like to live in the past. They want to build their future. Jamaat has been saying things that seem more practical and achievable,\" Maimul Ahsan Khan, a retired law professor of law at Dhaka University, told NPR.   However, he added, \"I think Jamaat would have got even more seats if it did not have the past baggage of affinity to Pakistan and 1971.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Women queue up to cast their vote at a polling station during Bangladesh's national parliamentary election, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Thursday, Feb. 12, 2026.\n                \n                    Mahmud Hossain Opu/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mahmud Hossain Opu/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Observers say the result may mark just the first step for Jamaat in rebuilding its political influence.   \"With 77 seats, we have nearly quadrupled our parliamentary presence and become one of the strongest opposition blocs in modern Bangladeshi politics. That is not a setback. That is a foundation,\" said Shafiqur Rahman.   Civil rights concerns   While more than 90 percent of Bangladesh's population is Muslim, its political system ensures equal rights for minority religions.   Although Jamaat has Sharia — or Islamic — law enshrined in its constitution, it has recently softened its public image, taking a more moderate tone on religion and saying it will respect Bangladesh's political system.   It fielded one Hindu candidate during the election but no women, and Shafiqur Rahman has publicly said no woman can lead the party.   However, Jon Danilowicz, an independent political analyst and retired former diplomat who served in Bangladesh, told NPR that violence against minority groups in Bangladesh has a long history and is often driven by factors besides ideology alone.   \"Often it's driven by economics and other issues,\" he says, and minority groups have \"been equally victimized by the BNP and Awami League.\"   Danilowicz says that in regards to the party's treatment of women, \"they frame it as protection and safety and in terms of family and preserving the role of women within a family structure.\"   Jamaat's first tests are to demonstrate that it can hold the new government accountable and to implement the July National Charter — a set of reforms to prevent a return to autocracy — which could help to reassure millions of Bangladeshis who still distrust the party.\n",

Lindberg, the founding director of Sweden's V-Dem Institute, which monitors democracy across the globe, says the U.S. has already crossed the threshold and become an \"electoral autocracy.\"   Steven Levitsky, a professor of government at Harvard University and co-author of How Democracies Die, agrees.   \"I would argue that the United States in 2025-26 has slid into a mild form of competitive authoritarianism,\" Levitsky said. \"I think it's reversible, but this is authoritarianism.\"   Under competitive authoritarianism, countries still hold elections, but the ruling party uses various tactics — attacking the press, disenfranchising voters, weaponizing the justice system and threatening critics — to tilt the electoral playing field in its favor.   \n   Levitsky cited what he considers two strikingly autocratic moments that occurred in September. First, the Trump administration threatened ABC's parent company, Disney, following Jimmy Kimmel's comments on the killing of Charlie Kirk.   \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Brendan Carr, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, warned.   A week later, President Trump proposed that U.S. generals use American cities as training grounds for their troops.   \"We're under invasion from within,\" Trump said to a gathering of military brass in Quantico, Virginia. \"No different than a foreign enemy, but more difficult in many ways because they don't wear uniforms.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Protesters throw trash and objects as they clash with federal agents and police during a \"National Shutdown\" protest against Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Los Angeles on Jan. 30, following the shooting deaths of two U.S. citizens by federal agents in Minneapolis.\n                \n                    Patrick T. Fallon/AFP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Patrick T. Fallon/AFP\n    \n\n   \n   Levitsky said this is the kind of language dictators in South America used in the 1970s — leaders like Augusto Pinochet in Chile.   A smaller number of scholars reject the portrayal of Trump as a would-be autocrat. They say he is expanding executive power to address the excesses of his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.   Jonathan Turley, a professor at George Washington University Law School, says Trump is pressuring news organizations and universities to address problems with liberal bias.   \"There are legitimate objections that have been raised by the Trump administration,\" said Turley, the author of Rage and the Republic. \"That does not justify some of the means, but there is a long-standing need for a debate within these institutions.\"   \n   Other political scientists say the U.S. system of government is battered but still democratic. Kurt Weyland, who researches democracy and authoritarianism at the University of Texas at Austin, says he's increasingly confident that the U.S. can withstand Trump's sweeping attempt to expand executive power.   Weyland said that for the first months of his second term, Trump was like a \"steamroller\" and faced little containment or opposition. But Weyland, who wrote Democracy's Resilience to Populism's Threat: Countering Global Alarmism, says that has changed.   For instance, Kimmel was yanked off the air but soon returned and continues to routinely mock Trump. Weyland also said the president's attempt to tilt the electoral playing field through mass redistricting hasn't worked out as he might have hoped.   \"If the guy had succeeded in seriously skewing [future] elections in the House, that would've gone to the core of democracy,\" said Weyland, \"but he didn't. He got barely anything.\"   Weyland also said federal agents shooting two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis last month was disastrous for the president. Border czar Tom Homan said last week that the immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota is ending. Weyland thinks the public blowback to the killings limits Trump's ability to deploy such aggressive tactics going forward.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Demonstrators spell out an SOS signal of distress on a frozen lake in Minneapolis, in the aftermath of the shooting deaths of Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents.\n                \n                    John Moore/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        John Moore/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The next big test for American democracy could come in November's midterms. The Trump administration is suing states to hand over voter data, which worries Kim Scheppele, a Princeton University sociologist who has studied the authoritarian tactics of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.   In 2014, Orbán's government messaged Hungarian voters living in the United Kingdom to go to one polling place and then switched to a different location on Election Day.   \"They disenfranchised almost all the Hungarians in the U.K., most of whom were oppositional to Orbán,\" says Scheppele.   This month, Steve Bannon, a close Trump ally, proposed that the administration deploy Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to polling places to root out undocumented migrants trying to vote — which is statistically rare.   \n   White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said she'd never heard the president discuss such a plan — and federal law prohibits it.   But Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College, worries that such a move would drive down participation by people of color and naturalized citizens who fear harassment by ICE. If ICE were deployed, Nyhan hopes it would spark even more people to vote.   \"But even contemplating that kind of interference is, I think, a really substantial threat,\" said Nyhan. \"The way Election Day works in this country, there are no do-overs.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      Crowds of protestors gathered in cities and towns across the nation on Saturday to protest against President Trump. And there is no sign of a breakthrough to end the government shutdown.   \n\n    (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Ho, ho. Donald Trump has got to go. Hey, hey. Ho, ho.DON GONYEA, HOST:  Protesters in cities and towns across the nation took to the streets yesterday to challenge the Trump administration. One of those attending a No Kings rally here in Washington, D.C., was Jane Campos (ph).JANE CAMPOS: Well, I think we are at risk of losing our democracy, and we really need to stand up and say enough is enough.GONYEA: But Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson slammed the demonstrations as a hate America rally. Joining us now to discuss the protests and much more is NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben. Good morning, Danielle.DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Good morning, Don.GONYEA: So how do you assess the significance of these demonstrations?KURTZLEBEN: Well, they're definitely significant. I mean, first of all, they were huge. You saw these full city blocks just densely packed with people in New York, D.C., Chicago. You saw some big protests worldwide and still sizable protests in smaller cities, suburbs and small towns.But also, I just keep thinking back to covering protests right after Trump was first inaugurated in 2017. You immediately had the Women's March. You had those demonstrations at airports about immigration, pro-science demonstrations. But they were all separate.This has been a slower build, but it's like you're seeing all of that energy rolled into kind of one big protest movement. And furthermore, as Trump has gone further and faster with his agenda this time, these protests feel existential. They're not about issues. As the protesters keep saying, this is about democracy itself.GONYEA: And the president, meanwhile, continues to make foreign policy a top priority. He talked on the phone to Russia's President Vladimir Putin last week before hosting Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House. That was on Friday. What would you say is the state of play when it comes to those relations?KURTZLEBEN: Well, it's really striking to me how big events keep happening in this whole saga, and yet we haven't seen President Trump make a lot of headway. There was that disastrous Oval Office meeting earlier this year where Zelenskyy, Trump and Vice President Vance came to a near-shouting match. There was that meeting in Alaska with the Russian president on U.S. soil. That was momentous. And there were several foreign leaders coming to the White House to talk about peace this year. And then this week, this two-hour phone call with Putin and Zelenskyy visiting the White House. And yet for all of that sounded fury, there just hasn't been a lot of movement.GONYEA: Anything come out of these latest talks?KURTZLEBEN: Well, one big topic was these long-range Tomahawk missiles. Prior to that Thursday Putin call, Trump had signaled he might supply those missiles to Ukraine. But after that call, talking to Zelenskyy, he seemed to have softened on it, saying he hopes to end the war without those missiles. But we do now have some more big meetings to come. Trump says he will meet Putin soon in Budapest, Hungary, to discuss an end to the war. And in addition, Secretary of State Marco Rubio says he will hold talks with the Russian foreign minister before all of that. But as we've seen, none of that means progress.GONYEA: And then finally, Danielle, it is Day 19 of the government shutdown. Any glimpse of a deal?KURTZLEBEN: No, in a word.GONYEA: OK.KURTZLEBEN: On Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats alike are dug in, and Trump doesn't seem himself to be in a hurry to fix things. He's using the shutdown to pick winners and losers within the government. He has said he's trying to hurt what he calls Democrat programs. And meanwhile, while some workers are starting to go unpaid, he says he's going to make sure that some - military, FBI, ICE - that they will get paid.Now, one more development. The administration has been trying to do layoffs across government during the shutdown. They said they had planned around 4,000 at one point. A U.S. district court judge issued a temporary restraining order halting some of those layoffs. What happened was some unions representing government employees argued, look, you can't just shut down programs because funding runs out, and the judge agreed with them.But that restraining order only protects some employees. And so the Trump administration, as of Friday, had only paused work on a small share of the firings. Now, meanwhile, White House Budget Director Russ Vought - he said layoffs eventually could total more than 10,000. So this fight just is not going to go away.GONYEA: That's NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben. Danielle, thank you, as always.KURTZLEBEN: Thank you, Don.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

The overriding theme of the marches was the accusation that the president is behaving more like a monarch than an elected official.   This is the second massive wave of protests organized by No Kings — a network of progressive organizations fighting against Trump's agenda. Organizers projected a turnout in the millions across some 2,600 events around the country.   In New York City's Times Square, protesters carried signs that read: \"resist the fascists traitors\" and \"No crowns, No kings,\" spilled into the crowd of Broadway matinee show attendees, Gothamist reported.   \n   The No Kings group said it had already achieved its goal in June and was ready to send the White House yet another statement.   \"In June, we did what many claimed was impossible: peacefully mobilized millions of people to take to the streets and declare with one voice: America has No Kings,\" No Kings said on its website.   The overwhelmingly peaceful June protests were in response to a military parade held on the Army's 250th anniversary — which coincided with Trump's 79th birthday. Critics said Trump had pushed for the extravagant parade not to commemorate the armed forces, but as a display of his own vanity.   \"Now, President Trump has doubled down,\" No Kings said on its website, citing immigration detentions carried out by often-masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, the administration's aggressive slashing of federal education resources and environmental protections, gerrymandering and other concerns.   No Kings organizers estimated that more than 5 million people turned out for the June protests. They speculated that Saturday's event could be even bigger.   No Kings held one of its largest protests in Washington, D.C. No Kings events were not planned for the city during the June protests when the military parade was held.   Demonstrators filled Pennsylvania Avenue near the U.S. Capitol, many holding signs that read \"No Kings, No Tyrants\" and some even wearing costumes. There were also many people wearing yellow, a color organizers said is to show unity.   \n   Sen. Bernie Sanders of (I-Vt.) addressed D.C. protesters in remarks slamming tech billionaires who he said have become richer and more powerful since Trump became president, calling out Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg \"and the other multibillionaires who were sitting right behind Trump when he was inaugurated.\"   Uriah Kitchen of Delaware, who attended the protest with his son Elijah, told NPR \"we made a pledge of allegiance when we were in school and this is what it's all about.\"   \"This is why we're here, we're here to protect America,\" Kitchen said.   Trump, himself, was not at the White House during the protests but on a visit to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.   \n   Lt. Patrick Loftus, a spokesperson for D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department, told NPR the department made no arrests during the protest.   In Chicago, a city Trump has repeatedly criticized over crime, Mayor Brandon Johnson spoke to a cheering crowd.   \"Now listen, there are those in this country who have decided at the behest of the President to declare war on Chicago and American cities across this country!\" the Democratic official said. \"But we are here to stand firm, to stand committed that we will not bend, we will not bow, we will not cower, we will not submit to the authoritarianism that is coming down!\"   The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to allow it to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois after lower courts blocked the deployment.   \n   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A person dressed in a Statue of Liberty costume participates in a \"No Kings\" national day of protest in New York on Saturday. Millions of people are expected to attend similar protests across the country, organizers say.\n                \n                    Timothy A.

Clary/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, slammed the demonstration as a \"hate America rally,\" and other Republicans have derided the movement as anti-American.   \"It's all the pro-Hamas wing and, you know, the antifa people,\" Johnson said last week on Fox News. \"They're all coming out.\"   Lucia Wrobleswski from Afton, Minn., a city council member and former police officer pushed back on the rhetoric: \"They keep saying that we who are anti-fascist or Democrats are terrorists and fascists and it's such a lie,\" she said while at a local rally.   \n   Responding to NPR's questions about the protests, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said: \"Who cares?\"   Maria Floriano showed up to an event in San Pablo, Calif., wearing a hat and shirt decorated with butterflies. She compared immigration to butterflies, saying \"migration is beautiful\" and \"an act of courage.\"   Floriano, noting the protest was held in a Bay Area community home to a large population of immigrants, said: \"We want them to know that there are people fighting for them, that not everyone feels that they're not welcome here.\"   At a rally in Sarasota, Fla., Jim Rosinus, chairman of Lee County's Democratic Party, said that although party leadership was there to supply signs and refreshments, the event was nonpartisan.   \"It's not a Democratic Party thing, and there are a lot of people here who are not Democrats,\" he said. \"They're either NPAs or even Republicans; there are a lot of Republicans who are just fed up with where their party is going and what's happening and want to show it.\"   That sentiment was echoed at rallies in other cities, including Salt Lake City, where protester Adam Livingston, a 35-year-old Marine Corps veteran, wore fatigues and carried a Marine Corps flag.   \"Veterans and even active duty service members need to realize that we're loyal to the Constitution and not to a faith, a political party, an ideology, or a man,\" he said.   Republican Govs. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia and Greg Abbott of Texas, in preparation for the day of protesters, mobilized their states' National Guards.   \"The Governor has authorized state active duty for training to help ensure the Guard will be ready to respond if needed to help keep people safe,\" Youngkin spokesman Peter Finocchio wrote in a statement to VPM.   The Texas Newsroom reported that Abbott said in a statement about sending the Guards to Austin: \"Violence and destruction will never be tolerated in Texas. Texas will deter criminal mischief and work with local law enforcement to arrest anyone engaging in acts of violence or damaging property.\"   \n   Standing by a traffic light in Plano, Texas, Jenny Colombo held a rainbow-trimmed sign that said \"The Emperor Has No Clothes.\"   \"I feel President Trump is the epitome of that character,\" Colombo told member station KERA. \"Everybody is just walking around him, everybody can see what's going on, and they're all just supporting him blindly.\"   As of Saturday evening, protests appeared to have been peaceful with no major incidents of violence reported.   New York City police said events there drew an estimated 100,000 people across all five boroughs and that it made no protest-related arrests.   \n   Speaking to Connecticut Public, that state's lead No Kings organizer, Jim Chapdelaine, reiterated the coalition's commitment to peace and the importance of people showing up for what they believe in.   \"There are powers that be that would prefer we all just stay at our houses and, I don't know, take up crochet,\" Chapdelaine said in a Tuesday interview. \"It's really important to build community and solidarity and unity, [and] especially important to do that in a very peaceful way.\"   NPR's Joel Rose, KQED reporter Brian Krans, MPR's Dana Ferguson, KUER's Martha Harris and WGCU's Mike Braun contributed reporting.\n",

His retirement was announced by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth this week on social media. NPR's Quil Lawrence reports.QUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE: Secretary Hegseth announced that Admiral Alvin Holsey would retire after 37 years in the military and praised what he called the admiral's unwavering commitment to mission, people and nation. U.S. Southern Command later posted a message from Admiral Holsey thanking his troops. It's highly unusual for an officer not to finish the full three years of a command like this, and even stranger in the middle of a military buildup, which has seen thousands of U.S. troops move into position off the Venezuelan coast. Admiral Holsey is Black. The Trump administration has let go several senior military leaders who are non-white or female, implying that they'd been promoted for that reason. But there's another theory this time, says retired Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery.MARK MONTGOMERY: I'd probably lean more towards we're conducting extremely unusual operations in Southern Command right now that a reasonable person could disagree with the legality of.LAWRENCE: At least six times recently, the U.S. military has made lethal strikes on small civilian vessels. The White House says they carry drugs. Critics say the strikes are illegal under both U.S. and international law and that they amount to execution without trial. Montgomery says the military is ill-suited to that job.MONTGOMERY: As much as I absolutely want to prevent all drugs coming into the country, this kind of law enforcement action against narcotic deliveries is best handled by law enforcement that does appropriate due process.LAWRENCE: A U.S. official not authorized to speak publicly has confirmed with NPR that Admiral Holsey recently met with Hegseth at the Pentagon to express his concerns and then stepped down. After that news broke, President Trump confirmed the most recent strike on what he described as a drug-carrying submarine. Trump said without evidence that this was, quote, \"not a group of innocent people.\" A second U.S. official who is not permitted to speak publicly said U.S. troops seized two survivors after that strike, and they're being brought elsewhere for possible legal proceedings.Quil Lawrence, NPR News.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "\n      The government shutdown goes on and House Speaker Mike Johnson refuses to swear in a Democratic representative-elect. President Trump thinks he has momentum to get a Russia-Ukraine peace deal done.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  Senior political contributor Ron Elving joins us. Ron, thanks so much for being with us.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.SIMON: Of course, there were big protests during the first Trump administration, women's marches among them, many demonstrations against his immigration policies. How do these No Kings protests compare?ELVING: The day after Trump's first inauguration in 2017, close to half a million people - most of them women - marched on the mall in Washington. There was an estimated 400,000 in New York City, 250,000 in Chicago, and so on. But as we just heard, organizers this year expect crowds in more than 2,000 locations, and attendance, they hope, will be in the millions. Those earlier protests were largely driven by advocates for abortion rights and women's rights. The current protests cover a wider range of issues - the rule of law, individual rights under the Constitution, and the cutbacks in funding for health and education. But at the same time, the overarching issue today is rejection of autocracy, rejection of rule by one person.SIMON: We're now on the 18th day of a government shutdown. Is this becoming showdown - a shutdown, unlike any other?ELVING: In past shutdowns, there have been serious ongoing efforts to resolve the underlying issues, to negotiate between the parties, to reach some kind of agreement. That's the difference. In the past, there has been general agreement that the damage from the shutdown, the harm to everyday Americans was more important than having one side or the other prevail. There was a sense of there being an us - not just an us against them. And we are not seeing that now. Whatever responsibility Democrats have for this shutdown, they are at least here in town, in D.C., ready to talk. The president and his party have refused, saying there is nothing to negotiate. The House has not had a voting session since the summer.SIMON: Speaker Mike Johnson is also refusing to swear in Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva. She won her special election in Arizona more than three weeks ago. Arizona's attorney general is threatening legal action if she's not sworn in. What reasons has the speaker offered for the delay?ELVING: Johnson has said he does not want to swear in Ms. Grijalva until the House is back in session so she can have all the usual ceremony. Except that earlier this year, he swore in two Republicans elected in special elections when the House was not in session - ceremony or no ceremony. We cannot know the mind of Mike Johnson or overhear his conversations with the president, but people wonder whether the real difference here is that swearing in Grijalva could cost Mike Johnson control on the issue of the Epstein files. Once she's a member, there will be a bipartisan majority on the petition to force a vote releasing those files, something Mike Johnson has fought hard to block.SIMON: And former Trump national security adviser John Bolton pleaded not guilty yesterday to charges that he mishandled classified materials. What are your thoughts, Ron?ELVING: We hope now to have a trial to test whether Bolton shared classified information in messages he sent to family members and kept copies of those messages at home. Another thought, of course, is back to the stacks and stacks of documents - many of them classified - found at Mar-a-Lago in 2017, all of them subject to a subpoena that Trump was ignoring after leaving office.SIMON: And, of course, Ron, last week, we talked about President Trump's success with the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. Yesterday, the president said he thought the deal provided momentum for Russia-Ukraine talks. Does that seem to be the case?ELVING: That has been a fond hope for all who want these wars to end. But Trump has not yet been able to transfer his Middle East momentum to Ukraine. He has been pressuring Russia to come to the table. But this week, he had a phone call with Vladimir Putin, and after that, he said he thought Putin wanted a deal, and then Trump sat down with Ukraine's President Zelenskyy in the Oval Office and poured cold water on the long-range missiles he had talked about sharing with Ukraine. Obviously, a big letdown for Zelenskyy.SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving. Thanks so much for being with us. Talk to you later.ELVING: Thank you, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

When they started dating, Surovtsev was honest about his past. He told her that he had come from the former Soviet Union as a refugee at the age of four. And that when he was a teenager, his green card was revoked after pleading guilty to carjacking and burglary charges in California.   He explained that after being released from prison, in 2014, he spent time in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody while they tried — and failed — to deport him to Ukraine and Russia.   Both countries, according to legal filings reviewed by NPR, could not provide or confirm Surovtsev's citizenship since he left before the fall of the Soviet Union. They couldn't give him the travel documents needed for deportation.   \n   Since then, each year, Roman Surovtsev did a check-in with ICE.   In the meantime, the Surovtsevs' lives followed the path of thousands of immigrants in the U.S. who are considered stateless. They got married, had kids, and launched a small commercial painting business in Texas.   Then, one day in early August, what should have been a 10-minute errand at a kiosk at the Dallas ICE field office for one those regular check-ins turned into 30 minutes of waiting in the parking lot, \"praying that he wouldn't be detained,\" his wife told NPR.   \n   \"There were tears involved, just not knowing what was on the other side of that appointment,\" Samantha Surovtsev recalled. Then she got that call: \"I panicked. I panicked because it said, 'This is a call from a detainee.'\"   Roman Surovtsev joined the trend of others who are detained at their regularly scheduled check-ins with ICE, to meet the administration's one-million-person annual deportation target.   The \"human element\"   What makes his case different is that his wife has marshalled a team of lawyers on his behalf. Unlike hundreds of others the Trump administration has vowed to deport as part of its mass deportation goal, Surovtsev has a chance to make his case in front of a judge.   \n   \"People need to understand that there's a human element involved with immigration, that every story is unique,\" his wife said. \"Every case deserves to be heard in front of a judge. This is not a black-and-white situation.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Surovtsevs on their wedding day on Sept. 29, 2019.\n                \n                    Credit: Surovtsev family\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Credit: Surovtsev family\n    \n\n   \n   According to the Surovtsevs' lawyers and court filings, ICE has been trying for a second time to deport Roman to Ukraine, which does not have the documentation to prove his citizenship and could draft him into armed conflict. In court filings, his lawyers argue his re-detention is unconstitutional since there's been no change to make it easier to deport him to his place of birth and that there is \"not a significant likelihood that Roman would be removed in the reasonably foreseeable future.\"   \n   The absurdity of his situation was highlighted at the Bluebonnet Detention Center in Texas. The north Texas detention site, which was over its population capacity this summer, also housed Venezuelan migrants.   Surovtsev was given deportation travel paperwork in Ukrainian, according to a court declaration from Zachery Hagerty, the deportation officer processing Surovtsev. Surovtsev, who is fluent in English, does not speak or read Ukrainian.   In court filings, the Justice Department, which argues these cases on behalf of the government, said that the re-detention is legal because the agency has once again requested new travel documents from Ukraine.   Hagerty in his declaration said he believes Surovtsev could at least be deported to a third country, if not Ukraine.   \n   The Department of Homeland Security didn't respond to a request for comment about his specific case.   In the meantime, his legal team has successfully vacated his carjacking criminal conviction, arguing that he was not informed of the consequences to his immigration status when he originally pleaded guilty as a teen.   \"It's not a complex question. It's not a discretionary issue,\" said Eric Lee, a partner at the law firm Lee and Godshall-Bennett, one of the firms handling the case. \"He's going to get his green card back in a matter of time, which only makes it all the more callous and absurd that the administration continues to try and remove him to a country to which removal is effectively going to be a death sentence.\"   \n   Navigating due process   In the more than two months that Surovtsev has been in detention, he has missed his wedding anniversary, his wife and daughter's birthdays and his mother's recent health issues. His wife, Samantha, has had to cancel about two months' worth of jobs for their painting business and their two employees are out of work.   Every day, she told NPR, she turns down about five work leads, letting customers know that there is a family emergency. She has instead spent her time working with several attorneys across the country to vacate her husband's conviction, reinstate his green card and release him from detention.   \n   Immigration advocates have argued that the Trump administration's rapid approach to increase arrests and removals reduces the limited due process immigrants get. That due process is in part to minimize the chances of mistakes and prevent someone from being removed when they may have valid claims to stay, they said.   Lawyers say the Trump administration has taken steps to undermine due process. Earlier this year, the president said it wasn't possible for all the people he wants to remove to get a trial.   Immigration officers have been told to make arrests in court, even as judges told immigrants to come back to their case. And the Homeland Security Department has mandated that immigrants be detained while undergoing their proceedings, with such detention as mandatory for those who entered without legal status.   \"Yet there are lots of people in this situation. And there have been several habeas cases filed over the summer on very similar facts regarding re-detention,\" said Chris Godshall-Bennett, a constitutional and civil rights attorney and another of Surovtsev's lawyers, referring to the legal avenue for people to claim their detention is unlawful.   \n   The process can be slow, and most people in immigration detention and in immigration court do not have legal representation to argue the particulars of their cases. Lee, the other attorney on Surovtsev's case, said this process shows that the government is trying again to do something it can't: deport Surovtsev to Ukraine.   \"The danger here is not simply that people will be sent somewhere wrongly. The danger is that the government is going to do it on purpose in a way that disregards those protections,\" Godshall said. \"By disregarding those protections for a subset of individuals, it has opened the door to disregarding them. Period.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      The Trump administration has adopted an aggressive approach to foreign policy in Latin America. NPR's Scott Simon speaks with Ivan Briscoe at the International Crisis Group about the shift.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  When it comes to foreign policy in Latin America, the Trump administration has favored a more muscular approach, demanding control of the Panama Canal, a bailout for Argentina with strings attached and opposing tariffs on Brazil to influence the trial of a former president - and as we just heard, killing alleged drug smugglers on boats in the Caribbean - all part of an escalating pressure campaign against the regime of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela. We're joined now by Ivan Briscoe. He's senior director of policy at the International Crisis Group. Thanks so much for being with us.IVAN BRISCOE: It's a pleasure to be on your show. Thank you.SIMON: What do you believe defines the Trump administration's approach to Latin America?BRISCOE: I don't believe that you can sum it up easily. I think it's got various strands, and that's what we see at play across the region at the moment. The core, of course, is domestic policy, which is controlling migrants, coming down hard on the drug epidemic, especially the use of fentanyl, restoring manufacturing industry to the United States. I think a lot of that is bound up with policy towards Latin America, which is where most of the migrants have come from and the drugs come from and where a lot of the manufacturing industry has gone. That sense of Latin America is doing United States wrong has been used by Trump since the very start in his political career.But there are two other elements, I think, which are really important. One is the Monroe Doctrine - you know, the idea that United States is the sole, real major power that can act across the Americas. No other power can do so. But a last element is Trump's one-on-one relationship with leaders who are in his partisan ideological camp with which he has a strong personal relationship and with whom he's willing to do one-on-one deals, it seems, favors for favors, in an effort to build a broader pro-Trump, if you like, coalition across Latin America. And that side of his approach is one which we're just starting to see more of, and the consequences are very uncertain.SIMON: Let me follow up on Venezuela because we have these strikes on boats and a now-confirmed CIA presence operating in Venezuela. Do you think, at the same time, that's likely to foment any kind of regime change in Venezuela?BRISCOE: I'm not so sure. And I think this is what's driving a little bit U.S. policy towards Venezuela at the moment - the perception that the Venezuelan government is actually weaker in some ways than it has ever been. This is a message which has - obviously being propagated by the Nobel Prize winner and Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado. But there's no denying there's truth in it. The Venezuelan government lost elections last year. It prevented the real results being released. It led a crackdown. But that was a major event which has caused it discredit in the region with its neighbors. And obviously, it weakens the movement from within.But the problem - of course, the most practical problem in the way, is the fact that that government is screwed into power. It has got a very efficient, repressive machinery. It is very close to the military. And so is there any real possibility of peeling away some of those allies or peeling away military support to generate change? I'm not sure.SIMON: Let's listen to something that the Nobel Peace prize winner and opposition leader in Venezuela, Maria Corina Machado, said on our program WEEKEND EDITION Sunday.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Once Maduro goes, the Cuban regime will follow. The Nicaraguan regime will follow. And for the first time in history, we will have the Americas free of communism and narco-dictatorships.SIMON: Do you share that confidence?BRISCOE: No, because history would say that we have seen that message propagated from leading Latin American politicians, leading lights in Washington for decades. How many years is it since the Cuban Revolution? It's almost hard to do the calculation in one's head - 66 years, isn't it? It's a very long time. So one's heard it before, and one tends to disbelieve it because in each case, it's difficult to see how that process gets going, because these are highly authoritarian, repressive states with powerful secret police and intelligence services, which clamp down very soon on any signs of dissent.SIMON: Why do you think the Trump administration has made the Argentina bailout dependent upon the results of the Argentine elections? Why has President Trump come down so much on the side of President Milei?BRISCOE: Well, they share a lot in common. Milei - he won with the promise of clearing out the political elites, freeing up the economy, stopping all the nonsense - so very similar messages - conservative social values, lean state, tough on security. Trump sees in Milei this soulmate, and he believes that by building strong connections to individual leaders - Milei, Bukele in El Salvador, Noboa in Ecuador - this will be the start of a gradual move in the region towards much more pro-Trumpian governments which will work more closely with the United States and will engage in those sorts of transactions and those sorts of favors for favors, which I think Trump believes is the most efficient way to run diplomacy.But I'm just not sure whether this hard play towards Latin American countries, insisting that voters listen to what he's saying and do his bidding is going to work. Latin Americans are very sensitive to infringements of their sovereignty, all the more so from the United States, and it's a very dangerous game to play.SIMON: Ivan Briscoe is senior director of policy at the International Crisis Group.

Instead, they think that we don't know what's best for ourselves.\"   Missouri is the second state in the country, alongside Texas, to gerrymander its congressional map after President Donald Trump set off a nationwide redistricting battle in July to try to maintain control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterms.   \n   Multiple other states, including North Carolina, Indiana, Florida, Ohio and Kansas could soon follow. California is trying to counter the Republican effort by redistricting in favor of Democrats, if voters pass a constitutional amendment next month.   Missouri's Republican Governor, Mike Kehoe, signed the new map into law late last month. The state had six Republicans and two Democrats in Congress, but the new plan targets longtime Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II's seat in Kansas City.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Leann Villaluz (right) has been going door to door for weeks to collect signatures for a petition to put Missouri's new congressional map to voters. She says most people she's talked to are willing to sign.\n                \n                    Savannah Hawley-Bates/KCUR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Savannah Hawley-Bates/KCUR\n    \n\n   \n   But with Villaluz and about 3,000 other volunteers, a group called People Not Politicians Missouri is working to overturn the state's new map. If they're successful in getting more than 106,000 signatures across the state by December 11, a referendum will go on the ballot in 2026 for voters to decide whether to want to keep or reject it.   The group says it's already gathered more than 100,000 signatures and is still collecting more. If they get the signatures they need, the referendum would stall the map until voters weigh in next year.   Villaluz says everyone she's spoken to has been excited to sign. She's visited five neighborhoods so far around Kansas City, which would be split into three Republican-leaning districts under the new map. Villaluz even took her petition to the recent Chappell Roan concert to get signatures.   \n   \"Just about anyone that stops and hears what the petition is about is ready and willing to sign,\" Villaluz says. \"Whatever your vote is, it's going to be diluted with the maps, and nobody wants that.\"   Missouri attorney general and secretary of state fight back    Not only does People Not Politicians Missouri have to gather enough signatures, it also has to take on pushback from top state election officials. The state's Attorney General Catherine Hanaway filed a lawsuit in federal court arguing that a referendum on redistricting violates both the U.S. and Missouri constitutions.   Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins did approve the group's referendum petition this week after initially rejecting it. But in a press release, Hoskins claims that none of the signatures gathered before his approval date are valid.   \"The process is clear,\" Hoskins said in the release. \"Every Missourian deserves confidence that ballot measures follow the law — not out-of-state agendas or confusion campaigns. Missouri values fairness and integrity, and this process reflects that.\"   The executive director of People Not Politicians Missouri, Richard von Glahn, said in a statement that Hoskins is \"deliberately spreading misinformation for political purposes,\" and that, according to the state constitution, the group was allowed to begin gathering signatures before the secretary of state's approval.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A group called People Not Politicians Missouri has been working to gather signatures to overturn Missouri's new congressional map. Signers have to leave one column on the petition, their congressional district, blank, because with the map changes, many don't know which district they're in.\n                \n                    Savannah Hawley-Bates/KCUR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Savannah Hawley-Bates/KCUR\n    \n\n   \n   \"Our campaign has gathered signatures at a historic pace — I've never seen Missourians unite and mobilize this quickly,\" von Glahn said in the statement. \"We will not be intimidated or distracted. This referendum will qualify, and Missourians — not politicians — will decide the future of fair representation in our state.\"   The Democratic National Committee has joined the referendum effort and is contributing more staff and money to the cause. A slew of lawsuits have also been filed challenging the new districts.   A legal effort, too    Rebeca Amezcua-Hogan is one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit that seeks to block Hoskins from using the map to hold a congressional primary or general election and argues mid-decade redistricting without a new census is unconstitutional.   \n   \"My own voting power would be watered down,\" Amezcua-Hogan says. \"I would feel like I'm not being represented. And I think that at least personally, for the issues that are close to my heart that I've been working on for years, it would be incredibly discouraging.\"   Amezcua-Hogan is running as a progressive for the Kansas City Council. The area she wants to represent would be split into three different congressional districts if the new map holds. When she talks to voters for her campaign, Amezcua-Hogan is also gathering signatures for the referendum effort.   She says Kansas City is already competing for federal resources and splitting it up into three districts will only make that more difficult.   \"Kansas City is already at a point where we're dealing with lack of affordable housing, lack of mental health resources, lack of transportation,\" says Amezcua-Hogan. \"It already feels like we're fighting an uphill battle, and that uphill battle is only going to get worse.\"   Most, but not all Republicans, are on board   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Lawmakers convene in an extraordinary legislative session at the Missouri State Capitol on Monday, Sept. 8, 2025, in Jefferson City, Mo.\n                \n                    Brian Munoz/St. Louis Public Radio\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brian Munoz/St. Louis Public Radio\n    \n\n   \n   Missouri's new congressional map easily passed the Republican-dominated Missouri Legislature in its week-long special session.   Michael Davis represents a suburb south of Kansas City and is one of the lawmakers who championed the new map. He's part of the state's Freedom Caucus, a group of Republican legislators who aim to push the party further to the right.   Davis says Missourians elected Republican lawmakers because they trust them to do what they think is best with redistricting.   \"We should send a conservative message to D.C.,\" Davis says. \"The best way to do that is by sending seven Republicans who are going to ensure that Republicans keep control of the U.S. House of Representatives.\"   But 15 Republicans — including Jon Patterson, the speaker of the Missouri House — voted against the map in the state legislature. Nearly all of them are from parts of the state targeted by redistricting or in areas that would be moved into new districts.   \n   Republican state Rep. Bill Allen represents a part of Kansas City's northland that is evenly split between parties. He opposes mid-decade redistricting and said he was disappointed that Missouri seemed to follow Texas and Trump's lead in doing so.   \"I think I heard from one or two constituents that wanted me to vote in favor, and almost every other one that I heard was in opposition,\" Allen says. \"The job of the representative is to represent the district, not the party, certainly not the president. Just the district that I represent, the 39,000 people. Their will is my responsibility.\"   Villaluz says she plans to keep gathering signatures for the next two months, until the group finds out if it has done enough to put redistricting on the ballot and potentially reverse Missouri's gerrymandered map.   \"I feel that Missouri is used as a guinea pig by the GOP,\" says Villaluz. \"They think that the average Missouri voter is dumber than we are, and they think that they can get away with a lot more here in a red flyover state, but that's not the case.\"   Villaluz says voters across Missouri won't stand idly by, and she believes they'll get the last word.\n",

Today's top stories   The ceasefire in Gaza was tested this weekend when Israel launched an assault on the territory in response to an attack on its troops. The Israeli military said Sunday that \"terrorists\" attacked Israeli troops operating in the Rafah area resulting in two soldiers being killed. Hamas denied involvement in any attacks. Gaza officials say dozens were killed in the Israeli strikes. Both sides are accusing the other of violating the ceasefire deal brokered by the United States.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Smoke billows following an Israeli strike that targeted a building in the Bureij camp for Palestinian refugees in the central Gaza Strip on Oct. 19. Gaza's civil defence agency said a series of Israeli air strikes on October 19 killed at least 11 people across the territory, as Israel and Hamas traded blame for violating a ceasefire.\n                \n                    Eyad Baba/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Eyad Baba/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Yesterday's events mark the most significant threat to the ceasefire deal since both sides signed the agreement, NPR's Rob Schmitz tells Up First. Despite what happened, Hamas and Israel say they are still committed to the spirit of the ceasefire. U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and President Trump's adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, arrive in Israel today and Vice President JD Vance is expected to arrive tomorrow to get the ceasefire deal back on track. The group will try to facilitate the return of the remaining Israeli hostage bodies, which is an important part of the first phase of the agreement.   \n   The government shutdown is entering day 20 with no serious negotiations underway to bring it to an end. The longest shutdown was 35 days and happened during Trump's first term in the White House. However, this time it is different as there is less pressure to get a deal because some of the impacts are not being widely felt, NPR's Deirdre Walsh says.    🎧 Instead of feeling pressure to fold due to their projects being targeted, Democrats are digging in and saying that this is more of the same tactics the Trump administration used before the shutdown happened. The Senate has unsuccessfully voted 10 times on a House-approved stopgap bill to fund the government. The next vote is expected tonight. Senate Democrats are expected to keep blocking that bill, not budging on their position that health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year need to be extended.   The U.S. plans to stop all subsidies to Colombia and implement new tariffs after the country's leader, Gustavo Petro, said Trump's attacks on boats coming from Venezuela amount to murder. U.S. forces have destroyed boats in the open waters in what the government describes as a counternarcotics operation.    🎧 The U.S. government says it has struck at least seven vessels and claims they were loaded with drugs headed to the U.S. NPR's Eyder Peralta says the big picture is that it has been decades since the U.S. military has taken a position like this in the Americas. This has created tension in the region. Renute Roberts, a fisherman in Trinidad, says he can hear drones circling at night. While Roberts says he believes drugs are a problem, he says Trump can handle it without bombing boats.   \n   Cost of living    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                As health insurance prices are surging, some companies are covering their employees' medical plans.\n                \n                    Getty Images/Emily Bogle/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Getty Images/Emily Bogle/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   NPR's series Cost of Living: The Price We Pay is examining what's driving price increases and how people are coping after years of stubborn inflation.    U.S. health care is the most expensive in the developed world and the price point is only rising. Last year, the average annual premium for an employer-based health insurance plan for a family of four was over $25,500. Of that average total, employers contributed about $19,200 and workers contributed the rest. Total premiums have risen over 24% since 2019 and are widely expected to surge next year. Here's how the increasing costs are impacting people and companies:    ⚕️ Drugmakers, hospitals, insurance companies and other for-profit companies have driven up the costs of accessing medical care in the U.S. For example, drugmakers are developing more effective medications, but they are charging a lot for them.⚕️ For many of the millions of people who get health insurance through their employer, their paycheck deductions could surge next year by 6% to 7% on average.⚕️ Some companies are covering all insurance premiums. Offering zero-premium health insurance can help to recruit new employees, reduce turnover rates and help workers stay focused on their job, instead of expenses.   Listen to more about what companies are doing to help with health insurance premiums, or read a conversation about it.

The first cumbia song recorded in Ecuador in the 1960s had just one verse and it was called \"Cumbia Triste.\" Written by Polibio Mayorga, the song combined the rhythms of the San Juanito — traditional Andean music — with rural Colombian cumbia, which arrived to the country by way of the record industry. The result marked a new identity for many migrants who came to live in Ecuador's urban centers. Mayorga laid the groundwork for the Ecuadorian cumbia sound and musicians like Medardo Luzuriaga, who transformed the genre into a national sensation. Luzuriaga recorded over 100 albums, and his emblematic cumbias still live in the collective conscience of the entire country.

The Trump administration wants schools to sign a \"compact\" in exchange for priority access to federal grants.\n                \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Monday is the deadline for a handful of universities to agree to a list of commitments that align with the Trump administration's political priorities, in exchange for preferential access to federal funds.   The Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education was sent on Oct. 1 to nine colleges — both private and public — and would require schools to bar transgender people from using restrooms or playing in sports that align with their gender identities, freeze tuition for five years, limit international student enrollment, and require standardized tests for admissions, among other things.   Of the original nine schools that received the document, as of Sunday night, six had indicated they are not planning on signing.   \n   MIT was the first school to issue a public statement: The document \"includes principles with which we disagree,\" MIT President Sally Kornbluth wrote in a letter to Education Secretary Linda McMahon on Oct. 10. \"And fundamentally the premise of the document is inconsistent with our core belief that scientific funding should be based on scientific merit alone.\"   \n   Following that rejection, President Trump wrote on Truth Social that all colleges would be able to sign on, not just those that received the letter.   Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Southern California followed, with statements \"respectfully\" declining the offer.   On Friday, the White House held a virtual meeting with colleges that hadn't yet sent rejection notices, including the University of Arizona, the University of Texas at Austin, Vanderbilt University, Dartmouth College and the University of Virginia. Three additional schools were also invited: Arizona State University, Washington University in St. Louis and the University of Kansas, according to The Wall Street Journal.   \"Today's conversation with national higher education leaders is an important step toward defining a shared vision, and we look forward to continued discussions in the weeks ahead,\" McMahon wrote on X after the meeting. She said attendees had a \"positive and wide-ranging conversation about the Compact.\"   \n   But following that meeting, two schools, the University of Virginia and Dartmouth College, announced they also would not be signing on to the agreement. Dartmouth President Sian Leah Beilock said in a letter to students and faculty on Saturday that she did not think \"a compact — with any administration — is the right approach to achieve academic excellence.\"   UVA said it wanted \"no special treatment\" when it comes to federal funding.   \"A contractual arrangement predicating assessment on anything other than merit will undermine the integrity of vital, sometimes lifesaving, research and further erode confidence in American higher education,\" wrote Paul Mahoney, the interim president of UVA. He said the university had provided the administration with comments and that the university agreed with many of the principles laid out in the compact.   \n   UVA's previous president resigned this summer under pressure from the Trump administration over the university's response to President Trump's order to end diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.   The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday on its plans for the compact going forward. An automated emailed response said there were staff shortages due to the government shutdown and blamed Democrats.   Since Trump took office, the administration has canceled billions of dollars in federal research grants at many universities over a number of issues, including transgender policies, diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and antisemitism on campus.\n",

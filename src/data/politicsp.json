Party leaders, hoping to win back support from some of the working-class supporters who have drifted away from them, have used the moment to remind voters of the recent cuts Republicans have approved to some health care programs.</p>   \n   <p>Republicans are outwardly exuding confidence that the approach will not find traction, reminding the public that Democrats have forced a shutdown. But <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.kff.org/quick-take/more-than-3-in-4-aca-marketplace-enrollees-live-in-states-won-by-president-trump-in-2024/__;!!Iwwt!SCDzOYduWJedwG7jX7Qj5Q2a5wSlrFf3suDuxfJLuzTUSVu4Hd515ofuFeQhnQaZk9CV_53WSDo58w$\" target=\"_blank\">a new KFF analysis</a> shows that 80% of all premium tax credits benefited enrollees in states Trump won.</p>   <h3>Open enrollment for 2026</h3>   <p>The shutdown <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/04/nx-s1-5562517/aca-obamacare-shutdown-trump-naic-health-insurance\" target=\"_blank\">coincides with open enrollment season</a>, as insurers are preparing to send notices revealing next year's premium rates for roughly 24 million people enrolled in ACA coverage. The average enrollee is expected to pay <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/__;!!Iwwt!SCDzOYduWJedwG7jX7Qj5Q2a5wSlrFf3suDuxfJLuzTUSVu4Hd515ofuFeQhnQaZk9CV_50hYhZ6OQ$\" target=\"_blank\">more than double</a> if the tax credits are left to expire. Insurers have also said they'll have to dramatically raise the price of premiums because healthier people will opt out of coverage as it becomes more expensive, leaving a sicker pool of Americans — and less money to cover them.</p>   \n   <p>\"Over the next few days, what you're going to see is over 20 million Americans experience dramatically increased health care premiums, copays and deductibles because of the Republican unwillingness to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the steps of the Capitol on Thursday.</p>   <p>Open enrollment in most states begins on Nov. 1. Some insurers and exchanges have delayed sending notices detailing premium rates for next year because they are waiting to see what unfolds in Washington. For example, Covered California, the state's insurance marketplace, is planning to mail out notices to more than a million enrollees later than usual this year, on Oct. 15.</p>   \n   <p>From her home in Richmond, Va., 31-year-old Natalie Tyer is anxiously awaiting the arrival of her notice. She checks the state's marketplace website daily to see if new rates for her insurance plan have posted.</p>   <p>Tyer has relied on marketplace coverage for over a year now while she works part time for a small, local video production company and pursues a master's degree to become a school counselor. The tax credits help cover $255 of her monthly premium, bringing it down to $53. Since she's generally healthy, if the credits expire and her premiums go up significantly, she might drop coverage altogether.</p>   <p>\"I very well might have to go without health insurance and may have to rely on hope,\" Tyer said.</p>   <p>Democrats' push to center the shutdown on health care affordability, though, runs up against many uncomfortable realities of the federal government's closure, which will leave millions of federal workers without paychecks, hamper some functions of public health agencies, and threaten food assistance payments for low-income mothers, among other effects.</p>   <h3>This isn't the first shutdown over health care</h3>   <p>The ACA, though, has been<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2011/03/24/134766561/happy-birthday-affordable-care-act\" target=\"_blank\"> a political flashpoint since 2010</a>, when Republicans fought against the passage of the landmark health care legislation. A wave of Republican congressional victories soon followed that fight and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/09/20/224422562/house-gop-votes-to-fund-government-kill-obamacare\" target=\"_blank\">spurred a government shutdown in 2013</a>, when the GOP tried to gut the program. Party leaders <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/12/13/570479181/why-do-so-many-people-hate-obamacare-so-much\" target=\"_blank\">again tried to repeal it in 2017</a> to follow through on a Trump campaign promise.</p>   \n   <p>The latest clash — over the billions of dollars in tax credits that Democrats issued during the COVID-19 pandemic to boost enrollment in the ACA — has been simmering for months. Democrats, who wrote the original legislation introducing and then extending them, set the enhanced tax credits to expire at the end of this year. Even some Republicans began warning this summer that letting those tax credits lapse could be detrimental, with Republican pollsters Tony Fabrizio and Bob Ward issuing a memo that cautioned an extension of the credits could make a difference in next year's midterm election.</p>   <p>Extending the ACA tax credits, which have reduced monthly premiums to as little as $0 or $10 for poorer enrollees and capped the amount middle-income Americans paid to just 8.5% of their income, is also a popular move among many Americans.</p>\n</div>",

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>NPR's Michel Martin interviews Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire about the state of negotiations in Congress to end the government shutdown.</p>   \n</div><div>\n    <p>MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: </p><p> The Senate on Monday again voted down each party's stopgap funding bill to reopen the government. Senator Jeanne Shaheen is with us now on day seven of the shutdown. She is a Democrat, and she represents New Hampshire. Good morning, Senator. Thank you so much for...</p><p>JEANNE SHAHEEN: Good morning.</p><p>MARTIN: ...Joining us. Let me just clarify this one thing. As you've just heard - as we've all just heard - the Republicans are arguing that Democrats want to give undocumented immigrants free health care. Now, Julie has just told us that is largely not true. It's tortured logic at best. But I wanted to ask you if you think that argument is resonating with voters in any way.</p><p>SHAHEEN: I haven't heard from anyone in New Hampshire, as in the rest of the country. We don't provide health care for illegal immigrants. And I think there's also a law that dates back to the Reagan administration that says that hospitals who receive federal funding can't turn away anyone who's there for emergency care. So I think that's part of where some Republicans are getting that notion. But the fact is, as we heard, Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act marketplace do not allow illegal immigrants to enroll.</p><p>MARTIN: So one reason we called you is that you were one of the handful of Democratic senators who voted to keep the government open in March. This time you've been voting against it. What would you need from Republicans in order to vote to reopen the government?</p><p>SHAHEEN: You know, I think we ought to be able to do two things. We ought to both be able to reopen the government, keep the government open, and we ought to be able to make sure that we're not kicking 4 million people off of their health insurance and raising the costs, as we heard from Julie, almost over doubling for some cases, the cost of health insurance for another 20 million people because that has real ramifications for the entire health care system.</p><p>In New Hampshire, we're already looking at four facilities that are closing because of the law that was passed back in the summer, the president's big bill that I call as big betrayal of the American people. So this is going to have an impact on hospitals, on providers, on health clinics, and we need to address it. And I'm encouraged that more and more of my Republican colleagues are saying, yes, we do need to address it. We recognize this. If you look at the data, 76% of people who benefit from these premium subsidies are in states that President Trump won in November. So the president, as we heard in his remarks yesterday, also is beginning to recognize that this is something that we need to address.</p><p>MARTIN: So the president on social media last night said he's willing to work with Democrats on health care. Leader Jefferies, Leader Schumer say that Republicans have not reached out, or at least White House has not reached out to them. But has anybody reached out to you directly, any of your fellow senators or the administration, for that matter?</p><p>SHAHEEN: Well, no one from the administration, but I am talking, as many of us are, with our fellow senators about where can we find common ground? What do we think is agreeable to enough people on both sides of the aisle that we can reopen the government and we can get this done? Because there is urgency to addressing these - the cost of health insurance. People are going to start getting their bills because insurance companies are setting their rates in October, and the marketplace opens on November 1. And what we've heard from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is that if we don't address this until December, a million and a half people will lose their health insurance, and it's going to cost the federal government a lot more.</p><p>So there's - there are real reasons why getting this done quickly is important. And, you know, it shouldn't be that difficult because nobody wants to see people who don't really need that help benefit from a program. We ought to all be able to agree that we don't want waste, fraud and abuse in the system. We ought to all be able to agree that the people who need this help the most are the ones who ought to get it. And I think more and more people are recognizing that, yes, there is some real common ground that we should be able to find.</p><p>MARTIN: But as you just pointed out, these cuts were part of the president's bill that was passed in early July. If this was such an important issue, why wasn't this negotiated in the time since that seven-month funding bridge was passed in March? I mean, it's not like people didn't talk about this.</p><p>SHAHEEN: Well, we tried to...</p><p>MARTIN: Go ahead.</p><p>SHAHEEN: No, we tried to negotiate it back in the summer. But as we saw, that bill was passed with only Republican votes, and there was no interest in talking to Democrats about what we might need in order to protect people's health care.</p><p>MARTIN: So White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt spoke with our co-host Steve Inskeep about the administration's plans to lay off or fire federal workers during the shutdown. Let me just play a short clip of what she said.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)</p><p>KAROLINE LEAVITT: Unfortunately, we have to do things we don't want to do because the government is completely shut down and there's zero money coming into the federal government's coffers.</p><p>STEVE INSKEEP: People are still paying taxes.</p><p>LEAVITT: And so right now, the Office of Management and Budget is taking a hard look at the balance sheet and having to understand, what agencies do we have to cut? Who do we have to lay off in order to keep this thing running?</p><p>MARTIN: Do you believe that?</p><p>SHAHEEN: No. She's being disingenuous because the fact is, the Trump administration, from Day 1, started firing federal employees. I'm the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, and I watched the painful exercise with DOGE when they came in and cut all of - virtually all of USAID and the foreign assistance programs that the United States has. I've watched the Veterans Administration cut people, and then have to hire people back, the Department of Agriculture fire people, and then have to hire people back 'cause they didn't know what people do, the Food and Drug Administration fire people, and then have to hire people back 'cause they didn't have enough inspectors for food safety. So it is totally inaccurate for this administration to claim that it's the shutdown that's causing them to fire people. It's the shutdown that's giving them more of an excuse to fire people, but this has been happening from Day 1.</p><p>MARTIN: But the longer you keep the government closed - sorry, not you. But the longer the government stays closed, do you risk giving more power to the administration to keep doing that?</p><p>SHAHEEN: That's why we need to work together to get this open. And...</p><p>MARTIN: That is Senator...</p><p>SHAHEEN: ...Many of us are talking.</p><p>MARTIN: That is Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire. Senator, thank you for talking with us. And I do want to mention we reached out to a number of Republican lawmakers to join our program, but they declined. And we do want to say the invitation remains open. Senator Shaheen, thank you so much for talking with us today.</p><p>SHAHEEN: Good to talk to you. Thanks.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF VALIUM AGGELEIN'S \"BIRD WINGS\")</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.

And he warned that disruptions could worsen until the government reopens.</p>   <p>\"If we see there's issues in the tower that are affecting controllers' ability to effectively control the airspace, we'll reduce the rate, and you'll see more delays or you might see a cancellation,\" Duffy said. \"I'm willing to do that before we're willing to risk anyone's life in the air.\"</p>   <p>In a statement shared with NPR, the FAA says it \"slows traffic into some airports to ensure safe operations\" when there are increased staffing shortages. It directs travelers to <a href=\"https://nasstatus.faa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">its website</a> for real-time flight impacts for every U.S. airport.</p>   <p>Politicians on both sides of the aisle are blaming each other for the shutdown and ensuing travel snafus. The government shut down on Oct. 1 after partisan disagreements, largely over <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/03/nx-s1-5560987/shutdown-undocumented-immigrants-medicaid-obamacare\" target=\"_blank\">health care subsidies</a>, prevented the Senate from passing a funding bill.</p>   \n   <p>Air traffic controllers <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/02/nx-s1-5560219/air-traffic-controllers-ending-government-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\">played a key role</a> in ending the last government shutdown, which stretched on for 35 days, from December 2018 to January 2019.</p>   <p>Only an FAA-described \"slight increase\" in sick leave at two air traffic control facilities threw major<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/01/25/688660390/flights-delayed-at-laguardia-newark-airports-as-workers-call-in-sick-amid-shutdo\" target=\"_blank\"> East Coast airports into chaos</a> and increased pressure on the Trump administration to ultimately reach a spending deal with Congress.</p>   <p>Long-standing controller staffing shortages — exacerbated by insufficient hiring, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/21/nx-s1-5415886-e1/inside-a-school-thats-working-to-fix-the-u-s-shortage-of-air-traffic-controllers\" target=\"_blank\">extensive training timelines</a> and high dropout rates — have <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/22/g-s1-68333/newark-air-traffic-controller-atc\" target=\"_blank\">remained a problem</a> in the years since. As Monday's events show, even a small number of sick calls can make a big impact.</p>   \n   <h3>Which airports were affected?</h3>   <p>According to the FAA, Monday's delays affected air space across the country, including Phoenix, Denver, Chicago, Indianapolis and Washington, D.C.</p>   <p>The airports in Newark and Denver both saw ground delays due to staffing issues, according to the FAA.

And the legal tactic is getting mixed results in federal court.</p>   \n   <p>Oregon and Portland officials <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/04/nx-s1-5557239/trump-national-guard-portland-court-ruling\" target=\"_blank\">successfully delayed</a> efforts to send troops there.

And by Tuesday afternoon, Texas National Guard troops had arrived at a training center outside of Chicago — despite the vehement objections of local leaders, <a href=\"https://www.wbez.org/immigration/2025/10/07/national-guard-chicago-texas-jb-pritzker-donald-trump-elwood-will-county\" target=\"_blank\">the <em>Chicago Sun-Times</em> reported</a>. </p>   <p>Portland and Chicago are just two of the latest cities<strong> </strong>where Trump has threatened to send troops. He sent hundreds of troops to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., over the summer and the National Guard has<strong> </strong>also been ordered to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/03/nx-s1-5557215/memphis-national-guard-trump-tennessee\" target=\"_blank\">Memphis</a> — a move supported by Tennessee's Republican governor.</p>   <h3><strong>Who controls the National Guard?</strong></h3>   <p>The National Guard serves in three types of capacities.</p>   <p>\"State active duty\" is when troops are under state command and state funded. Title 32 — which is how the guard is being deployed in Memphis — is when troops are under state command but federally funded. Then, there's Title 10, which is when guard members are both federally controlled and funded.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7503x5001+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F10%2F19%2Fd2e475b54b41a74f1e7158e4f492%2Fgettyimages-2235131215.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7503x5001+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F10%2F19%2Fd2e475b54b41a74f1e7158e4f492%2Fgettyimages-2235131215.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7503x5001+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F10%2F19%2Fd2e475b54b41a74f1e7158e4f492%2Fgettyimages-2235131215.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7503x5001+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F10%2F19%2Fd2e475b54b41a74f1e7158e4f492%2Fgettyimages-2235131215.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7503x5001+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F10%2F19%2Fd2e475b54b41a74f1e7158e4f492%2Fgettyimages-2235131215.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7503x5001+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F10%2F19%2Fd2e475b54b41a74f1e7158e4f492%2Fgettyimages-2235131215.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7503x5001+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F10%2F19%2Fd2e475b54b41a74f1e7158e4f492%2Fgettyimages-2235131215.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7503x5001+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F10%2F19%2Fd2e475b54b41a74f1e7158e4f492%2Fgettyimages-2235131215.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7503x5001+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F10%2F19%2Fd2e475b54b41a74f1e7158e4f492%2Fgettyimages-2235131215.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7503x5001+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F10%2F19%2Fd2e475b54b41a74f1e7158e4f492%2Fgettyimages-2235131215.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7503x5001+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F10%2F19%2Fd2e475b54b41a74f1e7158e4f492%2Fgettyimages-2235131215.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7503x5001+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F10%2F19%2Fd2e475b54b41a74f1e7158e4f492%2Fgettyimages-2235131215.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7503x5001+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F10%2F19%2Fd2e475b54b41a74f1e7158e4f492%2Fgettyimages-2235131215.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7503x5001+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F10%2F19%2Fd2e475b54b41a74f1e7158e4f492%2Fgettyimages-2235131215.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7503x5001+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F10%2F19%2Fd2e475b54b41a74f1e7158e4f492%2Fgettyimages-2235131215.jpg\" alt=\"U.S. Sen.

They also say that for troops to be federalized, their governor of each state still needs to approve a Title 10 order.</p>   <div>\n            <div>\n        <picture>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8192x5464+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F25%2F6d197bfd46de9c26fe77a7476c25%2Fgettyimages-2239485931.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8192x5464+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F25%2F6d197bfd46de9c26fe77a7476c25%2Fgettyimages-2239485931.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8192x5464+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F25%2F6d197bfd46de9c26fe77a7476c25%2Fgettyimages-2239485931.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8192x5464+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F25%2F6d197bfd46de9c26fe77a7476c25%2Fgettyimages-2239485931.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8192x5464+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F25%2F6d197bfd46de9c26fe77a7476c25%2Fgettyimages-2239485931.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8192x5464+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F25%2F6d197bfd46de9c26fe77a7476c25%2Fgettyimages-2239485931.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8192x5464+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/webp/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F25%2F6d197bfd46de9c26fe77a7476c25%2Fgettyimages-2239485931.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/webp\"></source>\n            <source srcset=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8192x5464+0+0/resize/400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F25%2F6d197bfd46de9c26fe77a7476c25%2Fgettyimages-2239485931.jpg 400w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8192x5464+0+0/resize/600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F25%2F6d197bfd46de9c26fe77a7476c25%2Fgettyimages-2239485931.jpg 600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8192x5464+0+0/resize/800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F25%2F6d197bfd46de9c26fe77a7476c25%2Fgettyimages-2239485931.jpg 800w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8192x5464+0+0/resize/900/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F25%2F6d197bfd46de9c26fe77a7476c25%2Fgettyimages-2239485931.jpg 900w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8192x5464+0+0/resize/1200/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F25%2F6d197bfd46de9c26fe77a7476c25%2Fgettyimages-2239485931.jpg 1200w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8192x5464+0+0/resize/1600/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F25%2F6d197bfd46de9c26fe77a7476c25%2Fgettyimages-2239485931.jpg 1600w, https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8192x5464+0+0/resize/1800/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F25%2F6d197bfd46de9c26fe77a7476c25%2Fgettyimages-2239485931.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1025px) 650px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"></source>\n            <img src=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8192x5464+0+0/resize/1100/quality/50/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F25%2F6d197bfd46de9c26fe77a7476c25%2Fgettyimages-2239485931.jpg\" alt=\"A protester holds a sign outside of a downtown U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility on Oct. 05 in Portland, Ore.\" />\n        </picture>\n</div>\n<div>\n    <div>\n        <p>\n                A protester holds a sign outside a downtown U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility on Sunday in Portland, Ore.\n                <b>\n                    Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n                </b>\n                <b><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>\n            <p><b><b>toggle caption</b></b>\n    </p></div>\n    <p><span>\n        Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n    </span>\n</p></div>\n   </div>\n   <p>Goitein said, \"It's not about whether the federal government should have this authority at all. It's about whether the federal government should be able to use these authorities based on what really appear to be completely contrived claims about the situation on the ground.\"</p>   <h3><strong>Could Trump use the Insurrection Act?</strong></h3>   <p>One way that a sitting president has deployed the guard domestically without a state's consent was <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/03/28/1241141939/insurrection-act\" target=\"_blank\">through the Insurrection Act</a> — a set of laws meant to address major civil unrest. It also allows federal troops to take part in law enforcement activities like searches and arrests.</p>   <p>It's only been invoked a handful of times in U.S. history, with the last instance being over 30 years ago during the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles.</p>   \n   <p>\"For better or for worse, I think the insurrection Act has been a third rail politically for much of its history,\" said Stephen Vladeck, a professor of law at the Georgetown University Law Center.</p>   <p>In his second term, Trump has floated the idea of using the Insurrection Act. On Monday, when asked by a reporter under what circumstances he would invoke it, Trump said, \"If people were being killed and courts were holding us or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure I'd do that.\"</p>   \n   <p>Vladeck doesn't think Trump invoking the law is out of the question. He said, \"I think that the administration understands that that would be an even more dramatic escalation.\"</p>   <h3><strong>How are courts responding?</strong></h3>   <p>For the most part, federal judges in California and Oregon have expressed wariness and skepticism over the troop deployments.</p>   <p>In California, U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer, who has presided over the state's challenge to the guard deployment, strongly criticized the Trump administration over the move, calling it illegal and asserting that federal officials did not follow proper protocol for federalizing troops.</p>   <p>The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in California, however, has previously argued that \"a great level of deference\" had to be given to the president's assessment that a situation required military intervention.</p>   \n   <p>In Oregon, after temporarily blocking the federalization of the state's National Guard members, U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut ruled that the facts just could not be supported that a military intervention was needed — even if deference was given.</p>   <p>\"As soon as the federalized National Guard deploys to Portland, the state of Oregon will suffer an injury to its sovereignty,\" she wrote Saturday in her <a href=\"https://www.portland.gov/federal/documents/10-4-2025-state-city-v-trump-temporary-restraining-order-granted/download\" target=\"_blank\">order</a>.</p>   <p>It's unclear how a federal judge in Illinois will rule regarding the Trump administration's deployment of Guard troops there. On Monday, U.S. District Judge April Perry <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/06/nx-s1-5563882/illinois-and-chicago-sue-the-trump-administration-over-national-guard-deployment\" target=\"_blank\">declined to immediately block a troop deployment</a> and gave the administration until the end of Wednesday to respond to the lawsuit filed by state and city officials.</p>   <p>Vladeck believes it will be up to the courts to check presidential authority on this issue.</p>   <p>And, he said, \"sooner or later\" the Supreme Court will have to weigh in on what circumstances support military intervention in American cities.</p>   <p>\"We've been fortunate for 230 years to not have to worry about where the line is between permissible and impermissible uses of those authorities,\" he said. \"That luck has run out, and now we really are at a point where the question is going to be: Do courts have the power to draw a line in the sand? And if so, where is that line?\"<br /></p>\n</div>",

There are some people that really don't deserve to be taken care of, and we will take care of them in a different way.\"</p>   \n   <p>When pressed on the legality of such a move, Trump said,  \"What the law says is correct and I follow the law.\"</p>   \n   <p>Trump was responding to questions about a draft memo from the Office of Management and Budget, which was first reported by <em>Axios</em> and confirmed by a senior White House official not authorized to discuss the memo which has not been publicly circulated.</p>   <p>The fight over federal worker pay is the latest salvo in the Trump administration's efforts to force Democrats to vote for a clean continuing resolution and drop their demands to extend health care subsidies for millions of Americans.</p>   <p>The memo's legal argument contradicts <a href=\"https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/reference-materials/special-instructions-for-agencies-affected-by-a-possible-lapse-in-appropriations-starting-on-10-1-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">guidance issued by the Office of Personnel Management</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/1341\" target=\"_blank\">wording of a 2019 law</a> signed by President Trump during his first term that explicitly guarantees federal workers \"shall be paid\" when a shutdown ends, whether they were furloughed or continued working.</p>   <p>The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, a bipartisan law enacted after the record 35-day shutdown in 2018, added language to the Antideficiency Act that automatically applied back pay to federal employees for \"any lapse in appropriations that begins on or after December 22, 2018.\"</p>   <p>Previously, Congress had to approve retroactive funding after a shutdown with new legislation.</p>   \n   <p>The White House memo notes a clause in the text that says workers shall be paid \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates, and subject to the enactment of appropriations Acts ending the lapse\" and argues that means Congressional action is required to enact back pay.</p>   \n   <p>Guidance published by the Office of Management and Budget on Sept. 30 did include a reference to the law's automatic restoration of pay.</p>   <p>\"The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-1) provides that upon enactment of appropriations to end a lapse, both furloughed and excepted employees will be paid retroactively as soon as possible after the lapse ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates,\" <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20251002174206/https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Frequently-Asked-Questions-During-a-Lapse-in-Appropriations.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">the Sept. 30 memo reads</a>. \"Additional guidance for agencies on implementing Public Law 116-1 and treatment of pay and leave is available from OPM.\"</p>   <p><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Frequently-Asked-Questions-During-a-Lapse-in-Appropriations.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">A version updated on Oct. 3</a> removes that paragraph.</p>   <p>The draft memo is the latest in a multi-pronged pressure campaign from the White House seeking to punish Democrats during the shutdown, including efforts to cancel grant funding for energy projects and hold up transportation funding in states that did not vote for Trump in 2024. The administration has also threatened widespread reduction-in-force efforts at federal agencies which have so far not materialized.</p>   \n   <h3>Congress responds</h3>   <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters that while he isn't extensively familiar with the plan and hasn't discussed it with the White House, it is possible there may be a legal justification for the draft. </p>   <p>\"There are legal analysts who think that is not something the government should do,\" Johnson said. \"If that is true, that should turn up the urgency and the necessity of the Democrats doing the right thing here.\"</p>   <p>The top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., argued any interpretation to withhold backpay was \"lawless.\" </p>   \n   <p>\"They're plotting to try and rob furloughed federal workers of backpay at the end of this shutdown,\" Murray said in remarks on the Senate floor. \"This flies in the face of the plain text of the law, which could not be more clear.\"</p>   <p>Loading...</p>\n   <p><em>Deepa Shivaram contributed to this report. </em></p>\n</div>",

Agents claimed the woman was armed and that she and other protestors were using cars to box in agents, WBEZ reports.</p>   <p>Raoul told NPR's Steve Inskeep that it is evident the Trump administration's actions against Chicago are \"political in nature.\" Trump has vowed for weeks to clean up crime in Chicago, though the city has experienced a decline in most major crime categories this year, <a href=\"https://www.wbez.org/criminal-justice/2025/07/25/chicagos-crime-decline-is-part-of-a-national-trend-researchers-say\" target=\"_blank\">according to WBEZ</a>.</p>   <p>Last month, Trump said he would \"love to have\" Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker call the White House <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/04/nx-s1-5527020/trump-national-guard-chicago-illinois-pritzker\" target=\"_blank\">to make a formal request for troops</a>. The president also <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/06/nx-s1-5532148/national-guard-chicago-baltimore-new-orleans\" target=\"_blank\">posted on Truth Social last month</a> that the city was going to find out \"why it's called the Department of WAR.\"</p>   <p>\"All of these communications coming from the president and members of his administration demonstrate that this is about political targeting, not about conditions on the ground in Chicago or anywhere in the state of Illinois,\" Raoul said.</p>   <p>In an emailed statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said \"Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities.\"</p>   \n   <p>A federal judge <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/06/nx-s1-5563882/illinois-and-chicago-sue-the-trump-administration-over-national-guard-deployment\" target=\"_blank\">did not immediately block the Trump administration from deploying troops</a> to Chicago as Illinois requested in its lawsuit — including the deployment of some troops from Texas and other states. Oral arguments in that suit are set for Thursday.</p>   <p>Richard Hayes, who served as former Illinois National Guard Adjutant General — its highest ranking member — <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/07/nx-s1-5563902/former-illinois-national-guard-official-on-efforts-to-deploy-troops-to-chicago\" target=\"_blank\">said in an interview with <em>Morning Edition</em></a> if and when troops are deployed, the public should know there are things soldiers are or aren't supposed to do.</p>   \n   <p>\"All soldiers — sailors, airmen, Marines, space guardians — they have a duty to follow legal orders just as much as they have a duty to not follow illegal ones. So you're duty-bound either direction,\" Hayes said.</p>   <p>But Raoul said troop deployment is still cause for alarm because these are not \"normal times.\"</p>   <p>\"I don't have any negative feelings about National Guardsmen when they're serving their country, but it's how they're being directed that I'm concerned about,\" Raoul said.</p>   <p>On the prospect of Illinois' lawsuit being appealed all the way to a Trump friendly Supreme Court and troops being deployed in Chicago, Raoul said \"that would be a very dangerous thing to occur.\"</p>   <p>\"It's un-American. This is not what we expect in our country, to be subject to military deploying in our streets to do civilian law enforcement work,\" Raoul continued \"It's not what we do in the United States of America.\"</p>   <p><em>This digital article was edited by Treye Green.

Dick Durbin, the committee's top Democrat. </p>   <p>\"In eight short months, you fundamentally transformed the Justice Department and left an enormous stain on American history. It will take decades to recover,\" he added.</p>   <p>Democrats have zeroed in on a number of issues that they say show her mismanagement of the agency, including the decision to indict <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/25/nx-s1-5552690/james-comey-indicted\" target=\"_blank\">former FBI Director James Comey</a> less than two weeks ago following <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/22/nx-s1-5550132/trump-justice-department-comey-letitia-james-virginia\" target=\"_blank\">public demands from the president</a> to do so.</p>   <p>Bondi was asked about that decision during an exchange with Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, who referenced <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115239044548033727\" target=\"_blank\">a Truth Social post</a> by Trump less than a week before Comey was indicted, directing \"Pam\" to take federal action against the former FBI director.</p>   <p>When Hirono asked whether Bondi was \"the Pam that the president was referring to,\" Bondi replied, \"I'm sure I was.\"</p>   <p>\"It's very clear to me that when the president posts something like that, that he considers the DOJ to be his law firm, and you his lawyer,\" Hirino responded.</p>   \n   <p>Comey, who faces one count of making false statements and one count of obstruction of justice stemming from congressional testimony in 2020, is scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday in federal court in Alexandria, Va.</p>   <p>The Comey indictment — and the machinations that led to it — are the latest, and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/22/nx-s1-5550132/trump-justice-department-comey-letitia-james-virginia\" target=\"_blank\">arguably most concerning, example</a> of what many legal observers point to as the politicization and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/06/g-s1-64305/weaponization-doj-trump-bondi-justice-department\" target=\"_blank\">weaponization of the department under Bondi</a>.</p>   \n   <p>Traditionally, the Justice Department enjoys a degree of independence from the White House, particularly in investigations and prosecutions to insulate them from partisan politics.</p>   <p>But critics say that firewall has been bulldozed since Trump returned to office and put Bondi and other loyalists in top DOJ jobs. Last month,<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/22/nx-s1-5550132/trump-justice-department-comey-letitia-james-virginia\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>Trump openly directed Bondi</u></a> to go after his perceived political adversaries, including New York Attorney General Letitia James, California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff, a Senate Judiciary Committee member, and Comey.</p>   <p>\"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" Trump said in a social media post addressed to Bondi. \"JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\"</p>   <p>Shortly before that post, the president pushed out the<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/20/nx-s1-5547837/us-attorney-virginia-resigns-letitia-james-probe\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>top federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik Siebert,</u></a> a career prosecutor Trump tapped for the role earlier this year. Siebert's office was leading investigations into both James and Comey, and Siebert had expressed concerns about the strength of the evidence in both cases.</p>   <p>Trump then installed<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/21/nx-s1-5549086/trump-nominates-white-house-aide-top-us-prosecutor-probing-letitia-james\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>Lindsey Halligan</u></a>, a former insurance attorney and White House aide with no prosecutorial experience, as U.S. attorney to replace Siebert. She sought and secured an indictment against Comey, overruling career prosecutors who questioned the strength of the case.</p>   <p>After Comey was charged, Bondi posted on social media: \"No one is above the law. Today's indictment reflects this Department of Justice's commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people. We will follow the facts in this case.\"</p>   \n   <h3>Since Bondi took the helm, DOJ has been in almost constant turmoil</h3>   <p>Bondi and her top lieutenants have fired prosecutors who worked Capitol riot cases or investigated Trump and pushed out senior officials at the FBI.</p>   <p>The Public Integrity Section, which prosecutes public corruption, has been almost entirely emptied out, while more than 70 percent of the attorneys in the<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/19/g-s1-66906/trump-civil-rights-justice-exodus\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>Civil Rights Division have departed</u></a> as well.</p>   <p>At her confirmation hearing, Bondi echoed Trump's assertions that the Justice Department under President Biden was weaponized against Trump and conservatives more broadly.</p>   <p>She vowed that would change under her leadership.</p>   <p>\"The partisanship, the weaponization will be gone,\" she told lawmakers. \"America will have one tier of justice for all.\"</p>   <p>In an appearance on Fox News after Comey was indicted, she told Sean Hannity, \"the weaponization has ended.\"</p>   <p>\"We've made that very clear,\" she said. \"Whether you're a former FBI director, whether you the head of a former intel community, whether you are a current state or local elected official, whether you're a billionaire funding organizations to try to keep Donald Trump out of office, everything is on the table. We will investigate you and we will end the weaponization. No longer will there be a two-tier system of justice.\"</p>   \n   <p>Since his indictment, several career prosecutors in that U.S. attorney's office have been fired.</p>   <p>A letter signed by nearly 300 former career DOJ employees and released on the eve of Bondi's hearing says the department is failing to uphold the rule of law, keep the country safe and protect civil rights.</p>   <p>\"The administration is taking a sledgehammer to other longstanding work the Department has done to protect communities and the rule of law, too,\" the letter says. \"We call on these leaders to reverse course — to remember the oath we all took to uphold the Constitution — and adhere to the legal guardrails and institutional norms on which our justice system relies.\"</p>   \n   <p>The letter was released by Justice Connection, a group that supports DOJ employees.</p>   <p>DOJ has not responded to NPR's request for comment on the letter.</p>\n</div>",

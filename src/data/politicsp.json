Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services offered no explanation of its decision to terminate and later restore grant money for mental health and addiction programs.\n                \n                    Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   After a tense day of confusion and backroom negotiations, the Trump administration moved Wednesday night to restore roughly $2 billion in federal grant money for mental health and addiction programs nationwide.   The money had been cut off late Tuesday without warning, sending shockwaves through a segment of the country's patchwork system of public health that relies on grant funding.    \"After a day of panic across the country, non-profits and people with mental health conditions are deeply alarmed, but also hopeful that this money is being restored,\" said Hannah Wesolowski with the National Alliance on Mental Illness.   \n   An administration official confirmed to NPR that the cuts, first announced by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), were being reversed. They asked not to be identified because they didn't have permission to speak publicly about the decision.   They said all of the roughly 2,000 organizations affected by the whiplash series of events were being notified that full funding would be restored.   Official notice of grant restoration began reaching organizations Thursday morning. According to a letter sent by SAMHSA to a care provider in upstate New York, which was shared with NPR, the termination of federal funding communicated Tuesday \"is hereby rescinded.\"   \"Your award will remain active under its original terms and conditions,\" the letter states. \"Please disregard the prior termination notice and continue program activities as outlined in you award agreement.\"   NPR was unable to confirm who triggered the initial decision to terminate the grants by sending letters that abruptly signaled programs no longer \"aligned\" with the Trump administration's public health agenda.   After sending the letters, officials at the Department of Health and Human Services and SAMHSA went silent, offering no clarification to health care providers or the public about what would happen next or where patients should go for care.   \n   The sudden defunding and lack of communication triggered a backlash from local officials and care providers, who said the American public would see a rapid dismantling of essential safety net programs.   \"We provide treatment, life saving treatment,\" said Dan Lustig who runs the Haymarket Center, the largest non-profit addiction treatment program in Chicago, which treats people at high risk while using illicit drugs like fentanyl and methamphetamines.   \"If people don't get access to treatment they just die. That's a fact,\" Lustig said. \"You can spin this any way people want to, but people are going to die.\"   The American Medical Association weighed in, issuing a statement saying it was \"deeply concerned\" by the cuts and calling for grants to be restored.   \"At a time when patients already face too many barriers to care, sudden funding disruptions risk leaving them without the support and treatment they urgently need,\" the statement said.   That message reached members of Congress. Republican and Democratic lawmakers scrambled to urge White House and Health and Human Services officials to reverse course.   \"We heard from offices on both sides of the political aisle who were working on this issue throughout the day,\" said Wesolowski. The bipartisan pressure, she added, \"really speaks to the power of the collaboration on this issue.\"   While most of the talks happened behind closed doors, some Democratic lawmakers publicly blasted the Trump administration and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for what they described as roughshod treatment of front-line care providers.   \"After national outrage, Secretary Kennedy has bowed to public pressure and reinstated $2 billion in SAMHSA grants that save lives,\" said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut.   \"Our policy must be thoughtful – not haphazard and chaotic. This episode has only created uncertainty and confusion for families and health care providers,\" she added.   While confusion over funding was apparently short-lived, public health organizations and other sources told NPR that the termination letters demoralized staff in a system already weakened by deep cuts to Medicaid, enacted by the Republican-controlled Congress last year.    \n   For 24 hours, it was unclear which programs would survive and who would still have jobs when the dust settled.   Dr. Yngvild Olsen, an addiction treatment physician who served as the director for the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment inside SAMHSA until July 2025, said the turmoil also raised questions about who in the Trump administration is making key public health decisions.   \"My understanding is that much of the staff at SAMHSA was caught unaware,\" Olsen said. \"These were decisions made without the input of experts in these programs and experts in this [addiction and mental health] field.\"   For months, Trump administration officials have been signaling they think many of the country's current public health programs are ineffective and need to be replaced.   But public health experts told NPR there has been little or no communication with frontline groups that provide much of the actual in the U.S. Meanwhile, no clear plan from the administration has emerged. Instead, local government agencies and non-profits caring for patients have faced a series of threats, disruptions and funding chaos.   \"This sparks a lot of uncertainty about who's making public health decisions in this country,\" said NAMI's Wesolowski. \n",

Federal district Judge David O. Carter dismissed a lawsuit in California that sought to give the Justice Department access to that state's unredacted voter file, which includes sensitive data like Social Security numbers and driver's license data. A district judge in Oregon also said in court Wednesday that he was tentatively planning to do the same there.   California and Oregon are two of 23 states, along with Washington, D.C., that have been sued by the Department of Justice for rebuffing requests for voter data. All states are led by Democrats, or were lost by President Trump in the 2020 election.   \n   The DOJ has argued that it needs unfettered access to the state voter lists to determine whether states are maintaining their voter lists in accordance with federal law. State officials from both major political parties, however, have noted that the federal government has never had access to this data before, and expressed worries about what else the federal government could use the data for.   \"The government's request is unprecedented and illegal,\" Judge Carter wrote. \"The DOJ's request for the sensitive information of Californians stands to have a chilling effect on American citizens like political minority groups and working-class immigrants who may consider not registering to vote or skip casting a ballot because they are worried about how their information will be used.\"   Carter, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, also wrote that the Justice Department's suit appeared to be a \"telltale 'fishing expedition.'\"   \"Even the federal government is not permitted to sue first, obtain discovery, and finalize its allegations later,\" Carter wrote.   The Department of Justice did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Carter's dismissal.   The U.S. Constitution is clear that states run their own elections, with almost no input from the executive branch. And when the Trump administration made similar requests for this sort of election data in Trump's first term, it was universally rejected. In 2017, one Republican secretary of state famously said the Trump administration could \"go jump in the Gulf of Mexico.\"   \n   But things have changed.   At least eight Republican states have either voluntarily provided or said they will provide their full statewide registration list to the administration during his second term, according to tracking by the Brennan Center for Justice.   In many cases, the data has been run through a revamped system at the Department of Homeland Security meant to search for noncitizens. NPR was the first news outlet to report on the details of the system, known as SAVE, but after tens of millions of records were run through it, no evidence of the sort of widespread voter fraud Trump has long talked about has come to light.   Carter's ruling is the first to come out of the numerous voter data lawsuits across the country, and during a hearing, he noted that he expected his ruling to be appealed regardless of the outcome, potentially all the way to the Supreme Court.\n",

The plan does not include a remedy for people who buy their health insurance on HealthCare.gov, some of whom are facing sky-high premium hikes this month.   \n   Trump dubbed the ideas the \"Great Healthcare Plan.\" The White House issued a fact sheet and held a press call hosted by the chief of Medicare and Medicaid, Dr. Mehmet Oz.    Oz said the planned legislation, which the administration is asking Congress to develop, has four pillars:    Drug price reformsHealth insurance reformsPrice transparency for health costsFraud protections and safeguards   Asked for specific policy details, Oz said it was a \"broad framework\" and referred further questions to a White House official who spoke on background. The official also did not provide detailed answers to reporters' questions but did say that this future legislation would not replace other possible laws.    \n   Familiar ideas   Both Oz and Trump talked about the plan as if it is a replacement for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), but the proposals are much narrower in scope than that law, which passed with no Republican votes in 2010.   A bipartisan group of senators is trying to hash out a bill to extend ACA enhanced subsidies, and Trump's plan appears not to preclude that short-term deal moving forward, but it is not a vote of confidence either.    \"This does send a signal that Trump isn't looking to compromise with Democrats on the enhanced tax credits,\" says Cynthia Cox, a senior vice president at KFF, a nonpartisan health research organization. \"This looks much more like a compilation of Republican ideas, including some that are already in the Affordable Care Act. It doesn't appear to address the rising premium payments that we're seeing.\"   \n   Senate still working   Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, who has been leading the bipartisan talks on reviving the enhanced subsidies, told reporters Thursday that he \"loved\" Trump's Great Healthcare Plan.    He said that the omission of the subsidies in Trump's plan did not throw a wrench into those negotiations. \"No, the biggest wrench in our negotiations is that the Democrat leader has basically made public statements that, to me, sounds like he doesn't want Congress to make a deal.\"   A bill that the House of Representatives passed over the objections of Republican leaders in that body that would be a three-year extension of the enhanced subsidies appears to be a nonstarter in the Senate, though it still has the support of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.    \n   Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, is also working on the bipartisan deal. She was more upbeat. \"I'm not giving up,\" she told reporters at the Capitol on Thursday, which is the last day of ACA open enrollment. She noted that families are having to make their final decisions Thursday on whether to pay more for their coverage or go without health insurance.    \"I don't think it is too late to try to salvage something,\" Murkowski said.   If a bipartisan fix comes together, it would likely have to address people who have already paid a higher premium for their January coverage.\n",

Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations committee, about bipartisan legislation that would block a U.S. takeover of Greenland.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Now we turn to one of the top Democrats seeking to block the Trump administration's efforts to control Greenland. Senator Jeanne Shaheen is from New Hampshire. She's ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and she's co-sponsoring legislation that would bar the administration from annexing or conducting military operations in that territory. And Senator Shaheen is with us now. Good morning. Thank you for joining us.JEANNE SHAHEEN: Well, nice to be with you. And I would just point out that the legislation that I'm sponsoring with Lisa Murkowski from Alaska, who is a Republican - so it's bipartisan.MARTIN: OK. So the first question about this is, spell out what you see as the danger here.SHAHEEN: Well, NATO has been the strongest, most effective security alliance probably in history. And as most of your listeners would know, the only violation of Article 5 was against the United States after 9/11, and all of our NATO partners went to war with us in Afghanistan, including Denmark. And for President Trump to undermine that national security compact by threatening Greenland makes no sense at all. And it makes no sense because Greenland and Denmark's leaders have both said whatever the United States needs from Greenland, from Denmark, they're willing to partner with us on. So if it's critical minerals, if it's more bases, if it's working together to address a threat from Russia and China, they're willing to work with us on that. Why are we considering a military option to do that?MARTIN: So...SHAHEEN: It makes no sense at all.MARTIN: So let me jump in here. The president says that if the U.S. does not seize Greenland, Russia or China will. Your argument is, you know, to the contrary, taking Greenland would play directly into Russia and China's hands. Can you say more about why?SHAHEEN: Absolutely. One of the things that makes the United States so strong is not just our military might. It is our allies and partners. And it's in America's interest to maintain those strong relationships. And what Vladimir Putin and President Xi of China are looking at is that Donald Trump is undermining those relationships in ways that benefit Russia, that benefit China, that benefit Iran and North Korea. Again, it makes no sense that the president of the United States is undermining our own national security by his statements.MARTIN: You mentioned at the top of our conversation that this - you co-sponsored this bill, along with Senator Lisa Murkowski from Alaska. How much support do you see or does Senator Murkowski see from other Republicans?SHAHEEN: We've had a number of Republicans who have spoken out against the president's comments. We had a meeting with the ambassadors from Denmark and Greenland last week with Roger Wicker, who is the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee. He and I did a statement to reporters at the end of that meeting talking about the fact that we have a long-standing relationship with Greenland, with Denmark, that there is no need to have any kind of a negotiation, that they're willing to partner with us on whatever our interests are.MARTIN: So obviously, the president would need to sign this bill to make it law. That's unlikely because this is contrary to his stated goal. Is the goal here to get Republicans on the record about whether they support aggression against a NATO ally?SHAHEEN: The goal is to speak up about the president's comments. And we know that the overwhelming majority of the American people oppose any effort to take Greenland by military force. We know they oppose the United States trying to buy Greenland at a time when we have so many domestic needs - the high cost of groceries and energy. When we've got millions of people who are losing their health insurance, why is he talking about spending $700 billion to acquire something that we don't need because they're willing to work with us on it?MARTIN: So before we let you go, you are - I understand you're traveling later this week to Copenhagen - Friday - with a bipartisan delegation...SHAHEEN: Yes.MARTIN: ...Of lawmakers. What do you hope to achieve while you're there?SHAHEEN: Well, we want to hear from the leaders of both Denmark and Greenland about what their concerns are, about how we might work together to address some of the challenges that are facing Greenland and the alliance and how we can help to reassure people about United States and Congress support for Greenland, for Denmark, for the values that we all share and for the NATO alliance.MARTIN: That is U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen. She's a Democrat from New Hampshire. She's ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Senator Shaheen, thanks for joining us once again.SHAHEEN: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Even if it the gesture proves to be purely symbolic, it was extraordinary given that Trump has effectively sidelined Machado, who has long been the face of resistance in Venezuela. He has signaled his willingness to work with acting President Delcy Rodríguez, who had been Maduro's second in command.   \"I presented the president of the United States the medal, the Nobel Peace Prize,\" Machado told reporters after leaving the White House and heading to Capitol Hill. She said she had done so \"as a recognition for his unique commitment with our freedom.\"   \n   Trump confirmed later on social media that Machado had left the medal for him to keep, and he said it was an honor to meet her.   \"She is a wonderful woman who has been through so much. María presented me with her Nobel Peace Prize for the work I have done,\" Trump said in his post. \"Such a wonderful gesture of mutual respect. Thank you María!\"   \n   The White House later posted a photo of Machado standing next to Trump in the Oval Office as he holds the medal in a large frame. A text in the frame reads, \"Presented as a personal symbol of gratitude on behalf of the Venezuelan people in recognition of President Trump's principled and decisive action to secure a free Venezuela.\"   Trump has raised doubts about his stated commitment to backing democratic rule in Venezuela, giving no timetable on when elections might be held. Machado indicated that he had provided few specifics on that front during their discussion.   She did not provide more information on what was said.   'We can count on President Trump'   After the closed-door meeting, Machado greeted dozens of cheering supporters waiting for her near the White House gates, stopping to hug many.   \n   \"We can count on President Trump,\" she told them without elaborating, prompting some to briefly chant, \"Thank you, Trump.\"   Before her visit to Washington, Machado had not been seen in public since she traveled last month to Norway, where her daughter received the peace prize on her behalf. She had spent 11 months in hiding in Venezuela before she appeared in Norway after the ceremony.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, center, is welcomed by Sen.

Scott Applewhite/AP\n    \n\n   \n   The jubilant scene after her meeting with Trump stood in contrast to political realities in Venezuela. Rodríguez remains in charge of day-to-day government operations, along with others in Maduro's inner circle. In her first state of the union speech Thursday, the interim president promoted the resumption of diplomatic ties between the historic adversaries and advocated for opening the state-run oil industry to more foreign investment after Trump pledged to seize control of Venezuelan crude sales.   Trump has said it would be difficult for Machado to lead because she \"doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country.\" Her party is widely believed to have won 2024 elections rejected by Maduro.   White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called Machado \"a remarkable and brave voice\" but also said the meeting didn't mean Trump's opinion of her changed, calling it \"a realistic assessment.\"   Leavitt told reporters that Trump supported new Venezuelan elections \"when the time is right\" but did not say when he thought that might be.   A 'frank and positive discussion' about Venezuela   Leavitt said Machado had sought the face-to-face meeting without setting expectations for what would occur. She spent about two and a half hours at the White House.   \"I don't think he needs to hear anything from Ms. Machado,\" the press secretary said while the meeting was still going on, other than to have a \"frank and positive discussion about what's taking place in Venezuela.\"   \n   After leaving the White House, Machado went on to a closed-door meeting with a bipartisan group of senators.   Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said Machado told them that \"if there's not some progress, real progress towards a transition in power, and/or elections in the next several months, we should all be worried.\"   \"She reminded us that Delcy Rodríguez is, in many ways, worse than Maduro,\" he added.   Asked if Machado had heard any commitment from the White House on holding elections in Venezuela, Murphy said, \"No, I don't think she got any commitment from them.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, center, leaves the Capitol, Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026, in Washington.\n                \n                    Allison Robbert/FR172296 AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Allison Robbert/FR172296 AP\n    \n\n   \n   Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican, was exultant following the meeting, saying Machado \"delivered a message that loud and clear: What President Trump did was the most important, significant event in Latin America. That getting rid of Maduro was absolutely essential.\"   Machado's Washington stop coincided with U.S. forces in the Caribbean Sea seizing another sanctioned oil tanker that the Trump administration says had ties to Venezuela. It is part of a broader U.S. effort to take control of the South American country's oil after U.S. forces captured Maduro and his wife less than two weeks ago at a heavily guarded compound in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas and brought them to New York to stand trial on drug trafficking charges.   Leavitt said Venezuela's interim authorities have been fully cooperating with the Trump administration and noted that Rodríguez's government said it planned to release more prisoners detained under Maduro. Among those released were five Americans this week.   Trump said Wednesday that he had a \"great conversation\" with Rodríguez, their first since Maduro was ousted.   Machado doesn't get the nod from Trump   Just hours after Maduro's capture, Trump said of Machado that \"it would be very tough for her to be the leader.\" Machado had steered a careful course to avoid offending Trump, notably after winning the peace prize, and had sought to cultivate relationships with him and key administration voices like Secretary of State Marco Rubio.   \n   The industrial engineer and daughter of a steel magnate, Machado began challenging the ruling party in 2004, when the nongovernmental organization she co-founded, Súmate, promoted a referendum to recall then-President Hugo Chávez. The initiative failed, and Machado and other Súmate executives were charged with conspiracy.   A year later, she drew the anger of Chávez and his allies again for traveling to Washington to meet President George W. Bush, whom Chávez considered an adversary.   Almost two decades later, she marshaled millions of Venezuelans to reject Chávez's successor, Maduro, for another term in the 2024 election. But ruling party-loyal electoral authorities declared him the winner despite ample credible evidence to the contrary. Ensuing anti-government protests ended in a brutal crackdown.\n",

He argued there were no grounds to invoke the Insurrection Act.   \n   \"If Donald Trump does invoke the Insurrection Act, I'm prepared to challenge that action in court,\" Ellison said in an emailed statement.    The act is one way the president can send troops to states to restore law and order. But unlike in Trump's National Guard deployments in 2025, the Insurrection Act would allow armed forces to carry out law enforcement functions, such as making arrests and conducting searches.   Beyond quelling protests, the law could also open the door to significantly expand the military's role in protecting federal buildings and carrying out immigration enforcement, which some of Trump's aides have suggested he invoke the law for.   Since President Thomas Jefferson signed it into law in 1807, the Insurrection Act has been invoked only about 30 times. The last instance was over three decades ago, during the 1992 Los Angeles riots. During his second term, Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of using the statute. Back in June, when asked whether he would invoke the act during the anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles, Trump said it \"depends on whether or not there is an insurrection.\" In October, when asked under what conditions he would utilize the Insurrection Act, Trump replied, \"I'd do it if it was necessary. So far it hasn't been necessary.\"   \n   He went on: \"If people were being killed and courts were holding us or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure I'd do that.\"   Trump has also erroneously claimed that nearly half of all U.S. presidents have invoked the law and that it was invoked 28 times by a single president, as he said during an interview with CBS' 60 Minutes in late October.   \n   In reality, only 17 out of 45 presidents — or 37% — have utilized the law, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and policy organization that in 2022 tracked all Insurrection Act invocations. The group also did not find a president who invoked the emergency powers more than six times, as President Ulysses S. Grant did during the Reconstruction era.   The White House did not release a statement on the president's threat.   Here's what to know.   How would the Insurrection Act get used?   There are three ways that the president can invoke the Insurrection Act, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.   The first is at the request of a state legislature or governor facing an \"insurrection.\" The law itself does not elaborate on what qualifies as an insurrection, but legal scholars generally understand the term as referring to a violent uprising of some kind.   In the second path, the president does not need a state's consent to deploy troops when \"unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion\" makes it \"impracticable\" to enforce federal laws.   The third path also does not require the affected state's support. In this case, the president can send in the military to suppress an insurrection that \"hinders the execution of the laws\" or \"opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws.\"   Before invoking the Insurrection Act, the president must first order the \"insurgents\" to disperse within a limited amount of time.   \n   How would troop deployments differ under the Insurrection Act?   So far during Trump's second term, National Guard troops have been called into Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland, Ore., under a statute known as Title 10, which places the force under federal control. The operations in Memphis, Tenn., and Washington, D.C., were authorized under Title 32, meaning they were under state command. (The situation in D.C. is unique since the federal district is not a state and therefore does not have a governor.)   \n   Under these deployments, National Guard forces are subject to the Posse Comitatus Act, which generally prohibits federal military personnel from acting as police on American streets. It's rooted in one of the nation's founding principles, which opposes military involvement in civilian affairs.   The Insurrection Act, however, is a key exception to the law.   The controversial emergency powers were last used during the 1992 Los Angeles riots after the acquittal of four police officers in the beating of Rodney King.   Then-President George H.W. Bush invoked the law at the request of then-California Gov.  Pete Wilson, who was worried that local law enforcement could not quell the unrest alone.   But that deployment also showed the risks of using military personnel as law enforcement. In an infamous moment, LA police officers asked a group of Marines to \"cover\" them as they approached a house. The Marines interpreted their request as asking them to open fire, while the police officers actually wanted them to stay on guard.   \n   \"The Marines then lay down suppressing fire. The police were completely aghast,\" Mick Wagoner, a retired Marine Corps lieutenant colonel, told NPR last year.   How much power does the Insurrection Act give the president?   Some of the Insurrection Act's power comes from what's not in it.   Terms like \"insurrection,\" \"rebellion\" and \"impracticable\" are loosely defined and give broad deference to the president, according to William Banks, professor emeritus of law at Syracuse University and an expert in national security and emergency powers.   \n   \"It's incredibly open-ended and grants him a dramatic amount of discretion to federalize an incident,\" he added.   The law also does not mention time constraints on the troop deployments. Nor does it involve Congress in the process to maintain checks and balances, Banks added.   The Insurrection Act has also been rarely tested in the courts. Trump himself described the Insurrection Act as providing legal cover.   \n   \"Do you know that I could use that immediately and no judge can even challenge you on that? But I haven't chosen to do it because I haven't felt we need it,\" he said during the October 60 Minutes interview.   Despite its broad language, legal experts argue that historical precedent matters when it comes to the Insurrection Act.   If Trump were to invoke the law to address crime or enforce immigration laws, it would represent a sharp departure from past uses and would likely face legal challenges, according to Laura A. Dickinson, a professor at George Washington University Law School who focuses on national security.   \" While it seems very broad on its face, it's not a blank check,\" she said.

Big Stick policy. Gunboat diplomacy.   Until recently, the terms were relegated mostly to the pages of dusty history books. But President Trump is leaning heavily on his own understanding of these concepts to justify his attack on Venezuela, his bullying tactics aimed at acquiring Greenland and his latest threats to strike Iran.   At a news conference this month, Trump said U.S. troops captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro because his actions amounted to a \"gross violation of the core principles of American foreign policy dating back more than two centuries … to the Monroe Doctrine.\"   \n   \"And the Monroe Doctrine is a big deal, but we've superseded it by a lot, by a real lot. They now call it the 'Donroe Doctrine,'\" he said.   What is the Monroe Doctrine?   In 1823, President James Monroe cautioned Europe in his address to Congress, declaring that \"any attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of\" the Western Hemisphere would be seen as \"dangerous to our peace and safety.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A painting of James Monroe, the fifth president of the United States, who served from 1817 to 1825. The doctrine named after him has served as a justification for U.S. intervention in Latin America and elsewhere.\n                \n                    National Archives/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        National Archives/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Monroe's declaration came at a time when Spain was struggling to hang on to its North American possessions — areas on the continent that included parts of Florida and vast areas of the present-day U.S. Southwest.   The Monroe Doctrine \"emerged from a geopolitical context in which the United States was a rising power, staking a claim to the Western Hemisphere as its sphere of influence,\" says Jay Sexton, director of the Kinder Institute on Constitutional Democracy at the University of Missouri.   \n   At its inception, the doctrine \"simply stated what European powers could not do in the Western Hemisphere\" but was deliberately open-ended, allowing \"later Americans [to] redeploy it or reimagine it for a new context,\" adds Sexton, who is author of The Monroe Doctrine: Empire and Nation in Nineteenth-Century America.   In fact, eight decades later, President Theodore Roosevelt reimagined the Monroe Doctrine as a more muscular policy — in part as a response to Britain, Germany and Italy's naval blockade of Venezuelan ports over that country's failure to pay on foreign debts. In his 1904 annual message to Congress, Roosevelt argued that \"chronic wrongdoing\" on the world stage required \"intervention by some civilized nation.\"   \n   \"In the Western Hemisphere the adherence of the United States to the Monroe Doctrine may force the United States, however reluctantly, in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or impotence, to the exercise of an international police power,\" he said.   \"Roosevelt strongly believed that the real advances are through diplomacy — slow, patient diplomacy — and not through military instruments,\" says Jon Alterman, the Brzezinski chair in global security and geostrategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a bipartisan research organization in Washington, D.C.   \n   In contrast, he says, Trump \"seems to think that the diplomacy stuff is slow and hard and imperfect, and the nice thing about the military is that things … [are] sharp and clear and successful.\"   In 1907, Roosevelt famously dispatched a flotilla of 16 U.S. battleships, dubbed the \"Great White Fleet,\" on a global circumnavigation to showcase American strength to potential rivals, particularly an increasingly assertive Japan. However, Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University, emphasizes that Roosevelt's flotilla \"didn't go to war,\" but rather \"he brought it to the Pacific and said, 'Look at how large our navy is.'\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Theodore Roosevelt (center) sits on a steam shovel at the Culebra Cut of the Panama Canal in November 1906.\n                \n                    U.S. Library of Congress/AFP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        U.S. Library of Congress/AFP\n    \n\n   \n   Even so, the Roosevelt Corollary, as it came to be known, justified intervention in Latin America to maintain regional stability, such as the U.S. support for Panama's secession from Colombia, which allowed the construction of the Panama Canal, and the sending of U.S. troops to Cuba in 1906 to quell an insurrection there. The corollary reflected Roosevelt's broader Big Stick philosophy — \"speak softly and carry a big stick\" — prioritizing diplomacy first, with military force as a last resort. Trump's approach appears to flip those priorities, says Michael Cullinane, chair of Theodore Roosevelt studies at Dickinson State University.   Cullinane notes that in the case of Venezuela, \"the lead-up to what Trump did is very similar to what Roosevelt did, but the 'speak softly' bit was missing.\" Trump, he says, \"didn't conduct diplomacy before using the big stick. He just used the big stick.\"   \n   The emergence of American \"gunboat diplomacy\"   Expanding on the policies of Monroe and Roosevelt, President Woodrow Wilson took \"gunboat diplomacy\" to a new level.   Using America's growing naval power, Wilson demonstrated a more aggressive, interventionist approach than his predecessors, sending U.S. Marines to invade Haiti and the neighboring Dominican Republic to secure U.S. financial interests on Hispaniola. He inherited a U.S. Marine presence in Nicaragua ordered by his predecessor, William Howard Taft. Wilson later ordered the U.S. Navy to occupy the Mexican port of Veracruz as part of a campaign to depose Mexico's dictator. He also sent U.S. forces across the border in pursuit of Mexican guerrilla leader Pancho Villa.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                This political cartoon depicts President Woodrow Wilson handing a thick, heavy olive branch, representing the League of Nations, to a dove of peace, in 1919.\n                \n                    Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Wilson's policies may be the better analogy to Trump's own interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine. Like Trump, Wilson wanted to be seen as a peacemaker, famously pushing for the League of Nations — a predecessor to the United Nations — in the wake of World War I. \"The paradox of the Wilson years is that Wilson is the president that orders the most interventions in the Caribbean and Central America,\" Sexton says.   But Brinkley warns against \"overthinking Trump's thinking\" on foreign policy. He argues that Trump \"just cherry-picks what's convenient from the bushel of American history.\"   Ultimately, Trump's famously transactional nature translates into a type of realpolitik that informs his relations with others.   Roosevelt is on Mount Rushmore and helped negotiate an end to the Russo-Japanese War, for which he won the Nobel Peace Prize — an honor that Trump has repeatedly insisted he deserves.   But Trump is no Teddy Roosevelt, Cullinane says. Among other things, \"disrespecting international law is something that Roosevelt would not have done.\"   \"Roosevelt supported international arbitration. ... That is very different from how Donald Trump is approaching international relations,\" Cullinane says.   U.S. interventions in Latin America continued after World War II, but the Monroe Doctrine was invoked less often, Sexton says. That's because the doctrine \"arose from a geopolitical context in which the United States was a rising power and was staking a claim to the Western Hemisphere to its sphere of influence.\"   \n   With the U.S. emerging from World War II as a truly global power, it didn't seem to fit.   \"But as that world order has begun to unravel [and has] begun crashing down, spheres of influence are making a return,\" he says.\n",

    "body": "\n      The Justice Department is once again at the center of the news, with investigations of federal lawmakers, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and resignations by career prosecutors in Minnesota.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  Over the past week, the Trump administration has pursued investigations into the chairman of the Federal Reserve and sitting lawmakers. At the same time, leaders of the Justice Department have ruled out a civil rights investigation against the federal officer who shot and killed motorist Renee Macklin Good in Minneapolis. The Department of Justice is once again at the center of the news, so we have asked NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro and NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson to discuss what's been happening over the last week. Hello to both of you.DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there.CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Hi there.CHANG: Carrie, let's start with you. It feels like we have been seeing, like, an escalation for the Justice Department and the Trump administration this week, like, both when it comes to the tactics that this administration uses and their willingness to push the boundaries of the law, right? Is this all part of some bigger goal, you think?JOHNSON: Definitely. Virtually everything that's happened over the past week could have been predicted on Inauguration Day. President Trump returned to the White House promising to investigate his perceived political enemies. And after the election, people were worried about DOJ, but changes there have been more sweeping and more quick than many of them feared. The Supreme Court in the immunity case made clear President Trump and future presidents are largely immune from prosecution for their official actions in office. And so this is an aggressive Justice Department under Trump's full command - really the culmination of statements he made on the campaign trail.CHANG: That's right - on the campaign trail. Because as a candidate, he promised - right? - to go after his enemies. He also promised to be tough on immigration. Domenico, how are people responding to what's been happening in Minnesota specifically?MONTANARO: Well, the situation in Minneapolis is really highlighting some of these aggressive tactics of the Trump administration. There's new polling this week out from a couple of outfits. A Quinnipiac poll found that 57% disapprove of the way that ICE is enforcing immigration law. Fifty-three percent said that they don't think that the shooting was justified, while only 35% say that it was. And this has become the real problem for Trump on something that had been an advantage with immigration. You know, people may be in favor of deporting criminals who are in the country illegally, but they've also been saying for months that they see this administration's approach as going too far or acting too harshly when it comes to deportations. And that's been dragging down Trump's numbers overall on immigration.CHANG: Well, Minnesota, I mean, it's just one part of the story this week, right? Like, Democrats in Congress say that they are being investigated over a video urging military members to disregard illegal orders. How did those investigations fit into what we've been talking about?JOHNSON: Yeah, several Democrats this week told us they've heard from the FBI and agents who want to interview them. They say this is an infringement on their First Amendment rights and potentially their rights as lawmakers as they try to do their jobs. One of them, Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, has gone so far as to sue the Pentagon, which has been threatening to reduce his rank and benefits over what he said in that video.MONTANARO: Yeah. And I have to say, from a raw politics perspective, I mean, do Republicans really want to elevate the profiles of people like Mark Kelly, the senator from Arizona, or Elissa Slotkin, the senator from Michigan? They're two of the more moderate members of the Democratic caucus. You're talking about an astronaut, a former CIA analyst. I mean, they'd cut pretty good profiles for 2028 candidates. And I'd venture to say that if not for how the Trump administration has gone after them, Kelly in particular would not likely be somebody who's as much part of the 2028 conversation as he is now. And it's also just not the wing of the Democratic Party that politically you would think the Republicans would want to highlight.CHANG: So maybe they're shooting themselves in the foot. Well, there was more this week. The Department of Justice is investigating Jerome Powell - as we said, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. And then we saw that the FBI searched the home of a Washington Post journalist. Carrie, can you just explain what's been happening on those fronts?JOHNSON: Yeah, a real whirlwind. On Sunday night, Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, made a video explaining that he seemed to be under criminal investigation for testimony he gave on Capitol Hill about renovations to the Fed's buildings. Powell basically said this was a smokescreen - that President Trump wants to get rid of him because the Fed wasn't moving as quickly as Trump wanted on interest rates. And then a few days later, FBI agents showed up in the morning at the home of a Washington Post reporter. They took two laptops, a phone and a smartwatch. The Justice Department says this is tied to an investigation of a federal contractor who's been accused of retaining government secrets. But to search a reporter's home is a stunning step, one that past administrations had avoided and one that also may run afoul of a federal privacy law.CHANG: I mean, it seems like retribution is a major theme now in Trump's second term, yeah?MONTANARO: Yeah, for sure, it's a huge motivating factor. I mean, remember, he's been smarting from investigations that were going into him for years, and he's been promising, quote-unquote, \"retribution.\" And that's coming to fruition now. You know, it's really become a sort of political platform in the second term - fuel for a conservative grievance. He's gone after any number of perceived political enemies, whether it's former officials who've spoken out against him, journalists, universities, law firms - you name it.CHANG: Yeah. Well, Carrie, how are people inside the Justice Department responding to some of this backlash?JOHNSON: They're not saying much about the investigation of Jerome Powell or the one of Democratic lawmakers on the video, but they are defending the immigration efforts in Minnesota. The deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, says federal immigration officers are risking their lives in Minneapolis under chaotic conditions and they have to make split-second decisions. He says he sees no reason to open a civil rights investigation into Renee Macklin Good's death. Instead, DOJ seems to want to investigate Good's widow and any tie she has to activist groups.CHANG: And that suggested direction of the investigation does not seem to have gone over well with some of the career prosecutors in the DOJ, right? Like what's the latest there?JOHNSON: Major unrest in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Minnesota. Several prosecutors quit. These resignations are part of a broader pattern that's been happening across the country since Trump took office in Tennessee, D.C., Virginia, and of course, what happened in last year in New York with the dropping of the case against former New York City Mayor Eric Adams. In all of these instances, the ethics of career prosecutors are being put to the test. And so long as the president commands the Justice Department to target his critics, it's likely to keep happening.CHANG: That is NPR's Carrie Johnson and Domenico Montanaro. Thank you to both of you.MONTANARO: You're welcome.JOHNSON: My pleasure.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Tensions remain high in Minneapolis. President Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to quell ongoing protests there against federal officers carrying out his immigration crackdown.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  President Trump today threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to suppress ongoing protests in Minneapolis. Tensions remain high after an ICE officer killed 37-year-old Renee Macklin Good last week. Frustrations boiled over last night after a Venezuelan immigrant was shot in the leg by a federal agent who said he was attacked. NPR's Jasmine Garsd is in Minneapolis and joins us now with the latest. Hi, Jas.JASMINE GARSD, BYLINE: Hi.CHANG: So what does it feel like right there now? Like, what's the mood like?GARSD: You know, last night, a Minnesotan asked me, does the rest of the country understand what is happening here? So let me paint a picture. The mood is very tense. Homeland Security says there are more than 2,000 ICE agents on the ground and more on the way. A lot of people out here are terrified of retaliation for protesting and don't want to give their full names. Like this young protester - he asked to go by his first name only, Cameron.CAMERON: They have the city turned into a war zone just like they want it to be. They're here to scare people.GARSD: Right now, the streets are fairly empty. A lot of stores have their doors locked. And on every street corner, there are one or two people, citizens, just standing, monitoring for ICE agents. The level of organized resistance to ICE here is like nothing I've seen anywhere else in the U.S. Thousands of people are on messaging apps right now, sharing license plates numbers of cars which they suspect are ICE agents in order to warn their neighbors.CHANG: Well, last night, as we mentioned, a Venezuelan immigrant was shot in the leg, which I saw led to more protests. And I understand that you got there right after that incident. What did you see?GARSD: Yeah. Homeland Security has issued a statement saying the federal immigration agent was acting in self-defense after he was attacked by the immigrant and two other people with a shovel and a broom handle. The Trump administration is calling protesters professional agitators and insurrectionists. I met a lot of families there, older adults, different ethnicities. It was a very mixed group. I spoke to a nurse who said she's afraid of ICE retaliation for protesting. She wanted to only be referred to by her first name, Karen. And she asked me, is it normal how scared I am right now?KAREN: It's my first time out here, but I'm a nurse. And I'm afraid people are going to get hurt, so I'm here to keep my neighbors safe.(SOUNDBITE OF WHISTLE BLOWING)UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: We don't want (inaudible) here.GARSD: Moments after we spoke, ICE agents started throwing what seemed like flash grenades. There were very loud bangs, and we ran away.CHANG: OK. Well, as we said earlier, President Trump is now threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act in order to tamp down these protests we're talking about. How are Minneapolis officials responding to that threat?GARSD: Well, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said there were no grounds to invoke the act. In a statement, he added, quote, \"if Donald Trump does invoke the Insurrection Act, I am prepared to challenge that in - action in court.\" But, you know, people I spoke to out here expressed frustration with state leaders. Last night at the protest, I met a mom who told me she was scared of speaking out against the government. She didn't want to use her full name, but this is her message to local officials.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Step up more. Do something. You know, come outside with the people. Support us some more. Like, you're just doing press conferences for what? Like, you're our government. Like, come outside and help us.CHANG: But Jasmine, can you just explain for people what invoking the Insurrection Act specifically means? Like, what would that look like?GARSD: Absolutely. So the president has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act multiple times. And the act is one way for a president to send in the military, but it's different from the National Guard deployments we saw last year in that the Insurrection Act goes further. It allows the military to carry out local law enforcement functions. You know, every person I have spoken to out here has told me they are furious and they have no intention of backing down. So there's a sense here that we're at a boiling point and that invoking the Insurrection Act would only inflame the situation.CHANG: That is NPR's Jasmine Garsd in Minneapolis. Thank you so much, Jas.GARSD: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

You're reading the Up First newsletter. Subscribe here to get it delivered to your inbox, and listen to the Up First podcast for all the news you need to start your day.   Today's top stories   Some media executives are calling the FBI's search of a reporter's home yesterday an alarming intrusion into the freedom of the press. The agency searched Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson's house as part of the Trump administration's investigation of a leak. Agents seized two computers and her smartwatch. Last month, Natanson documented the purge of hundreds of thousands of federal employees by relying on over 1,000 sources.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Washington Post Building at One Franklin Square Building on June 5, 2024 in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 It is highly unusual for the agency to search a reporter's home instead of an office, NPR's David Folkenflik told Up First. The government has informed the newspaper that Natanson is not the focal point of the investigation. Marty Baron, a former executive editor of The Washington Post, told Folkenflik that this administration has displayed a pattern of trying to undermine an independent press and attempting to interfere with its work.   Denmark's foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, says there is still a \"fundamental disagreement\" between his country and President Trump regarding Denmark's territory island Greenland. After meeting with Vice President Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio yesterday, Løkke Rasmussen said Trump clearly wants to \"conquer\" the territory. However, the two sides did agree to form a working group to continue discussing U.S. security concerns.    \n   🎧The U.S. seeking to acquire Greenland challenges the rules of international order, specifically the U.N. charter that says a member cannot use force against another country to seize territory, says Stewart Patrick, formerly of the George W. Bush State Department. Denmark has announced plans to build its military presence in Greenland, in what could be considered a pushback at allegations that it can't defend the country, according to NPR's Franco Ordoñez. Sweden and Germany also announced they would send military forces to the region, potentially conveying a message to the U.S. that Denmark is not alone.   A Trump administration official confirmed to NPR that sweeping cuts to over $2 billion in funding for mental health and addiction programs are being reversed. The reversal comes after letters about the news went out late Tuesday, sending a shockwave through the U.S.' public health system. Originally, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration was ending grants for roughly 2,000 organizations, which are frontline programs helping some of the most vulnerable people in the country.    🎧 The reversal comes as relief to people like Hannah Wesolowski, who is with the National Alliance on Mental Illness. She says these organizations are deeply demoralized, and over those 24 hours, many people thought they were going to lose their jobs and thought their really sick patients would lose care. NPR's Brian Mann says people he has been talking to feel rudderless due to the unexplained defunding, and then there was no clear explanation as to why the money was restored. This comes as the Trump administration has been signaling for months that it thinks many of the nation's public health programs are ineffective and need to be replaced.   \n   Deep dive   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Elementary students in Computer Lab\n                \n                    Adam Kaz/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Adam Kaz/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The risks of using generative artificial intelligence to educate children and teens currently outweigh the benefits, according to a new study by the Brookings Institution's Center for Universal Education. The study found that using AI in education can \"undermine children's foundational development\" and that \"the damages it has already caused are daunting,\" though fixable. Here's what the report discovered:    💻 AI can help students learn how to read and write. It has been found to be most effective when supplementing, rather than replacing, the efforts of a teacher.💻 Students increasingly offloading their own thinking onto the technology can lead to the kind of cognitive decline more commonly associated with aging brains.💻 An issue with kids' overuse of AI is that the technology has been designed to reinforce users' beliefs, which can be a concern when it comes to developing social-emotional skills.   Explore these recommendations to help harness the benefits of AI without exposing children to the risks that the technology currently poses.

Body dissatisfaction is increasing among young people, and it is starting to impact more boys, according to clinicians, including Dr. Jason Nagata. This developing trend challenges a long-held tendency in medicine that associates body image concerns mainly with girls. Some teenage boys striving for muscularity like their social media idols can develop compulsive, dangerous gym and diet habits. Nagata says negative body image attitudes in boys often stem from the feeling that they aren't muscular enough. A small portion of those young men develop an obsession with getting bigger and more muscular, also known as bigorexia.    🏋️‍♂️ Bigorexia was first described in a 1993 case report, but it has remained relatively understudied until recently.🏋️‍♂️ The three major pressures that contribute to the rise of muscle dysmorphia and men's desire to build muscle are family, peers and the media.🏋️‍♂️Nagata estimated that a third of teenage boys in the U.S. try to bulk up. However, the lack of awareness of the condition makes it harder to pin down how many develop bigorexia.   \n   3 things to know before you go   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                This screengrab from video provided by NASA TV shows the SpaceX Dragon capsule departing from the International Space Station shortly after undocking with four NASA Crew-11 members inside on Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026.\n                \n                    AP/NASA\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        AP/NASA\n    \n\n   \n   NASA's Crew-11 splashed down in the Pacific Ocean off San Diego in their SpaceX Dragon capsule after a nearly 10-hour journey from the International Space Station, completing the first medical evacuation from the orbiting lab.Let Freedom Ring, an annual signature concert celebrating the life of Martin Luther King Jr., is moving from the Kennedy Center to the Howard Theatre to save money.This week's Far-Flung Postcard takes you to the Hospitaller Fortress in Acre, Israel.

Though a Republican challenge remains in court, the ruling Friday is a boost for Democrats' efforts to counter the Republican-led redistricting President Trump has set off in other states.   Republicans had sued to block the redistricting, alleging that Democrats in the Virginia Legislature did not follow the proper process when they set the special election. A circuit court judge in rural Virginia ruled in Republicans' favor Jan. 27 and Democrats appealed that ruling.   \n   The state supreme court said that it would still hear arguments about the issues and did not grant the Democrats' appeal but the court wrote that has \"no effect on the referendum scheduled for April 21.\" It set deadlines for the submission of arguments after the election.   \n   Democrats took it as a sign they have court backing to hold the referendum. Democratic Speaker of the Virginia House Don Scott said the fact the court let the election proceed while it considers the case, \"tells you everything you need to know.\"   Virginia Republicans see it as a power grab, Democrats point to other states   Republicans say the redistricting is a partisan power grab that will leave their party's representation in Congress lower than the portion of Republican residents.   A top Republican acknowledged the election was on but said the party would continue to fight the case. \"That just shows that we've got to win the referendum and we got to win in court. I think we can do both,\" Virginia House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore said.   Democrats have proposed a new voting map that could help their party win four more seats in the House, converting the state's delegation from six Democrats and five Republicans to 10 Democrats and one Republican.   \n   They argue they are responding in kind to the Republican-led redistricting President Trump has started in other states. At his urging last summer, Texas Republicans redrew that state's voting map to help the GOP win five more seats. Republicans in Missouri and North Carolina also redistricted for a seat in each state.   Democrats in California, in a process similar to the one Virginia has started, won voter approval to counter Texas and draw a new map that could help them win five seats in November.   Overall, Republicans still lead the redistricting scramble by a couple seats and Virginia's new map could still be followed by Republicans in Florida tilting some seats their way in April.   Trump's agenda for the last two years of his term could hinge on Republicans maintaining their narrow lead in the House of Representatives, which would stave off possible Democratic efforts to block his policies and launch investigations into his administration.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Steve Inskeep asks Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona about the fight over funding for the Department of Homeland Security.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Arizona Senator Ruben Gallego was in that hearing and also voted against DHS funding at this time. Senators then left town, so we can expect a partial shutdown tonight. Senator Gallego is at the Munich Security Conference. Welcome to the program.RUBEN GALLEGO: Thanks for having me.INSKEEP: What happens tonight to the Coast Guard, to the TSA at the airports, the cybersecurity agency, among other things?GALLEGO: Nothing right now. Many are still fully funded for a couple weeks, and they'll continue doing their work. And in the meantime, we're going to continue trying to find a solution.INSKEEP: Are you saying, then, that missing this deadline is effectively no big deal?GALLEGO: Everything is a big deal when you're dealing with uncertainty of funding. But, you know, the one thing that we can't do is to rush to fund a government entity such as ICE and Border Patrol that killed two Americans in 2 1/2 weeks. So we have to do this right, and we have to make sure that, you know, we're doing it in the best interests of this country.INSKEEP: Well, let's talk that through. This is, of course, a debate over restrictions on immigration agents. There's been a lot of criticism of immigration agents in Minnesota. At the same time, you're in a state, Arizona, where I've talked with voters. People do want immigration enforcement, border enforcement. Do you think that voters are going to sustain you on this issue as you head into the fall elections?GALLEGO: Yes, because voters, I think, understand the nuanced position that they want. They want border security. They want immigration enforcement. They want professional immigration enforcement. That's not what they're seeing right now. That's not what they're seeing in Los Angeles. That's not what they saw in Minnesota. It's not what they're seeing all the time on TV, where you have ICE agents, border agents, Border Patrol agents acting in a manner that is, you know, unprofessional. You know, people are used to trained, professional law enforcement in their towns, and what they're seeing is quite the opposite. And I think that's why you're seeing people that are, you know, still in the position that they want immigration enforcement but not liking the type of action they're seeing within our cities.INSKEEP: As I understand it, you're not saying to abolish ICE, but you're calling to tear it down. What do you mean?GALLEGO: Well, it's pretty simple. You know, at the core, ICE is absolutely rotten right now. It is being run by Stephen Miller, and he is, you know, basically putting some of the worst elements into ICE. And so what does that look like? You know, you're hiring a lot of people that are not properly trained for a mission that is very sensitive. You're hiring more people than the mission requires. You're having them have more rights than most law enforcement has ever needed, such as being able to avoid warrants, being able to detain Americans. You know, they're about to create about eight to 10 massive warehouses to house, you know, tens of thousands of humans in one spot one day. When this period is done with Donald Trump, we can't have that same type of setup.You know, we're always going to have an immigration enforcement force. Every country has an immigration enforcement force. But it has to be rightsized to the mission that we want that, you know, respects human rights, that is also, you know, really geared to where the country wants to go when it comes to immigration enforcement. That's professional immigration...INSKEEP: Yeah.GALLEGO: ...Enforcement and border control, not the suppression that we're seeing in cities right now.INSKEEP: Senator, I want to ask about another issue here because you represent the state of Arizona, where Nancy Guthrie was apparently kidnapped. We've been following that disappearance, of course - Savannah Guthrie's mom. We've seen doorbell camera video of an armed man on her porch. I'd like to know, are you in touch with the family here or with authorities, and what are you hearing?GALLEGO: We're in touch with authorities. You know, obviously, this is a horrible situation. We pray for the safe return of the Guthrie mother. And, you know, it is just shocking, obviously, to our community down in Tucson. It's a safe community. It is a community that really does take care of each other. And I really hope that, you know, we have a solution there. And it is my goal to make sure that the federal government is doing everything it can to make sure - and using every leverage they can and every technology they can to make sure that she gets home safely.INSKEEP: Fox News is alleging, reporting, that the FBI is having a conflict with local authorities over sharing evidence and who gets what part of the investigation. Do you have any understanding of that?GALLEGO: I don't, but I really hope - yeah, I really don't. But I hope that there is an understanding that this is not the time for turf wars. It's time for - to be professional, share information. And the goal is obviously to get, you know, her safe and to hold the men or women accountable for what they did.INSKEEP: Senator Ruben Gallego is a Democrat from Arizona. Thanks for your time.GALLEGO: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

U.S. District Judge Manish Shah stopped the cuts from taking effect for 14 days, saying in his order that the states \"have shown that they would suffer irreparable harm from the agency action.\" That will keep grant money flowing from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to state and city health departments and their partner organizations while the challenge proceeds.   \n   The first batch of grants could have been pulled Thursday if the judge had not intervened, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said.   The Department of Health and Human Services said the grants are being terminated because they do not reflect CDC priorities, which were revised last year to align with the administration's shift away from health equity, the idea that certain populations may need additional support to eliminate health disparities.   Much of the money helped cities fight the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, especially among gay and bisexual men, adolescents and ethnic minorities.   \n   Federal health officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the judge's order.   Officials in the four states are among Trump's strongest political foes and view the cuts as retaliation for opposing his immigration enforcement crackdown. All have been targets of other federal cuts, including for food assistance programs, child care subsidies and electric vehicle infrastructure.   Their lawsuit, led by Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, argues that the health care cuts violate the Constitution by imposing retroactive conditions on funding that Congress already awarded.   \"Targeting four Democrat-run states that are standing up to his completely unrelated immigration policies is a transparent attempt to bully us into compliance,\" Raoul said. \"The president may be playing politics with critical public health funding, including more than $100 million to Illinois, but our residents are the ones who pay the price.\"   \n   The attorneys general say the loss of funding would force them to lay off hundreds of public health workers.   Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said they will seek to extend the judge's pause for the duration of the lawsuit.   Courts have temporarily blocked similar efforts by the Trump administration, including a plan to cut off billions for child care subsidies and other programs for low-income families in the four states, plus New York.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Steve Inskeep asks Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., about the lingering impact of the federal immigration crackdown in Minnesota.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Senator Amy Klobuchar represents Minnesota and is also seeking the Democratic nomination for governor there, and she is on the line. Senator, welcome back.AMY KLOBUCHAR: Well, thanks, Steve. Great to be on.INSKEEP: Governor Walz there spoke of economic ruin for people in Minnesota, and he said the government has to, quote, \"fix what they broke.\" The idea there, I think, is that the federal government damaged people's lives and they should pay. Should they?KLOBUCHAR: Yes. Let's start out with the loved ones of Alex Pretti and Renee Good. There are ongoing investigations - one state, one combined federal-state - for these outrageous killings of two innocent American citizens. Those cases are ongoing, and we need the feds to allow complete access to investigatory evidence to the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. That's the first thing and most obvious.Secondly, there has been so much money spent on this. That $75 billion that they put into ICE that tripled their budget that made them bigger than the FBI was spent on this invasion. You look at what it was every week. One estimate is $18 million American taxpayers were paying every week, 9 million on compensation for border control and ICE, 4.5 million for the lodging. So all of that is a question of values. Is that how you want to spend your money, American taxpayers? My answer is no.And then there is the economic costs and the cost of the overtime for the police, not just in Minneapolis, in suburban police departments, rural police departments. So obviously, we will and they will be seeking compensation for all the overtime, all the extra time. And then, of course, there will be civil lawsuits about the violations of rights of people being racially profiled. Among elders, door rammed in, thrown into a car in his underwear, driven around for an hour only for them to find out, oh, we got the wrong guy. He's perfectly innocent. The man we are trying to get has been in prison for years.INSKEEP: So you're telling me that lawsuits are likely here.KLOBUCHAR: Certainly.INSKEEP: OK. I want to ask about another aspect of this. People sometimes have been talking of preserving evidence so that people who violated the rights of citizens can be prosecuted in a future administration. You were a prosecutor in Minneapolis. Can you talk me through that scenario? What would it require to preserve evidence and prepare for prosecutions three years from now?KLOBUCHAR: Well, a lot of this will have to do, of course, about what the cases are about and statute of limitations, things like this. But the feds...INSKEEP: Let's say the shootings of the two U.S. citizens.KLOBUCHAR: OK. The feds can't destroy that evidence. A federal judge in Minnesota appointed by Donald Trump issued a ruling that they could not destroy that evidence. So you will have evidence that should be there, and then you have the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension simply wanting access to that evidence because, in the case of Renee Good, they are actually doing a parallel investigation with the attorney general of Minnesota and the county attorney to look at that because that investigation, if you remember, got closed down by the feds. So they are seeking that evidence right now.INSKEEP: So you believe it would be possible to prosecute people three years from now?KLOBUCHAR: Yes, depending on statute of limitations. But I believe they're going to be doing it sooner than that on a state basis, and possibly on a federal basis in the case of the Alex Pretti case. And then there's also going to be civil lawsuits.INSKEEP: OK. You think that there might actually be a good-faith investigation on the federal side?KLOBUCHAR: There has to be a good-faith investigation.INSKEEP: We should note, also, we are on the verge of a DHS shutdown, a Homeland Security shutdown, and it is over this dispute over new rules for immigration agents. It doesn't sound like you and the Senate got very close at all to an agreement on this.KLOBUCHAR: Well, this was expected. Most of the government, the vast majority of the government is funded because we had an agreement. The one part that isn't, Homeland Security. Our belief is ICE should be separated from TSA. Those parts should be funded. We should have a separate vote on that, a negotiation on ICE with much needed reform and, in my mind, a reduction in all the funding they got. It was completely out of hand. They have too much money. That's a lot of this. But they need training. They need requirements on body cameras. They need to have to follow police conduct rules. They need to follow the Fourth Amendment on search and seizure, have judicial warrants. The list is endless because this was basically a roving gang of ill-trained officers.INSKEEP: And...KLOBUCHAR: And it has to stop. But Minnesotans stood together, stared down ICE, never blinked. And that is why today - we have now learned from the announcement yesterday that ICE is leaving Minnesota.INSKEEP: OK. Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who's also a candidate for governor there. Thanks very much for your time, as always.KLOBUCHAR: Thanks, Steve.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

    "body": "\n      A stopgap bill to temporarily fund the Department of Homeland Security expires Friday night. DHS could be without funding for days, as the House and Senate are expected to be in recess next week.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Funding for the Department of Homeland Security expires at the end of the day.STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  The Senate failed on Thursday to advance a spending bill that would have funded DHS through the end of September. Democrats have vowed not to support any bill without major changes to immigration enforcement. Here's Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHUCK SCHUMER: Today's strong vote was a shot across the bow to Republicans. Democrats will not support a blank check for chaos.INSKEEP: In a moment, we speak with Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego. First, the facts.FADEL: NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt joins us to talk through all this. Good morning, Barbara.BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Good morning.FADEL: So is this one of those days where the clock is ticking down to a shutdown and then there's a last-minute deal?SPRUNT: You know, I don't think so this time. Both sides seem pretty far apart still. Some Democratic demands do have bipartisan support, like requiring body cameras for officers. But there are other proposals that Republicans have pushed back on, like having officers remove their masks. So I think it's going to be a holding pattern while both parties keep negotiating.FADEL: OK. So a shutdown, though, doesn't mean there won't be money for ICE, right?SPRUNT: That's right. A shutdown here does not mean a shutdown of ICE. And that's because the agency got over $70 billion in separate funds from Congress over the summer as part of Republicans' massive spending and tax bill. So other agencies within the DHS will be affected by a shutdown, like TSA and FEMA.FADEL: Now, we saw top officials from ICE and Customs and Border Protection testifying before the Senate yesterday. But Kristi Noem, the head of DHS, wasn't there, right?SPRUNT: That's right, and her absence was mentioned a few times. Several senators said they want her to testify before the Homeland Security Committee. She's actually set to testify before a different committee come March. And you might remember that almost immediately after officers shot and killed Alex Pretti, Noem described him as a domestic terrorist, and she later said that she got that information from Border Patrol agents on the ground. But yesterday, CBP Commissioner Rodney Scott told the committee he never described Pretti as a terrorist, nor was he aware of anyone in his agency saying that. And he said he couldn't speculate as to why she would say that.FADEL: Interesting. So he's directly contradicting what Noem said. What else stood out to you in the hearing?SPRUNT: Well, we learned some important numbers. ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons said that there's been more than three dozen internal investigations into allegations of excessive use of force by its agents in the last year. Eighteen have been closed, 19 pending and one referred for further action, although he didn't say which incident that was. And another thing that stood out to me, you know, senators spent a lot of time trying to clarify the use-of-force policies - how officers are trained in de-escalation. And committee Chairman Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, played a video of Pretti and officers. And he paused the video several times, stopping to show officers pushing a nearby woman to the ground, spraying Pretti in the face, surrounding him.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RAND PAUL: I see nothing here, I mean, not even a hint of something that was aggressive on his part. Everything was retreat. He's over in the street. He retreats. He retreats. The woman is pushed to the ground. He tries to assist the woman to get up. He's violently sprayed, and it just continues.SPRUNT: Now, the officials, in response, wouldn't give specifics about this. They said it's an ongoing investigation. They said the body camera footage would eventually be released. But Paul made a point of saying that ICE and CBP have to admit their mistakes in order to restore the public's trust.FADEL: That's NPR's Barbara Sprunt.

Kennedy Jr. hasn't held true to many of the promises he made while appealing to U.S. senators concerned about the longtime anti-vaccine activist's plans for the nation's care.   Kennedy squeaked through a narrow Senate vote to be confirmed as head of the Department of Health and Human Services only after making a number of public and private guarantees about how he would handle vaccine funding and recommendations as secretary.   Here's a look at some of the promises Kennedy made during his confirmation process.   \n   The childhood vaccine schedule   In two hearings in January 2025, Kennedy repeatedly assured senators that he supported childhood vaccines, noting that all his children were vaccinated.   Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., grilled Kennedy about the money he has made in the private sector from lawsuits against vaccine makers and accused him of planning to profit from potential future policies making it easier to sue.   \"Kennedy can kill off access to vaccines and make millions of dollars while he does it,\" Warren said during the Senate Finance Committee hearing. \"Kids might die, but Robert Kennedy can keep cashing in.\"   Warren's statement prompted an assurance by Kennedy.   \"Senator, I support vaccines,\" he said. \"I support the childhood schedule. I will do that.\"   Days later, Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a Republican and chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, declared that Kennedy had pledged to maintain existing vaccine recommendations if confirmed.    \n\n    \n        \n    \n        \n                    YouTube\n                \n        \n   Cassidy, a physician specializing in liver diseases and a vocal supporter of vaccination, had questioned Kennedy sharply in a hearing about his views on shots.   \"If confirmed, he will maintain the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' recommendations without changes,\" Cassidy said during a speech on the Senate floor explaining his vote for Kennedy.   A few months after he was confirmed, Kennedy fired all the incumbent members of the vaccine advisory panel, known as ACIP, and appointed new members, including several who, like him, oppose some vaccines. The panel's recommendations soon changed drastically.   \n   Last month, the CDC removed its universal recommendations for children to receive seven immunizations: those protecting against respiratory syncytial virus, meningococcal disease, flu, COVID-19, hepatitis A, hepatitis B and rotavirus. The move followed a memorandum from the White House calling on the CDC to cull the schedule.   Now, those vaccines, which researchers estimate have prevented thousands of deaths and millions of illnesses, are recommended by the CDC only for children at high risk of serious illness or after consultation between doctors and parents.   In response to questions about Kennedy's actions on vaccines over the past year, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the secretary \"continues to follow through on his commitments\" to Cassidy.   \"As part of those commitments, HHS accepted Chairman Cassidy's numerous recommendations for key roles at the agency, retained particular language on the CDC website, and adopted ACIP recommendations,\" Nixon added. \"Secretary Kennedy talks to the chairman at a regular clip.\"   Cassidy and his office have repeatedly rebuffed questions about whether Kennedy, since becoming secretary, has broken the commitments he made to the senator.   Vaccine funding axed   Weeks after Kennedy took over the federal health department, the CDC pulled back $11 billion in COVID-era grants that local health departments were using to fund vaccination programs, among other initiatives.   That happened after Kennedy pledged during his confirmation hearings not to undermine vaccine funding. Kennedy replied, \"Yes\" when Cassidy asked him directly: \"Do you commit that you will not work to impound, divert, or otherwise reduce any funding appropriated by Congress for the purpose of vaccination programs?\"   A federal judge later ordered HHS to distribute the money.   The National Institutes of Health, part of HHS, also yanked dozens of research grants supporting studies of vaccine hesitancy last year. Kennedy, meanwhile, ordered the cancellation of a half-billion dollars' worth of mRNA vaccine research in August.   \n   A discredited theory about autism   Cassidy said in his floor speech that he received a guarantee from Kennedy that the CDC's website would not remove statements explaining that vaccines do not cause autism.   Technically, Kennedy kept his promise not to remove the statements. The website still says that vaccines do not cause autism.   But late last year, new statements sprang up on the same webpage, baselessly casting doubt on vaccine safety. \"The claim 'vaccines do not cause autism' is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism,\" the page on autism now misleadingly reads.   The webpage also states that the public has largely ignored studies showing that vaccines do cause autism. That is false. Over decades of research, scientific studies have repeatedly concluded that there is no link between vaccines and autism.   A controversial 1998 study that captured global attention did link the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine to autism. It was retracted for being fraudulent — though not until a decade after it was published, during which there were sharp declines in U.S. vaccination rates.

Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin says what they've learned is that they have only scratched the surface.JAMIE RASKIN: The ones they're not releasing are the ones that are piquing my interest the most. And we've probably been able to look at less than 1% of them.CHANG: Lawmakers argue that the already difficult process of combing through the millions of files is now being hindered. Joining us now is NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales, who's been following all of this. Hi, Claudia.CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa.CHANG: OK, so I've been hearing lawmakers say that they've been under surveillance, basically, by the Justice Department when they're searching through all of these files, like they're being spied on. Can you explain? What is happening?GRISALES: Well, lawmakers are already facing an arcane process when they try to view these records. They have to set an appointment at the Justice Department to get a time slot. And there's only four terminals set up to search through the 3.5 million records released so far. And they can't take in any electronics or any staff. And yesterday, Attorney General Pam Bondi was carrying a binder at a House oversight hearing with a printed list of members who've conducted these searches and the specific documents that they looked at. I talked to New Mexico Democrat Teresa Leger Fernandez about this.TERESA LEGER FERNANDEZ: This is exactly why this whole process is flawed and a sham. And it is an outrage that they are spying on Congress.GRISALES: And she says DOJ should be investigating the Epstein case, not lawmakers who are looking through these documents in controlled searches. And she said when she did look at the files herself, she found names of men that should have been released long ago.CHANG: Interesting. OK, so even though there have been these roadblocks, do we know if these lawmakers are uncovering any new revelations?GRISALES: Yes, they have. The authors of the Epstein Transparency Act - this is Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie and California Democrat Ro Khanna - they've been a key part of forcing the release this week of names of men and co-conspirators that were redacted on some of these files. Ultimately, what a lot of these lawmakers want is what they've heard from the Epstein survivors and what they want, which is a release of the full list of men who they believe were part of this sex trafficking network - and accountability. Here's Vermont Democrat Becca Balint.BECCA BALINT: They really want us to help them change the culture, and we made that commitment to them. How long do we follow this? Until we feel like the work is in a good place. And we're nowhere near that right now.GRISALES: So it's clear they're playing a really big role here.CHANG: Yeah. OK, so then what are some of the other challenges that these lawmakers are facing as they're trying to review these files?GRISALES: Well, they passed a law requiring the release of these files nearly three months ago now. Lawmakers say this process has been riddled with pushback from President Trump and his administration. And until they change their posture or there are changes in leadership, people will not be held accountable. Here's North Carolina (ph) Republican Nancy Mace this morning speaking with our colleagues on Morning Edition.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)NANCY MACE: And it's going to be up to us in a bipartisan manner in Congress to have the courage and the bravery to bring these people before America and let them answer for what actually happened.CHANG: OK, so what happens next, Claudia?GRISALES: Well, lawmakers say it's going to be an uphill process. It's going to take a lot of time. They're going to keep searching the records that have been released. But we know the Justice Department has not released 3 million records they say are duplicates, but lawmakers are not buying that. So we should expect them to put a lot more pressure on Attorney General Bondi, Trump and his administration to make sure everyone who should be held accountable is.CHANG: That is NPR's Claudia Grisales.

The pardons were announced by White House pardon czar Alice Marie Johnson. Ex-NFL players Joe Klecko, Nate Newton, Jamal Lewis, Travis Henry and the late Billy Cannon were granted the clemency.   \n   \"As football reminds us, excellence is built on grit, grace, and the courage to rise again. So is our nation,\" Johnson wrote on the social media site X, as she thanked Trump for his \"continued commitment to second chances.\"   Johnson said Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones \"personally\" shared the news with Newton, who won three Super Bowls with the team.   The White House did not return a request for comment Thursday night on why Trump, an avid sports fan, pardoned the players.   \n   Klecko, a former star for the New York Jets, pleaded guilty to perjury after lying to a federal grand jury that was investigating insurance fraud. A defensive lineman, Klecko was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2023. He was a two-time Associated Press All-Pro player and a four-time Pro Bowler.   Newton, an offensive lineman, pleaded guilty to a federal drug trafficking charge after authorities discovered $10,000 in his pickup truck as well as 175 pounds of marijuana in an accompanying car driven by another man. Newton was a two-time All-Pro player and six-time Pro Bowler.   \n   Lewis, formerly of the Baltimore Ravens and the Cleveland Browns, pleaded guilty in a drug case in which he used a cellphone to try to set up a drug deal not long after he was a top pick in the 2000 NFL draft. Lewis, a running back, was named an All-Pro once and was a one-time Pro Bowler. He was named the 2003 AP Offensive Player of the Year.   Henry, who played for the Denver Broncos, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to traffic cocaine for financing a drug ring that moved the drug between Colorado and Montana. He was a running back for three teams and a one-time Pro Bowler.   \n   And Cannon — who played with the Houston Oilers, Oakland Raiders and Kansas City Chiefs — admitted to counterfeiting in the mid-1980s after a series of bad investments and debts left him broke.   \n   Cannon was a two-time All-Pro player and a two-time Pro Bowler. Cannon also won the 1959 Heisman Trophy while starring for Louisiana State University, where he had one of the most memorable plays in college football history: an 89-yard punt return for a touchdown against Ole Miss. He died in 2018.\n",

It would not be the first time recently that lawmakers pledged to find consensus only for negotiations to fall apart.   A month ago, Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, was projecting confidence that a bipartisan group of lawmakers was nearing a deal to restore lapsed health insurance subsidies.   The enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies expired at the end of last year, despite a majority of Americans in favor of Congress renewing them, according to polling from the nonprofit KFF.   \n   \"We're in the red zone,\" Moreno told reporters. \"But that does not mean a touchdown. It could mean a 95-yard fumble.\"   In the end, there was no touchdown. Moreno told NPR last week that the talks fizzled. He blamed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for shutting them down in order to keep pummeling Republicans over premium costs.   \"Shouldn't we be here trying to figure out how to solve problems rather than trying to score political points for the purposes of the next election?\" Moreno asked.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, speaks to members of the media at the U.S. Capitol on January 13, 2026. Until recently, Moreno was projecting confidence that a deal to restore lapsed health insurance subsidies was in reach.\n                \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Democrats dispute that characterization, saying Republicans blew up the effort by inserting anti-abortion language in a provision on health savings accounts.   Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., says the effort was doomed to fail — not because of a lack of compromise but because Democrats lost leverage when a few voted to end the shutdown last fall.   \"I was pretty confident the minute we gave up that we weren't going to get it,\" Murphy said.   A bipartisan agreement to address ICE tactics has yet to materialize    Congress' ability to act is again being tested, this time by the aggressive actions of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agents in Minnesota and elsewhere.   As with the subsidies, public outcry pushed a number of Republicans and Democrats to pledge to do something — in this case, reining in enforcement tactics. Top lawmakers initially signaled optimism that they could find common ground on topics such as requiring that officers wear body cameras.   \n   But within days, that rosiness dissipated. Now Democrats are again threatening to withhold their votes for the measure, risking a shutdown of the department after Friday, unless Republican lawmakers and the White House agree to the reforms they want.   Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has repeatedly blamed Democrats, saying they imposed an unrealistic timeline and then dawdled before producing a laundry list of nonstarters, like banning agents from wearing masks or requiring judicial warrants for enforcement operations in homes.   Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., called the White House's initial response to their demands insufficient and continue to insist that their proposals are reasonable and targeted.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, enters the U.S. Capitol on January 27, 2026. Collins has been a key negotiator in government funding talks, and says the passage of appropriations bills is evidence that Congress can still do hard things.\n                \n                    Heather Diehl/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Heather Diehl/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Asked why bipartisan negotiations keep crumbling, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine., who has participated in negotiations on the subsidies and immigration, said Congress does successfully collaborate, like negotiating and passing bipartisan government funding bills worth more than $1 trillion.   \"I don't know how you could possibly describe that as crumbling,\" Collins told NPR. \"That's Congress reasserting its power of the purse.\"   Little incentive to compromise   Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat who represented North Dakota in the Senate from 2013 through 2018, spent hours in rooms with centrist senators like Collins trying to resolve a standoff over the debt ceiling.   She says bipartisan negotiations have always been a high-wire act, particularly amid a national crisis.   \"When the shock wears off, then all of a sudden everyone goes back to their corners,\" Heitkamp said.   A gang of eight lawmakers tried, but failed, to pass comprehensive immigration reform in 2013. Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Tim Scott, R-S.C., made progress on policing reform after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, but came up empty-handed.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A gang of eight lawmakers, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., tried but failed, to pass comprehensive immigration reform in 2013. Above, from left in the gang of eight were, Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Graham, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J.\n                \n                    J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Heitkamp, who until recently directed the University of Chicago's Institute of Politics, says many lawmakers today see even less incentive to compromise as politics becomes more tribal.   \n   \"The base on both sides, their willingness to reward compromise is greatly diminished,\" she said. \"If you look at the Senate of old, there were a lot of egos in that room and a lot of people who made up their own minds, and now what you have is people who are willing to be cogs in the wheel.\"   How inaction diminishes public trust   When Congress promises to act and does not, Heitkamp says, that erodes public trust in the institution's ability to respond to problems.   Sixty-six percent of Americans report having not very much or no trust in Congress, according to a September Gallup survey.   Of the 14 Arizona swing voters who participated in a Feb. 10 online focus group organized by NPR and the Swing Voter Project, only two said they had confidence that Congress would take any action on the immigration-related proposals being discussed.   Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., says she is thinking about public trust as she helps lead the current negotiations on immigration enforcement.   \"Anybody can identify a problem,\" Britt said in an interview. \"We have to be people that are looking for solutions. Treating people with dignity and respect allows you to have tough conversations. I think we owe it to the people we serve to actually find that pathway forward.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., right, speaks with Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.,  during an oversight hearing on May 8, 2025. Britt and Murphy have been key negotiators for their parties in talks around DHS funding.\n                \n                    Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Britt panned Democrats' initial demands last week as a Christmas list, though talks are ongoing and, unlike the fight over the health subsidies, the White House is involved and negotiating directly with Democrats.   Last fall, Britt helped strike a deal with those handful of Democrats who voted to end the 43-day shutdown — including Sen. Tim Kaine.   Kaine, D-Va., says bipartisan action is still possible, but the reality is that on the most fraught issues, it is extremely difficult.   \"On health care, on immigration, the parties are in fundamentally very different places,\" he said. \"And so that means I go into any negotiation on a topic like this: high hopes, low expectations.\"\n",

Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) often finds himself at odds with his party.   He's unapologetically pro-Israel at a time when fewer members of Democrats are. He spent the fall railing against the federal government shutdown and he, along with a few other Senate Democrats, broke from the party and struck a deal with Republicans.   \"It's always been wrong for us to shut the government down,\" he told NPR. \"Rightly, [Democrats] criticize the Republicans when they've shut the government down. It's wrong. It's reckless.\"   \n   In an interview with All Things Considered host Scott Detrow, Fetterman posed a question to his critics: \"What exactly am I guilty of?\"   \"I suffered from depression and I made a recovery and I won an election,\" he said. \"And I went on to be an unapologetic supporter of Israel. And I happen to think that we have to have a secure border and I think it's wrong to shut our government down.\"   Fetterman spoke with NPR in a conversation tied to his new memoir, Unfettered, about his 2022 Senate campaign that saw him suffer a stroke and fall into a deep depression.   A video of the unedited interview will be available to watch later today. The interview text below has been edited for length and clarity.      Interview highlights   Scott Detrow: This is a book about an election cycle where you suffered a stroke and you struggled with serious depression.   Sen. John Fetterman: Profound depression. Honestly, I know millions of Americans suffer from it.   And when you hear the expression that you can't get out of your bed — that's true.   Detrow: Last time I interviewed you, you had just returned to the Senate from Walter Reed [National Military Medical Center]. It was a pretty emotional conversation. You were still processing your treatment and what came next.   \n   I wanted to ask a little bit about that because there's parts of this book where it seems like you're saying that you've, at times, regretted being so open about your mental health struggles. Is that accurate?   Fetterman: No. I don't regret it.   But people have been willing to use it or to create an impression that's just not true. And it's an honest conversation because a lot of people have had those things. And I've had a lot of people reach out to me over the years since and it's an honor to speak to people, to their experience, because sometimes people can feel alone.   \n   And I've always wanted to make that conversation as simple as it can to just stay in this game. Because I've had people in my life make the decision to leave. And that's not a fail, they didn't fail. But that's a decision that they can't come back [from]. And how heartbreaking that is and how sad that is.   Detrow: You're talking about suicide.   Fetterman: Yeah, absolutely.   It's not a weakness. And that's [I want to be] a voice saying, \"hey, look, that's a lie. I don't know what your recovery looks like, but as long as you stay in it, I promise you you will get better.\"   Detrow: I want to ask about Israel. You were very out front about [supporting Israel]. You never changed your tune. I'm wondering, as the Israeli attacks and bombing of Gaza continued, were there any points where you second guessed the place that you had staked yourself?   Fetterman: [Israel] had an opportunity to take out the Iranian nuclear facilities. I was the only Democrat that supported that. I was actually charging for those things. You know, that comes from Trump. Well, then I happen to agree with it. And now, can you imagine if they would have acquired a nuclear weapon there? And now what is behind this constant violence there? Is it Israel or it's because Iran funding these proxies like Hamas and Hezbollah doing these kinds of terrible things. And that war would have ended when you sent back all the hostages.   \n   Detrow: So, at no point in the conflict did the balance shift for you as you thought about this in the context of 69,000 Palestinians dead?   Fetterman: No one breaks down how many actual Hamas fighters or other people that were involved in that. So, we're not really sure.   The only time you see members in Hamas is when they're handing over funerals and rallying. Otherwise, they embed themselves in the civilians and they were forced to fight a war through an urban situation.   \n   Why can't people condemn putting tunnels under hospitals and embedding themselves in where civilians are? And you know, because they can't fight a real war. So, that's why they use civilians as human shields. And that's the tragedy.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Ailsa Chang talks with Republican strategist Mike Ricci about the deal to end the government shutdown.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  The Senate is now voting on a bill that would fund the government through January, ending the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. Late last night, a handful of Senate Democrats broke with their party and sided with Republicans on this bill. For more, we're going to turn now to Republican strategist Mike Ricci. He worked with several congressional Republicans, including former speakers John Boehner and Paul Ryan, and he was on the Hill for government shutdowns in 2013 and 2018 going into 2019. I spoke with Ricci before the Senate vote today.CHANG: OK. So we love to say government shutdowns feel like a movie that just keeps on...MIKE RICCI: (Laughter).CHANG: ...Replaying. Has this shutdown felt any different to you?RICCI: Well, to your point, you know, you go into these trying to have a sense of how they'll end. And your job is to kind of know kind of how to get to the ending, the denouement, if you will. And this shutdown, there just never was a sense of, you know, how are they going to land this plane? How are they going to stick this landing?CHANG: Yeah.RICCI: And, you know, instead, we got kind of this underwhelming, you know, exit last night and tonight. They're kind of rushing out of there. So it's hard to believe that after such a long ordeal that it's happening so abruptly.CHANG: I was going to ask you what you thought of the deal. You find it totally underwhelming?RICCI: Well, I think, again, you know, perception is destiny for these leaders. And so you want to - if you're going to go into a big fight like this, you want to have a sense of - you know, there's a lot of showmanship involved, and you want to sell the deal. And you want to - you know, you can win by losing and saying, look, we got more than we thought we could, than Republicans thought we could. And, you know, instead, it was kind of a handful of Senate Democrats, nobody in leadership really, at a press conference last night instead of, you know, leadership's Chuck Schumer, especially, kind of dictating the pace of things. And again, it's just very much underwhelming after such a long ordeal.CHANG: Yeah. Well, let's talk about blame because this shutdown...RICCI: Sure.CHANG: ...It's another example of how both parties blame each other for some problem.RICCI: Yeah.CHANG: Who do you see getting the blame here? - because, yes, Republicans are in control of Congress, but, you know, here's a small faction of Democrats breaking away from their leaders to make this deal. Who do you think is going to be held responsible for the last several weeks?RICCI: Well, I think I'm going to punt a bit and say that we're kind of in a runoff, if you will, here to see what happens in the next 30 days or so with the health care subsidies. And if Democrats can figure out - 'cause they said they would get a vote on these subsidies. And so if everything is about the cost of living now, as we saw in last week's elections, and you can frame the next 30 days around health care and around the cost of living going into the holidays, then Democrats have a chance to shift the blame back to President Trump and Republicans.But if this becomes about the division among Democrats that we're seeing play out on social media, once again, as we have time and again, then, you know, Democrats will miss an opportunity here to really keep Republicans on the defensive. So, you know, I think there's going to be a bit of an overtime period here, if you will, to really see how it lands. And, you know, obviously, we didn't see the worst of it with SNAP benefits or even with, you know, air travel.CHANG: Yeah...RICCI: But...CHANG: ...With Thanksgiving coming up.RICCI: ...You know, that probably would have been where the blame really would have set in, but perhaps they've cut that off here at the pass.CHANG: Well, I'm asking about blame because blame obviously most matters when there's an election. How much do you...RICCI: Yeah.CHANG: ...Think voters will remember this fight a year from now when they're voting in the midterms?RICCI: Very little.CHANG: (Laughter).RICCI: I was part of the shutdown in October 2013, and I thought it was going to be the end of everything. And we won the next election 13 months later. You know, we could - if you - if I - you know, you could point out things that happened two, three months ago that you forgot almost happened. So I think very little, but it does affect the dynamics of how these parties, you know, get together, how they have a coherent message for the midterms. You know, a lot of Democrats are going to be having conversations in the next few days of whether Chuck Schumer should still be, you know, one of their leaders, and that obviously takes away time and energy from...CHANG: Yeah.RICCI: ...Fighting in the election.CHANG: Well, last question for you. I mean, obviously, we're seeing fault lines among Democrats, at least in the Senate. What kind of tensions are you seeing among Republicans right now?RICCI: So, you know, Speaker Mike Johnson took the extraordinary step of keeping the House away now for, I think, almost 50 days, and bringing them back, that'll be a bit of a - there'll be a bit of venting and a bit of decompression there. And we'll see how much Republicans resented that and how much, you know, they're able to get back together on the same page. Again, Democrats kind of fighting with each other probably convinces them that they got a good win here, and maybe that's a way to move past last week's elections. But those first 24, 48 hours, when the House comes back, you're going to want to watch closely what members are saying and how much theatrics there are towards the speaker there.CHANG: That is Republican strategist Mike Ricci. Thank you very much.RICCI: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

John Fetterman, D-Penn., about his vote to end the longest government shutdown in history.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman was one of a handful of Democrats who voted to reopen the federal government late last night. It's not a surprise. Fetterman has been against his party's gamble since the beginning. He has said he wants to extend the health care subsidies at the heart of the impasse, but not at the cost of cutting SNAP benefits or the other consequences of the shutdown. Fetterman paid a visit to NPR's D.C. studio late this morning. I asked him about why he's been at odds with the majority of his party on the shutdown.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)DETROW: You called it a failure when you put out a statement last night, you know, leading up to this vote to begin the process of reopening the government. You've been clear that that's been your point of view all along. Walk us through why. Why were Democratic leaders and other members in your party wrong to push forward with this?JOHN FETTERMAN: Well, we were - as a committed Democrat, it's always been wrong for us to shut the government down. Rightly, they criticize the Republicans when they've shut the government down all the time. It's wrong. It's reckless. You can pull up all the quotes that would confirm that. So now that's - you know, now it might be us driving it. That makes it wrong too.I absolutely support extending those tax credits. But for me, the kinds of chaos and holding our government hostage is unacceptable. And you can have priorities, but it's wrong to go shutting our government down, and that's where we're at.DETROW: I wanted to get your response to some of the thinking from other members of the party. I want to quote you something from Ezra Klein, the New York Times columnist who isn't in Congress, but I think he kind of represents a lot of the mainstream thinking here. And the quote is this - \"Shutdowns are an opportunity to make an argument, and the country was just starting to pay attention. If Trump wanted to cancel flights over Thanksgiving rather than keep health care costs down, I don't see why Democrats should save him from making his priorities so exquisitely clear. And I worry that Democrats have just taught Trump that they will fold under pressure. That's the kind of lesson he remembers.\"What do you make of that general argument?FETTERMAN: Well, it's just - like, that's actually not a fold. That's realizing that it's the kind of chaos that might care more about the kinds of impacts that it's going to have on 42 million people. Like, if you depend on them to eat, that's not a political game. And it's not a political game, as Mr. Klein seems to refer to it as, you know? It's really about our bigger priorities.And now, in a longer conversation here, remind us (ph), Democrats designed those tax credits to expire at this year. That's the Democratic Party. That's not something they're taking away. They're saying, we can have a conversation to extend them. And I do hope we should. And I think many of their constituents are going to be impacted too. And that's why I think it's a way forward to find that without dropping our entire country into this kinds of chaos.DETROW: Part of the agreement is that there's a promised vote on these health care subsidies, extending them. How confident are you that actually happens, that gets to the president's desk?FETTERMAN: I do believe John Thune is an honorable man in the arena. And Trump, I would like to remind everyone with the border deal. And I assumed we'd get rolled for that, and we did. And you can't control what Trump's going to decide, ultimately. But for me, it's a choice of do you really want to risk the kinds of mass chaos that we are quickly descending in? And after 40 days, how much longer? And now it's a fact, too, flying is becoming more and more chaotic, and that probably also means dangerous more than it should be. Yes, I want health care, but not to create this kinds of stress in our system.DETROW: That was Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman, who is also out with a new memoir this week. Our wide-ranging conversation continues on that, his place in this party, his health and U.S. policy on the war in Gaza. That's Tuesday on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      The Senate is expected to vote as early as today to approve a spending package that would end the longest federal government shutdown in history.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  The longest government shutdown in U.S. history may be coming to an end.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARRY BLACK: Eternal God, we thank you for the progress we have made on this journey to reopen the government.SUMMERS: That is Barry Black, chaplain of the U.S. Senate, where lawmakers are soon expected to vote to do just that. But that does not mean that the government will reopen immediately. NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas is tracking the latest from Capitol Hill. Hi.SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: Hey, Juana.SUMMERS: So Sam, just start by unpacking the substance of the deal for us. What did the Senate actually agree to?GRINGLAS: At the core is a resolution funding parts of the government through the end of January. The Senate has been voting on a version of that for weeks now. What's new is this stopgap is now paired with three full-year appropriations bills that would fund some agencies, including ones providing food assistance and services for veterans. The package also has a provision to reverse the firings of federal employees during the shutdown. That same section would prevent more layoffs through January 30. Senate Majority Leader John Thune has also promised a vote on expiring health insurance subsidies.SUMMERS: Well, Sam, Congress has been sort of stuck and at this impasse for 41 days now. How did we get to this breakthrough?GRINGLAS: So for weeks, Democrats held out on supporting a Republican-backed funding bill, hoping they could win an extension of those expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies. Democrats won big in the elections last Tuesday. Trump partially blamed the shutdown, and Democrats thought the president, you know, would feel compelled to bring Republicans to the table, but that did not happen. And meanwhile, food assistance benefits were still not flowing, and thousands of flights were being canceled or delayed because of staffing shortages. Talks picked up again among a small bipartisan group of senators, and they emerged Sunday with a deal backed by seven Democrats and one independent who caucuses with them, just enough to let this package advance, meaning each of those votes was crucial.SUMMERS: Not a vote to spare there. I mean, this is far from overwhelming support from Democrats. What have they got to say?GRINGLAS: Well, there's a real conflict here over whether those eight did the right thing. Independent Angus King explained his thinking this way.ANGUS KING: There was zero chance of dealing with the ACA issue as long as the shutdown continued. Now - I don't know - 50/50?GRINGLAS: King said he would take some chance over no chance any day and said the pain of the shutdown was just becoming untenable. But many Democrats are angry that their colleagues relented. This is House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Well, I don't have much to say about those individuals, and they're going to have to explain themselves to their constituents and to the American people.GRINGLAS: Three of those eight senators voting yes are retiring after next year. Meanwhile, the most vulnerable Senate Democrat up for reelection, Jon Ossoff of Georgia, he voted no.SUMMERS: And then, Sam, what happens if this bill gets through the Senate?GRINGLAS: The package now has to pass the House before President Trump can sign it into law. The House, though, has not been in for weeks. But today, Speaker Mike Johnson told members to start making plans to come back.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE JOHNSON: To all my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats in the House, you need to begin right now returning to the Hill. We have to do this as quickly as possible.GRINGLAS: House passage, though, is not a sure thing. It might require some arm-twisting, though Johnson, he projected confidence it will get done.SUMMERS: Sam, last thing, if President Trump ultimately signs this into law, is it finished? Is this the end of the saga?GRINGLAS: No. There are still a lot of questions about that promised health care vote next month, like exactly what will be voted on and will enough Senate Republicans support it? And if they do, will Johnson even bring it up for a vote in the House? And remember, with some of the government is now funded for the next year, much of it is still only funded through the end of January, so Congress could be back at another impasse in just a few weeks.SUMMERS: NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas, thank you.GRINGLAS: Thanks, Juana.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

The measure would fund much of the government through Jan. 30 and provide funding for some agencies through the end of next September.   But the shutdown will not end right away. The U.S. House of Representatives must also pass the legislation, which is not guaranteed, before President Donald Trump can sign it into law.   Seven Democrats and one independent senator voted with nearly every Senate Republican to approve the stopgap funding bill after a more than monthlong impasse that resulted in missed paychecks for millions of federal workers, delayed food assistance benefits and air travel disruptions.   \n   Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was the sole GOP no vote.    Over the weekend, a bipartisan group of senators reached an agreement to end the shutdown after holding a series of on-again, off-again talks over the last several weeks. A procedural vote to advance a funding bill achieved the required 60 votes late Sunday night, setting up Monday's vote.   The funding package includes language to reverse reductions in force of federal employees by the Trump Administration during the shutdown, protections against further layoffs through the end of January, backpay for federal employees and a trio of appropriations bills, including one that will fully fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, through Sept. 30, 2026.   A deal without Democrats' health care demands   But the deal does not include an extension of subsidies for Affordable Care Act health insurance premiums that are set to expire later this year. Most Democrats have refused to vote for a funding measure that did not include a concrete path to preserve the subsidies.   \n   Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Sunday that he would hold a vote by mid-December on a bill of Democrats' choosing to extend the expiring subsidies. Thune has said throughout the shutdown that Republicans would only negotiate on the subsidies once the government was open.   \"This deal guarantees a vote to extend Affordable Care Act premium tax credits, which Republicans weren't willing to do,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., wrote in a statement. \"Lawmakers know their constituents expect them to vote for it, and if they don't, they could very well be replaced at the ballot box by someone who will.\"   \n   But the majority of Senate Democrats disagreed that this was the best deal they could get, doubting that Republicans would agree to extend the subsidies without the pressure of an ongoing shutdown. After Democratic victories on Election Night last week, some senators said it was a mistake to back down.   \n   \"As long as there is still any time left to reverse the MAGA health care hike, I believe we must do everything we can to force Republicans to the negotiating table,\" wrote Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee that negotiated the three full-year funding bills.   The full-year funding measures include money for agriculture, military construction and veterans affairs and the legislative branch. Those are just three of the 12 appropriations bills Congress needs to pass before the continuing resolution would run out again at the end of January.   On to the House   House leadership alerted members Monday morning that they would have 36-hours notice to return to Capitol Hill for a vote. The House has not conducted official business since the chamber passed its version of a continuing resolution in mid-September. While Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has held near-daily press conferences at the Capitol, many rank-and-file have not been in for weeks.   \"At the very moment that they do that final vote, I will call all House members to return as quickly as possible,\" Johnson told reporters Monday and, noting the ongoing shutdown-related air travel delays, told members, \"You need to begin right now returning to the Hill.\"   \n   Moving the measure through the House could require some arm-twisting. Many Democrats have indicated they will not support the deal, and some hard-line Republicans may not be inclined to vote for it either.   But Johnson projected confidence Monday that the measure can pass and said Trump is ready to sign it. The speaker, though, has so far declined to promise an ACA vote in the House should a bill pass the Senate.\n",

Most congressional Democrats were against the deal that eight of the senators, who caucus with them, crossed the aisle to vote and re-open the government.   Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren called the move a \"terrible mistake\"; Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said it was indefensible; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, declared it a \"policy and political disaster.\"   And there were far harsher things said about the deal on social media across the political spectrum of people left of center, not just the most progressive.   \n   Make no mistake: bridging the divide is going to be a significant challenge. But despite the intense blowback, the result in the end might not be all that bad for Democrats in next year's midterm elections.   Consider that affordability was the dominant issue in the off-year elections, where Democrats won sweeping victories. If it's the most important issue next year — and it very likely will be — then Democrats will likely retain the advantage.   What's more, if Republicans do vote against health care subsidy extensions in December — when a promised vote is to take place as part of this shutdown deal — then the GOP will fully own the increased health care costs that come with it.   Democrats could also look like the adults who took the high road, recognizing the very real pain that a lot of people were beginning to feel when President Trump and his administration were beginning to turn the screws on the most vulnerable.   So, Democrats' biggest challenge heading into next year's midterms may be keeping progressives on their side — and fired up to vote — after what many of them are viewing as the latest show of weakness from a party, as they see it, defined by that weakness.   \n   A Democratic vise   Democrats put themselves in a very difficult position from the very beginning of this fight. Any acute observer could have seen this coming — and realize Democrats had nothing but bad options.   Republicans dug in, figuring at least enough Democrats couldn't handle the pain of millions losing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits as well as federal worker furloughs and layoffs.   And they were right.   \"Most of us up here have voted repeatedly with the Democratic strategy,\" Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said. \"But after 40 days, it wasn't going to work.\"   It's hard to \"win\" a fight when one side broadly cares about whether the government is open and working properly and the other thinks government is the problem.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                This combination photo of eight senators who are facing criticism from the Democratic party for their deal to end the government shutdown shows Sen.

John Fetterman, D-Pa., who voted repeatedly to end the shutdown.   Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine, who caucuses with the Democrats, is one of the three Democrats who has also been voting to end the shutdown, said bluntly: \"It wasn't working. It's been six weeks. Republicans made it clear they weren't going to discuss the health care issue, Affordable Care Act tax credits, until the shutdown was over.\"   \"Waiting another week, or another month, wouldn't deliver a better outcome,\" New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said. \"It would only mean more harm for families in New Hampshire and all across the country.\"   Not everyone agrees with that reasoning, including swing-state Sen. Elissa Slotkin from Michigan.   \n   \"I always said it's got to do something concrete on health care,\" she said of an agreement to re-open the government. \"And it's hard to see how that happened.\"   Leadership problems   Democratic leaders also were ostensibly against the deal to reopen the government.   Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer voted no, though there are questions about whether Schumer allowed the senators, who went ahead with the votes, to do so.   None of the senators, who came out in favor of the shutdown deal, are in imminent political jeopardy, given they're not facing reelection next year, and two of them are retiring.   \n   \"The overwhelming majority of Senate Democrats, led by Leader Schumer, are opposing this bill in the Senate,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Monday.   He pointed out that the Trump administration's actions when it comes to federal workers leaves most Democrats \"deeply skeptical\" of their \"intentions.\" And on health care, Republicans, he noted, have not acted in \"good faith,\" given that it's the party that tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act dozens of times.   \"It doesn't change the core problem here,\" Jeffries said of the shutdown deal. \"We need to decisively address the Republican health care crisis on behalf of working-class Americans, everyday Americans and middle-class Americans.\"   But Schumer already faced significant pushback when he abandoned the fight in March and voted to keep the government open. And given the party's movement toward ousting older leaders, the shutdown deal could spell trouble for the 74-year-old New Yorker as a party leader, even if he didn't vote for it.   A changing party – from pragmatism to pugilism in the age of Trump   Schumer is certainly not representative of how the Democratic Party is changing. And the moderates, who signed onto this deal, also very much represent the old guard of the party.   \n   For as much that's made of how much the GOP has changed since Trump came into office — and it has been a lot — the Democrats have changed as well.   Democrats have moved from pragmatism to pugilism. As an example of that, in April of 2017, just after Trump began his first term, an NBC poll found that 6-in-10 Democrats favored making compromises with Trump to gain consensus on legislation.   But that has completely flipped. As of March of this year, the last time there was a threat of a shutdown, two-thirds of Democrats said they think Democrats in Congress should instead stick to their positions even if this means not getting things done in Washington.   Not every progressive sees what happened as a total disaster for the left. Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo, who is generally a pretty pragmatic progressive, sees a silver lining. He described the deal as \"embarrassing,\" but sees progress for the left:   “[T]here’s a difference between the deal itself and where the deal leaves Democrats and the broader anti-Trump opposition. This deal shows us that Democrats still don’t have the caucus they need for this fight that will be going on at least through this decade. But the shutdown also accomplished a lot. And not withstanding the WTF fumble at the 10-yard line, it’s still a dramatically different caucus than we had in March. … Democratic voters need to keep demanding more, keep up the pressure and keep purging the Senate caucus of senators who are not up to the new reality.”   He also points out that if this deal goes through, there will be another funding deadline at the end of January. At that point, if Democrats don't extract health care extensions or anything else of consequence, there will be another opportunity for leverage.   \n   Over the next year, there will also likely be primaries from the left and expect the shutdown positioning to be a litmus test for those primaries – and for 2028.   In the meantime, Democratic officials are banking on voters having a short-term memory, that with time, progressives will take a victory in the progress they've made in moving the party to a more fighting stance – and the issue landscape will propel them to winning next year.   And winning cures a lot of divisions.\n",

The Syrian president entered the building through West Executive Avenue, adjacent to the White House, rather than on the West Wing driveway used for other foreign leaders' arrivals. He left the White House about two hours later and greeted a throng of supporters gathered outside before getting into his motorcade.   It marked the first visit to the White House by a Syrian head of state since the Middle Eastern country gained independence from France in 1946 and comes after the U.S. lifted sanctions imposed on Syria during the decades the country was ruled by the Assad family. Al-Sharaa led the rebel forces that toppled Syrian President Bashar Assad last December and was named the country's interim leader in January.   \n   Trump and al-Sharaa — who once had ties to al-Qaida and had a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head — first met in May in Saudi Arabia. At the time, the U.S. president described al-Sharaa as a \"young, attractive guy. Tough guy. Strong past, very strong past. Fighter.\" It was the first official encounter between the U.S. and Syria since 2000, when then-President Bill Clinton met with Hafez Assad, the father of Bashar Assad.   White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday's visit is \"part of the president's efforts in diplomacy to meet with anyone around the world in the pursuit of peace.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa looks on during a press conference in Ankara, Turkey, Feb. 4.\n                \n                    Francisco Seco/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Francisco Seco/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Trump, a Republican, has recently said that al-Sharaa is \"doing a very good job so far\" and that a \"lot of progress has been made with Syria\" since the U.S. eased sanctions.   \n   One official with knowledge of the administration's plans said Syria's entry into the global coalition fighting the Islamic State group will allow it to work more closely with U.S. forces, although the new Syrian military and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the country's northeast had already been fighting the group.   Before al-Sharaa's arrival in the U.S., the United Nations Security Council voted to lift sanctions on the Syrian president and other government officials in a move that the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Mike Waltz, said was a strong sign that Syria is in a new era since the fall of Assad.   \n   Al-Sharaa comes into the meeting with his own priorities. He wants a permanent repeal of sanctions that punished Syria for widespread allegations of human rights abuses by Assad's government and security forces. While the Caesar Act sanctions are currently waived by Trump, a permanent repeal would require Congress to act.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Motiah Boustany, of Charlestown, W.Va., holds a banner depicting Syria's President Ahmed al-Sharaa outside of the White House, as al-Sharaa meets with President Donald Trump, Monday, in Washington.\n                \n                    Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n    \n\n   \n   One option is a proposal from Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, that would end the sanctions without any conditions. The other was drafted by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a hawkish Trump ally who wants to set conditions for a sanctions repeal that would be reviewed every six months.   But advocates argue that any repeal with conditions would prevent companies from investing in Syria because they would fear potentially being sanctioned. Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, likened it to a \"hanging shadow that paralyzes any initiatives for our country.\"\n",

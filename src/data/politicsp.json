    "body": "\n      After Tuesday's election results and low approval numbers for Republicans, allies are raising concerns that President Trump is too focused on foreign policy.   \n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  President Trump is hosting Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary at the White House. Last night, he had dinner with Central Asian leaders and expanded the Abraham Accords. Earlier, he threatened strikes against Nigeria.LEILA FADEL, HOST:  This on the same week that the government shutdown became the longest ever, and election results suggest Trump's edge on the economy is waning. It's raising concerns among some of Trump's allies that he's spending too much time focused on the rest of the world and not enough at home.MARTÍNEZ: NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez joins us now. So what's this meeting with Orban about?FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: Yeah. I mean, the meeting is expected to be about the war in Ukraine and pressing Hungary to stop buying Russian oil as a means to pressure Moscow to end the war. Though the concern is not about Orban specifically, but all the time and effort put on foreign policy. I mean, A, it's not just one week. In the past month, Trump's helped broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. He continues to threaten Venezuela. He's trekked across Asia, struck a deal with China and even started to plan a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. It's just a tremendous amount of foreign policy work.MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. And then the timing, too, because right now many Americans are struggling with the cost of living. I mean, some of Trump allies feel like he really needs to be talking more about the economy instead.ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, and it's not just about the election results, either, but also Trump's low approval ratings. Stephen Bannon told Politico that Trump shouldn't spend so much time on the Middle East and Ukraine and needs to pivot to the economy. Vivek Ramaswamy, a candidate for Ohio governor, said Republicans can't mess around.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)VIVEK RAMASWAMY: Our side needs to focus on affordability. Make the American dream affordable. Bring down costs - electric costs, grocery costs, health care costs, and housing costs - and lay out how we're going to do it.ORDOÑEZ: And JD Vance, the vice president, while downplaying the Democrats' victories, also said Republicans need to, quote, \"focus on the home front.\"MARTÍNEZ: So people close to the president are asking for a pivot. Will he?ORDOÑEZ: I mean, he's talking a lot about the economy now. But he's largely blaming allies in Congress - Republicans - for not touting his work.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The affordability is much better with the Republicans. The only problem is the Republicans don't talk about it, and Republicans should start talking about it and use their heads.ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. And the White House told me that there will be more of a focus on the home front and cited yesterday's announcement on lowering drug prices. But they push back on the idea that his work overseas isn't in U.S. interests, saying new trade deals, for example, brings money home, and killing drug traffickers keeps Americans safer.MARTÍNEZ: Do you think, Franco, that all of this might be an issue for the midterms? They're coming up in less than a year.ORDOÑEZ: It probably will. I mean, I was talking with Jon McHenry, a Republican pollster, who said the economy is always going to be the most important issue for voters.JON MCHENRY: People expect you to do well on foreign policy, but they expect you to do well on foreign policy while you're also laser-focused on domestic issues. You know, the foreign policy is a kind of a nice-to-have, and the domestic policy is a must-have.MARTÍNEZ: Franco, are Republicans nervous?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, McHenry also pointed to an NBC poll that shows two-thirds of Americans feel Trump has fallen short on the economy, which were similar numbers that former President Barack Obama had in 2010. And that year, Obama's party lost 63 House seats in the midterm elections.MARTÍNEZ: All right. That's NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez. Thanks a lot.ORDOÑEZ: Thank you, A.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration violated the First Amendment rights of Education Department employees when it replaced their personalized out-of-office notifications with partisan language.\n                \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Win McNamee/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration violated the First Amendment rights of Education Department employees when it replaced their personalized out-of-office e-mail notifications with partisan language blaming Democrats for the government shutdown.   \n   \"When government employees enter public service, they do not sign away their First Amendment rights,\" U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper wrote in his decision on Friday, \"and they certainly do not sign up to be a billboard for any given administration's partisan views.\"   The lawsuit was brought by the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE).   \"This ridiculous ploy by the Trump administration was a clear violation of the First Amendment rights of the workers at the Education Department,\" said Rachel Gittleman, the president of AFGE Local 252, which represents many Education Department workers, in a statement. She added it is \"one of the many ways the Department's leadership has threatened, harassed and demoralized these hardworking public servants in the last 10 months.\"   \n   Cooper ordered the department to restore union members' personalized out-of-office email notices immediately. If that could not be done, he warned, then the department would be required to remove the partisan language from all employees' accounts, union member or not.   \n   According to court records, in the run-up to the government shutdown, Education Department employees were told to create an out-of-office message for their government email accounts to be used while workers were furloughed. The department even gave employees boilerplate language they could adapt that simply said:   \"We are unable to respond to your request due to a lapse in appropriations for the Department of Education. We will respond to your request when appropriations are enacted. Thank you.\"   But, on the shutdown's first day, the department's deputy chief of staff for operations overrode staffers' personal messages and replaced them with this partisan autoreply:   \"Thank you for contacting me. On September 19, 2025, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5371, a clean continuing resolution. Unfortunately, Democrat Senators are blocking passage of H.R. 5371 in the Senate which has led to a lapse in appropriations. Due to the lapse in appropriations I am currently in furlough status. I will respond to emails once government functions resume.\"   \n   While the message was written in the first person, multiple employees told NPR they did not write it and were not told it would replace the out-of-office messages they had written.   \n   At the time, Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications, said in a statement to NPR: \"The email reminds those who reach out to Department of Education employees that we cannot respond because Senate Democrats are refusing to vote for a clean CR and fund the government. Where's the lie?\"   In his decision, Cooper lambasted the department for \"turning its own workforce into political spokespeople through their official email accounts. The Department may have added insult to injury, but it also overplayed its hand.\"   The department did not respond to an NPR request to comment on the ruling.   \"Nonpartisanship is the foundation of the federal civil-service system,\" Cooper wrote, a principle that Congress enshrined in the Hatch Act.   That law, passed in 1939, was intended to protect public employees from political pressure and, according to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, \"to ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion.\"\n",

We also look ahead to what's next in the shutdown.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  The U.S. government shutdown is entering its 39th day. Yes, it is the longest in U.S. history. And this week, Democrats won solid victories in the New Jersey and Virginia governors races, among many others. NPR senior political contributor Ron Elving joins us from Milwaukee. Ron, thanks so much for being with us.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.SIMON: How do you read what you think a lot of voters were saying?ELVING: The common message was that they wanted to see more positive change in their own personal circumstances - more focus on prices and jobs and economic futures. And the message was quite clear across state lines in voting groups, not just New York, New Jersey, California and Virginia, but in less-noticed races in Pennsylvania, Georgia and even Mississippi. And yes, blue cities and blue states were voting blue, but voting groups that had been trending for Trump and the Republican Party in those states stopped trending that way - younger voters, noncollege voters, Hispanics and other people of color.So we have reached the first turning point in Trump's second term. And this is no longer the summer of Trump carrying all before him, testing the limits of his office, with no one to oppose him. Voters have now weighed in. The courts are pushing back. There are internal divisions within the Trump coalition, and even some of his supporters in Congress are looking for room to maneuver. So Republicans need to decide how they run and win without Trump on the ballot to bring out his portion of the electorate.SIMON: In the end, is it the economy, the economy, the economy that counts?ELVING: We don't have the usual government numbers because of the shutdown, but we have private agencies measuring people losing their jobs, and some of their reports suggest we are nearing recession-level job losses. The University of Michigan consumer confidence gauge, which is a national measure, is nearing a low point. And then there's the new buzzword of the year, affordability. A Washington Post/ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted in late October found that 7 out of 10 Americans say their grocery costs have gone up over the past year, and 6 out of 10 say the same for their utility prices. The president, though, sees things his own way. Here he is talking to reporters about a Walmart Thanksgiving bundle and seeming to equate a certain holiday special with the state of the economy.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Walmart just announced it two days ago - 25% cheaper. This year will be cheaper to have Thanksgiving than it was a year ago under sleepy Joe Biden.ELVING: What the president doesn't mention is that the Walmart Thanksgiving special has significantly fewer items in it this year. More of them are store brand, not name-brand items, meaning they tend to cost less. It's a classic case of shrinkflation where the product gets smaller.SIMON: So after this weekend, the shutdown will be 40 days and 40 nights, the longest in history - getting longer. What are you watching for in the coming days?ELVING: It's going to get still worse. People are going to have trouble getting those food stamps because, with courts trying to restore full benefits and the administration saying it will comply even as it appeals that decision to the Supreme Court, all of the confusion will take time to sort out. The air traffic control system was already stretched dangerously thin before this, so we're seeing some airports in chaos, and there have been a thousand flights canceled.It's hard to imagine the Republicans in Congress making a deal at this point without Trump driving the bargain, and it's hard to imagine getting it done without the House coming back into town, in Washington, into official session. And right now, Speaker Mike Johnson is still refusing to do that, mindful no doubt that it would mean swearing in a new Democratic member who was elected six weeks ago, making it quite likely that the House would vote to release the Jeffrey Epstein files that Johnson has been blocking.SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving. Very good to talk to you, my friend. Talk to you next week. Take care.ELVING: Thank you, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      The elections were voters' chance to weigh in a year after President Trump's election. Now Republicans and Democrats are reflecting on where they are and what they need to do to win in the future.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  The elections this week were the first time that voters got to register how they're feeling a year after President Trump's election. And the answer was clear. They are not happy with the party in power. Now both Republicans and Democrats are reflecting on where they are and what they need to do to win in the future. NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro and senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith are reflecting on that, too, and they're here to talk about it. Hi there.TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hello.DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Great to be with you.SUMMERS: So guys, Democrats had a huge week, big wins for mayor in New York City, governor in New Jersey, as well as in Virginia. How are they feeling going forward?KEITH: Democrats got their groove back, at least a little bit, after last year's bruising losses. They spent months in the political wilderness, but now they feel like they have a road map out. Just listen to Democratic National Committee chairman Ken Martin in a call earlier this week.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KEN MARTIN: Make no mistake, the Democratic Party is back. The Democratic Party is a party of affordability, and the Democratic Party is full steam ahead to take back Congress next year.KEITH: Winning is one heck of a drug.MONTANARO: Yeah, and this is a lesson, like, that they learned from the 2024 election. You know, a lot of people felt like it was too esoteric, focused in many respects on Trump and democracy. You know, Kamala Harris says the Democratic candidate tried on the economy and inflation, but it's a lot harder to win and make the focus on affordability when you're in charge and people are upset about the state of the cost of living. And it's a message that Democrats are coalescing around now, no matter who that candidate is.SUMMERS: And there was a lot of ideological diversity among the Democratic Party candidates who won. How's the party handling that?KEITH: Yeah, it's easy to look at the election of Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York City and moderates Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill in Virginia and New Jersey and say, wow, this party is split between progressives and moderates, but there is actually a through line, which Martin referenced. It's that affordability thing.And there's an analogy here to 2006, when Democrats were still licking their wounds from George W. Bush's reelection, and voters were in a foul mood. Democrats coalesced behind a clear and simple message. John Lawrence was chief of staff to Nancy Pelosi, who became speaker of the House after that election. And he says Democrats need to do the same thing now, and he even has some hope that they will.JOHN LAWRENCE: For all the focus on Mamdani, if you listen to Spanberger or Sherrill's acceptance speeches, they're all talking the same language. I mean, they're not talking about free buses or rent control, but that doesn't matter. They're talking about affordability.KEITH: He says Democrats just need to stick with this affordability message going into the midterms - cost of living, groceries, power bills, housing costs - and not let themselves get distracted by social issues or climate change or the democracy stuff.SUMMERS: Right. But as you guys well know, President Trump in his campaign - he specifically promised he would fix the economy. He claims now that he has, but that's not what voters are saying they feel. So what does this mean for Republicans?MONTANARO: Yeah. I mean, Trump won in 2024 because of the cost of living, and he promised to fix it, but what he qualifies as a great economy isn't resonating with voters, and that was clearly the case in these off-year elections. For Trump, it's all about things like the stock market and gas prices, but those are not everything, and his tariffs have actively made things more expensive.SUMMERS: Is the White House acknowledging that, though?KEITH: One of the president's top political advisers said this week that Trump will be pivoting to talk more about the cost of living, but he's been talking about it a lot this week, actually, as if it isn't a real problem.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't want to hear about the affordability because right now, we're much less. If you look at energy, we're getting close to $2-a-gallon gasoline.KEITH: That was Trump last night at a dinner for Central Asian leaders, and he really seemed to dismiss the concern about the cost of living as a messaging problem.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: The affordability is much better with the Republicans. The only problem is the Republicans don't talk about it, and Republicans should start talking about it and use their heads because we have great numbers. We have great - and they're going to only get better.KEITH: He says the numbers are going to get better because his tariff policies will ultimately improve the U.S. economy, though that's really not clear at this point. Right now, Trump is facing some of the same issues that President Biden did, which is that you can't credibly tell people that the economic fundamentals are strong and inflation is slowing down if, out in their real lives, they are experiencing sticker shock.SUMMERS: Right, and when we get to the midterms, Republicans will still be in charge. President Trump himself won't be on the ballot, though. So what dynamic does this create for Republican candidates?MONTANARO: Yeah, I mean, no matter what they do, Republicans are going to be tied to Trump. But in those swing districts, they're going to likely have to try - if the affordability environment doesn't change - to try to distance themselves somewhat from Trump. Here's Republican strategist Mike DuHaime, a former political director at the Republican National Committee, making that point.MIKE DUHAIME: Especially in the blue and purple states, there has to be some differentiation from Trump. Doesn't mean you have to completely distance yourself, but there has to be something where you show some level of independence and some level of individuality.MONTANARO: And another part of the problem here for Republicans is that they can't actually be Donald Trump.DUHAIME: Most candidates have to realize, like, you're not Donald Trump. You were not on \"The Apprentice\" for 10 years. You were not a star on the WWE. Your name is not on buildings.MONTANARO: So it's really an era we're in of the celebrity politician, but it's also an era of anger at whoever's in charge. You know, again, 2006 was a marker for the beginning of this trend. You know, consider that 6 of the last 7 midterm elections have had presidents with approval ratings under 50%, and we're moving toward that again with Trump.KEITH: Yeah, this is a problem that Democrats had when President Obama was in office. He was a turnout machine but only when he was on the ballot. And the party had major losses at the state and even local level during his presidency. Right now, Democrats do not have an obvious leader. That will likely be decided by the presidential primary over the next 2 1/2 years, and it's not clear what a post-Trump Republican party looks like either because he has demanded absolute loyalty and fealty from members of his party.MONTANARO: Right now, in this era of anger and skepticism at presidents, being out of power gives the advantage to Democrats heading into next year's midterms.SUMMERS: NPR's Domenico Montanaro and Tamara Keith, thanks to both of you.KEITH: You're welcome.MONTANARO: You got it.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "\n      Democrats won every election in the 2025 off-year contests, setting them up for high expectations going into the 2026 midterms. Democrats and Republicans talk about what it could mean going forward.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Democrats outperformed expectations in races across the country this week. And so NPR political correspondent Sarah McCammon has been asking Democrats and Republicans what this all means for next year's midterms. And Sarah is with me now. Good morning, Sarah.SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Hi, Leila.FADEL: So let's start with Democrats. What are they telling you?MCCAMMON: Well, obviously, they are very pleased across the...FADEL: Right.MCCAMMON: ...Board. And they're framing their success this week as a repudiation of President Trump's policies, as well as an affirmation of their candidates' focus across the country on economic issues like affordability. That said, I am hearing some divisions within the party about who best represents the future of the party. You know, is it more moderate Democrats like Abigail Spanberger in Virginia or Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey? Or is it young progressives like Zohran Mamdani, who won the mayoral race in New York City?FADEL: Right. And Spanberger and Sherrill won the governors races. What are you hearing from Democrats about Mamdani specifically? Because he really won without the Democratic establishment behind him.MCCAMMON: Yeah. I mean, they recognize that Mamdani excited the party base and motivated New York voters both to register in big numbers and to vote, largely by talking about these affordability issues like housing. I also heard some skepticism about his broader appeal beyond New York. Debbie Cox Bultan with the center-left group NewDEAL noted that the two moderate Democrats we mentioned, Spanberger and Sherrill, outperformed Vice President Kamala Harris' performance from last year by large margins.DEBBIE COX BULTAN: That is not true for the mayor-elect in New York. And so I think when we think about how we're going to move forward and win across the country in places that are hard to win, we've got to look to people like Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill as the roadmap if we're going to be able to build broad coalitions to win in '26 and '28.MCCAMMON: It's probably worth mentioning Mamdani was in a three-way race in New York City.FADEL: Right.MCCAMMON: He is a democratic socialist and has been accused by some Jewish groups of antisemitism based on some of his views on Israel. For his part, Mamdani has repeatedly said he would fight antisemitism, and he drew support from about a third of Jewish voters. Some centrist Democrats worry, though, that attacks on Mamdani from Trump and other Republicans, some of whom have painted him as a communist and a terrorist because of his Muslim faith, will harm Democrats in other parts of the country.FADEL: But the attacks didn't work - right? - in New York. He got over a million votes. So what are the lessons from his win, if there are any?MCCAMMON: Well, both Republicans and Democrats I've talked to since the election think Mamdani absolutely will be a focus in the coming months. But Ezra Levin of the progressive group Indivisible told me he thinks the Democratic Party has to be big enough for many voices if they want to win.EZRA LEVIN: I think effective Democratic leadership would recognize we need a big tent. And if you're organizing with people in this moment who entirely agree with everything that you stand for, your tent's too small.MCCAMMON: And Levin says the party needs to be laser-focused right now on fighting authoritarianism and defeating Trump's agenda.FADEL: With how well the Democrats did on Tuesday, are Republicans recalibrating their strategy going forward?MCCAMMON: You know, both parties - at least based on these results, where things stand right now - say the economy will continue to be a huge focus across the board. One Republican strategist I spoke with, Zack Roday with Ascent Media, acknowledged that focusing on cultural and social issues like the transgender policy issue seemed to be less effective for Republicans this year compared to a year ago. And he says Republicans are in power in Washington, and they'll need to focus on issues that voters care about, like the cost of living.You know, on another note, Democrats also won a pretty resounding victory in California, allowing them to redraw their congressional maps. Another Republican strategist, Whit Ayres at North Star Opinion Research, told me some Republicans may look at this week's results, the big turnout from Democrats, and decide to be a little more cautious about this redistricting strategy, which President Trump, of course, has promoted. Ayres says in some districts where Republican control is more marginal, they could actually risk losing seats by doing this. So they could overplay their hand.FADEL: That's NPR political correspondent Sarah McCammon.

The government had been planning to fund only partial payments this month.   \n\n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  The Trump administration is appealing a court order requiring it to restore full SNAP food benefits by today.LEILA FADEL, HOST:  The government had previously said it would only restore partial benefits in response to an earlier decision. A federal judge in Rhode Island issued the new order yesterday, saying the government failed to consider the harm to individuals who rely on those benefits.MARTÍNEZ: NPR's Tovia Smith is following this. So, Tovia, that Rhode Island judge - that's the same one who last week forced the Trump administration to use emergency funding to keep SNAP going. So what's he saying now?TOVIA SMITH, BYLINE: Well, he's laying into the Trump administration again, accusing it of withholding and delaying SNAP benefits for, quote, \"political reasons.\" U.S. District Judge John McConnell Jr. called it astounding that the Trump administration didn't consider the harm it was causing to the millions of Americans who depend on this food assistance. As he put it in his order, this court is not naive to the administration's true motives. McConnell cited a post the president put up on social media this week declaring that SNAP benefits will only resume when, quote, \"the radical-left Democrats open up government.\" And the judge said that was proof of Trump's intent to defy the original court order to keep SNAP going and a big part of why he ordered the government to fully fund SNAP by today. And it was just about an hour later that the Trump administration appealed the court order. Attorneys offered no arguments just yet, just saying they're appealing.MARTÍNEZ: I know the administration has said that it doesn't have the money to fully fund SNAP during the government shutdown. So did the judge address where the money will come from now?SMITH: Yes. Remember last week, he said the government had to use an emergency fund to keep SNAP going, though that was only enough to pay partial benefits. This time, he said the administration must also cover the rest by tapping into a much bigger source of money from customs revenues, which the government said it was saving just in case it was needed for things like child nutrition programs. But yesterday, the judge wasn't having it. He said it defies belief that the administration would prioritize a hypothetical need over the, quote, \"very real and imminent (ph) risk of children being deprived of their food assistance today.\"MARTÍNEZ: Now, what are you hearing from the administration and from the groups that brought the lawsuit to get the SNAP money reinstated?SMITH: So a spokesperson for the Agriculture Department, which administers SNAP, blamed Democrats for the lapse in benefits, accusing them of using the shutdown as leverage for their political agenda. And on the other side, the cities and nonprofits that brought the case to court were celebrating the judge's order, calling it a major victory until the government appealed. As one leader of an antihunger group put it, the thrill didn't last long. And the fear is now that it could still be a while before this gets resolved.MARTÍNEZ: So what about today's deadline to restore funding? It sounds like not a lot of time to do a lot of stuff.SMITH: Yes. And just to note, the deadline today is for the government to get the money to states, which is just step one. So even if they manage that, it's hard to imagine the money could get all the way to individuals so quickly. Remember, the administration had said reducing benefits is complicated and could take weeks or months. So now it's unclear if any processing that was done now needs to be undone, and the government may seek to stay the judge's order while the appeal plays out. So meantime, millions of people are still left trying to scrape by with whatever they can afford and whatever they can get at food pantries, for example, which are already straining to keep up with demand.MARTÍNEZ: NPR's Tovia Smith.

Clary/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The Trump administration is reducing air traffic at 40 of the nation's busiest airports, starting Friday and ramping up over the next week.   The Federal Aviation Administration says the move aims to reduce pressure on air traffic controllers. As federal employees, they have been working without pay for over a month due to the government shutdown, now the longest in U.S. history with no end in sight.   \n   Delays and disruptions have already hit airports across the country as a result of escalating staffing shortages. The new flight restrictions add another layer of uncertainty and stress for travelers.   \"It does have the potential to be quite disruptive, even though the vast majority of flights are still going to operate as scheduled,\" says Nick Ewen, senior editorial director of The Points Guy travel website.   The cancellations on Friday represent about a 4% reduction in flights. That number is expected to ramp up to the FAA-required 10% — or some 4,400 fights daily — by next Friday if the shutdown continues.   \n   Major U.S. airlines say they are trying to minimize disruptions and are granting customers extra flexibility to change or refund their tickets during this period — even if their flight isn't canceled. The key word is \"flexibility,\" Ewen says.   \"Travelers that are flying this weekend into next week, they have to be flexible and ready to pivot if things go wrong,\" he says.   Here's what to know if that applies to you.   Which flights could be affected?    Ewen says the likelihood of a flight getting canceled comes down to factors such as the size of the plane, how full it is and what route it is flying.   \"The airlines are really trying to focus on those flights that are going to be least disruptive, where there are … alternatives to get affected customers to their final destination,\" he adds.   United, Delta and Alaska airlines, for instance, say their international flights will not be affected.   United also says it is not canceling any flights operating between its seven hub airports, in Newark, N.J., Chicago, Houston, Denver, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and San Francisco.   \n   Some airlines have already posted flight changes through the weekend, and others into next week. They all say they are working to alert passengers on affected flights with as much notice as possible, directly through booking contact information as well as through their apps and websites.   Ewen says anyone planning to travel should download their airline's app days in advance, and make sure notifications are enabled so travelers will, ideally, know about any changes before they actually get to the airport.   \n   \"If you do go to the airport, remember that a little kindness goes a long way,\" he adds. \"Screaming at a gate agent, yelling at a customer service agent is not going to increase the likelihood of you getting rebooked.\"   What if your flight gets canceled?    Ewen advises passengers to try to rebook their flight as soon as possible, either through the airline's app or website, by phone or in-person if they're already at the airport.   \"If you're on a plane with 100 passengers that gets canceled, that's 100 people that have to be accommodated,\" Ewen says. \"So if you can be among the first five to get accommodated, that's going to be ideally a better situation than someone who's the 95th customer.\"   Airlines including Alaska, Southwest and JetBlue say that in most cases, customers on canceled flights will be automatically rebooked on the next available flight, though they can still cancel for a refund.   Under Department of Transportation rules, customers on significantly delayed or canceled flights who choose not to accept an airline's rebooking option are entitled to a full refund, regardless of how restrictive their original ticket was.   \n   That still applies here, Ewen says. On top of that, many airlines are giving customers more options by allowing them to cancel or rebook their flights without change fees.   American Airlines is waiving change fees, refunding affected passengers — in any fare class — if their flight is canceled or they choose not to fly. Delta is similarly letting all customers change or cancel their flights for free in affected markets. United also says it will refund those who cancel flights, and waive change fees (and in some cases, fare differences) for those who rebook.   The specifics of these waivers are likely to evolve in the coming days, Ewen says.   \"The best thing to do is if you are flying on a particular airline, look at that airline's website, read through the details of the policy that they have and know that it could change,\" he says. \"So even if your flight is not eligible today, it could be later today, or it could be tomorrow, or it could be on Monday.\"   \n   Should you change your plans proactively?   With so much up in the air, some passengers may be wondering if it's worth flying at all.   Ewen says if your plans are flexible, it may be worth rescheduling — both to remove some of the potential risk and add some \"slack back to the system\" by opening up seats for other people. The same is true for those who may be able to travel by car or train instead.   \"Everyone has their own definition of how important it is to take the trip that they have booked,\" he says. \"But if you are truly flexible and you're like, 'Yeah, no, I can do this some other time,' it could be a good idea to go ahead and make that decision to cancel.\"   What about booking upcoming travel?    Thanksgiving travel — which can be a headache any year — is one big question mark as the shutdown stretches on.   \n   At the moment, Ewen says, it's still \"safe-ish.\" He says people who've already booked Thanksgiving flights shouldn't rush to cancel them just yet, and those hoping to make plans can still proceed with caution.   \"If someone has not booked Thanksgiving travel yet and they have to take a flight, I would say go ahead and try to lock those plans in now, and maybe consider either adding travel insurance on top of that or potentially booking a fully refundable ticket in case there are going to be delays or cancellations.\"   Mark Friedlander, a spokesperson for the nonprofit Insurance Information Institute, recommends people shop around for travel insurance policies beyond what airlines offer at checkout, noting that sites like Squaremouth make it easy to compare options.   He says standard policies typically start at between 4% and 10% of the cost of a prepaid, nonrefundable trip — and while you don't necessarily have to buy them the same day you book your flight, it's cheaper to do so sooner than later.   \n   There is one catch: Most standard policies have a \"known event clause\" for things like natural disasters or political crises, Friedlander says. So the travel insurance you buy while the shutdown is already happening is not likely to cover any disruptions caused by it. That's why airlines' extra flexible policies are \"good news for all consumers,\" he says.   Ewen of The Points Guy says the longer the shutdown continues, the longer it could take crews and planes to get back on track — all the more reason airlines and passengers alike are hoping for a resolution soon.   \n   \"Right now, we're in a little bit of a travel lull before that Thanksgiving rush,\" he says. \"So if we can get things dealt with, hopefully we'll be able to avoid some of the major issues during Thanksgiving week. But again, that just remains to be seen.\"\n",

How are higher prices changing the way you live? Fill out this form to share your story with NPR.      What's the item?   Furniture   How has the price changed since before the pandemic?   The price of bedroom furniture rose 11% since February 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The price of living room, kitchen and dining room furniture rose 25%.   \n   Loading...\n   Why has the price gone up?    Like all industries, furniture makers and sellers are dealing with higher expenses: utilities, insurance, wages. Big cost spikes came during the pandemic, when shoppers raced to buy desks for home offices and patio sets, and shipping costs soared.   But if you ask furniture industry insiders, the first thing they'll reply is that the price of furniture has actually grown slower than overall inflation, which has risen nearly 26% since February 2020.    Then, the experts will note that prices are down from their peak in 2022. And then — like David Koehler did — they'll deliver the popular adage:   \"You could buy a $399 sofa in 1984, and you could still buy a $399 sofa today,\" says Koehler, who runs the Delaware chain Johnny Janosik Furniture.   Of course, not everyone wants a $399 sofa, but the fact that it still exists makes furniture different from other big-ticket items, like cars or appliances.   Overseas competition has kept prices lower    Setting aside high-end woodwork and heirloom craftsmanship, sellers of mass market furniture feel intense pressure to keep prices down.   \"The barriers to entry are very, very low, and the furniture business is incredibly fragmented,\" says Bill McLoughlin, editor in chief of Furniture Today, a trade publication.   \n   Besides, furniture sellers compete not just with second-hand goods, but with any expensive plans you may have, say, for a trip or home repairs.   \n   And the race for cheapest prices has moved a lot of the industry abroad.   \"Manufacturing follows low-cost labor. That has been true for 60 years,\" says McLoughlin. \"Because labor is such a large component of the cost of a product.\"   American wages tend to be a lot higher than those overseas, on top of the bigger costs of U.S. environmental standards. So even at domestic furniture-making hubs in Mississippi or North Carolina, many components — fabrics, handles and electronics, like the power button for your recliner — still ship from abroad, mainly China.   Enter: tariffs    During his first term, President Trump's tariffs made it pricier to ship furniture from China, so a lot of manufacturing moved out — though not to America, but to Vietnam.   This year, Trump raised tariffs on imports from almost all countries. And he's set new double-digit tariffs specifically for kitchen cabinets, vanities and upholstered furniture.   The furniture giant Ashley Furniture in June raised the price of the majority of its products as a result of tariffs. The Home Furnishings Association, an industry trade group, has warned of cumulative cost increases for both retailers and shoppers.   What are people doing about it?   As importing furniture becomes pricier, American-made furniture may start looking more attractive in comparison. But seller Koehler worries about how shoppers will react.   \"The consumer, when we get feedback, they say, 'We would love to buy American,'\" he says. \"But when they vote with their dollars and see, this item is $500 and that item is $1,200, they say, 'I think I can only afford the $500.' So they end up buying an imported item anyway, just because there is such a difference in price.\"   \n   Many shoppers find themselves in the same spot as Erin Cummins in Connecticut: watching their spending rise on other, more critical costs, such as health insurance, or car insurance, or groceries.   \"Every time we're having company over, I look at that furniture and I'm going, 'I really need to replace that,'\" says Cummins, whose threadbare couches have been well-loved by three dogs and three children. \"I have priced it out a bit, but every time I do, I get sticker shock and walk away.\"   \n   Cummins says at this point, the cost of new furniture displeases her more than the state of what she already owns, and her couches — still standing, even if covered by a blanket — feel more stable than her budget.\n",

Today's top stories   Beginning today, the Federal Aviation Administration will reduce air traffic by 10% at many of the busiest airports. This move is intended to help keep the nation's airspace safe as the agency deals with a shortage of air traffic controllers and the government shutdown. Airlines have started canceling flights in order to comply with the FAA's orders.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                People take photos as a plane lands at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on Nov. 6, 2025, in Los Angeles, California. The FAA will be reducing flights by 10% in 40 major airports around the country, including LAX, beginning tomorrow amid air traffic control staffing shortages due to the federal government shutdown.\n                \n                    Mario Tama/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mario Tama/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 The shutdown is taking a toll on air traffic controllers, who are required to work without pay. NPR's Joel Rose tells Up First that there is some speculation that the reduction in air traffic is mostly a PR or political move related to ending the shutdown. The air traffic control system was functioning fairly well during the shutdown until this past weekend, when staffing shortages occurred at dozens of facilities simultaneously. Travelers have expressed concern over what could happen if their flights are canceled due to the FAA's change.   The Trump administration is appealing a court decision ordering it to restore full funding for SNAP benefits by today. The government previously stated it would restore partial benefits in response to an earlier decision. In a new decision made yesterday, U.S. District Judge John McConnell Jr. in Rhode Island ruled that the government failed to consider the harm to individuals who rely on those benefits.    \n   🎧 The emergency fund to keep SNAP going was only enough to make partial benefit payments, resulting in McConnell saying the administration would need to tap into money from customs revenue. The deadline the judge set is for the government to distribute the money to states, but even if it manages that, NPR's Tovia Smith says it is hard to imagine funds could reach individuals that fast. The administration previously stated that reducing benefits is a complicated process that could take weeks to months, and it is unclear whether that process now needs to be undone.   President Trump's allies are raising concerns that he is spending too much time focused on the rest of the world and not enough on domestic issues. The president has been nurturing international relations, from currently hosting Prime Minister Viktor Orbán of Hungary at the White House to a dinner last night with leaders from Central Asia. Earlier, he also threatened strikes against Nigeria. These actions occurred during the same week that the government shutdown became the longest in history.    🎧 The election results have also pointed to Trump possibly losing his edge on the economy. The president's approval ratings are also low, NPR's Franco Ordoñez says. Among Trump's allies, Vice President JD Vance stated that Republicans need to focus on what is happening on the home front while commenting on the Democratic victories at the ballot box. The White House informed Ordoñez that there will be more of an economic focus on the U.S., pointing to yesterday's announcement of lower prices on obesity drugs.   \n   Deep dive   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Alexis Blake inside her car at her apartment's parking garage on August, 8th, 2025.

After examining data from Quadrant Information Services, startling differences in auto insurance rates were found between drivers with poor credit and those with excellent credit, often resulting in thousands of dollars in annual premiums.   🚗 Insurance companies and industry groups defended the use of credit history to help set premiums. They say it is a powerful indicator of whether a driver will have an insured loss.🚗 Consumer advocates point out that credit scores are consistently lower for lower-income Americans and people of color.🚗 Will Guzzardi, a Democratic lawmaker representing mostly Latino Chicagoans in the Illinois state legislature, has been working on car insurance fairness for about two years. His efforts include introducing a bill that would have required insurers to prove that their practices don't harm any policyholders based on race, gender, or other factors.

That support is deeply rooted in their evangelical faith, he said. But recently, Lahmeyer has noticed the conversation around Israel is changing quite a bit — particularly online.   \n   \"Some very influential leaders, all of whom I like — Tucker Carlson, Candace Owens, Marjorie Taylor Greene — have taken a very controversial stance in regards to the nation of Israel,\" he said.   Last week, Carlson hosted a prominent white nationalist named Nick Fuentes on his show. Although Carlson disagreed with Fuentes on his most antisemitic statements, such as American Jews are more faithful to Israel than they are to the United States, he did broadly align with Fuentes on his views about the country itself.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                White nationalist Nick Fuentes recently appeared on Tucker Carlson's podcast where he promoted antisemitic ideas. While Carlson disagreed on many topics, he said that America's support for Israel needed to be questioned: \"We get nothing out of it, I completely agree with you there,\" Carlson told Fuentes.\n                \n                    Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n    \n\n   \n   \"I've always thought it's great to criticize and question our relationship with Israel because it's insane and it hurts us. We get nothing out of it, I completely agree with you there,\" Carlson said.   Opposition to Israel on the right isn't new, but younger conservatives appear to be rapidly moving away from supporting the close U.S. relationship with the country. Among several polls, one from the Pew Research Center out earlier this year showed that conservatives under 50 were increasingly skeptical of Israel. Over the past three years, the group's negative views of the country jumped from 35% to 50%.   Loading...\n   The stakes for Israel are enormous. If skepticism starts spreading from conservative influencers to elected officials, it could threaten billions in military and foreign aid that Israel receives each year from the U.S.    For more than a decade, the majority of its political support in America has come from Christian conservatives, said Daniel Hummel, a historian at the University of Wisconsin, Madison who's studied Christian support for Israel. Today, with many on the left angry over the war in Gaza, their backing is more important than ever.   \"They're the last bastion of organized, large-scale national support for Israel,\" he said.   Biblical roots   Christian support for Israel is rooted in the Bible itself. Many evangelical Christians believe that the promises God made to the Jewish people in the Old Testament still hold, Lahmeyer said.   \"God's made a covenant with the Jewish people and he's not going to break that covenant,\" he said.   Evangelicals see support of the modern state of Israel as a way of honoring that divine will. \"If God says, 'This land belongs to you eternally,' then it belongs to you eternally — because God's the creator, he's the owner,\" Lahmeyer said.   \n   Many also believe the return of the Jewish people to Israel is a prerequisite for the second coming of Christ, he added.   From a modern standpoint, Hummel says, Christian support for the state of Israel has been growing in fits and starts since the nation was founded in 1948. The famous evangelical pastor Billy Graham visited Israel in the 1960s. By the 1980s and 1990s many large Christian groups, like the Moral Majority and the Christian Coalition, were supporting Israel.   \n   Evangelical support for Israel grew vastly in the years following the 9/11 terror attacks, Hummel said. Particularly in 2006, support for the country took off with the formation of a group known as Christians United For Israel (CUFI). The group became a single-issue lobby that claimed support from millions of American evangelicals, Hummel said. CUFI has been a staunch advocate for Israel and some of its most expansionist policies — such as settlements in the West Bank. (CUFI did not respond to NPR's request for an interview for this story.)   Because of their biblical beliefs about Israel, Hummel said, evangelical backers, known as Christian Zionists, have become central to American support. The backing of Christian Zionists kept growing, even as traditional supporters on the American left grew increasingly skeptical of Israel's policies in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                New housing projects are seen in the West Bank Israeli settlement of Givat Ze'ev,  June 18, 2023. Evangelical Christians have supported the expansion of Israeli settlements.\n                \n                    Ohad Zwigenberg/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Ohad Zwigenberg/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Today Christian Zionists \"are really valuable to Israel,\" he said. \"They tend to say, 'We think Israel knows its interests best… and we just want to support what they decide.'\"   Cracks over Gaza   But Israel's war in Gaza has challenged that view. \"Over the last two years, there has been this kind of gnawing away of support of Israel among evangelical Christians,\" Lahmeyer said.   The polls support that observation, said Shibley Telhami, the Anwar Sadat Professor for Peace and Development at the University of Maryland, who tracks public opinion about Israel. He says that since the war in Gaza, support has plummeted among young conservatives.   \n   Telhami's own work shows that today, only 32% of evangelicals aged 18-34 sympathize with Israel over the Palestinians — that's more than 30 points lower than the older generation. Support more broadly from Republicans in the same age range is only 24%.   Loading...\n   Telhami believes that shift in sentiment has emboldened longtime opponents to Israel on the right.   In addition to Tucker Carlson, prominent Republican influencers like Candace Owens and Stephen Bannon have publicly criticized Israel recently.   Many of these personalities never supported Israel, and they sense that now is the moment to speak up, said Curt Mills, editor of the American Conservative Magazine, which opposes Israeli policies and was founded by Pat Buchanan – a Christian conservative, former presidential hopeful and political commentator.   \n   \"Tucker and Bannon are political operators and in a lot of ways true believers, but they are also very effective businessmen and they would not be doing these programs if nobody gave a hoot,\" he said. \"There's an audience for this, people are frustrated, people are angry and they have reason to be.\"   In addition to anger over the way Israel has conducted its war in Gaza, Mills says many conservatives want America to avoid becoming entangled in new wars, particularly in the Middle East. And they worry Trump is allowing Israel to drive military decisions. That anxiety grew after America bombed Iranian nuclear sites earlier this year.   \"They are using Donald Trump's presidency like a rented car. The Israelis, the Israeli lobby, the Netanyahu Government, the neoconservatives in his ranks,\" he said.   Resurgent antisemitism   A desire for American isolationism and outrage over how Israel has conducted the war have driven some to speak up. But other influencers are using the war as an opportunity to peddle antisemitic conspiracies.   One example came last month, when podcaster Candace Owens discussed a meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a group of U.S. social media influencers:   \n   \"Two years ago, the mere idea that you might share a perspective that Jews are controlling the media, that would be considered antisemitic. You would be called a Jew hater. Fast forward to 2025, and Bibi Netanyahu is now hosting an on-camera meeting,\" she said.   The idea that \"Jews control the media\" is a long-held antisemitic trope. Owens has made other antisemitic remarks in the past, though she has repeatedly said that she does not hate Jewish people.   White nationalist Nick Fuentes used his appearance on Carlson's show to promote numerous antisemitic ideas: including that he believed Jews naturally dislike Europeans and that Jewish people prevent America from unifying around a common vision for itself.   \"The main challenge to that, a big challenge to [unifying the country] is organized Jewry in America,\" he told Carlson.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee (Center) tours the fifth-century Church of St George in the Palestinian Christian village of Taybeh, northeast of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, on July 19, 2025. Huckabee and others in the Trump Administration continue to be highly supportive of Israel.\n                \n                    JAAFAR ASHTIYEH/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        JAAFAR ASHTIYEH/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Hummel points out that much of this antisemitism is entangled in a theological divide over Israel. Many conservative opponents to Israel are Catholic or non-evangelical Protestants, he said. Those individuals do not necessarily share the view that the Jewish people still share a sacred covenant with God. And some, like Fuentes, are resurfacing centuries-old Christian conspiracy theories about the Jewish people.   Telhami says that it remains to be seen what all this actually means for the relationship between America and Israel. The Trump administration continues to be broadly supportive, and the U.S. ambassador to Israel is Mike Huckabee — a devout evangelical Christian.   \"The question of course is whether the shift in public opinion in-and-of-itself would lead to a shift in policy. And that's not a straightforward line,\" Telhami said.   But he added, it is clear that on the American right, support for Israel is no longer the given it once was.\n",

NPR reporters are reviewing the files, which so far have included unredacted names and photographs of Epstein victims, communications with powerful figures like Elon Musk and former White House counsel in the Obama administration Kathryn Ruemmler and even more mentions of President Trump.   Being mentioned in the files, which include unvetted submissions made to the FBI, Epstein's private correspondence and court records, is not a sign of wrongdoing or association with Epstein's crimes.   \n   Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche says Friday's release means the DOJ is now in compliance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which Congress passed last November and which legally required the DOJ to release all the files.   Members of Congress who passed the law had earlier complained that the DOJ had failed to meet its deadline of mid-December to release all the files and have questioned the extensive redactions made to photos and documents released so far.   NPR's initial review of the new files found Trump's face blacked out on a news article sent by onetime advisor Steve Bannon and a spreadsheet that contained unverified allegations of inappropriate conduct by Trump and others that was briefly offline.   A Justice Department spokeswoman said the document was down \"due to overload and is back online.\"   The Justice Department press release also said that the tranche of files may include \"fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos, as everything that was sent to the FBI by the public was included in the production that is responsive to the Act.\"   \"Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,\" the release continues. \"To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.\"      \n   Never miss a big story. Sign up for the NPR Politics newsletter, sent weekly      Blanche at a press conference on Friday morning said more than 500 lawyers and others worked through weekends and holidays to comply with the law, while making sure to protect victims' information. He said they had to review more than 6 million pages — \"two Eiffel Towers of pages\" — to decide what to release. They're continuing to withhold documents that depict violence or involve attorney-client privilege, he said. The department also said it discarded any duplicates or unrelated materials.   \"I take umbrage at the suggestion, which is totally false, that the attorney general or this department does not take child exploitation or sex trafficking seriously, or that we somehow do not want to protect victims,\" Blanche said.   He also said the DOJ wasn't seeking to protect President Trump while releasing the files, though some of the files contained sensational and false claims about the president and others.   \"Through the process, the Department provided clear instructions to reviewers that the redactions were to be limited to the protection of victims and their families,\" the DOJ said in a statement. \"Some pornographic images, whether commercial or not, were redacted, given the Department treated all women in those images as victims. Notable individuals and politicians were not redacted in the release of any files.\"   Epstein files political saga   The release of the Epstein files is the latest development in a political saga that has dogged Trump's second term in office and caused bipartisan backlash against Trump's conflicting and shifting commentary on the subject.   Trump amplified conspiracy theories about the files relating to his onetime friend Epstein on the campaign trail, vowing to publicize information about the financier's crimes and ties to powerful people that he alleged was being covered up by the government. But once he returned to the White House, Trump fought efforts by lawmakers and his supporters to release those files.   \n   \"There's this mantra out there that, oh, you know, the Department of Justice is supposed to protect Donald J. Trump,\" Blanche said on Friday. \"That's not true. That was never the case. We are always concerned about the victims.\" He said Trump has directed the DOJ to \"be as transparent as we can.\"   Separately, Blanche said the Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation into the death of Alex Pretti, a U.S. citizen who was shot by two immigration enforcement officers last weekend in Minneapolis. The investigation is being led by the FBI, but it is also coordinating with the DOJ's civil rights division, which is led by Harmeet Dhillon.   He also said the investigation was being done in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security.   \"I don't want the takeaway to be that there's some massive civil rights investigation that's happening; I would describe this as a standard investigation by the FBI, when there's circumstances like what we saw last Saturday,\" Blanche said.   This is a developing story and may be updated.   NPR's Ryan Lucas, Elena Moore, Saige Miller, Jaclyn Diaz, Carrie Johnson, Alana Wise and Danielle Kurtzleben contributed reporting.\n",

Al Green, D-Texas, at a rally at Columbus Circle near Union Station in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 2, 2025.\n                \n                    Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Former CNN anchor Don Lemon and an independent Minnesota journalist, Georgia Fort, were among four people arrested by federal agents in connection to an anti-ICE protest at a church in Minnesota.   Journalists, press advocates and Democratic lawmakers accused the Trump administration of attempting to intimidate journalists conducting independent accountability reporting.     A federal grand jury in Minnesota has indicted the four on charges related to the interruption of a religious service at the church, where a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official serves as a pastor.    Lemon had followed the protesters in as they demonstrated. In his livestreamed video, he says he is there as a journalist. He interviewed the pastor and others present, as well as protesters.    \n   Some of President Trump's supporters argued he had participated in the disruption.    In a statement posted on social media, Lemon's attorney, Abbe Lowell, called the arrest an \"unprecedented attack on the First Amendment and transparent attempt to distract attention from the many crises facing this administration.\"   Amnesty International demanded the release of Lemon and Fort, calling their arrests \"a critical threat to our human rights.\"   \n   \"Reporting on protests isn't a crime — its protected by the First Amendment,\" said Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. \"The Justice Department should drop these prosecutions or they should be thrown out.\"    Media executives and press rights advocates have been on heightened alert over a series of actions taken by the Trump administration: formal investigations of most of the United States' leading broadcasters, including ABC, CBS, NBC, NPR and PBS; threats by Trump to hold up big corporate transactions involving media companies; Trump's personal lawsuits against major news outlets, including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal; and, most recently, the FBI's seizure of computers and devices from Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson without warning, said to be part of an investigation of the leak of national security documents. Typically prosecutors contact news organizations to give them a chance to identify relevant materials and to challenge the need to hand them over in court.   \n   Justice Department celebrates Lemon's arrest   On Friday morning, Justice Department officials celebrated the arrest of Lemon in California after failing twice to secure arrest warrants for him in Minnesota.    \n   U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi took personal credit, posting on X that the arrests occurred at her direction \"in connection with the coordinated attack on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota.\" The two other people arrested early Friday are local activists.    \"You have the right to worship freely and safely,\" she said in a video. \"And if I haven't been clear already, if you violate that sacred right, we are coming after you.\"   Bondi's spokesperson Gates McGavick posted a meme of the attorney general with laser beams emanating from her eyes.    U.S. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon posted on X that the church was \"a space protected from exactly such acts by federal criminal and civil laws! Nor does the First Amendment protect your pseudo journalism of disrupting a prayer service. You are on notice.\" Dhillon, who oversees the civil rights division of the Justice Department, also reposted a tweet referring to Lemon as one of \"today's klansmen.\"   Three others were previously charged in connection with the church protest, accused of violating a law that prevents people from obstructing places of worship or abortion clinics.   A federal magistrate judge previously declined to approve Lemon's arrest, citing a lack of evidence. And the chief federal appeals court judge in Minnesota rejected a prosecutor's appeal of the decision, writing that there was \"no evidence\" of any criminal behavior in Lemon's work.     The Washington Post reviewed the videos of Lemon at the protest.    \"The footage shows that he was with activists before the protest and followed them to the church, where he spent approximately 45 minutes and spoke with four parishioners and five protesters,\" the Post wrote. \"In all but one instance, the exchanges appear to be calm. The footage does not show him participating in the chants that disrupted the service. A pastor at one point asks him to leave. Seven minutes later, he exits the church building.\"   \n   \"Pure authoritarian bile\"   Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., denounced the arrest on the Senate floor, saying it \"is a dark message to journalists everywhere: If you dare criticize this administration, watch your back.\"   \"That is not democracy,\" Schumer said. \"That is a police state, and that is pure authoritarian bile.\"   Friday morning, Fort posted a video on social media saying federal agents were at the door of her home in Minnesota. Fort said in the post that she was reporting when she filmed the church protest. She is a known quantity in Minnesota press circles. According to the National Association of Black Journalists chapter in Minnesota, Fort has won regional awards and served as an officer of the group.     Lemon, who now appears on YouTube, Substack and other social media platforms, left CNN in 2023 after 17 years at the cable network, amid criticism that he made sexist comments about women and aging.    CNN was among those outlets and institutions that weighed in against Lemon's arrest, saying it \"raises profoundly concerning questions about press freedom and the First Amendment.\"   \n   In the statement, shared with NPR by a spokesperson, the network said the Constitution protects \"journalists who bear witness to news and events as they unfold, ensuring they can report freely in the public interest, and the DOJ's attempts to violate those rights is unacceptable.\"   CNN's parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery, is in the process of trying to sell itself to Netflix, though CNN and other cable channels would be spun off. Antitrust regulators at the Justice Department will get to review the deal if it is approved by shareholders.  Trump has said he wants a say in who owns CNN next.\n",

As she oversees the network's parent agency, critics say her comments violated the spirit and perhaps even the letter of federal law that seeks to safeguard Voice of America's editorial independence.\n                \n                    Voice of America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Voice of America\n    \n\n   \n   Kari Lake, who oversees the parent agency of the Voice of America, has hit legal and political roadblocks in her drive to dismantle the government-funded broadcaster.   She has instead accelerated her use of the U.S. government-owned network to promote President Trump and his views — in possible violation of federal law and policies.   To mark the completion of Trump's first year in office last week, Lake was interviewed on Voice of America's Persian-language service through an interpreter. During the five-minute segment, she praised Trump repeatedly.   Lake lauded Trump's actions toward Iran, called him \"the president of peace\" and reiterated Trump's tenuous claims he had ended eight wars and conflicts.   \n   Lake said Trump was \"putting out fires\" throughout the world with a policy of \"peace through strength.\" She also castigated judges who ruled against Trump and the administration, citing an \"out-of-control judiciary,\" and she trashed former President Joe Biden's record, which she termed \"horrific.\" NPR reviewed her original remarks in English and the interpretation offered to viewers in Iran, the service's target audience.   \"VOA is telling the story of the brave Iranian people and their fight for freedom,\" Lake says in a written comment to NPR. \"That story cannot be told without sharing statements from President Trump or the support the Iranian people have for him.\"   The segment, part of a glowing one-hour special on Trump's first year back in the White House, was also broadcast on Voice of America's Chinese language service, in which her remarks could be heard in English.   Lake is a familiar pro-Trump guest on such conservative news outlets as Fox, Newsmax and OANN, where she shares baseless claims of election fraud and comments on topics like immigration and Venezuela. None of them have any direct link to her federal job.   Given Lake's role overseeing the parent agency of Voice of America, her appearance last week was a sharp departure for the network.   \n   In separate interviews, 11 current and former Voice of America journalists and officials at its federal parent, the U.S. Agency for Global Media, said they could not recall anything like it. Most spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing professional retribution, given ongoing links to the agency, its broadcasters or the federal government.   By law, the chief executive of the U.S. Agency for Global Media is required to respect what is often called a firewall, designed to shield editorial staffers and their news decisions from politics. Since late July, Lake has periodically fashioned herself as the agency chief, though she is currently signing her official emails as deputy CEO.   Critics say her recent appearance on Voice of America tramples on that firewall.   \"These are precisely the reasons why you would have a charter and why you would have to adhere to the highest principles of journalistic ethics — to avoid these kinds of situations,\" says David Kligerman, the former general counsel of the U.S. Agency for Global Media under both Trump and Biden.   During Trump's first term, Voice of America host Greta Van Susteren interviewed then-Vice President Mike Pence and twice interviewed President Trump during foreign trips, all in 2018. No one objected: Trump and Pence were powerful public officials. The interviews were newsworthy.   Veterans of the agency and Voice of America tell NPR that having their boss on the air in a partisan role is different.   \"It seems to contradict the spirit and the sense of the firewall,\" says Rick Stengel, the former top editor of Time magazine, who sat on the agency's governing board while serving in the U.S. State Department during the Obama administration.   \"Listening to Kari Lake, she sounded more like a press secretary for the president than the head of an independent news service,\" Stengel says. \"We never wanted it to sound like a state broadcaster in an authoritarian country that would air hagiographic biographies of the Dear Leader.\"   \n   After losing elections, Lake rises at broadcast agency   Lake is a former local TV news anchor turned unsuccessful MAGA candidate in Arizona, where she ran for both governor and U.S. Senate and lost. Early last year, Trump installed her atop the U.S. Agency for Global Media. But Lake's ability to lead the agency is being challenged in court.   Before taking office, Trump announced he wanted to name Lake to be the director of the Voice of America.   According to two journalists at the network with knowledge, Voice of America editors were nervous enough about her arrival that they half-jokingly discussed offering Lake her own show in hopes of saving the network from evisceration or being turned into a pro-Trump propaganda channel. (Those people spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.)   Yet Trump does not have the legal authority to appoint the agency's chief executive. That power rests with a bipartisan oversight board whose members are confirmed by the U.S. Senate, under laws designed to insulate the network from political interference.   Upon entering the White House, Trump dismissed the board members. That meant there was no legal way for him to install Lake or anyone else atop Voice of America.   Instead, last March, Trump issued an executive order that the agency be reduced to the bare minimum required by law. He named Lake as senior advisor to the U.S. Agency for Global Media. She testified that she held all but five percent of the power the agency's CEO would normally wield.   \n   Lake moved swiftly to lay off 85% of the workforce in response to Trump's executive order. Those staffers have been whipsawed by a series of court rulings that reinstated their jobs, followed by fresh rounds of layoffs.   Last July, the White House named Lake deputy CEO at her own urging, according to her testimony in court.   Lake said in a sworn affidavit that she became acting CEO in late July, though the White House made no formal announcement of it.   Trump has not nominated her to be CEO, which would require confirmation from the U.S. Senate. As NPR has reported, under the law it's not clear she is eligible to hold the position of acting CEO, either.   \n   Neither the U.S. Agency for Global Media nor the White House has responded to NPR's numerous requests for documentation of her appointment as acting CEO. Nor has Lake, for that matter.   \n   U.S. District Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth, who is presiding over a series of cases challenging her actions at the agency, has questioned Lake's honesty and the validity of the administration's legal defenses. He has ordered her to bring back enough employees to meet the expectations set by Congress when it put money aside for the agency. He has not yet ruled on the legality of Lake's authority.   Compelled to bring back some VOA journalists, Lake has emphasized the Persian-language service   In recalling some journalists to work, Lake has put a special emphasis on the Persian-language service, given the current upheaval and crackdown in Iran.   Lake's choice to run that service is a veteran former Voice of America journalist, Ali Javanmardi, who left the network in 2019, according to current and former colleagues. Javanmardi also has praised Trump on the air: \"Perhaps for the first time,\" Javanmardi told viewers this month, \"the leader of the free world is standing alongside the people of Iran.\" His X (formerly Twitter) feed and his LinkedIn profile display in the background a photograph of a bloodied but undaunted Trump just after the unsuccessful assassination attempt on his life in Butler, Pa.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The LinkedIn profile for Ali Javanmardi, who is overseeing the Voice of America's Persian-language service, features a photograph of President Trump moments after the unsuccessful assassination attempt in Butler, Pa. Under Javanmardi's leadership, the service has promoted Trump and kept his critics off the air.\n                \n                    AliJavanmardi's LinkedIn account/LinkedIn\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        AliJavanmardi's LinkedIn account/LinkedIn\n    \n\n   \n   Javanmardi has urged editors and producers not to book guests who may be critical of Trump, according to colleagues who spoke on condition they not be named. (They cited fears of workplace retaliation.)   NPR has also reviewed a text from a Voice of America journalist who said the Persian-language service canceled an appearance by a former Trump foreign policy adviser, Elliot Abrams, because he had been critical of the president on Iran. (Abrams did not respond to an email seeking comment.)   \n   In another instance, a journalist for Voice of America Persian told a foreign policy commentator that the network's management could not allow any critique of the president. The commentator declined to appear on air, the text exchange shows.   During the hour-long special on which Lake appeared, Voice of America Persian host Payam Yazdian offered effusive praise of Trump's return to the White House. Yazdian called Trump's first year back \"the start of an exciting period of national success, and the return of global respectability.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Voice of America Persian anchor Payam Yazdian presented a one-hour program last week that presented a glowing assessment of President Trump's first year in office for viewers in Iran. Kari Lake, who is running the network's federal parent agency, repeatedly praised the president in her appearance on the show.\n                \n                    Voice of America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Voice of America\n    \n\n   \n   Additionally, Javanmardi has discouraged coverage of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's last shah, according to two journalists with knowledge of events who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing concerns of professional reprisals.   Pahlavi has become a rallying point for some of those opposed to the current regime, even as the repressive record of Pahlavi's father repels many Iranians and Iranian-Americans.   \"Ignoring or sidelining [Pahlavi] is not neutrality, it's an editorial failure,\" wrote former BBC journalist Ali Hamedani, who runs his own Persian-language radio service in London.   Javanmardi blames the Iranian government for online criticism of his work.   \"In my new job at VOA, my primary mission is to ensure it aligns with the US foreign policy and conveys @POTUS's support for the people of Iran,\" he wrote in a social media post on Jan. 18.   Lake is backing him up.   \"We are not in the business of selecting Iran's political leadership. That would be irresponsible of any outside news organization,\" she writes in the statement to NPR. \"That decision belongs solely to Iran's 93 million citizens, who have a right to self-determination.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Iranians gather while blocking a street during a protest in Tehran, Iran on Jan. 9. The nationwide protests against failing government economic policies started in Tehran's Grand Bazaar in late December. The demonstrations spread to universities and other cities.\n                \n                    MAHSA/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        MAHSA/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Like Lake, Javanmardi's legal authority to direct news coverage appears shaky.   He has been described on the network's airwaves as a senior adviser overseeing Voice of America's Persian, Kurdish and Afghan television services.   According to three colleagues who spoke on condition of anonymity, however, Javanmardi works for the U.S Agency for Global Media, not Voice of America. His email address has a USAGM domain. (The colleagues spoke on condition of anonymity, citing fears of retribution.)   \n   As an employee of the parent agency, his involvement in news decisions could run afoul of the same firewall that critics say Lake ignored by appearing on Voice of America.   Javanmardi and USAGM did not respond to NPR's requests for comment or questions about his job or title.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Kari Lake, who at the time was running for one of Arizona's U.S. Senate seats, spoke at the Road to Majority conference in Washington, D.C. on June 21, 2024.  The conference host, Faith and Freedom Coalition, advocates for incorporation of Christianity in American government.\n                \n                    ALLISON BAILEY/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty/AFP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        ALLISON BAILEY/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty/AFP\n    \n\n   \n   Largely ignored by Lake, Congress moves to sustain international networks   In a rebuke of the Trump administration, House and Senate lawmakers have drafted spending bills that include $643 million for the U.S. Agency for Global Media for fiscal year 2026.  The House passed its version of the legislation earlier this month.   While that amount is far less than what Congress allocated in the past, it is four times what the Trump administration had requested for the agency, funds that Lake intended to use to shut it down.    The lawmakers also set aside money for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. It has operated on a shoestring since Lake sought to cut off its funds. Like Voice of America Persian, its Persian-language service, called Radio Farda, is aimed at audiences inside Iran.   When authorities severed access to the Internet, the network's executives appealed to the U.S. Agency for Global Media to use their shortwave and mediumwave radio transmitters in Kuwait and elsewhere.    Lake has repeatedly condemned Radio Free Europe for broadcasting into Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has cracked down on the independent press. In June, when the U.S. bombed Iran and the Iranian regime blocked web access, she did not allow Radio Farda access to the transmitters.   In a posting on Facebook on Jan. 13, Lake said she and Radio Free Europe CEO Steve Capus agreed \"we need to have a unified message so we are not sending mixed messages to the people of Iran.\" But she said Capus has not fulfilled his side of the bargain. (Capus and Radio Free Europe did not comment for this story.)   \n   Radio Farda still has not been allowed to use the transmitters.   Her refusal has frustrated some influential lawmakers.   \"It's been a week since the regime in Tehran blacked out the internet, and 10 months since USAGM blacked out its transmitters for Persian-language @RadioFarda_ from @RFERL,\" Republican Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky tweeted on Jan 15. \"What a waste of America's tremendous capacity to share the truth.\"   On a conservative commercial talk radio show last week, Lake called Radio Farda \"a propaganda site run by Radio Free Europe.\"   NPR's Ayda Pourasad and D. Parvaz contributed to this story.\n",

Pretti was shot multiple times Jan. 24 as Border Patrol officers tried to arrest him while he was recording immigration officers on his phone.   Blanche says the probe is separate from the Department of Homeland Security's shooting investigation of the incident.   \"It means talking to witnesses. It means looking at documentary evidence, sending subpoenas if you have to,\" Blanche told reporters at a news briefing Friday on multiple topics. \"And the Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, has the best experts in the world at this.\"   \n   Blanche gave no investigation timetable, nor did he commit to the release of body camera footage of the agents. He said the department's investigation would encompass events of that day as well as the days and weeks that preceded the Pretti shooting.   In a statement, Steve Schleicher, the Pretti family attorney, said: \"The family's focus is on a fair and impartial investigation that examines the facts around his murder.\"    Under questioning, Blanche said the fatal shooting of Good isn't receiving similar Justice Department scrutiny.   \"There are thousands, unfortunately, of law enforcement events every year where somebody is shot,\" he said. \"The Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice does not investigate every one of those shootings. There has to be circumstances or facts, or maybe unknown facts, but certainly circumstances that warrant an investigation.\"   Federal officials have excluded Minnesota investigators from assisting with reviews of both shootings, leading to a state lawsuit that seeks to require that evidence of the Pretti shooting be maintained. State authorities haven't ruled out bringing charges against federal officers after completing their own investigations.\n",

Today's top stories   President Trump plans to nominate Kevin Warsh to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve, replacing Jerome Powell when his term expires in May. Trump has repeatedly complained that Powell has been too timid about cutting rates. Here's what to know about Warsh.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Kevin Warsh (center) is President Trump's pick to lead the Federal Reserve.  Warsh is a former Fed governor who has echoed the president's call for lower interest rates.\n                \n                    Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Border czar Tom Homan is planning to pull some of the thousands of federal immigration agents out of Minnesota. After arriving in Minneapolis to oversee the government's immigration crackdown, Homan acknowledged some problems with operations, which led to federal agents fatally shooting two Americans this month.   🎧 Homan says he is revamping immigration enforcement to make it safer, more efficient and by the book. But these plans hinge on state and local level cooperation, says NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán. Homan explained that this would require the administration to have greater access to prisons and jails, which would mean fewer agents on the streets. Martínez-Beltrán says currently it feels like nothing has changed since Homan arrived. He has not provided a timeline for the drawdown, and federal agents continue to make arrests across the state.➡️ Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar announced yesterday that she is running for Minnesota governor. Her bid comes at a time when immigration enforcement is a key issue for the state, and several Republican leaders have entered the race.   \n   The Senate reached a deal last night to prevent large portions of the government from shutting down, while allowing time to negotiate changes to the Homeland Security bill. The deal, which Trump endorsed, would give Congress a two-week extension for negotiations. However, for this to work, the Senate will have to vote on these changes and send the measure back to the House.    🎧 The House is in recess until early next week, making a short-term shutdown all but inevitable, NPR's Ximena Bustillo tells Up First. It remains unclear whether the House will approve the new package. Bustillo says that if lawmakers act fast, they could minimize the effects of a shutdown because most federal offices are closed over the weekend.   The FBI has seized hundreds of thousands of 2020 election ballots from Fulton County, Ga., which includes most of Atlanta. The county is a hub of baseless fraud claims from that election cycle. Trump still falsely claims he won the 2020 election. The FBI's actions have sparked concerns surrounding the 2026 midterm elections.    🎧 NPR's Stephen Fowler covered Fulton County's 2020 election and its aftermath. He says he witnessed several conspiracy theories that have since been debunked — including that ballots cast before Election Day were fake. The county is one of the several places where Trump faced criminal charges for his efforts to overturn the election. The case was dropped last year. The Trump administration is inserting itself in election data in multiple ways, including using Social Security data to hunt for noncitizen information. Fowler says the administration's actions are intensifying tensions with state and local election officials who are worried about what steps the federal government will take this year.   \n   Today's listen   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                XX\n                \n                    Ryder / @ryd.der\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Ryder / @ryd.der\n    \n\n   \n   Destin Conrad has earned his first Grammy nomination for best progressive R&B album with his debut album, Love on Digital.

    "body": "\n      The Justice Department says it has released more than 3 million pages of materials tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, to comply with the law.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  All right, we turn now to news out of Washington, where the Justice Department says that it's releasing more than 3 million pages of materials tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This is happening under the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Congress passed that law late last year, requiring the Justice Department to make all of the Epstein files public. NPR justice correspondent Ryan Lucas is covering this and joins us now. Hi, Ryan.RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Hi there.CHANG: OK, so it was the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, who made this announcement today, right? What did he have to say?LUCAS: Well, Blanche said that the department is producing 3 million pages of materials today. He says that brings the total amount the department has released under the Epstein law to around 3.5 million pages. Here's a bit of what Blanche said.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TODD BLANCHE: Today's release marks the end of a very comprehensive document identification and review process to ensure transparency to the American people and compliance with the act.LUCAS: Now, he said more than 500 lawyers and other DOJ employees worked nights, weekends, also holidays to go through and review all of these materials. And there were a lot of files to review. Blanche said it was the equivalent of two Eiffel Towers' worth of pages if stacked up.CHANG: Wow.LUCAS: And NPR has a team of folks going through the latest files, looking for anything new or noteworthy.CHANG: That is a lot of files for the NPR team. OK, well, the Justice Department has gotten a lot of criticism for its handling of the Epstein files, like over its redactions that it has made throughout all of these files, failing to meet the deadline that was outlined under the law. Did Blanche respond to any of those criticisms?LUCAS: Yes. He spelled out, as the department has in the past, that redactions were made as the law allows for things like personally identifiable information of Epstein's victims or of pornographic material. Blanche said today that the department also redacted every woman who appears in any photo or any video, with the exception of Ghislaine Maxwell. She's Epstein's longtime confidant. She was convicted in 2021 of sex trafficking for helping Epstein abuse underage girls.Now, Blanche said that when the number of files is this big, mistakes are, as he put it, inevitable. The Justice Department has not yet provided a summary of the redactions that it made and the legal basis for them as the law requires. Blanche said that that will happen in due time.CHANG: OK. Well, the friendship between President Trump and Jeffrey Epstein has been a constant topic of conversation. They were friends for years before there was a falling out. Did Blanche address concerns that the Justice Department might be withholding embarrassing information about Trump in these files?LUCAS: Well, he was asked point-blank whether Trump was treated the same as everyone else who appears in the files and whether everything in there related to him is being released. It was a pertinent question, in part because Blanche himself previously served as Trump's personal defense attorney. Now, Blanche replied that the department complied with the law. He also denied that the DOJ protected Trump in any way. He also at one point said this.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BLANCHE: There's this mantra out there that, oh, you know, the Department of Justice is supposed to protect Donald J. Trump and that's what we were telling - that's not true. That was never the case. And we are always concerned about the victims.LUCAS: He said there's a hunger for information out there that won't be satisfied by the release of these files. Now, some of that hunger, it has to be said, has been fueled by Trump and other top administration officials, including at the Justice Department, because of the conspiracy theories that they've pushed over the years about what could be in these files.CHANG: And before we go, Ryan, I want to turn quickly to something that Blanche said about Minnesota. He now says the Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into the killing of Alex Pretti, right? Isn't that a reversal?LUCAS: Right. Since Pretti was shot dead by federal immigration agents last weekend, administration officials had publicly said DHS was leading the Pretti investigation. There was no FBI civil rights probe. Now we have, as you said, a reversal. Blanche says the FBI is investigating. It's in coordination with the Justice Department Civil Rights Division. I will say that the attorney general - the deputy attorney general also brushed off questions about whether the FBI would conduct a similar investigation into the killing of Renee Macklin Good, the other U.S. citizen fatally shot in Minneapolis by federal agents this month. Blanche said cases are handled differently depending on the circumstances.CHANG: That is NPR's Ryan Lucas. Thank you so much, Ryan.LUCAS: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF EMOTIONAL ORANGES SONG, \"TALK ABOUT US\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Leila Fadel speaks with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., ahead of a possible partial government shutdown Friday.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Let's take a closer look now at the deal struck between Democratic Senators and the White House with one of those lawmakers, Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. Good morning, Senator, and welcome back to the program.RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Good morning to you. Thanks for having me.FADEL: So this deal is ultimately an extension to negotiate on the reforms your party wants when it comes to ICE. I mean, do you think you will get the reforms you want and get this bill passed, given all the hurdles ahead, 'cause it will have to go back to the House, etc?BLUMENTHAL: I believe that we're on a path to avoid a shutdown but still have strong, strict reforms and restraints on an out-of-control, lawless and reckless agency that is inflicting physical violence and violation of rights, not only in Minneapolis, but all across the country. And the country is rightly outraged and angry. I am angry at what I have seen on the streets and neighborhoods and communities of America. So I think we will avert a shutdown and have two weeks as an opportunity to impose these kinds of reforms and restraints. But let me be very clear. If we don't get them, DHS will be shut down. I would shut down this agency.FADEL: When you say shut down this agency, you won't vote for any funding for it?BLUMENTHAL: I would deny any funding for it if the demands - I view them as demands - are not met because essentially, we are seeking to require masks off, body cameras on, basic respect for constitutional rights and accountability for when those rights are violated, just as would be applied to any use of force standards in state or local law enforcement.FADEL: Now, President Trump is publicly supporting this deal. Is he supporting the demands that you just lined out, you just outlined there?BLUMENTHAL: I have no great assurance that he will support these demands. But be very clear that a failure to meet these demands means that the Department of Homeland Security would be shut down. At least my vote would be to end funding for it. What we've done is to separate the other departments like transportation and the Department of Defense, so that Republicans can't make the issue paying our military or enabling passengers to fly safely. The focus will be on DHS and its lawless, unconstitutional actions, including avoidance of judicial warrants and the random sweeps, the draconian break-ins and trashing of people's homes, detention and arrests without judicial warrants. This kind of absolute lawlessness cannot be permitted in America.FADEL: Is two weeks enough to get - enough time to get everyone on the same page when it comes to DHS and immigration enforcement? I mean, what will these two weeks do?BLUMENTHAL: I believe that two weeks is more than adequate time for Republicans to agree with us on these strict reforms. And we cannot rely on executive branch action because, frankly, Donald trust - Trump is not to be trusted. He has not agreed to all of these reforms or even any of the significant ones. And so we have actually fought down the period of time to weeks. They wanted longer, but these kinds of overhauls of the agency are readily doable within that amount of time. And a first indication of their good faith is whether there will really be an independent investigation immediately.FADEL: An investigation into Alex Pretti's killing and Renee Good's killing?BLUMENTHAL: An investigation into the Pretti and Good killings and other kinds of physical assaults that essentially violate the law.FADEL: Do you get a sense of - I mean, give me a sense of how many of your Republican colleagues agree with these restrictions on ICE that you're seeking or you believe will come on side.BLUMENTHAL: You know, that's a great question, and I won't have the answer until I see what they're actually willing to agree to because, you know, we've seen a lot of talk. We now need action. The president is talking about downsizing the force in Minneapolis. We've yet to see it. The kinds of...FADEL: Well, actually, the president said he doesn't have plans to do that, and Tom Homan said that they do. So it's not even clear that that's the case.BLUMENTHAL: Well, let's see what happens in Minneapolis and whether Republicans are willing to agree to these reforms because if they don't, DHS would be shut down.FADEL: That's Richard Blumenthal, Democratic senator of Connecticut. Thank you for your time.BLUMENTHAL: Thank you.FADEL: We have asked Trump administration officials and Republican leaders in Congress to join us for an interview.

    "body": "\n      The government is set to shutdown at the end of the day Friday. Shutdowns have evolved in recent years from rare collapses of government function to increasingly frequent political tools.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  All right, another shutdown is on the horizon. Major swaths of the federal government will run out of money at midnight tonight. Agencies from the Pentagon to the Departments of Transportation, Health and Human Services and Homeland Security - they will all run out of money. Senators approved a spending package to get things reopened, and we're assuming that the legislation will get approved in the House.But why are we even talking about a shutdown at all? - because remember, people, funding the government is a basic constitutional responsibility for Congress. But shutdowns have become an increasingly common political tool. NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas and senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro have been digging into the politics of shutdowns, and they join us now. Hello to both of you.DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey there.SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa.CHANG: All right, Sam, let's start with you. I want to start with a very basic question. What is behind this upcoming shutdown?GRINGLAS: Well, it's the immigration enforcement tactics of the Trump administration. You know, this final group of spending bills were on track to pass on time and with bipartisan support. But the second deadly shooting by a federal immigration officer in Minneapolis upended all of that, and Democrats pledged to withhold their votes for the funding to try to extract some guardrails that would rein in some of these aggressive tactics.CHANG: OK, and Domenico, explain. Why force a government shutdown in order to get to a policy goal?MONTANARO: Well, like we've said many times before, life in the minority stinks. You have very few tools to use as leverage to try and extract any compromises, and this is one of the only ones they have. You know, I think Democrats learned with the shutdown toward the end of last year that they could win the blame game. That one was about elevating health care, introducing the idea that Republicans weren't going to extend health care subsidies. It's something people weren't really talking about much before that. Now there's an issue that's right in front of everyone's eyes and dominating the news with majorities in polls saying they disagree with the Trump administration's deportation tactics, which is actually easier political ground to stand on for Democrats.CHANG: Exactly. And, Sam, I want to go a little deeper into that because we have had shutdowns in the past, but these two are coming so close together. Is there something about this specific moment that's different from previous shutdowns?GRINGLAS: Take the 35-day shutdown over border wall funding in 2018 to 2019.CHANG: Oh, I remember.GRINGLAS: I remember watching House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, you know, negotiating with President Trump in the Oval Office in front of the TV cameras. I asked Drew Hammill, a top Pelosi aide at the time, how that moment was different from now.DREW HAMMILL: From a debate about a distant wall to your own neighborhood, to your own backyard - yeah, that's a different scenario.GRINGLAS: Now we're talking about the presence of a federal force sparking violence in an American city or, in the fall, people's health insurance premiums doubling or even tripling. That's really personal. This is also a moment where Congress has ceded so much of its authority to the executive, and as Domenico said, Democrats have really limited options to do anything about that. And as Drew Hammill told me, voters want and expect a fight.CHANG: Yeah, maybe, but Domenico, is that the fight that they want - a fight over a government shutdown?MONTANARO: Well, maybe, maybe not, but Democrats have shown their ability here, again, with the last shutdown and now in this moment, to be able to capitalize on Trump's vulnerabilities. And whether the left is happy with Democratic leaders efforts or not, I think what we're seeing here is that the center has moved left on how to conduct immigration enforcement. You're seeing moderate Republicans loudly oppose ICE's actions and against these jumps to conclusions we've seen by people like Kristi Noem, the Department of Homeland Security secretary, and Stephen Miller, a Trump deputy chief of staff.CHANG: All right, well, Sam, are Democrats in Congress looking at this funding fight over ICE any differently than the one we last talked about over health care subsidies?GRINGLAS: Well, we know Democrats are more unified than last time. Last fall, six Democrats broke with their party to end the stalemate despite only getting the promise of a vote on extending the subsidies. They were worried about the risks of a shutdown - federal workers missing paychecks, food stamps running out. Now five of those six were willing to risk another shutdown, and I got to catch up with one of them, Jacky Rosen of Nevada. And I asked her, what changed?JACKY ROSEN: ICE is out of control. Donald Trump is out of control. His tyrannical government, his cruel cabinet - who the hell do they think they are? We have a Bill of Rights.GRINGLAS: Democrats feel emboldened because what's happening in Minnesota strikes at something more fundamental about the direction of the country in a way that maybe the health subsidies debate just didn't.CHANG: OK, well, that's how Democrats might be feeling. What about Republicans?GRINGLAS: Yeah, we're in an era when congressional Republicans rarely criticize the Trump administration, but the images coming out of Minneapolis have made even more Republicans uneasy. Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina told reporters this week why he thinks members of his caucus are spooked.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)THOM TILLIS: It's terrible. It's making the president look bad on policies that he won on. He won on a strong message about immigration. And now nobody's talking about that. They're talking about the incompetence of the leader of the Homeland Security. These people are amateurs. They got to de-escalate there and treat these communities with some respect.MONTANARO: Yeah, and this has become a major concern within Republican ranks, as you can hear there. You know, this is an issue that Republicans had owned, and now it's a liability talking about immigration. Take a Fox News poll that was out this week - 6 in 10 voters it surveyed said ICE has been, quote, \"too aggressive.\" That's jumped since last summer.And it's not just because of progressives with strong opposition. Whites without college degrees jumped 14 points. Independents are up 22. Even Trump voters and Republican women were up, too, and that's in a survey where more than half approved of Trump on border security. But clearly ICE's tactics have been weighing Trump and the GOP down and made the narrative less about immigrants not coming to the country illegally and more about the harsh tactics used in trying to deport them. These are major red flags for Republicans in an election year and why we're seeing a shift.GRINGLAS: Though, I should say, openness to sweeping policy changes is far from universal among Republican lawmakers who have blasted Democrats for holding up funding. This is Senator Markwayne Mullin, Republican of Oklahoma.MARKWAYNE MULLIN: We're not going to keep ICE from doing their job. The American people wanted the president to enforce law and order, and ICE is doing their job.CHANG: But, Sam, I mean, is what we're seeing right now just illustrating the power of the shutdown, the polarization of politics, or do you think we're seeing something else entirely?GRINGLAS: I mean, I think it's a little bit all of the above, but I put this question to Republican Capitol Hill veteran Antonia Ferrier. Her old boss was the former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. He used to describe shutdown standoffs as box canyons, these narrow gorges with no exit on the other end, where you're making demands, and there's no way out.ANTONIA FERRIER: What I think we're seeing right now is markedly different. You can see it viscerally across America but also in the halls of Capitol Hill. There is just so much public attention and outrage that Democrats are demanding - and many Republicans agree - there has to be some kind of changes made.GRINGLAS: Still, Ailsa, we have seen so many instances of Republicans expressing discomfort over something - like, say, Trump's actions in Venezuela - only to back off after some tepid reassurances. And even if Republicans are amenable to some changes here, like with the health subsidies, those talks can still crumble. So in the end, will the power - or, I guess, legacy - of these shutdowns be tangible policy changes or really just directing the public's attention ahead of the midterms?MONTANARO: And all this in addition to the fact that prices are what voters have been saying have been driving their decisions.CHANG: Yeah.MONTANARO: ...And now Democrats putting Republicans on their heels on health care and immigration.CHANG: That is NPR's Domenico Montanaro and Sam Gringlas. Thanks to both of you.MONTANARO: You're welcome.GRINGLAS: Thanks.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

In a Truth Social post, Trump said \"To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.\"   The Venezuelan government responded with a statement saying Trump's comments violate international law and are a \"colonialist threat\" to the country's sovereignty.   \"No authority outside the Venezuelan institutional framework has the power to interfere with, block, or condition the use of international airspace,\" the statement said.   \n   As of Sunday afternoon, Flightradar24 shows planes continuing to fly in Venezuelan airspace.   This comes a day after the Senate and House Armed Services committees said they would look into the Pentagon after The Washington Post reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave an order to kill all crew members aboard a boat suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean in September. NPR has confirmed the Washington Post's reporting.   The military has carried out at least 21 strikes and killed at least 82 people on alleged drug boats as part of \"Operation Southern Spear,\" a campaign that the Trump administration says is aimed at tackling drug-trafficking.   Venezuela said in its statement that \"such statements represent an explicit use of force, which is prohibited by Article 2, paragraph 4 of the U.N. Charter of the United Nations.\"   Democrats have also strongly criticized the administration's strategy, saying the military didn't have enough evidence that the boats were carrying drugs before conducting the strikes. Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland, told ABC'S This Week on Sunday it's possible the military's actions could be considered a \"war crime,\" and that Hegseth should be held accountable.   \"They've never presented the public with the information they've got here,\" Van Hollen said, \"But it could be worse than that, right? If that theory is wrong, then it's plain murder.\"   \n   However, Republican Senator Eric Schmitt, a member of the Armed Services Committee, said on Sunday Morning Futures on Fox News that Trump is acting \"well within his Article 2 powers\" when it comes to curbing drug smuggling by striking the boats.   \"I think it's a two part strategy,\" Schmitt said. \"One is to get rid of the precursors that are coming from China, and then take out the cartels that are distributing this and bringing it to the United States of America.\"   Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have expressed frustration at Trump's stance on Venezuela, and that the Trump administration conducted the strikes without legislative approval.   \"Trump's reckless actions towards Venezuela are pushing America closer and closer to another costly foreign war,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer posted on X on Saturday, hours after Trump's post about Venezuelan airspace.   Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former Trump ally, also posted on Saturday, saying \"Reminder, Congress has the sole power to declare war.\"\n",

Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters afterward that the session was productive but work remains in the search for a peace deal.   \"It's not just about the terms that ends fighting,\" Rubio said. \"It's about also the terms that set up Ukraine for long-term prosperity. ... I think we built on that today, but there's more work to be done.\"   The high-level negotiations in Florida came days before President Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, will be in Moscow to meet with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.   \n   Rubio, Witkoff, and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, represented the American side in the talks, held at a sensitive time as Ukraine continues to push back against Russian forces that invaded in 2022 while dealing with a domestic corruption scandal.   Diplomats have focused on revisions to a proposed U.S.-authored plan that was developed in negotiations between Washington and Moscow. That plan has been criticized as being too weighted toward Russian demands. As the meeting began Sunday, Rubio focused on reassuring Ukraine.   \"The end goal is, obviously, not just the end of the war,\" Rubio said. \"But it's also about securing an end to the war that leaves Ukraine sovereign and independent and with an opportunity at real prosperity.\"   \"This is not just about peace deals,\" the top American diplomat said as the teams sat down at the Shell Bay Club, a golf and racket club developed by Witkoff in Hallandale Beach.   Rustem Umerov, head of Ukraine's security council, responded to Rubio by expressing his country's appreciation for U.S. efforts, a message geared toward Trump, who has at times claimed that Ukraine has not been sufficiently grateful for U.S. assistance during the war.   \"U.S. is hearing us,\" Umerov said. \"U.S. is supporting us. U.S. is working beside us.\"   \n   Umerov, who appeared with Rubio to deliver a brief statement to reporters after the talks, underscored Ukraine's gratitude for U.S. support during nearly 4-year war. But the senior official offered no hints about what, if any, progress was made during the talks.   \"Our objective is a prosperous, strong Ukraine,\" Umerov said. \"We discussed all the, important, matters that are important for Ukraine, for Ukrainian people, and U.S. was super supportive.\"   Umerov has been involved in ongoing talks. But until now, Ukraine's head negotiator had been Andrii Yermak, the powerful chief of staff of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. On Friday, Zelenskyy announced the resignation of Yermak, after his home was searched by anti-corruption investigators.   Zelenskyy's government has been roiled by fallout from a scandal over $100 million embezzled from the energy sector through kickbacks paid by contractors, causing newfound domestic pressures for Zelenskyy.   It was only a week ago that Rubio had met with Yermak in Geneva, with each side saying the talks had been positive in putting together a revised peace plan.   \n   Among the other members of the Ukrainian delegation were Andrii Hnatov, the head of Ukraine's armed forces, and presidential adviser Oleksandr Bevz.   The plan, which Trump has since played down as a \"concept\" or a \"map\" to be \"fine-tuned,\" would have imposed limits on the size of Ukraine's military, blocked the country from joining NATO and required Ukraine to hold elections in 100 days. Negotiators have indicated the framework has changed, but it's not clear how its provisions have been altered.   It had initially envisioned Ukraine ceding the entire eastern region of the Donbas to Russia — a sticking point for Kyiv.   Trump said on Tuesday that he would send Witkoff and perhaps Kushner to Moscow this week to meet with Putin about the plan. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, in comments published Sunday on Russian state television, said Putin would see Witkoff before Thursday, when Putin departs for India.   \n   Both Witkoff and Kushner, like Trump, hail from the world of real estate that values dealmaking over the conventions of diplomacy. The pair also were behind a 20-point proposal that led to a ceasefire in Gaza.   Zelenskyy wrote on X that the Ukrainian delegation would \"swiftly and substantively work out the steps needed to end the war.\"   In his nightly address on Saturday, Zelenskyy said the American side was \"demonstrating a constructive approach.\"   \"In the coming days it is feasible to flesh out the steps to determine how to bring the war to a dignified end,\" he said.   Attacks continue despite diplomatic efforts to end the war   On Saturday, Russian drone and missile attacks in and around Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, killed at least three people and wounded dozens more, officials said. Fresh attacks overnight into Sunday killed one person and wounded 19 others, including four children, local officials said, when a drone hit a nine-story apartment block in the city of Vyshhorod in the Kyiv region.   \n   In a post on Telegram Sunday, Zelenskyy said Russia had attacked Ukraine with 122 strike drones and ballistic missiles.   \"Such attacks occur daily. This week alone, Russians have used nearly 1,400 strike drones, 1,100 guided aerial bombs and 66 missiles against our people. That is why we must strengthen Ukraine's resilience every day. Missiles and air defense systems are necessary, and we must also actively work with our partners for peace,\" Zelenskyy said.   \"We need real, reliable solutions that will help end the war,\" he added.   After Ukraine claimed responsibility for damaging a major oil terminal on Saturday near the Russian port of Novorossiysk, owned by the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, Kazakhstan told Ukraine on Sunday to stop attacking the Black Sea terminal. The CPC pipeline, which starts in Kazakhstan and ends at the Novorossisyk terminal, handles a large proportion of Kazakhstan's oil exports.   \n   \"We view what has occurred as an action harming the bilateral relations of the Republic of Kazakhstan and Ukraine, and we expect the Ukrainian side to take effective measures to prevent similar incidents in the future,\" Kazakhstan's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.   Madhani reported from Washington. Associated Press writer Elise Morton in London contributed to this report.\n",

Twenty-year-old Sarah Beckstrom has died. Twenty-four-year-old Andrew Wolfe is in critical condition. The suspect in custody is an Afghan national who entered the U.S. through Operation Allies Welcome. In 2021, his application for asylum was approved under the Trump administration. President Trump has called for several measures, like a permanent pause on migration from, quote, \"all third world countries\" and denaturalizing those who, quote, \"undermine domestic tranquility.\" NPR's Ron Elving joins us. Ron, thanks for being with us.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.SIMON: Those would be sweeping changes. Can the president really do that?ELVING: The president can say what he wants to say. He can make everyone respond to whatever he's proposing. He can steer the conversation and, to some degree, control the agenda. He can also issue, as we know, his executive orders and make elements of the executive branch do things. But the scale of these threats and the use of terms, such as permanent pause or third world countries or disturbing domestic tranquility - let's just say there would be a lot to work out in the enforcement. And that's assuming any such effort survived in federal courts.Now, Trump did attempt something like this with his so-called Muslim ban early in his first term. That caused great confusion and disruption and court resistance until, finally, a third revision got the blessing of the Supreme Court on a 5-4 vote.SIMON: How popular are President Trump's immigration policies with Americans right now?ELVING: They have been popular. Immigration has been his best issue with voters this year, but his approval numbers on immigration have fallen lately, along with his polls in general. There's been less attention paid to the southern border in the media and lots of negative notice given to ICE raids and deportations.Now this tragic National Guard story could turn things around again, like in 2015. You may remember it was exactly 10 years ago this time of year that Trump, then just a candidate for the Republican nomination, proposed a ban on all Muslims entering the U.S. That, too, is in response to a shocking gun crime that was attributed to immigrants. And lo and behold, that posting on Twitter boosted Trump back to the lead in major polls of Republicans who were seeking the White House in that cycle. It's possible Trump has not forgotten how all that played out for him back then.SIMON: Another critical question of the week, what is the status of that 28-point plan the U.S. presented to Ukraine with a Thanksgiving deadline?ELVING: The plan was close to a set of proposals from a Russian diplomat named Dmitriev. What that plan gave Russia was parts of eastern Ukraine that the Russian army has occupied but also other parts that they have not. Now, that's a big deal. It's largely what the war has been about. So Ukraine has parried that thrust for now, and the question is whether the Russians can live with something less.Putin made it clear on Friday that he expects to gain a lot of territory in this deal, and he scoffed at suggestions that Trump's negotiator, Steve Witkoff, had been coaching the Russians or helping them deal with Trump. And, of course, not helping this process is that Andrii Yermak, a top negotiator and one of the most powerful men in Ukraine, resigned yesterday in the wake of a major corruption scandal.SIMON: Ron, what are you watching for in Congress between now and the holidays?ELVING: The biggest thing right now is health care - what to do about expiring subsidies for health insurance under Obamacare that are going to cause enormous spikes in what people have to pay and cost some people their insurance. That was the issue in the shutdown this fall, and it has not been resolved. Last week, Trump said those subsidies might just have to be extended for a time, maybe just long enough to get past the 2026 midterm elections. That would be politically expedient. But many House Republicans are digging in their heels - do not want to be seen as bailing out Obamacare, even if temporarily. And without a resolution on this issue, we may well be right back in government shutdown early next year.SIMON: Ron Elving, thanks so much.ELVING: Thank you, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "\n      President Trump says he's closing Venezuela's airspace and further limiting immigration to the U.S. Lawmakers are facing a deadline over extending the subsidies for Obamacare.   \n\n    LAUREN FRAYER, HOST:  President Donald Trump heads back to Washington after spending Thanksgiving at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. He's been posting about Afghan nationals and immigration following the attack last week on two National Guard members near the White House. It was an attack that fatally wounded one of them. Additionally, Trump has said that Venezuela's airspace is closed. NPR White House correspondent Deepa Shivaram joins us now. Good morning, Deepa.DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: Hey there.FRAYER: So first, a fact-check - can the U.S. president close another country's airspace?SHIVARAM: Yeah. I mean, it's a fair question, Lauren, because we don't really have a lot of details or follow-up from the White House about this social media post from Trump that came over the weekend. And all the president said is that the airspace, quote, \"above and surrounding Venezuela,\" should be considered \"closed in its entirety.\" And his post was addressed to airlines, pilots, drug dealers and human traffickers. And that's pretty much all we've heard, no other details or any clarification. Is this new policy? You know, what did the president mean by this?The bottom line, though, is that the president does not have the authority to close another country's airspace. Though I will note that recently, the FAA, which is the Federal Aviation Administration - they did warn that airspace over Venezuela could potentially be hazardous, but that doesn't mean that the airspace is closed.FRAYER: Well, how has Venezuela responded?SHIVARAM: Yeah. The Venezuelan government, you know, said it forcefully rejects the president's statement. They called it a colonial threat that undermines Venezuela's sovereignty. Really no mincing words there - and, you know, keep in mind - this is what's important - this is all coming as the U.S. has conducted multiple strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea, the Eastern Pacific, on these boats that the U.S. government says are carrying drugs, and dozens of people have been killed in these strikes.And then on top of that, Trump has also recently indicated that the U.S. would stop drug traffickers by land as well. And he recently declared the government of Nicolas Maduro, who leads Venezuela, as a terrorist organization. So the tension on this issue has really escalated here.FRAYER: Deepa, switching gears - Trump said that he was requesting 500 more National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., following that shooting last week. Is that happening?SHIVARAM: Right. So the president announced he was going to add 500 more National Guard troops, like you said, to D.C. This happened shortly after the attack on guard members outside the White House - nearby the White House earlier this week. That plan appears to remain in place. Those 500 new guard members will join about the 2,000 guard members who are already in the city.And there is a new development, though, from the weekend, which is that the government has also declared that every group of National Guard members patrolling Washington, D.C, will also be accompanied by at least one D.C. police officer. The details of this - a little unclear. But a police officer who spoke to NPR on the condition of anonymity said that D.C. police officers would be getting overtime pay to do this work, so it's not interfering with their already day-to-day duties.FRAYER: And the suspect accused of shooting those two National Guard members is an Afghan national, according to authorities. He lived in Washington state. And now the president says he wants more restrictions on immigrants because of this shooting. What exactly does President Trump want to do?SHIVARAM: Yeah. Well, the president, you know, posted on social media on his platform Truth Social, and he said that he wants to, quote, \"permanently pause migration from all third-world countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover.\" He commented that reverse migration is the answer here. In the immediate aftermath of that shooting, you know, Trump said that he wanted every Afghan who entered to the U.S. after U.S. troops pulled out of Kabul in 2021 - he wanted them to be reexamined. And remember, this happened in the Biden administration, so he's laying a lot of blame on former President Joe Biden.There really isn't much detail about what that means - the timeline of this, who would be in charge. There's already a lot of security, stringent examination of people who are coming into this country. They are being vetted, but all asylum decisions just in the last day or two have been halted to ensure more vetting and screening, and that's what the president is hoping for.FRAYER: And the president and lawmakers come back this week to another pressing problem that has yet to be resolved, and that's the extension of the enhanced subsidies for Obamacare. What's the latest on that?SHIVARAM: Yeah. Remember that this was the issue that really propelled the government to shut down just a month ago. Right now, Congress is pretty divided on how to do it. There's even some division among GOP members. I think the thing to watch out for, though, is to see how the White House and President Trump will weigh in on this because Republicans, like I said, aren't really on the same page here.FRAYER: That's NPR's White House correspondent, Deepa Shivaram.

In April, the White House announced it was withholding some $790 million in federal funds from Northwestern while the government investigated the claims. University interim President Henry Bienen said in a statement to university personnel that \"the payment is not an admission of guilt,\" according to the school newspaper The Daily Northwestern.   Earlier this month, Cornell reached a deal requiring the university to pay $60 million to unfreeze $250 million withheld by the Trump administration over alleged civil rights violations. The private Ivy League university said the settlement did not come \"at the cost of compromising our values or independence.\"   Per the agreement, Northwestern will pay out the $75 million over time through 2028 and \"shall maintain clear policies and procedures relating to demonstrations, protests, displays, and other expressive activities, as well as implement mandatory antisemitism training for all students, faculty, and staff,\" according to the DOJ.   Education Secretary Linda McMahon called the settlement \"a huge win\" for higher education.   \"The deal cements policy changes that 'will protect students and other members of the campus from harassment and discrimination,' and it recommits the school to merit-based hiring and admissions,\" she said in a statement.   \n   \"The reforms reflect bold leadership at Northwestern, and they are a roadmap for institutional leaders around the country that will help rebuild public trust in our colleges and universities,\" she added.   An explainer posted to the university's website said that the school decided to negotiate an agreement rather than take a chance in court, calling the cost of a legal fight \"too high and the risks too grave.\"   Northwestern's Bienen said in a video statement that the school would retain its academic freedom and autonomy from the federal government.   \"There were several red lines that I, the board of Trustees and university leadership refused to cross. I would not have signed anything that would have given the federal government any say in who we hire, what they teach, who we admit or what they study,\" Bienen said.   \"Put simply, Northwestern runs Northwestern.\"\n",

The president explained his decision on social media by posting that \"according to many people that I greatly respect,\" Hernandez was \"treated very harshly and unfairly.\"   In March of last year, Hernandez was convicted in U.S. court of conspiring to import cocaine into the U.S.A. He had served served two terms as the leader of the Central American nation of roughly 10 million people.   \n   Hernandez has been appealing his conviction and serving time at the U.S. Penitentiary, Hazelton in West Virginia.   \n   A lawyer for Hernandez, Renato C. Stabile, expressed gratitude for Trump's actions.   \"A great injustice has been righted and we are so hopeful for the future partnership of the United States and Honduras,\" Stabile said. \"Thank you President Trump for making sure that justice was served. We look forward to President Hernandez's triumphant return to Honduras.\"   A separate lawyer for Hernandez, Sabrina Shroff, declined comment.   The post was part of a broader message by Trump backing Nasry \"Tito\" Asfura for Honduras' presidency, with Trump saying the U.S. would be supportive of the country if he wins. But if Asfura loses the election this Sunday, Trump posted that \"the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is.\"   Asfura, 67, is making his second run for president for the conservative National Party. He was mayor of Tegucigalpa and has pledged to solve Honduras' infrastructure needs. But he has previously been accused of embezzling public funds, allegations that he denies.   In addition to Asfura, there are two other likely contenders for Honduras' presidency: Rixi Moncada, who served as the finance and later defense secretary before leaving to run for president for the incumbent democratic socialist Libre party, and Salvador Nasralla, a former television personality who is making his fourth bid for the presidency, this time as the candidate for the Liberal Party.   \n   Trump has framed Honduras' election as trial for democracy, suggesting in a separate Truth Social post that if Asfura loses, the country could go the way of Venezuela and fall under the influence of that country's leader, Nicolás Maduro.   Trump has sought to apply pressure on Maduro, ordering a series of strikes against boats suspected of carrying drugs, building up the U.S. military presence in the Caribbean with warships including the Navy's most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford.   \n   The U.S. president has not ruled out taking military action or covert action by the CIA against Venezuela, though he has also floated that he was open to speaking with Maduro.   Outgoing Honduran President Xiomara Castro has leaned into a leftist stance, but she has kept a pragmatic and even cooperative attitude in dealing with the U.S. administration and she has received visits from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Army Gen. Laura Richardson, when she was the commander of U.S. Southern Command. The president has even backed off his threats to end Honduras' extradition treaty and military cooperation with the U.S.   Under Castro, Honduras has also received its citizens deported from the U.S. and acted as a bridge for deported Venezuelans who were then picked up by Venezuela in Honduras.   Argentine President Javier Milei, a staunch admirer of Trump, also gave his support to Asfura in Honduras on Friday.   \"I fully support Tito Asfura, who is the candidate who best represents the opposition to the leftist tyrants who have destroyed Honduras,\" the libertarian president said on his X account.\n",

    "body": "\n      Maryland is one of the most heavily leaning Democratic states in the nation and it's one of the few that could redistrict to help their party win Congress by countering Republicans. However, so far, the idea hasn't been well-receive.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  As President Trump pushes Republican-led states to redraw their district maps for next year's congressional elections, Democrats are looking at where they might counter with their own redistricting. In Maryland, the Democratic governor has created a commission to consider redistricting and making recommendations, but only one of the state's eight House members is a Republican. WYPR's Sarah Petrowich reports there are people in both parties who don't want to go after that seat.SARAH PETROWICH, BYLINE: With a Democratic governor and party control in both chambers of the state Legislature, Maryland is one of the bluest states in the country, and it's one of just a handful of blue states that could redistrict before the midterms. Governor Wes Moore created a commission on the idea, and it's drawn big online crowds. There were the expected objections from Republicans. One was Barbara Lafferty (ph), from the district with the state's only Republican U.S. House member.BARBARA LAFFERTY: If you take away that one congressional seat, for me, I have no voice.PETROWICH: Democrats lined up to support redistricting, arguing it's a way to push back against the Trump administration. But even some Democrats have doubts. Barbara Osborn Kreamer, a former legislator, said she hopes to just vote out the Republican, Representative Andy Harris, without a new map.BARBARA OSBORN KREAMER: Personally, it's an outrage to be represented by Andy Harris at this time, but we are working very hard in Hartford County to increase our base of volunteers, increase our activism.PETROWICH: In all, Maryland's House delegation has seven Democrats and one Republican. Lawmakers actually drew an 8-0 map a few years ago, but it was blocked by the courts. Then they quickly drew the current map without much public input. Governor Moore says he wants to hear from the public now, though he hasn't explicitly called for redistricting. But another leading Democrat, Senate president Bill Ferguson, said in an interview with WYPR in Baltimore, that a new map could die in the court again, and the current one is good enough.BILL FERGUSON: We are sending, from my perspective, seven Democrats to Washington to fight on behalf of Marylanders, and I think that's an important feature of where we are.PETROWICH: In an interview, the Republican Congressman Andy Harris said he opposes mid-decade redistricting and warns that if Democrats overreach, they could end up losing ground.ANDY HARRIS: Not only could a new map be thrown out now, but the current map could be adjudicated by the court as one that is unduly partisan and force it to be redrawn to have two or three Republicans in Congress from Maryland.PETROWICH: Across the country, it's unclear which party will win the redistricting battle, especially as court challenges are pending. Texas Republicans were quick to answer Trump's call for redistricting, and California Democrats were quick to counter it. But some other states have been more hesitant, like Maryland. John Willis teaches public policy at the University of Baltimore and is a former Democratic secretary of state in Maryland. He says it makes sense for Democrats here to keep their options open as a deterrent to Republicans elsewhere.JOHN WILLIS: Why not be part of the conversation and tell the other states on the other side that if you're going to go to extreme lengths, you know, maybe we will, too. That's - it's an OK thing to say.PETROWICH: But he noted that trying to redraw one district could make the others more competitive.WILLIS: There are often unintended consequences. The public may, in fact, you know, vote differently than you think they will.PETROWICH: The governor's Redistricting Advisory Commission has at least one more meeting on the calendar. Moore could call on lawmakers to consider redistricting before the end of the year or when they meet as scheduled in January.For NPR News, in Baltimore, I'm Sarah Petrowich.(SOUNDBITE OF PAVEL DOVGAL'S \"NIBIRU\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

Joseph Edlow, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), said Friday night that the agency is pausing decisions \"until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.\"   \"The safety of the American people always comes first,\" Edlow wrote on X.   The decision follows President Trump's promise of a sharp crackdown on immigration from countries he described as \"third world.\"   \n   Writing on social media on Thursday night, Trump railed against immigrants from impoverished nations, accusing them of being a burden on the nation's welfare system and \"preying\" on natural-born citizens.   \"I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover,\" he wrote on Truth Social.   \n   \"Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.\"   The Trump administration is already deporting some immigrants, either to their countries of origin or to third countries, many of which are paid to receive them. Venezuelans were deported from the U.S. to El Salvador, a number of migrants were sent to Eswatini and South Sudan, and Rwanda has agreed to accept deportees.   Edlow wrote on social media Thursday that he had been directed to conduct \"a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern.\"   He did not say which countries this would entail, and the USCIS did not respond to an NPR request for comment. But a June White House proclamation placed a travel ban on 12 countries of concern.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A makeshift memorial of flowers and American flags stands outside the Farragut West Metro station on Saturday in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Andrew Leyden/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Leyden/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   These included many African nations suffering from conflict and terrorism such as Chad, Sudan and Somalia — as well as other countries, such as Afghanistan. Another 7 countries were slapped with partial restrictions.    \n   In a statement to CNN, the Department of Homeland Security said it had already halted all immigration requests stemming from Afghanistan and was in the process of reviewing \"all\" asylum cases approved under former President Biden.   The department did not respond to an NPR request for comment.   History of anti-immigrant sentiment   The president's latest comments against immigration was sparked by the revelation that the alleged shooter was identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal — a 29-year-old Afghan national who had worked with the CIA to fight the Taliban in his native country and was admitted into the United States in 2021 as a result of his service. In a Thanksgiving Day call with servicemembers, Trump described the shooting as a terrorist attack and the shooter as a \"savage monster.\"   He blamed the Biden administration for Lakanwal's entry to the United States and for a general failure of the immigration system.   \"For the most part, we don't want 'em,\" he said, referring broadly to immigration seekers as gang members, mentally ill and previously incarcerated.   \n   Trump ran both successful White House campaigns on a pledge to crack down on illegal immigration, targeting at various points migrants from countries including Mexico and Somalia.   Speaking to reporters on Thursday after the Thanksgiving call, Trump widened his attack to focus not just on the alleged shooter but to rail against immigration to the U.S. and immigrants in general.   When asked by a reporter about the fact that as a former CIA asset, Lakanwal had been vetted, Trump repeatedly berated the reporter as \"stupid.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                People detained earlier in the day are taken to a parking lot on the far north side of the city before being transferred to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility on Oct. 31, 2025, in Chicago.\n                \n                    Jamie Kelter Davis/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jamie Kelter Davis/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Asked by another reporter whether he blamed all Afghans for the alleged actions of one, Trump said: \"No, but there's a lot of problems with Afghans.\"   Trump then turned his attention to immigrants from Somalia, who he has repeatedly accused of being gang-affiliated and \"taking over\" Minnesota — home to the nation's largest Somali community.   \n   Questioned about what Somalis had to do with the D.C. shooting, Trump said: \"Nothing.\" But, he added, \"Somalians have caused a lot of trouble.\" .   Later on social media, he described \"Somalian gangs\" in Minnesota as \"roving the streets looking for 'prey' as our wonderful people stay locked in their apartments and houses hoping against hope that they will be left alone.\"   Officials for the United Nations on Friday criticized Trump's call for sweeping halts to immigration seekers.   \"They are entitled to protection under international law, and that should be given due process,\" U.N. human rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence told reporters in Geneva.\n",

    "body": "\n      A recent NPR/PBS News/Marist poll found nearly 6-in-10 voters say President Trump's top priority should be lowering prices. That concern is being expressed loudly in the swing state of Wisconsin.   \n\n    LAUREN FRAYER, HOST:  Affordability. That's a word we will hear a lot of for the next 12 months. It's what voters say is a top concern, and it could be consequential in the swing state of Wisconsin. Reporters Chuck Quirmbach and Maayan Silver with member station WUWM join us now from Milwaukee. Welcome to the program.MAAYAN SILVER, BYLINE: Thank you.CHUCK QUIRMBACH, BYLINE: Thank you.FRAYER: So what are you both hearing from voters?SILVER: How cost of living are affecting people? I stopped by a turkey giveaway where people talked about struggling with basic needs and really what they want politicians to do about it.QUIRMBACH: Yeah. And I've been talking with folks about the Affordable Care Act and the expectation here that for hundreds of thousands of people covered under this Obama-era law, health care will be less affordable next year.FRAYER: And, Chuck, you've been following some of the events that Democrats are already holding around the state about health care affordability. What are they focusing on?QUIRMBACH: Well, the prediction that premiums are going up in January and that subsidies, including a federal tax credit that the state of Wisconsin says saves the average Care Act enrollee about $650 per month, may expire at the end of December. About 275,000 people here could be affected. One of them, freelance writer Nancy Peske, spoke at a news conference held by Wisconsin Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin. Peske says she may also have to pay additional costs for her son, who just landed a job with no health coverage.NANCY PESKE: So he's going to have such an astronomical premium that I'm probably going to have to pay that, too. So, yeah, it's going to be very tight.FRAYER: That's one concern. There's also the cost of living in general. Maayan, what are you hearing from some of the people you spoke with at this food giveaway that you mentioned?SILVER: Yeah. There were plenty of people in line at the turkey giveaway who directly blamed Trump for rising costs, who said they'd be voting for Democrats. But I also found some people who said they didn't foresee voting. I talked to Sharol Britton (ph). She's a 57-year-old who's been struggling financially. She gets food stamps, is on supplemental security income. And these days, she's sleeping in a van. She used to vote for Democrats, but now says she's fed up with all politicians.SHAROL BRITTON: The Trump administration, Democrat, Republican, liberal, right wing, left wing, back wing, horizontal wing, I don't give a freak. Get your stuff together, period.SILVER: Britton doesn't plan to vote until, in her opinion, politicians stop focusing on the 1% and start thinking more about people like her.FRAYER: And if voters like her stay home, that could really matter for congressional races. Chuck, tell us about some of those.QUIRMBACH: Well, the GOP has a 6-2 majority in House seats here, with Democrats hoping next year to unseat Republican Derrick Van Orden in western Wisconsin and Bryan Steil in the district south of Milwaukee. Also Republican House member Tom Tiffany from northern Wisconsin is running for governor. It's an open seat as Democratic incumbent Tony Evers is retiring. Van Orden, Steil and Tiffany have all criticized the ACA, or Affordable Care Act. The hazard in doing so is that, according to a recent polling by Marquette University, 58% of Wisconsin voters back extending the Care Act subsidies. But the polling also says the GOP Congress members' stance seems to be in line with the views of the majority of Republican voters here. Brian Norby runs an engineering firm and is chairman of the Jefferson County Republican Party west of Milwaukee. Norby says the ACA's enhanced tax credits are a political football.BRIAN NORBY: Now they're essentially being used as a political tool to heighten up the Democratic base to come out and vote. So why should we continue to extend them when they're designed by the Democratic Party?FRAYER: OK. So President Trump won Wisconsin by just under 30,000 votes in large part because of these pocketbook issues. And now, one year later, NPR polling shows that nearly 6 in 10 Americans say the Trump administration should focus on lowering prices. Maya, what are you hearing from Trump voters about this?SILVER: So sometimes voters I talked to said that economic woes, for instance, the effect of the government shutdown, were exaggerated. Others told me their budgets are tight sometimes, but they generally gave a lot of grace to Trump and his administration. That includes Aaron Eckhart (ph). He's the president of a home building company. He's also a Republican who voted for Trump. And he says of the economy...AARON ECKHART: So I think it's turning around.SILVER: So you think that President Trump is delivering on the promises that he made to make life more affordable?ECKHART: Correct. Promises made, promises kept.SILVER: Other Republicans I spoke with say that Trump had only been in office this term for a year and that he could still right the ship.FRAYER: So is affordability going to stay a strong issue in Wisconsin for the next, you know, 11 months until the election? Chuck.QUIRMBACH: Well, it might depend on what, if anything, the White House and Congressional Republicans come up with on the Affordable Care Act. Senate Republicans have promised to vote on extending the subsidies by next month. Wisconsin Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin says she's willing to work with, quote, any Johnny-come-lately to help families avoid higher costs come January 1.SILVER: And when it comes to higher costs overall, I'd say that Wisconsin is really a tale of two states, urban and rural, red and blue. And while voters around the state are concerned with prices, some really have unique concerns. There's manufacturers around the state grappling with tariffs. There's Wisconsin's big agricultural center. It's the dairy state that everyone knows about, but it also has a sizable soybean, corn, ginseng crops. So it's also the number one cranberry-producing state in the country, which is really relevant for this time of year. These farmers and rural voters have long been loyal backers of President Trump. But in part because of tariffs, Democrats are really trying to make inroads there.FRAYER: That's Maayan Silver and Chuck Quirmbach of NPR member station WUWM in Milwaukee. Thank you.MAAYAN SILVER AND CHUCK QUIRMBACH: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF JOAN SHELLEY SONG, \"OVER AND EVEN\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

President Trump on Sunday said he spoke to the families of the National Guard members and has invited both families to the White House.   Here is what we know.   D.C. police heighten security measures for troops   Federal authorities and the Metropolitan Police Department confirmed Saturday that every group of National Guards patrolling the city will be accompanied by at least one D.C. police officer, though details were scant. (The development was first reported by The Washington Post.)   \n   According to a police official who spoke to NPR on condition of anonymity, because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, the officers are to draw overtime pay so that they won't be diverted from current policing assignments.   The order does not apply to areas which the police department does not patrol, such as the national monuments, the U.S. Capitol, or D.C. transit locations, which are policed by other law enforcement agencies.      National Guard member Sarah Beckstrom remembered   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Community members prepare a portrait of West Virginia National Guard Specialist Sarah Beckstrom for a vigil in her honor at the town hall on Friday in Webster Springs, W.Va.\n                \n                    Jeff Swensen/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jeff Swensen/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Sarah Beckstrom, 20, of Summersville, W.Va., joined the service in 2023. Beckstrom's father, Gary, called her his \"baby girl\" and said she had \"passed to glory\" in a Facebook post on Thursday.   West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey on Friday called for residents to hold a moment of silence for the two victims of the shooting, as both were deployed as part of that state's National Guard.   Morrisey said in a statement Friday that Beckstrom had made the \"ultimate sacrifice\" in service to her state and the nation. He added that both Beckstrom and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, had stepped forward and volunteered for the mission in D.C.   Morrisey also said that Wolfe remains in \"very critical condition.\"   \n   \"These two West Virginia heroes were serving our country and protecting our nation's capital when they were maliciously attacked,\" Morrisey said. \"Their courage and commitment to duty represent the very best of our state.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A small memorial of flowers and an American flag has been set up outside the Farragut West Metro station in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Andrew Leyden/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Leyden/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The suspect is now facing a charge of first-degree murder   Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national who allegedly shot the National Guard members, is now facing a first-degree murder charge.   U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro said during an interview with Fox News on Friday that the charges against Lakanwal have been upgraded to first-degree murder and that there are \"many more charges to come.\"   \n   Lakanwal, who was 5 years old when the war in Afghanistan started, immigrated to the U.S. in 2021 when U.S. troops withdrew from Afghanistan and the Taliban toppled its government. Lakanwal worked with an elite counterterrorism unit, which was operated by the CIA, according to AfghanEvac, a nonprofit run by U.S. veterans and others who served in Afghanistan. The organization has said specialized units like this one were used to carry out extremely violent clandestine missions.   According to CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Lakanwal was able to resettle in the U.S. with his family because of the work he did on behalf of American intelligence.   Officials are looking for leads in the U.S. and abroad as there is yet no definitive motive for the shooting.   The Trump administration is pausing all asylum decisions   The administration is dramatically tightening its controversial immigration policies.   \n   Trump posted on Truth Social that he will \"permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover.\"   U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Director Joseph Edlow also posted on X, that the agency has \"halted all asylum decisions until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.   \"The safety of the American people always comes first,\" Edlow wrote.   NPR's Alana Wise, Kat Lonsdorf, Juliana Kim and Brian Mann contributed to this report.\n",

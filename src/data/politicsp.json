They include the leaders of organizations that address digital hate and a former European Union commissioner who clashed with tech billionaire Elon Musk over broadcasting an online interview with Donald Trump.   Rubio's statement said they advanced foreign government censorship campaigns against Americans and U.S. companies, which he said created \"potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences\" for the U.S.   The action to bar them from the U.S. is part of a Trump administration campaign against foreign influence over online speech, using immigration law rather than platform regulations or sanctions.   The five Europeans named by Rogers are: Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate; Josephine Ballon and Anna-Lena von Hodenberg, leaders of HateAid, a German organization; Clare Melford, who runs the Global Disinformation Index; and former EU Commissioner Thierry Breton, who was responsible for digital affairs.   Rogers in her post on X called Breton, a French business executive and former finance minister, the \"mastermind\" behind the EU's Digital Services Act, which imposes a set of strict requirements designed to keep internet users safe online. This includes flagging harmful or illegal content like hate speech.   \n   She referred to Breton warning Musk of a possible \"amplification of harmful content\" by broadcasting his livestream interview with Trump in August 2024 when he was running for president.   Breton responded Tuesday on X by noting that all 27 EU members voted for the Digital Services Act in 2022. \"To our American friends: 'Censorship isn't where you think it is,'\" he wrote.   French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said France condemns the visa restrictions on Breton and the four others. Also posting on X, he said the DSA was adopted to ensure that \"what is illegal offline is also illegal online.\" He said it \"has absolutely no extraterritorial reach and in no way concerns the United States.\"   \n   Most Europeans are covered by the Visa Waiver Program, which means they don't necessarily need visas to come into the country. They do, however, need to complete an online application prior to arrival under a system run by the Department of Homeland Security, so it is possible that at least some of these five people have been flagged to DHS, a U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss details not publicly released.   Other visa restriction policies were announced this year, along with bans targeting foreign visitors from certain African and Middle Eastern countries and the Palestinian Authority. Visitors from some countries could be required to post a financial bond when applying for a visa.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Steve Inskeep speaks with Democratic Congressman Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, who is sponsoring legislation to prohibit President Trump from using federal dollars to wage war with Venezuela.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  All right. We heard Quil mention Iraq and comparisons to Iraq. Our next guest served four tours in the U.S. military in Iraq. Democratic Congressman Seth Moulton of Massachusetts is on the line. Good morning.SETH MOULTON: Good morning, Steve.INSKEEP: What do you think the president's goal is in Venezuela?MOULTON: Well, we really don't know. It seems to be regime change, something that he has said repeatedly he's against. He's against regime change wars, and yet he seems to be absolutely obsessed with Maduro to the point where he's putting a lot of U.S. service members' lives in potential danger here, trying to push him out of power, a country that's not even a national security risk to the United States.INSKEEP: A couple of things to follow up on there. First, I can name one data point. In the recent Vanity Fair interview with Susie Wiles, the chief of staff, it got attention for other things. But there is a description of a meeting with the president on November 4 of this year, and part of the agenda was, quote, \"forcing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from power.\" So we don't have a public statement by the president, but we have a description of a meeting in which this is what he wants to talk about.MOULTON: Well, it sounds like Iraq 2.0 to me.INSKEEP: What do you mean?MOULTON: You know, a president who's obsessed with just getting a foreign leader out of power and assembling or concocting a rationale to do so. Of course, we had faulty intelligence about weapons of mass destruction that draw - drew us into Iraq. In this case, the president has literally created weapons of mass destruction by declaring fentanyl a weapon of mass destruction and thereby trying to justify what he wants to do here.INSKEEP: Let me follow up on another thing you said. You said Venezuela is not a national security threat to the United States. I get it in the sense that we're not worried about Venezuela's military, but it would not be hard to find ways that Venezuela's misgovernment has harmed the United States. It seems to have created a massive refugee crisis. A lot of the refugees have ended up in the United States with huge social and also political effects, even damage for your party. Why is that not a national security threat?MOULTON: Well, by that rationale, you could invade half the countries in the world. The point is that this is about priorities, and China is the major national security threat to the United States of America. And by assembling this huge armada, as Trump describes it, he's taking pressure off China, which makes it more likely they'll start a war.INSKEEP: What do you mean by taking pressure off China? Just because we're distracted?MOULTON: That's exactly right. And it's a concern I've heard echoed from people who are focused on China throughout the globe, including talking to military commanders whose job is it is every single day to deter and prevent China from starting a war in the Pacific that could literally become World War III. Not to mention that Putin seems very intent on invading other countries in Europe. We got to keep pressure on Putin so that American troops don't get involved in a war there. So there are a lot of places in the world where our presence is trying to deter and prevent wars. Trump seems intent on starting a war right to our south.INSKEEP: I want people to know that you've introduced legislation that blocks the president from using federal dollars to engage in military action in Venezuela. But as you know very well, that goes nowhere without Republican support. Do you have any sense that any of your Republican colleagues are concerned?MOULTON: A lot of Republican colleagues are concerned. A lot of them have been publicly against regime change wars, against what happened in Iraq. But they're all just scared of Trump. I mean, this is political cowardice at its peak, and, of course, it starts with Speaker Johnson, whose job is to actually follow the Constitution and have a vote on going to war in Congress because that's our constitutional responsibility. Instead, he just does whatever Trump wants, which in this case, seems to be supporting his efforts to start a new war.INSKEEP: When you hear analysts look at the various moves of the administration and see a new foreign policy orientation, which, in a sense, is an old foreign policy orientation, where the United States focuses on the Western Hemisphere and tries further to dominate the Western Hemisphere even more than the U.S. already has, while perhaps leaving a little more space for Russia and China to do what they want in their areas of the world, that is one way that Trump's foreign policy has been perceived. Do you think that's correct and do you think that's wise?MOULTON: It's wrong and it's dumb. And that's why every administration, including Trump's first administration, had a totally different national security policy that recognized that the world is a complicated and interconnected place, and China may seem far away. Russia may seem far away, but they present real threats to us, to our allies and to our American service members. So rather than push American service members into a war we don't need in Venezuela, he's taking - he's not doing enough to prevent wars where our adversaries actually really want to start them. So this is a massive change in policy from what previous Democratic and Republican administrations have done.INSKEEP: Congressman Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, thanks very much for your time. Good to talk with you again.MOULTON: Thank you so much, Steve.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Kennedy, Jr., speaks during an event on prescription drug prices in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Friday, Dec. 19, 2025, in Washington.\n                \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Evan Vucci/AP\n    \n\n   \n   NEW YORK — A coalition of 19 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, its secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and its inspector general over a declaration that could complicate access to gender-affirming care for young people.   \n   The declaration issued last Thursday called treatments like puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries unsafe and ineffective for children and adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria, or the distress when someone's gender expression doesn't match their sex assigned at birth. It also warned doctors that they could be excluded from federal health programs like Medicare and Medicaid if they provide those types of care.   The declaration came as HHS also announced proposed rules meant to further curtail gender-affirming care for young people, although the lawsuit doesn't address those as they are not final.   \n   Tuesday's lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Eugene, Oregon, alleges that the declaration is inaccurate and unlawful and asks the court to block its enforcement. It's the latest in a series of clashes between an administration that's cracking down on transgender health care for children, arguing it can be harmful to them, and advocates who say the care is medically necessary and shouldn't be inhibited.   \"Secretary Kennedy cannot unilaterally change medical standards by posting a document online, and no one should lose access to medically necessary health care because their federal government tried to interfere in decisions that belong in doctors' offices,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led the lawsuit, said in a statement Tuesday.   \n   The lawsuit alleges that HHS's declaration seeks to coerce providers to stop providing gender-affirming care and circumvent legal requirements for policy changes. It says federal law requires the public to be given notice and an opportunity to comment before substantively changing health policy — neither of which, the suit says, was done before the declaration was issued.   A spokesperson for HHS declined to comment.   HHS's declaration based its conclusions on a peer-reviewed report that the department conducted earlier this year that urged greater reliance on behavioral therapy rather than broad gender-affirming care for youths with gender dysphoria.   \n   The report questioned standards for the treatment of transgender youth issued by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health and raised concerns that adolescents may be too young to give consent to life-changing treatments that could result in future infertility.   Major medical groups and those who treat transgender young people have sharply criticized the report as inaccurate, and most major U.S. medical organizations, including the American Medical Association, continue to oppose restrictions on transgender care and services for young people.   The declaration was announced as part of a multifaceted effort to limit gender-affirming health care for children and teenagers — and built on other Trump administration efforts to target the rights of transgender people nationwide.   \n   HHS on Thursday also unveiled two proposed federal rules — one to cut off federal Medicaid and Medicare funding from hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to children, and another to prohibit federal Medicaid dollars from being used for such procedures.   The proposals are not yet final or legally binding and must go through a lengthy rulemaking process and public comment before becoming permanent. But they will nonetheless likely further discourage health care providers from offering gender-affirming care to children.   Several major medical providers already have pulled back on gender-affirming care for young patients since Trump returned to office — even in states where the care is legal and protected by state law.   Medicaid programs in slightly less than half of states currently cover gender-affirming care. At least 27 states have adopted laws restricting or banning the care. The Supreme Court's recent decision upholding Tennessee's ban means most other state laws are likely to remain in place.   Joining James in Tuesday's lawsuit were Democratic attorneys general from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin, Washington and the District of Columbia. Pennsylvania's Democratic governor also joined.\n",

Trump has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection to Epstein though he had a well-documented friendship with the disgraced financier in the 1980s, '90s, and 2000s. This latest tranche gives more details on Trump's relationship with Epstein, including documentation of Trump flying on Epstein's private jet in the 1990s. Epstein's relationship with powerful politicians and businessmen – and in particular, to what degree Trump may have been aware of Epstein's crimes – has been a central question as the DOJ has continued to release the files.   \n   Congress required the Justice Department to make all files available by last Friday. The department has taken a piecemeal approach to releasing the files, which are expected to contain hundreds of thousands of pages.   In a Tuesday-morning social media post, the department said that the latest batch contains nearly 30,000 pages, adding that it includes \"untrue or sensationalist claims\" about Trump. When asked for comment on the newest files, the White House referred NPR to the Justice Department statement.   The latest set of files includes a 2020 email from an unidentified federal prosecutor saying that \"Donald Trump traveled on Epstein's private jet many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware).\"   The prosecutor said Trump was listed as a passenger on at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996, including four on which Ghislaine Maxwell – Epstein's co-conspirator and herself a convicted sex offender – was also a passenger. The prosecutor also wrote that one flight included only Trump, Epstein, and a 20-year-old whose name was redacted.   Flight logs included in the latest files show that Trump's flights were primarily domestic, between New Jersey, Palm Beach, and Washington, D.C.   President Trump has yet to respond directly to the latest document dump, but on Monday told reporters that he thinks the Epstein files are a distraction, and that they unfairly implicate innocent people.   \n   \"What this whole thing is with Epstein is a way of trying to deflect from the tremendous success that the Republican Party has,\" Trump said. \"A lot of people are very angry that pictures are being released of other people that really had nothing to do with Epstein, but they're in a picture with him because he was at a party. And you ruin a reputation of somebody.\"   The files also include a 2019 letter supposedly sent by Epstein to convicted sex offender Larry Nassar — the former U.S. gymnastics team doctor. But since releasing the letter, the Justice Department has said it is a fake.   The letter, which says Epstein sent it from a correctional facility in Manhattan, says that \"our president shares our love of young, nubile girls.\" A stamp on the letter says it was returned to sender.    The Justice Department posted on social media there were some inconsistencies with the letter, such as a Virginia postmark instead of a New York postmark and the return address listing the wrong jail for Epstein. After initially saying Tuesday they were \"looking into the validity\" of the letter, the DOJ said the FBI had concluded it was a \"fake.\"   \"This fake letter serves as a reminder that just because a document is released by the Department of Justice does not make the allegations or claims within the document factual. Nevertheless, the DOJ will continue to release all material required by law,\" the Justice Department said.    The FBI declined to comment.   Another document included is a 2021 subpoena to Trump's Mar-a-Lago club for employment records during the investigation into Maxwell.   NPR's Luke Garrett contributed reporting.\n",

On a Friday in September, Mojica was caught on several cameras roughly pushing a woman into the hallway and then to the ground, as the woman screamed.   The incident at an immigration court in New York rapidly circulated online and prompted the Homeland Security Department to place Mojica on administrative leave – a rare instance of such leave being publicly announced.   By the following Monday, Mojica was back on the job, without any further explanation from the agency.   \n   NPR has now learned that he returned to work before the Homeland Security Department's internal watchdog had concluded a review into his behavior. The DHS Office of Inspector General ultimately decided — nearly two months later — that the incident did not merit a criminal probe.   The disclosure of the probe raises questions about the adequacy of DHS oversight mechanisms to investigate employee misconduct. It comes as the department has gutted some internal oversight agencies and faces consistent pressure from Trump officials to ramp up deportations.   Critics of the administration, and former ICE personnel, also worry the lack of transparency about DHS's disciplinary practices can further erode trust in federal law enforcement.   \"That's the scary part, that this is just one small case of a larger systemic issue of how law enforcement is being hyper-politicized,\" said Jason Houser, former ICE chief of staff under President Biden. He said the incident adds to the negative view of ICE officers.   \n   DHS has not responded to NPR's questions about its investigation process and procedures.   When Mojica was first suspended, DHS issued a statement that criticized his behavior.   \"The officer's conduct in this video is unacceptable and beneath the men and women of ICE,\" Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of media affairs at DHS, said at the time. \"Our ICE law enforcement are held to the highest professional standards and this officer is being relieved of current duties as we conduct a full investigation.\"   \n   NPR had also documented this officer's previous use of force while on the job.   But a few days later, Mojica returned to \"full active duty\" at ICE, according to media reports at the time. The news was re-shared on social media by Trump advisers, including deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, seen as one of the architects of Trump's aggressive immigration policy. No further explanation was provided.   \n   Push for more details from DHS   Rep. Dan Goldman, a Democrat, represents the district in New York that includes the immigration court where the incident took place. He had also been interested in getting answers about what happened with Mojica.   He questioned Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem about it at a hearing this month, and Noem promised she would give the congressman \"the investigation and the information that you would like.\"   Noem's response, shared with NPR in an undated letter, was five paragraphs long. She said ICE referred the incident \"for appropriate review.\" And DHS's Office of Inspector General on November 25 made the decision to not open a criminal investigation.   It was not immediately clear why Mojica was able to return to work before the agency's inspector general's office had closed its review of his behavior.   It's also unclear whether the inspector general, Joseph Cuffari, who was confirmed by the Senate during Trump's first term, is still pursuing an administrative complaint against Mojica.   \n   \"ICE officers continue to operate in a highly challenging and increasingly dangerous environment,\" according to Noem's response. \"Allegations of excessive force are reviewed through established internal mechanisms and accountability is imposed where warranted, consistent with law and due process. DHS will not litigate individual personnel matters through correspondence.\"   Goldman called the letter \"a wholly unsatisfactory response.\"   It \"didn't answer the question as to what investigation had been done in the three days between the incident and when he was reinstated, and certainly did not provide any more information about any additional investigation by the inspector general or anyone else,\" Goldman said in an interview.   \n   \"So it begs more questions than it answers.\"   Concerns about DHS discipline   Concerns about how DHS investigates and disciplines its employees predate President Trump.   During the Biden administration, the DHS OIG conducted a review of policies and procedures regarding senior executive employees going back nearly a decade and found that ICE did not follow its written policy when conducting disciplinary reviews of these employees.   But immigration policy experts say prior problems could be exacerbated by the rapid surge in hiring new officers, and the pressure the agency faces to detain more immigrants.   \n   For example, groups like the Migration Policy Institute say the rapid expansion of Border Patrol in the mid-2000s led to cutting corners on training and eased applicant vetting, two factors that may have contributed to an increase in misconduct.   Noem's letter to Rep. Goldman also said ICE relies on internal processes, including through its Office of Professional Responsibility, to address personnel and compliance matters. She declined to provide further details, citing that information \"is not appropriate for public disclosure.\"   Darius Reeves, a former ICE field office director for the Baltimore Enforcement and Removal Operations branch, said it is standard for administrative matters to be handed to the Office of Professional Responsibility, especially if there are no broader systemic issues.   Reeves was with the agency during the first Trump administration and left after the Biden administration.   \n   If it was not a criminal complaint, it could be reasonable for an officer to be reinstated quickly given the administration's push for arrests, he said. But he said DHS should have given the public more of an explanation of why it reinstated Mojica since it had publicly denounced the incident.   \"ICE is losing its professionalism,\" he said, speaking about the lack of public response and viral moments like this one. \"ICE has lost what I've always deemed us to be: the silent service.\"   \n   Houser, the former ICE chief of staff, agreed that both the inspector general and internal Office of Professional Responsibility could still be looking into a case like this, but the processes are lengthy.   \"That takes a lot of time and diligence and it doesn't happen overnight and it doesn't happen over a weekend,\" Houser said. He said investigations may be followed by additional review from legal counsels across the agency.   \n   \"Those processes need to be carried out by those that won't have political motives as their goal. It should be carried out by law enforcement,\" he said. \"And when that happened historically, there's a long paper trail of interviews, of witnesses and review and assessment.   \"It's not just brushed under the rug over a weekend.\"\n",

The incoming administration shut down the app, which was created by the Biden administration to allow migrants to schedule appointments to gain entry into the United States.\n                \n                    John Moore/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        John Moore/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   More than 1.6 million immigrants have lost their legal status in the first 11 months of President Trump's presidency. The staggering number includes people who applied for and were accepted to come to the country on a wide variety of immigration parole, visa, asylum and temporary protected status programs. That number exceeds Philadelphia's entire population.   This is the largest effort to take away deportation protections for migrants who are in the country legally. Immigration advocates say it's very likely an undercount.   \"These were legal pathways. People did the thing the government asked them to do, and this government went and preemptively revoked that status,\" said Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us, an immigration advocacy organization that has been tracking the efforts to delegalize immigrants.   \n   \"There's nothing close to this. Like there's no president of either party who has said, 'Central to my effort is revoking the work authorization and legal status for millions of people.'\"   \n   Many of the immigrants who lost legal status have been in the country for years. Now, they fear what could happen should their immigration cases not process quickly enough. The administration has encouraged immigrants to leave the country as it gets rid of their legal authorization.   \"The American taxpayer will no longer bear the financial burden of unlawfully present aliens,\" U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said, in response to a request for comment about concerns that the administration is making more people deportable.    In another effort to eliminate existing legal pathways, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced last week that the Trump administration would be pausing the diversity visa lottery program. In a post on X, she said the man accused of carrying out a deadly shooting at Brown University — and of killing an MIT professor — came to the U.S. through the program in 2017 and was granted a green card. While the cancellation doesn't impact those already in the country, the lottery program faces an uncertain future going forward.   \n   The White House says scrapping prior legal pathways and protections is part of its goal.   \"The Trump administration has done more to limit migration, both illegal and legal, than any administration in history,\" Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said during a press conference this fall. She touted all the ways the administration has cut off these avenues, including by pausing and revoking visas.   \"Having a visa in the United States is not a right. It is a privilege and the secretary of state — if you are deemed contrary to our country's foreign national interests — has the right to revoke that privilege.\"   A look at canceled programs and permissions   Hours after being inaugurated, Trump signed an executive order slashing a program created by the Biden administration to temporarily allow the entrance of 530,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The decision to end the program was later upheld by the Supreme Court — paving the way for individuals to be eligible for deportation.   Most of the people who entered the U.S. under this humanitarian parole hail from Haiti. Migrants under the program have pushed against the narrative that they are abusing the system.   \n   Temporary protected status, or TPS, provides deportation protection and grants work permits to people from specific countries affected by war, natural disasters, political instability, or any other condition that makes the country unsafe for its nationals to return to. Each country's designation can last six to 18 months at the discretion of the secretary of homeland security.   Since January, the Homeland Security Department has ended TPS for 10 countries. Here is the breakdown, according to DHS, of how many people were affected:   Loading...\n   The agency moved forward with ending TPS for about 3,800 Syrians, though that effort is currently stalled in court. Lawsuits have also impacted the termination of Venezuela's TPS designation. While the program has been terminated, certain beneficiaries will keep their TPS through October 2026.   The Trump administration argues that parole programs like TPS are meant to be only temporary. But immigration advocates said that while the government can, and has, ended country-specific designations in the past, it typically must prove that conditions in the country have improved.   \n   Schulte, from FWD.us, points to recent comments from Trump denigrating the situation in countries like Afghanistan and Haiti, and actions against Venezuela, as evidence that the U.S. does not consider these countries particularly improved or stable.   With each cancellation, DHS has offered monetary incentives and a 60 days' notice to leave the country. DHS did not respond to questions about how many people have taken them up on the offer of a $1,000 cash payment.   There are several pending lawsuits challenging the terminations of their TPS, and some people may be able to apply for other avenues for protection against deportation.   \n   Eliminating CBP One, others   Another program that the Trump administration ended earlier this year is CBP One, a mobile app that allowed migrants to make appointments to seek asylum from inside the U.S.   From 2023 to January 2025, more than 936,000 people were allowed in the country. It's unknown exactly how many people entered the U.S. through the app and were still waiting on legal permissions when it was canceled.   In the spring, thousands of migrants who had entered the U.S. through the app and awaited asylum appointments received messages to leave. Many who entered with the app ended up getting detained in courthouses or in their neighborhoods.   \n   Grebi Suárez, a Venezuelan barber who entered the U.S. through CBP One in January right before Trump was inaugurated, told NPR that last week he finally received his work permit and Social Security number.   \"But I'm anxious and scared because some of my friends have received emails from the government telling them to self-deport,\" said Suárez, who was featured on an NPR story last year about his attempts to get to the U.S.   \n   The State Department has also assisted the administration's goals of canceling permissions to be in the U.S. This year, 85,000 visas of all categories, including more than 8,000 student visas, have been revoked, according to a State Department official. That is more than double the number the year before.   DUIs, assaults and theft are some of the top reasons why visas were revoked, together accounting for almost half of the revocations in the past year, the official said in a statement.   \"These are people who pose a direct threat to our communities' safety, and we do not want to have them in our country,\" the official said.   Earlier this month, the administration also moved forward with canceling the Family Reunification Parole of 14,000 people, mostly Central and South Americans. The program sought to make it easier for people with family-based petitions to be permitted to be in the U.S. while their immigration processes played out.   \n   Migrants brace for more cancellations in 2026   Several thousand more migrants are at risk of their programs ending next year.   Other TPS permissions that expire next year are for El Salvador, Lebanon, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. If their programs, along with Ukraine's, get canceled, the U.S. may have no one residing under such a temporary status for the first time since the program was created in 1990.   Ukrainians who came under the Uniting for Ukraine parole program have been concerned their program could be next in line for cancellation. TPS for Ukrainians, which allowed about 100,000 people to enter the U.S., also is set to expire next year unless the administration renews it.   \n   The Trump administration earlier this year paused the Uniting for Ukraine program and later resumed it. The pause affected thousands of Ukrainians, including Viktoriia Panova.   Her work permit expired in February, adding to the anxiety and uncertainty she's felt since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.   \"Ukrainians, we cannot create any plans for our lives because of this situation,\" Panova told NPR earlier this year. \"We cannot live a full life.\"\n",

The outcome may determine which party controls the House after midterms.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  One of the big topics in politics this year has been redistricting. President Trump set off a race to reshape the voting map before next year's congressional elections. He's been pushing Republican lawmakers across the country to redistrict so their party can hold on to the House. That is key to his MAGA agenda. For a look at where it all stands, we're joined now by Andrew Schneider of Houston Public Media. Hi there.ANDREW SCHNEIDER, BYLINE: Hello.SUMMERS: So, Andrew, I want to get into the big picture, but let's start where you are in Texas. How did this all first start there?SCHNEIDER: Well, in the summer, President Trump called on Texas Republicans to redraw the voting lines to help the GOP win five more House seats. There's a heavily Republican legislature, a Republican governor, Greg Abbott. They were both eager to do it. You might remember Democratic lawmakers even left the state for two weeks to delay the vote, but eventually it passed, and the race was on. California Democrats countered. They held a special election last month where voters approved redistricting that could flip five seats there for Democrats. Republicans in North Carolina and Missouri also did it to favor their party. States normally redistrict at the start of the decade when the census comes in and shows how many seats each state gets based on their population. And experts we've talked with say the country hasn't seen a year with this much mid-decade redistricting since the 1970s, when the courts set out the rules for how it works now.SUMMERS: Can we say who's ahead at this point?SCHNEIDER: Well, so far, the GOP states, prompted by Trump, have used redistricting to get an advantage in flipping seven seats held by the Democrats. Then in Ohio, they had to redistrict this year because of a state law there. That could help them win two. So that's nine seats tilted towards the Republicans. Now, to the Democrats, they did those five in California. And in Utah, a court ordered a new map. That could help Democrats win a seat there. So that's six tilted towards the Democrats versus nine towards the Republicans. But something surprising has happened this month. The heavily Republican Indiana legislature rejected Trump's redistricting, even after Trump threatened a campaign against Republicans who didn't support it. Lawmakers in Kansas are also hesitating to do it.SUMMERS: Andrew, why would states oppose joining the scramble?SCHNEIDER: Well, the word many use for this is gerrymandering, where politicians are shifting votes around explicitly to help their party. Now, I spoke with Justin Levitt at Loyola Marymount University's Loyola Law School. He's a voting rights expert and an adviser on them in the Biden administration, and he says it's harmful.JUSTIN LEVITT: You take away people's ability to give a thumbs up or thumbs down on how their representatives have performed. And the more frequently you do that, the more you disconnect elected representatives from the people that they represent, the more you sever the relationship between we the people and our elected representatives. That's not a good thing for any of us.SCHNEIDER: Now, redistricting can also be risky because if a party goes for too many seats, it can actually make safe ones they hold more competitive, like swing districts. You don't know how people will actually vote. For example, in Texas, a lot of Latinos voted for Trump in 2024, and Republicans drew the lines based on that, but some Latinos might turn back to the Democrats in 2026.SUMMERS: Yeah, I mean, that's a fair point. We're not going to know how any of this turns out until people actually vote next November. Looking ahead, what could be coming up in 2026?SCHNEIDER: Well, Democrats in Virginia and Maryland are looking at redistricting to help their party, and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis says his state will try to tip seats towards the GOP. And there's a voting rights case before the U.S. Supreme Court that could allow more Republican states to redistrict. And like you said, it comes down to actual votes in November. So let's say Republicans gain an edge in a few seats through redistricting. That won't matter if there's a wave election with one party sweeping the vote around the country. But right now, Republicans only hold the House by a few seats. So if the midterms are close, that could make all the difference.SUMMERS: Andrew Schneider of Houston Public Media, thanks so much.SCHNEIDER: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

The gross domestic product — the broadest measure of the nation's economic activity — grew at an annual rate of 4.3% in the third quarter, much faster than the 3.8% expansion seen between April and June, according to the Commerce Department on Tuesday.   \n   Growth has picked up from the early months of 2025, when the U.S. economy actually shrank at an annual rate of 0.6% as President Trump prepared sweeping global tariffs.    The latest figures are already quite dated. Tuesday's report was originally due in late October but was disrupted by the historic government shutdown. And it now comes as polling increasingly finds Americans glum on President Trump's handling of the economy and the high cost of living.   Third-quarter data shows business and residential investment declining. Spending by state and local governments rose. The impacts of trade swings were more mixed in the latest report, compared to earlier in the year: imports of goods declined, while exports increased. Imports get subtracted from the government's measure of domestic economic activity, so they tend to depress GDP.    \n   Loading...\n   Americans continued to spend but are turning more cautious   Spending by consumers, who remain the key engine of the U.S. economy, increased in the third quarter, according to the Commerce report. People spent more on hospital and nursing home services, on prescription drugs and on \"information processing equipment,\" such as computer hardware, presumably as part of the AI boom.    Consumer spending has been resilient for much of the year; however, in recent polling, more and more people today are saying they're feeling down about their financial prospects. A new report on consumer confidence from the Conference Board on Tuesday found sentiment declining for the fifth month in a row, as Americans worry about inflation, the political environment and the future of the labor market.   Tuesday's GDP report also showed disposable personal income was flat in the quarter, as inflation continued to eat away at Americans' wages.   \n   'We're skating on past success because consumers have enjoyed a couple of consecutive years of strong wage gains,\" says Michael Zdinak, an economist with S&P Global Market Intelligence. \"Today's report shows that demand is strong and consumers are willing to spend money — if they're didn't have this sword of Damocles hanging over their head that, you know, AI is coming from their jobs or that mass layoffs are just right around the corner,\" he adds.   On average, workers' wages have been growing faster than prices. But those wage gains have slowed in recent months as the softening job market has chipped away at workers' bargaining power for higher pay. Wealthier shoppers have been propping up much of U.S. spending at stores and restaurants.    \n   Inflation has been cooling off notably, with consumer prices rising a modest 2.7% in November from a year earlier. Some food items have continued to drop in price, but not enough to offset the growing big costs, like rent, electricity and health insurance.     The latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll has found that only 36% of Americans approve of President Trump's handling of the economy, his worst mark in the six years that Marist has been asking the question.   NPR's Scott Horsley contributed to this report.\n",

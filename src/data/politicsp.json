The jury's conclusion came after about seven hours of deliberations. The case of the subway sandwich has come to symbolize how many in the nation's capital feel about the Trump administration's surge of federal law enforcement to the city.   Sean Charles Dunn in August called federal officers racists and fascists and threw his subway sandwich at one federal agent. He was caught by police and fired from his job at the Justice Department.   \n   The U.S. attorney's office in D.C. initially tried to charge him with felony assault. When a grand jury failed to indict him on that charge, the case was downgraded to a misdemeanor charge for assaulting a federal officer.   Dunn argued that he was being singled out because of his criticism of the Trump administration.   \"I'm relieved and I'm looking forward to moving on with my life,\" Sean Charles Dunn said outside the courthouse after the jury's verdict.\n",

    "body": "\n      Democrats won big in key elections this week. But rather than provide clarity, those victories have sent competing signals to lawmakers in the Senate about how to end the ongoing government shutdown.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Democratic wins and elections across the country on Tuesday have emboldened many to hold firm. That's despite earlier indications that they were searching for a way out as Americans felt the intense pains of furloughs, travel delays and unpaid SNAP benefits.A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas is here. So - all right, Sam. Let's start with the view from the White House. And he met with Senate Republicans for breakfast yesterday. What was his message? What did he say to them?SAM GRINGLAS, BYLINE: The president told Senate Republicans there was a lot to discuss, including what the party should do about their losses on election night.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And also about the shutdown and how that relates to last night. I think if you read the pollsters, the shutdown was a big factor, negative for the Republicans.GRINGLAS: Trump has been urging Republicans to end the shutdown by eliminating the Senate filibuster. That would lower the votes needed to pass bills. Congressional Republicans, you know, have mostly gone along with Trump's wishes, but Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota says getting rid of the filibuster is just not going to happen.MIKE ROUNDS: The Senate was designed to really be a place where consensus is brought about, making decisions that could stand the test of time. Simply going to make the Senate a mini version of the House is not what any of us really want to do.GRINGLAS: And there's another reason Republicans are hesitant to ditch the filibuster. They want to keep it in case they end up in the minority.MARTÍNEZ: All right. So if most Republicans, then, are saying no to President Trump's desire to bust the filibuster, are we seeing a different solution emerge?GRINGLAS: So both sides have been pretty dug in here. But this week, some bipartisan talks did seem to pick up steam - possibly a short-term funding measure into December, along with votes on a small package of regular appropriations bills. Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff of Georgia has been involved in those talks, and I asked whether he'd accept anything short of a deal to preserve expiring Obamacare subsidies. That's an issue that's been at the heart of this shutdown debate.JON OSSOFF: Conversations are ongoing. It's good that people are talking. There's real urgency to prevent this huge spike in health care costs and to reopen the government.GRINGLAS: Republicans would need eight Democrats to sign on to a deal to reopen the government, and Republicans have said that would become more doable as the shutdown pain got worse.MARTÍNEZ: So how do the election results affect all that?GRINGLAS: Well, there has always been a camp of Democrats who say any deal has to include an ironclad extension of those Obamacare subsidies. And many of them think their performance on Tuesday validates that position. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders says he needs not just a Senate vote on extending the subsidies, but also assurance that the measure would pass in the House and that Trump would sign it into law.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BERNIE SANDERS: If you simply had a nebulous vote that wasn't going to go anyplace, I think we got to continue to fight.GRINGLAS: On Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was kind of vague about what he could live with. On Wednesday, he made it sound like his caucus was not going to relent.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHUCK SCHUMER: The election results were not vague. They were not unclear. They were a lightning bolt.MARTÍNEZ: So, Sam, where does this leave things?GRINGLAS: Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries are calling for a meeting with Trump. On Air Force One on Sunday, I asked Trump whether he was interested in negotiating with Democrats, but he reiterated that they were the ones who needed to back down. The question is, will Tuesday change that calculus, or will this shutdown stretch into a sixth week?MARTÍNEZ: That's NPR congressional reporter Sam Gringlas. Thanks, Sam.GRINGLAS: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      The 85-year-old California Democrat's departure will mark the end of an era in Congress. In 2007, Pelosi became the first woman elected to serve as U.S. House speaker.   \n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  In a video released this morning, California representative Nancy Pelosi, the first woman elected speaker of the House, tells her San Francisco constituents that she will not be seeking reelection in Congress.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NANCY PELOSI: We have always led the way, and now we must continue to do so by remaining full participants in our democracy and fighting for the American ideals we hold here.MARTÍNEZ: Pelosi, a Democrat, was first elected 38 years ago and served two separate times as speaker. Senior political correspondent Scott Shafer from member station KQED in San Francisco has followed her career for decades. Scott, how did she ultimately get back on track to become speaker two decades later? I mean, you followed her from the very, very start.SCOTT SHAFER, BYLINE: Yeah. Well, I came to San Francisco a few years before she ran for Congress, and there, those vintage images in that video you just played were very poignant. They referenced the AIDS epidemic, the 1989 earthquake, ribbon-cuttings for major transit projects and more. And, you know, she recalled that the slogan for her first campaign was a voice that will be heard, which certainly turned out to be true. You know, when she got elected, Pelosi was not really well-known outside of Democratic circles. But she grew up in a political family, and later, she chaired the California Democratic Party, and then she raised money for Democratic Senate candidates nationwide. She knew a lot of important people in the party. So when she got to Washington, she could quickly cultivate relationships that really served her well later on.MARTÍNEZ: What would you say are some of her biggest accomplishments?SHAFER: Well, when she got to Washington during the Reagan administration, her district was ravaged by the AIDS epidemic. She made increasing federal funding a top priority, and that made a huge difference.Second, I'd say, the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. It really would not have passed in 2010 without Pelosi's shoulder to the wheel. She had to overcome resistance, not just from Republicans, but also from reluctant Democrats. Some of them wanted a less sweeping bill, but she made it happen.And then third, I'd say her emphasis on helping to make her party more diverse, encouraging, especially more women, women of color to get involved in politics. You know, there's nearly five times as many Democratic women in the House as when Pelosi arrived, and the number of Democratic women of color has grown more than 10 times over that span. She had a lot to do with that.MARTÍNEZ: Nancy Pelosi's known as a bit of a partisan warrior, but did she ever set that aside?SHAFER: She did. You know, in 2008, the final year of the George W. Bush administration, the economy was collapsing. She and Bush weren't particularly close, but she agreed to round up enough votes to stabilize financial institutions. Critics called it a Wall Street bailout. But, you know, that was a big example of her ability to reach across the aisle. In fact, when her official portrait was unveiled in 2022, Republican - former Republican speaker John Boehner noted that Pelosi would put nation over party and said that she was the most effective speaker of either party.MARTÍNEZ: Now, today's announcement comes just days after voters passed Proposition 50 that's going to help Democrats win more seats in the midterm elections. That's here in California where I am - where you - where both of us are, actually.SHAFER: Yeah.MARTÍNEZ: What do you make of the timing? Does one thing have to do with the other?SHAFER: Well, I talked to her on Election Day, and she said she was hoping for a big Prop 50 win and said right after that, she would turn to thinking about her future. Of course, Pelosi very much wants Democrats to retake the House, and Prop 50's going help with that. She sees that as really essential to putting a check on what she sees as President Trump's excessive use of force and use of executive power. And so with Prop 50's landslide win, it's a chance for Pelosi to take a victory lap and say it's time to let another generation lead.MARTÍNEZ: That's Scott Shafer from member station KQED. Scott, thanks.SHAFER: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Leila Fadel speaks to Republican Congressman Jeff Hurd of Colorado about his work on a bipartisan \"statement of principles\" to extend subsidies for Obamacare and end the government shutdown.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  We're going to focus now on a possible compromise. On Monday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House pitched an off ramp for the government shutdown. Four members of the House Problem Solvers Caucus released a framework that would extend the enhanced Obamacare subsidies at the heart of the standoff in Congress. Republican Congressman Jeff Hurd of Colorado signed on to this effort, and he joins me now. Good morning, Congressman.JEFF HURD: Good morning, Leila. Happy to join you.FADEL: Thank you for being back on the program. OK. So this is really the first time we're seeing a suggestion of compromise here on health care to reopen the government. What is your group proposing exactly?HURD: So this is a bipartisan legislative framework that I'm putting forward along with my colleagues, Tom Suozzi, Josh Gottheimer and Don Bacon. It's meant to prevent a sharp rise in health insurance costs for people that are buying plans on the individual market. And what we're doing - what this legislative framework says is, let's extend the enhanced premium tax credits for two years, set reasonable income caps so that the help goes to the families that need it the most. And then we can build in some stronger guardrails so that the system is more accountable. And then Congress can use that breathing room in the next two years to work on long-term reform.FADEL: So there's four of you. How much support does it have beyond the four of you among the two parties and also the president?HURD: I think there is room here for a lot of support. This is an issue. I will tell you, regardless of how red or blue your district is, health care and the cost of health insurance is a top issue. So not everyone agrees that this is necessarily the right solution, but this is a framework to begin discussions. I think there's a real - I'm cautiously optimistic that we will get a lot of legislative support, and this thing could really get some momentum.FADEL: How much does Tuesday maybe thaw things out a little bit and open a spirit of compromise? We saw that Democrats scored big wins Tuesday in swing districts where Republicans had done well in the past. And we heard President Trump there say, the shutdown hurt Republicans with voters. Do you think this will get - this atmosphere and what we saw on Tuesday might get more people willing to compromise rather than to hold ground like we've seen for five weeks?HURD: Well, look, I'll let smarter people than me who are more familiar with Virginia, New Jersey and New York City weigh in on the specifics of those elections. But what I can tell you is that on a hill here in Washington, D.C., we're anxious to get the government back open and to start tackling the key problems that we were sent here to tackle. The people that I represent in Western and Southern Colorado are most worried about things like the cost of housing, groceries and, of course, the cost of health care.FADEL: Yeah.HURD: We got to get the government open to start tackling those problems. And, you know, my view is, of course, we did that in the House. We passed the clean bipartisan bill to keep the government open. The Senate needs to do its job, pass that bill as well. But I'm hopeful that we can get that done soon. I think, now that we passed the election, there's a real opportunity to get some work done, and we need to be ready to hit the ground running. And that's what I'm doing with my colleagues on the Republican side and on the Democratic side.FADEL: And that - is that what got you to sign on to this statement? I mean, customers on Colorado's health insurance marketplace will see their premiums double on average, and tens of thousands will lose access to health care according to analysis by your state. I mean, is that what brought you to this place to sign on with Democrats and Republicans here?HURD: Well, sure. I've also been on legislation previously that's been introduced a couple of months ago that would just do a straight extension of the enhanced premium tax credits for a year. There was bipartisan support for that as well. I think this is something that addresses some of the concerns that we've heard on the Republican side and on the Democratic side about some of the imperfections and ways that we can improve the enhanced premium tax credits and phasing out income levels. You don't want a family that's earning $800,000 necessarily getting these tax credits. We want to make sure that we have reforms verifying eligibility. We want to check death records. We want to prevent things called ghost beneficiaries where these tax credits are going to the people that are no longer existing or alive. And we want to, you know, require better notice so that people know the value of this subsidy. So there's a start of it that was a couple of months ago, but this is kind of an advancement of that issue that I think is more serious, more substantive and has a better chance of getting legislative momentum.FADEL: What makes you more optimistic in this moment? I mean, what we've been hearing from Democrats is that they don't really trust Republicans to play ball and follow through. They don't trust that if they do negotiate, that it will be honored if it passes the Senate in the House with the president. That's something we heard from Senator Sanders. They want guarantees that whatever agreement happens is guaranteed across the board. What do you say to that?HURD: Well, it's tough to guarantee the outcome of any vote. That's something that I haven't seen at all happen here in Congress. What I can tell you is that there's a seriousness and a willingness to commit by Republicans like myself and Don Bacon and others as well on addressing these issues. Like I said, this is not a red state or a blue state issue...FADEL: Yeah.HURD: ...The cost of health insurance premiums. It is something serious. If we want to really serve our constituents, we really need to tackle this problem, and this is an important start to that.FADEL: Have there been any conversations with the president? And also, why did the Republican co-chair of the Caucus not sign on to this?HURD: You'll have to ask Congressman Fitzpatrick about that specifically. I'll tell you that the response that we've gotten from - you know, from the White House and from leadership is, you know, there's not necessarily the criticism that you'd expect if they were completely opposing this idea. So I'm encouraged by the response that we've gotten, which is more pragmatic and, hey, let's get the government back open, and then we can start talking about this.FADEL: Congressman Jeff Hurd, Republican of Colorado. Thank you so much for your time.HURD: Happy to join you, Leila.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Her response to his victory this week was both practical and tinged with optimism.   \n   \"The Partnership works with whoever wins,\" she says. \"Zohran has won resoundingly, and so we will seek to be his partner in dealing with the challenges facing the city, which are considerable right now.\"   Those issues include the ongoing affordability crisis that Mamdani made a central message of his campaign. But he has proposed addressing it with some policies that businesses and the wealthy people who run them widely dislike, including a rent freeze and higher taxes.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Supporters celebrate at an election watch party in Brooklyn on Nov. 4, 2025 after Zohran Mamdani was projected the winner in the New York City mayoral race.\n                \n                    Michael M.

Santiago/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   Speaking to WNYC on Wednesday, Mamdani promised to spend his first 100 days \"taking concrete and substantive actions to deliver on the cost of living crisis that is pushing so many New Yorkers out of the city.\"   He also promised to take on \"corporate greed.\"   CEOs' opposition to Mamdani is about both business and emotion   Practically speaking, Mamdani will be unable to raise taxes without help from New York State's government. But his proposal at least threatens to make the city more expensive for both businesses and billionaires in an effort to rein in costs for the rest of the city's residents.   Wylde points out that some business leaders had other reasons for opposing him. His rhetoric about \"corporate greed\" and his identity as a Democratic socialist tend to be trigger words for dyed-in-the-wool capitalists.   \n   And then there's his relatively youthful age of 34 — which was part of his appeal for young voters, but more off-putting to chief executives who may be decades older.   \"The universal [initial] reaction was, 'Is this young man someone you would hire to run a 300,000 person corporation?' And of course the answer was, 'No way,'\" says Wylde.   There are also deeper, emotional stakes for many CEOs in New York City, which has the largest Jewish population outside of Israel. The conflict between Israel and Hamas, and Mamdani's criticism of the Israeli government, became a major tension in this election.   \n   About one third of Jewish voters cast their ballot for Mamdani, according to CNN's exit polls. He spoke out against antisemitism and said Wednesday that he looks forward to working with Jewish leaders across the city.   Meanwhile, some of Mamdani's most vocal billionaire opponents seemed to accept their defeat this week. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman spent some $2 million on efforts to defeat the new mayor — but on Tuesday, he publicly congratulated him.   \"Now you have a big responsibility,\" Ackman posted on X. \"If I can help NYC, just let me know what I can do.\"\n",

A new analysis shows millions of people may get even less food assistance than expected under the Trump administration's plan to partially fund SNAP during the government shutdown.\n                \n                    Bloomberg/via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Bloomberg/via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   WASHINGTON —  The Trump administration says it will cut November's SNAP food benefits by a bit less than previously announced. In revised guidance for states, which are calculating partial payments, the U.S. Department of Agriculture says maximum allotments will be reduced by 35% instead of 50%.   \n   The complex formula for reduced payments otherwise stays the same, and it will still mean steep cuts for those who rely on the country's largest anti-hunger program.   The administration says participants who get the maximum level of food stamp benefits will now get about 65% of their regular assistance for November. Advocates and policy groups say most — those who have other income from things like social security, disability or employment — will get far less.   USDA's change late Wednesday came after an analysis by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which found the agency's original formula for partial payments would not have tapped all of its contingency funds. Two federal judges had found the administration is legally bound to spend that money to keep SNAP going.   \n   CBPP also estimated the original reduced benefit plan would have left nearly 5 million people with no payment at all this month.   USDA did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the center's analysis or the changed plan. But in a court filing late Wednesday related to the revised partial payment formula, the Justice department wrote the agency \"realized this error and worked to issue new guidance and tables as soon as it was discovered.\"   The change will be small in some cases. For example, the reduced minimum allotment for some 1-to-2 person households had been $12, and is now $16.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A motorist, who said he had been waiting in line for two hours, waits with others to receive food boxes this week at a large-scale drive-through distribution in the City of Industry, Calif.\n                \n                    Mario Tama/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mario Tama/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   A federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the administration to restart the country's largest anti-hunger program after funding lapsed last Saturday, a month into the government shutdown. USDA rejected the suggestion by that judge, and another federal judge in Boston, that it tap a larger pot of money to fully cover SNAP payments. Instead, it chose to use only a smaller contingency fund that could cover only about half of the program's monthly cost.   Implementing the administration's complex partial funding formula presents enormous procedural challenges for states, which administer the program that serves 42 million Americans. The USDA itself warned it could take weeks or even months to get the benefits to people.   \n   \"It requires a complete recalculation and a complete recoding of our system,\" said Tikki Brown, the head of Minnesota's Department of Children, Youth and Families. She said there is no timeline yet for payments in her state.   Danny Mintz, who works for the civic technology nonprofit Code for America, said some states have antiquated systems from the 1970s that make it difficult to quickly implement sweeping calculation changes.   \"There are legitimate concerns that altering the calculations of benefits may break things,\" he said. \"The quickest way for states to get benefits into people's hands is for USDA to fund the full amount of SNAP benefits.\"   Some states already are warning it could be weeks before payments can be made.   In a bluntly worded letter to USDA — seen by NPR member station WESA — Pennsylvania Human Services Secretary Val Arkoosh said the federal government is \"directing states to use the most complex and labor-intensive approach possible.\"   Pennsylvania is asking to use a simpler, faster method that was allowed for pandemic-related aid, and would essentially give everyone half their SNAP payment.   The prospect of delays and missed payments has brought a group of cities and nonprofits back to federal court in Rhode Island, to force the Trump administration to comply with an order to restart SNAP aid \"expeditiously.\"\n",

In 2007, she became the first woman elected to serve as speaker of the House.   \"For our daughters and our granddaughters: today we have broken the marble ceiling,\" she said at the time.   \n   As speaker and House Democrats' leader, Pelosi was known for her shrewd political judgment and incisive skills as a legislative strategist.   She was also a consistent political target for Republicans, who cast her — a San Francisco multi-millionaire — as the ultimate coastal elitist. Pelosi, who raised five children before coming to Congress, rejected the characterization.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Rep.

She famously claimed she went \"from the kitchen to the Congress\" after raising her children and staying active in state politics.   Fond of saying \"Congress has the power of the purse,\" she began her time on Capitol Hill as an appropriator, a role she drew from throughout her career. She quickly rose through Democratic leadership and became the first woman to lead a major party in either chamber when she was elected as the House Democratic Minority leader in 2002.   She led Democrats to retake the House majority in 2006 and after her history-making speakership election in 2007, Pelosi held the gavel for four years — until Republicans won back control of the chamber.   \n   Pelosi, who often called herself a \"master legislator,\" could reliably deliver Democratic votes on must-pass legislation when necessary, although her first speakership came at a complicated time — a financial crisis was looming and ultimately brought the U.S. economy to its knees.   In September 2008, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke huddled with congressional leaders in the speaker's office on the second floor of the U.S. Capitol. There, Paulson outlined a pending financial crisis \"from the depths of hell,\" as Pelosi later described it. The Bush administration was asking Congress for $700 billion to prop up the U.S. economy.   \n   \"When I asked Bernanke what he thought of the secretary's characterization, he said, 'If we do not act immediately, we will not have an economy by Monday.' This was Thursday night. Everyone in the room was flabbergasted,\" Pelosi later recalled.   After Barack Obama was elected that fall, Pelosi pushed forward the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, a stimulus package to counter the effects of the Great Recession. She was also instrumental in passing the Dodd-Frank reforms to the banking industry and was an architect of the Affordable Care Act. The sweeping health care reform law became the signature achievement of Obama's presidency.   In the wake of those bills, the far-right Tea Party movement helped harden Republican opposition to Obama and Democrats more broadly, and Democrats saw major losses in the 2010 midterm elections that relegated Democrats to the minority and ended Pelosi's first run as speaker. Obama himself described the defeat as \"a shellacking.\"   There was growing expectation that Pelosi would retire from Congress after losing the gavel and control of the House. She was featured in attack ads in swing districts, where Republicans used her image relentlessly and effectively to characterize the entire party as far-left elitists.   Ultimately, Pelosi reclaimed the gavel in 2019 — the first person to do so in over 60 years. Originally thought by analysts to be too liberal to be an effective leader, her legacy is ultimately that of a centrist and legislative pragmatist.   A long tenure   Pelosi served alongside four presidents during her time as speaker.   \n   Her contentious relationship with former Republican President George W. Bush was an early showcase of her ability to turn from aggressive critic to critical legislating partner.   Her relationship with President Trump was more fractious. She led two presidential impeachments and created the bipartisan Select Committee to investigate the Jan. 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol.   It was the election of President Joe Biden and Democrats gaining control of both chambers of Congress that saw Pelosi enact trillions in new spending through the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS bill and the bipartisan infrastructure law.   \n   When Democrats lost control of the chamber in the 2022 midterm elections, Pelosi stepped down from leadership amid demands for a turnover to allow a new generation of leaders to ascend. Pelosi continued to serve in the House during a time when Democrats continued to search for a path out of the minority in Washington.   \"History will note she is the most consequential speaker of the House of Representatives in our history,\" then-President Biden said at the time.   That same year, Pelosi's husband, Paul, was violently attacked by an intruder who broke into their home demanding to see the then-speaker. Paul Pelosi underwent surgery to repair a skull fracture and serious injuries to his right arm and hands. The attack was a stark example of the increase in political violence in the country.   Some two years later, Pelosi reportedly played a role privately and publicly in encouraging Biden to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race.   In 2024, Pelosi was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country's highest civilian honor.   Earlier this year, Pelosi signaled she would wait to make an announcement on her political future until after California voted on Proposition 50, a ballot measure that would enable state leaders to temporarily redraw current congressional lines to favor Democrats.   In a recent interview on CNN, Pelosi said she had \"no doubt that if I decided to run, I would win.\"   \"It isn't arrogant,\" she said. \"It's confident.\"\n",

Today's top stories   The government shutdown is now in its 37th day, and President Trump has been urging Republicans to end it by eliminating the Senate filibuster. Earlier this week, some Democrats expressed their interest in finding a way to resolve the shutdown, but their victories at the ballot box on Tuesday have emboldened many to hold firm. Meanwhile, the president acknowledged that the shutdown hurt Republicans on election night.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) speaks to reporters during a news conference on Nov. 5, 2025, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. The record for the longest shutdown in the U.S. Government was broken on Wednesday as it entered its 36th day.\n                \n                    Tom Brenner/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Tom Brenner/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Most Republicans are not in favor of ditching the filibuster, as Trump has sought, but some bipartisan talks appear to have picked up steam this week, NPR's Sam Gringlas tells Up First. The solution that Senate Democrats and Republicans could be discussing is a short-term funding measure until December or later, along with votes on a small package of regular appropriations bills. Republicans would need eight Democrats to sign onto a deal to reopen the government. However, the expiring health care subsidies remain a sticking point during these talks.   The Supreme Court has heard arguments in a case about Trump's tariffs, but has not yet issued a major ruling. Trump utilized a 1977 law, known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, to impose the tariffs. The central question of the case is whether the law gives the president the authority to impose tariffs on products from countries worldwide. The justices' opinions are not yet known, but their questions yesterday indicate that they were skeptical of Trump's position.    \n   🎧 If the court rules against Trump, the ultimate impact on tariffs is unclear. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben says the ruling would make a bunch of his tariffs illegal. Tariffs like the ones he's imposed on goods like steel and aluminum, however, would remain in place. The president has stated that this is the most important Supreme Court case ever. If the high court ruled against the president, it would be the first time they have tried to rein in his power.   In Chicago this week, the Trump administration has been taken to court by city residents who oppose the aggressive immigration campaign there. Judge Sara Ellis has listened to hours of testimony from citizens' accounts of jarring encounters with federal agents. Another judge, Robert Gettleman, presided over a hearing on Tuesday on the conditions inside an immigration holding facility in a Chicago suburb.    🎧 Ellis is preparing to hand down her ruling today in the preliminary injunction, according to Jon Seidel with Chicago Public Media and the Chicago Sun-Times. It would essentially extend the order she issued last month, limiting the use of force by federal agents against protesters. During yesterday's eight-hour hearing, Ellis heard from a woman who found herself staring down the barrel of a gun for filming the arrest of day laborers. She also listened to the video testimony of U.S. Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino, who stated that the use of force has been \"more than exemplary.\"   \n   Deep dive   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Natalya Kosarevich/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Tax season is approaching. The tax breaks extended under President Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" primarily benefit high-net-worth individuals and high-income earners. While middle-income households may experience modest relief, the majority of benefits will be allocated to those with substantial earnings, investment income, or large estates. Here are some provisions in the bill that favor upper-income individuals and families:    💰 Starting next year, Americans will have a permanent lifetime exemption for estate and gift taxes set at $15 million per individual and $30 million per married couple, up from $13.99 million and $27.98 million limits.💰 The exclusion for capital gains from sold qualified small business stock issued after July 4, 2025, has increased from $10 million to $15 million for companies with assets up to $75 million.💰 Bonus depreciation has been extended. This tax incentive enables businesses to immediately deduct 100% of the cost of qualifying assets, such as machinery and vehicles, rather than spreading the deduction over several years.

Kyra Lilien, who was hired in 2023, was presiding in a courtroom in Concord, Calif., in July when she paused the hearing of an immigrant seeking asylum to read an email.   \"I told them that we were not going to have a hearing because I had just been fired,\" Lilien said. Present in the court was a court interpreter and an attorney for the Department of Homeland Security. \"They asked me if I was joking.\"   Anam Petit, who was hired as an immigration judge in 2023 after a career in immigrant defense, was sitting on the bench in her courtroom in Virginia's Annandale Immigration Court in September. It was her two-year anniversary in the position and she was between hearings when she got the email.   \n   \"My voice was shaking. My hands were shaking. My mind was racing. And I gave the decision and I dismissed everyone without mentioning anything,\" Petit said. One decision that day was to deny asylum, and the other was a partial denial, each for a different member of one immigrant family, she recalled.   Tania Nemer was hired as a judge at the Cleveland immigration court in 2023. She had about 30 or 40 immigrants, a DHS attorney and staff in her court one morning in February. She had just finished explaining rights and responsibilities to the group when her door opened and her manager asked her to come with him. She was later escorted out of the building.   \"I didn't know at all why I was being fired at the time. And I kept asking; no one had a reason,\" Nemer said.   Nemer was one of the first immigration judges fired by the Trump administration after a slew of dismissals of leaders at the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), the branch of the Justice Department that houses immigration courts. Later that month, the administration fired 12 judges — an entire incoming class that had just been trained and was about to take the bench.   \n   Those dismissals come as the administration has ramped up mass deportations of those without legal status, and sometimes pointed to judges as obstacles in that effort.   The pattern has been consistent. Every few months this year, a new class of judges gets termination notices in the middle of the day, often while they are in the middle of immigration court proceedings. The notices often target those who have reached the end of their two-year probationary period, a trial period for federal workers before they are \"converted\" to permanent employees. It was previously common for these civil servants to be converted to permanent employees of the DOJ.   \n   \"None of us have been given an explanation, we are in the dark, but we've been trying to ascertain patterns,\" Lilien said, the former judge in northern California. She wonders if her past experience representing immigrants got her fired, even though she also worked at DHS as an asylum officer.   Her hunch has some correlation with the data. NPR has independently identified 70 immigration judges who received termination notices from the Trump administration between February and October. The number of judges who received termination letters matches the tally kept by the immigration judges' union. It also accords with NPR's past coverage of the terminations.   The count does not include assistant chief immigration judges (ACIJ), who are courthouse supervisors and also have their own dockets. The union has counted 11 ACIJs terminated.   \n   An analysis of each of the 70 immigration judges' professional backgrounds found that judges with backgrounds defending immigrants, and no prior work history at DHS, made up about 44% of the firings — more than double the share of those who had only prior work history at DHS.   NPR also analyzed the classes of judges onboarded between February 2023 and November 2024, who would have neared the ends of their probationary periods this year or are still in the probationary period. Of those judges, those who had prior DHS experience, including working as asylum officers and as attorneys for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, made up the largest share still on the bench.   Loading...\n   NPR reached out to the DOJ, EOIR and the White House for a comment on the firings and NPR's findings. The press staff at EOIR is furloughed due to the ongoing federal government shutdown, according to automatic email replies, though immigration courts are still operational. The White House referred questions to the DOJ.   \"DOJ doesn't 'target' or 'prioritize' immigration judges for any personnel decision one way or the other based on prior experience,\" a DOJ spokesperson told NPR in a statement. \"DOJ continually evaluates all immigration judges, regardless of background, on factors such as conduct, impartiality/bias, adherence to the law, productivity/performance, and professionalism.\"   The spokesperson added that, \"pursuant to Article II of the Constitution, IJs (Immigration Judges) are inferior officers who are appointed and removed by the Attorney General.\"   The spokesperson disputed the 70 count, saying the agency has terminated fewer than 55 judges, but was unable to provide more details. The agency's number is inconsistent with other news reports, NPR's prior reporting and the union. NPR reached out to reconcile the numbers. The DOJ spokesperson said staff have been furloughed and the Justice Department is not able to confirm their data.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Folders containing documents related to immigration cases are piled on a table in the office of Stephen Born, Esq. on July 31, 2025 in Everett, Mass.\n                \n                    Meredith Nierman/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Meredith Nierman/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Employees search for reasons   Fired judges have been grasping at straws to understand why they were fired — some have filed Freedom of Information Act requests. Others have turned to wrongful termination complaints and lawsuits. Some worry they were targeted on the basis of protected classes, such as gender or race.   \"I fit the bill,\" said Nemer, who had represented immigrants prior to becoming an immigration judge. Nemer listed off characteristics cited in a lawsuit she has filed, arguing she was fired based on various protected classes.   \n   \"It's hard to know without having the explanations of why judges were fired,\" said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan organization that focuses on immigration policy. \"But the way the Trump administration is approaching immigration courts reflects a really high prioritization of immigration enforcement and [the administration] has really made deportations this whole-of-government effort.\"   Immigration judges approve or deny a final order of deportation. Court officials have placed pressure on judges to move through their dockets faster, including by reviewing asylum cases without hearings.   \n   Each fired judge can leave behind thousands of cases, according to several interviews with fired judges throughout the year. Each case is an immigrant who has likely already waited years for their day in court, to make the case for why they should be allowed to stay in the U.S.   Many of these cases have now been reassigned to other judges, at the bottom of their already years-long dockets. Immigrants whose cases were already in progress, or set to be reviewed soon, now have new dates as far out as 2029.   There were 700 immigration judges at the start of the year. Over the past 10 months, EOIR has lost more than 125 judges to firings and voluntary resignations. Earlier this year, Republicans in Congress approved a spending bill that allocated over $3 billion to the Justice Department for immigration-related activities, including the hiring of more immigration judges, to address the backlog of millions of cases at immigration court.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Federal agents patrol the halls of immigration court at the Jacob K. Javitz Federal Building in June 2025 in New York City.\n                \n                    Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Fear of retribution   Probationary judges aren't the only ones who have been fired under the Trump administration. NPR tracked 12 fired judges who started prior to 2023. This means they were fired after their two-year probationary period.   Some have been left wondering if their firings were retribution for the decisions they made on the bench.   \n   Shira Levine had worked for EOIR since 2021 before being fired in September. She was presiding over a hearing for an immigrant who had already waited more than five years for a day in court when she got the email.   \"People looked surprised, but no one looked shocked,\" Levine said. \"That's because, unfortunately, this by that point had become a pattern.\" She said she didn't expect to be removed since she had passed her two-year mark. She was never given a reason.   \n   Levine, like several others, received a standard email that they were being terminated pursuant to Article 2 of the Constitution, which gives the executive the power to dismiss federal employees.   Levine thought she might have been dismissed because of her response to some recent Trump administration policies.   During the summer months, immigration judges had already had to contend with an outsized enforcement presence in normally empty courtroom hallways. ICE attorneys — who argue on behalf of a government that an immigrant should be deported — started more regularly filing \"motions to dismiss\" cases. When a judge granted such a motion, migrants would be detained before leaving the building.   \n   Levine said such motions should be granted if there is a change in the individual migrant's case, not a change in immigration policy.   \"I was not told it was because of my decision to deny the motion to dismiss that I was fired,\" Levine said. \"But I handed down a decision that contravened what they apparently wanted the judges to do.\"   Others, like Ila Deiss or Emmett Soper, who had been immigration judges since 2017 and 2016, served as career officials at the DOJ for nearly two decades.   Soper had been with EOIR since graduating law school in a variety of other roles. He doesn't know if his firing had anything to do with past policy work under the Biden administration's EOIR director or his handling of cases as a judge.   As the Trump administration brings in new people to the bench, he has concerns over the loss of experienced judges.   \"You have to be able to manage your courtroom and you have to make very difficult, sometimes life-or-death decisions, with the person whose life is going to be affected and the family members sometimes right in front of you,\" Soper said.   \"It's not something that you pick up right away. And with all of these judges — many of whom are very experienced — being fired, the agency is losing something that will take a long time to get back, if they ever can.\"   \n   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                People wait outside an immigration court and ICE field office on Oct. 24, 2025, in San Francisco.\n                \n                    Minh Connors/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Minh Connors/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Prior political interference   The agency is prioritizing other judges to hire.   The Trump administration has moved to bring back immigration judges it sees as unfairly fired by the Biden administration. The Justice Department, in a February memo, said that it cannot be confident the Biden administration was ethical and lawful in how it dismissed immigration judges and other adjudicators.   A handful of judges in 2022 had not been converted to permanent employment, sparking GOP outrage over what lawmakers saw as political interference.   \n   Earlier this year, Matthew O'Brien and David White, two of those judges let go under President Joe Biden, were reinstated at immigration courts in Virginia. O'Brien was brought back to a managerial position, as NPR previously reported — though he is no longer with EOIR. White is a judge at the Falls Church court.   The Justice Department appointed a new director of EOIR, Daren Margolin, in October. Margolin has previous experience as the assistant chief immigration judge, or courthouse supervisor, throughout multiple courts in California, and a background as a military and DHS lawyer. He had been fired from a command position at a Marine base for negligently firing a gun and had left EOIR in 2024 before returning to lead the agency.   Then the DOJ last month announced its first class of 2025, which included 25 temporary judges who are military lawyers.   \n   \"EOIR is restoring its integrity as a preeminent administrative adjudicatory agency,\" the announcement states. \"These new immigration judges are joining an immigration judge corps that is committed to upholding the rule of law.\"   The incoming class of permanent judges comprises mostly those with a background in federal government work, including EOIR itself and the Department of Homeland Security. Their previous jobs included training Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agents, serving as asylum officers and working for ICE's legal arm.   One judge was originally going to take the bench at the start of the year, but was among the initial class of judges fired before they could start. None of the incoming judges appear to have previously worked in the field of immigrant defense based on EOIR's announcement.   Immigration judges' backgrounds vary over time   In recent years, immigration judges' backgrounds have varied. Many came to the position after several years working for ICE's legal branch. Others became judges after working for immigrant defense nonprofits or in private practice. Some have no immigration law experience, which was previously a requirement for temporary judges but not for permanent ones.   \n   When immigration courts were first established, it was more common for immigration judges to have an enforcement background, said Dana Leigh Marks, a former immigration judge and immigration attorney who litigated landmark immigration cases before the Supreme Court.   Marks joined the court in 1987, when courts were still under the former Immigration and Naturalization Service branch of the DOJ.   \"Frankly, I was one of the individuals who was hired to show that it wasn't just a career path of prosecution that led you to be eligible to be an immigration judge,\" Marks said.   That push for professional diversification carried through the Biden administration. That administration selected as immigration judges not just immigration attorneys, but also criminal defense attorneys, other administrative judges across the federal government, and those with military experience, as it sought to diversify the perspectives of those interpreting the complicated set of immigration laws.   \n   Marks said that the president and his cabinet will continue to affect personnel decisions as long as these courts stay in the executive branch.   \"It's common sense that the boss of the prosecutor should not be the boss of the judge,\" Marks said, recalling the fight to keep immigration courts separate from immigration enforcement when DHS was created in 2002. Enforcement, which is primarily ICE, was separated from the DOJ.   —NPR's Rahul Mukherjee contributed to data analysis for this story.\n",

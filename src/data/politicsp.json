They did their sentence, but committed no crime.   A president, not a Queen, will again inexplicably \"pardon\" two turkeys, with no criminal record, in one of the strangest and most misunderstood of American traditions.   Let's clear some of it up:   This year's Turkeys are Gobble and Waddle    After the ceremony at the White House, the birds are headed back to the Tar Heel state, where they will spend whatever days they have left at North Carolina State University, a place that's been used before – in 2022 for \"Chocolate\" and \"Chip.\"   \n   A long history ... of sending turkeys to presidents    People have been sending turkeys to presidents since the late 19th century, but for decades, they were always meant to be eaten.   Lots of shenanigans took place, like the college student from Texas A&M in 1940 who hitchhiked 2,000 miles to Washington, D.C., with a turkey from Cuero, Texas – to give to the president. He stayed in a hotel that let the bird stay in a bathroom – until a maid let it out.   They found the turkey, gave it to the president, and it became such a thing, that members of Congress plucked feathers for souvenirs.   Sounds like a hoot… or a gobble.   The Turkey lobby takes over in 1947   The reason turkeys sit on tables in front of cameras with a president interacting with them is because of the National Turkey Federation, aka, Big Turkey.   Harry S. Truman was the first to be presented with one from the federation – and it started in protest. To save grain in a post-war conservation effort, Truman had established \"Poultryless Thursdays.\"   In protest, the poultry industry and others sent crates of chickens to the White House, in an effort known as \"Hens for Harry.\" It ended with the turkey federation mending fences and giving Truman a 47-pound turkey.   \n   Now, paid for by the turkey federation, the birds get to stay in – and mess up – an otherwise lovely hotel room in what has become days of photo ops before they are subjected to sometimes painful presidential jokes and looking like they'd rather be anywhere but there.   President Kennedy technically pardoned the first Turkey in 1963   But that wasn't the intention, and the president didn't use the word.   \"We'll just let this one grow,\" President John F. Kennedy said, looking at the bird, with a sign around its neck that read, \"Good eating, Mr. President.\"   The L.A. Times headlined the event as a \"presidential pardon.\"   President Reagan was the first to use the word pardon in relation to a turkey   But it wasn't a formal pardoning ceremony and it was a deflection from the Iran-Contra scandal.   In 1987, President Ronald Reagan was presented with a turkey, Charlie, but legendary ABC News correspondent Sam Donaldson took the opportunity to yell a question. He asked whether Reagan would pardon Oliver North and John Poindexter, who were involved in the arms deal.   \"If they'd given me a different answer on Charlie and his future,\" Reagan joked about the bird that was about to be pardoned, \"I would have pardoned him.\"   President George H.W. Bush formalized the modern-day event in 1989   Finally, the tradition became formalized with these words from the nation's 41st president:   \"[L]et me assure you and this fine tom turkey, that he will not end up on anyone's dinner table,\" George H. W. Bush said, \"not this guy — he's presented a presidential pardon as of right now—and allow him to live out his days on a children's farm not far from here.\"   For one more day, at least, the turkeys can feel like they are the champions.\n",

    "body": "\n      Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene's resignation is forcing the Republican party to reckon publicly with what the political landscape will look like when President Trump leaves the White House.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  What does it really mean when the president breaks up with one of his loudest supporters?MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Marjorie Taylor Greene went to Congress from Georgia in 2021, just in time to promote President Trump's bid to overturn his election defeat. Her comments and conspiracy theories caused even her own party to shun her at times, until she rose as a flamboyant Trump backer. That made it all the more striking when she resigned on Friday, saying the president abandoned his own agenda. In a few minutes, a Republican strategist analyzes the debate over who gets to define the GOP.INSKEEP: And NPR's Stephen Fowler is listening to that conversation. Stephen, good morning.STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Good morning.INSKEEP: How exactly does Greene critique Republicans?FOWLER: Well, there was this nearly 11-minute video she released Friday night that aired a wide array of complaints, including mentioning threats to her adult children and attacks led by President Trump calling her a, quote, \"traitor.\" But I think it's really important to listen to this point she made early on.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE: Americans are used by the political industrial complex of both political parties election cycle after election cycle in order to elect whichever side can convince Americans to hate the other side more. And the results are always the same. No matter which way the political pendulum swings, Republican or Democrat, nothing ever gets better for the common American man or woman.FOWLER: Greene says that American politics are not great right now. And even though Republicans have complete control of Washington, her argument is that party leadership isn't actually keen on leading.INSKEEP: Well, I guess this has been building up for a while. She criticized the president over his foreign policy, like when the United States bombed Iran. She questioned some domestic policies. And above all, she wanted the release of the Epstein files a lot more quickly than Trump was willing to agree to. So did she change?FOWLER: Well, in Greene's view, she's not the one that changed. It's Donald Trump and others in the Republican Party who have not maintained consistency when it comes to being Make America Great Again, America First conservatives. It's also important to note that Trump has never been a traditional conservative, and his return to office was built on convincing a lot of different groups and demographics with different ideologies and priorities to unite under that America First banner but defer to his interpretation of what being a conservative meant. There have been a number of instances where some of the Republican base voters this year have said, whoa, whoa, whoa, that's not actually what we wanted, like the Epstein files, where Trump went from, I will release them, to saying Republicans who want that to happen are stupid to collaring Marjorie Taylor Greene a traitor for supporting the measure to signing the bill.INSKEEP: Indeed. So what's the president saying now about Greene?FOWLER: Well, he told ABC News it was good for the country she was leaving, posted on his Truth Social website that she was a traitor, again, who would have lost a primary. Then he told NBC News that he'd actually love to see her return to politics eventually, all in the span of less than a day or so.INSKEEP: What? OK.FOWLER: It does underscore what people have been saying about the president, both in public and behind the scenes. There are some on the right who are echoing his attacks and say about Marjorie Taylor Greene, good riddance. There are other Republicans and even Democrats in the House who say she's making some good points about things. And for what it's worth, Marjorie Taylor Greene says she would have won her primary and thinks Republicans are set to lose the midterms. Some of that feeling is backed up by voters in the district and in Georgia, expressing support for her and disappointment in what President Trump is doing.And unlike plenty of clashes with more moderate Republicans who have all but disappeared from Trump's GOP, her role as this conservative stalwart inside the MAGA movement is really forcing the party to reckon more publicly and more quickly with the question of what the post-Trump GOP is going to look like.INSKEEP: NPR's Stephen Fowler, who's reporting from Atlanta. Stephen, thanks so much.FOWLER: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Republican strategist Alex Conant about the state of the MAGA coalition following Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's decision to resign from Congress.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  For more on this, we have Alex Conant. He is a Republican strategist with the public affairs firm Firehouse Strategies. Alex, thanks so much for coming back to see us.ALEX CONANT: Good morning.MARTIN: So Marjorie Taylor Greene is such a unique figure in politics, even in this era. But she's been such a strong loyalist for President Trump. Does her recent trajectory, like Steve pointed out - questioning the president's conduct, not just on the Epstein files, but on other policies - does that tell you anything about the state of the MAGA coalition?CONANT: Yeah, I mean, there's been a simmering debate within not just the Trump administration but the Republican Party as a whole over the last several years between the MAGA coalition, as you put it, and traditional conservatives. And you see it bubble up on issues like Israel, where you have a lot of people, MAGA leaders like the congresswoman, like Steve Bannon who don't want America to be very involved, don't want us to be as supportive of Israel compared to the more traditional conservatives.You see it on issues like health care, on issues even like the Epstein files, where you have (laughter) sort of the conspiracy theorists against the more traditionalists. And, you know, at the end of the day, these issues are starting to bubble up into the public. And I think what we saw over the weekend was the most vivid example of this coalition really has a lot of debate going on within it. And I think Trump is starting to struggle just really trying to keep it together.MARTIN: And what about her decision to resign? Does this strengthen or weaken or have any effect on the president's hold on MAGA?CONANT: Well, she's always been a bit of an iconoclast and, frankly, not all that popular within the Republican House caucus. I think the most immediate challenge is that he already has a slim House majority. It just got one vote less. And, you know, if some of her colleagues look at her and say, geez, you know, being a member of Congress isn't all it's cracked up to be, and they start to retire, too, he could have a real crisis on his hands just in terms of keeping the majority over the next year. You know, I think, beyond that, she quit in part because he was threatening to support a primary challenge against her, and she didn't want to lose her primary. That is a tactic he has used many, many times to keep people in line. But if, looking forward, him threatening primary challenges results in people just quitting, that doesn't necessarily help his cause either.MARTIN: You know, her online posts and her video, I'm sure you watched it. It was also an indictment of the current GOP leadership. And she predicted that Republicans would lose the House in the midterms. And I'm just interested in your take on that.CONANT: Well, we're still over a year out. I think it's going to be a very closely fought race. You know, historically, the party in power would lose the majority, and even more so when, you know, people aren't happy about the direction of the economy. That said, we're a long way out. Republicans feel really good about a lot of their recruits. I think the president and the White House have been more engaged in recruiting strong candidates this time than they were during his first term. So Republican insiders I talk to, Republicans running campaigns, they feel pretty bullish about our chances to keep the house.MARTIN: And, you know, the congresswoman threw cold water on this idea that she might've resigned in order to set herself up to run for president. But can you envision a different leadership role for her in the party in the future?CONANT: Well, look, she has a very high profile. The media loves to cover her. We're talking about her right now. I think anyone who can command media attention can command political support as well, especially in this environment. I think the 2028 Republican primaries are going to be fascinating because it's going to be a real debate ultimately between, do you have an America first, MAGA-style president continue, maybe somebody like JD Vance? Or do you have a more traditional conservative, somebody who supports Israel, somebody like Ted Cruz?I think, you know, if either of those two candidates, who both talked about running, if either of them falter, certainly somebody like MTG could see a lane. You know, whether or not she actually chose to run is anyone's guess. But I think we could end up seeing a much more competitive Republican primary than we're expecting right now, especially if Trump's political standing within the party deteriorates over the next 18 months.MARTIN: Before we let you go, what do you make of his kind of turnabout on her? I mean, yes, he generally gets very upset when people criticize him, especially people he thinks are supposed to support him. Well, pretty much everybody. He becomes infuriated when people criticize him or say that he's not doing what he's supposed to do, et cetera. But then within the span of such a short period of time, to sort of say, well, you know, I hope she'll think about a return to politics.CONANT: I think that's classic.MARTIN: How do you read that?CONANT: I think it's classic Trump. I mean, we saw the same thing with the New York mayor on Friday last week. And, you know, I worked for Marco Rubio in a previous life. You know, you talk about two guys who really went after each other and then became best friends afterwards. You know, I think Trump is one who's quick to turn this page, especially when he wins the back-and-forth.MARTIN: That is Republican strategist Alex Conant. Alex, thank you so much.CONANT: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Mark Kelly in the wake of a video of Democratic lawmakers urging servicemembers not to comply with \"illegal orders.\"   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth says the Pentagon is looking into remarks made by Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly. Last week, Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers with military or intelligence backgrounds released a video saying that U.S. troops must not follow illegal orders.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARK KELLY: You can refuse illegal orders.ELISSA SLOTKIN: You can refuse illegal orders.CHRIS DELUZIO: You must refuse illegal orders.SLOTKIN: No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our constitution.SUMMERS: President Trump responded on social media that this was, quote, \"seditious behavior punishable by death.\" But now one of the senators is facing the threat of court-martial by the Pentagon. NPR's Quil Lawrence is here to explain. Hi there.QUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE: Hi.SUMMERS: Quil, start by reminding us exactly what that video was about. Why are all of these Democrats talking about illegal orders?LAWRENCE: Well, there are two areas here. Judges have been ruling that some of the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops against the will of state governors is illegal. But there's also the ongoing lethal strikes against boats allegedly carrying drugs to the U.S. And that's another case where legal scholars and some European allies have said that they don't think these killings are legal. So this is six Democratic veteran lawmakers who are reiterating what troops, and especially officers, learn, is that you don't have to follow illegal orders and that, importantly, just following orders is not a defense for doing something illegal.SUMMERS: Right. So do you have a sense of why the Pentagon is specifically focusing on Senator Kelly?LAWRENCE: Yeah. Secretary Hegseth was very clear about this. Of all those six, Kelly is the only one who is formally retired from the military, and as such - he's a former navy captain, former combat pilot - so he can be recalled to active duty to face court-martial. But this would be unprecedented, I think. I spoke with military lawyer Kevin Carroll, who's a retired colonel, who served in the first Trump administration, and he said, the last thing even similar he could think of was in 1925 - so 100 years ago - but that was an active-duty officer. This is very different. And it seems, Carroll said, to be an attempt to silence political dissent.KEVIN CARROLL: Doing this to a retiree who also happens to be, you know, a senator who was considered for the vice presidency and might potentially be a presidential candidate in 2028 is really a horse of a different color.SUMMERS: Quil, has there been any response from Senator Kelly at this time?LAWRENCE: Yes. He put out a statement. I'll quote it partially. He said, \"Secretary Hegseth's tweet is the first I heard of this. I also saw the president's post saying I should be arrested, hanged and put to death. If this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable, it won't work.\" He also posted a photo on social media of his dress uniform with a chest full of medals, which I think largely is seen as a trolling of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth who doesn't have any of the sort of combat medals that usually would be expected for someone of his position.SUMMERS: Any sense of where all of this goes from here?LAWRENCE: Well, the Pentagon said it was reviewing this. It's not clear they'll actually charge him or call him back to court-martial him, especially because all these Democrats did was state U.S. military code, but it's a tough spot for troops right now. NPR and others have reported that the Department of Justice has determined these boat strikes are legal, so these troops have to follow their orders. But already, the head of Southern Command has left his - is going to be leaving his post shortly. Four-star Admiral Alvin Holsey reportedly had qualms about these strikes. That's according to U.S. officials who are not authorized to speak publicly.SUMMERS: NPR's Quil Lawrence. Thank you.LAWRENCE: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n   Utah Gov. Spencer Cox is comfortable bringing his faith into politics. He is less comfortable with a trend he perceives: \"Politics is replacing religion.\"   Cox drew widespread attention in September after the assassination of the activist Charlie Kirk in Utah. After briefing the public on the arrest of the suspect, the governor added a personal appeal for Americans to think about politics differently. \"I would encourage people to log off, turn off, touch grass, hug a family member, go out and do good in your community,\" he said.   Just before the Thanksgiving holiday, NPR sat with Cox for a conversation on the state of the country. He addressed the aftermath of the Kirk shooting in a divided nation — and discussed other issues, from nuclear power to artificial intelligence, that he sees as connected to those divisions.   \n   The conversation appears across several NPR platforms — on Morning Edition, in a special episode of Up First podcast, and in a video you can watch above or on YouTube.   Below are some key points from the conversation.   He says people heard and embraced his message in September   \"We have to decide: Is this an off-ramp?\" Cox said, adding that he believes some people are taking it. \"Here we are months later, and the response continues to be overwhelmingly positive.\"   He described meeting a mother whose son, she said, wanted to redirect his life, after hearing the governor's remarks. Cox also said he heard about the comments as far as New Zealand, where he traveled as part of a trade delegation.   A conservative Republican, Cox governs a state whose voters have sometimes been willing to tolerate criticism of President Trump. He describes his faith as \"core\" to how he approaches politics.   He remains concerned about a divided nation   Cox has made a signature issue out of \"disagreeing better,\" as he puts it: treating political opponents with civility.   \"We keep thinking if we just win this election, we'll never have to work with those people,\" he said. But the Constitution requires that \"we will always have to work with those people. That's how this gets done. We have to build coalitions.\"   \n   \"We're looking for tribes somewhere,\" he said. \"And we're finding that in politics. Politics is replacing religion.\"   He questions Trump's promise to investigate liberal groups   Cox said if groups really are encouraging violence, then \"we should hold them accountable.\" But after the Kirk assassination, \"every single Democrat I know that I talked to about this was just appalled.\"   He said he preferred to focus on one gunman who was responsible.   \"In my faith, we believe in agency. We believe that we are responsible for our own decisions and that other people aren't responsible for those. And so to try to attack an entire group of people or an ideology because of one person isn't right and isn't fair.\"   \n   His critics include some on the right   Cox spoke at the first gathering of Kirk's organization, Turning Point USA, after the assassination. Some in the crowd booed him. Kirk had previously called for Cox to be expelled from the Republican party in 2022 after the governor vetoed legislation banning trans athletes from girls' sports in schools.   Cox said he thought it was worth going before a crowd that differed with him, and once he explained his reasons for the veto, the crowd applauded. He has argued that the legislation targeted just a handful of athletes, was poorly conceived and would simply lead to lawsuits.   He says Trump hasn't taken up the opportunity to unify the nation   Cox said he didn't vote for Trump in 2016 or 2020, but endorsed him in 2024 after an assassination attempt in Butler, Pa. He called Trump's survival a \"miracle\" and said that only he could unify the nation. Asked whether this has happened, Cox said: \"I think if you were to ask him that question, he would say no. I don't think that's happened.\"   He nevertheless said the endorsement was valuable because \"I have an opportunity to have a relationship with the president. And I think that's very important to me. It's very important to Utahns.\"    \n   Cox said Trump called him after the Kirk assassination and praised his appeal for unity, even though Trump \"hasn't modeled that, and he sees the world a little differently than I do.\"   The radio version of this interview was produced by Taylor Haney and edited by Arezou Rezvani.\n",

Mark Kelly, a retired U.S. Navy fighter pilot and NASA astronaut, for possible violations of military law after he appeared in a video with other Democratic lawmakers urging active duty military and intelligence personnel to refuse \"illegal orders.\"   \n   In the case of Kelly, the Pentagon put out a statement saying that it had \"received serious allegations of misconduct against Captain Mark Kelly, USN (Ret.),\" and that \"a thorough review of these allegations has been initiated to determine further actions, which may include recall to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures.\"   The statement, posted on X, said: \"This matter will be handled in compliance with military law, ensuring due process and impartiality. Further official comments will be limited, to preserve the integrity of the proceedings.\"   \n   The move comes as the Trump administration faces legal questions surrounding its deployment of National Guard troops to U.S. cities and deadly airstrikes on boats suspected of drug smuggling in the Caribbean.   Last week, Kelly, a Democrat elected in 2020, joined five other House and Senate Democrats who also served in the armed forces or an intelligence branch in a video on X. In it, Kelly and the others said: \"This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence intelligence community professionals against American citizens. Like us, you all swore an oath to protect and defend this Constitution.\"   \"Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders,\" the video said.   \n   The video included appearances from Sen. Elissa Slotkin, a former CIA analyst, Colorado Rep. Jason Crow, a former Army Ranger who fought in Iraq, two Congress members from Pennsylvania -- Rep. Chris Deluzio, a former U.S. Navy officer, and Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, a former Air Force officer -- as well as Rep. Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, a former U.S. Navy intelligence officer.   After the video's release, President Trump posted on Truth Social that it amounted to \"seditious behavior\" that was \"punishable by death.\" Although the president later clarified that he was \"not threatening death,\" he posted again on Truth Social Sunday (in all caps): \"IT WAS SEDITION AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL, AND SEDITION IS A MAJOR CRIME. THERE CAN BE NO OTHER INTERPRETATION OF WHAT THEY SAID!\"   \n   After Trump's post, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in response to a question about the video on Thursday that any incitement to \"defy the chain of command, not to follow lawful orders\" was \"a very dangerous thing for sitting members of Congress to do, and they should be held accountable, and that's what the president wants to see.\"   Shortly after Trump's initial post on Thursday, House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters: \"For a senator like Mark Kelly or any member of the House or Senate to behave in that kind of talks is to me so just beyond the pale.\"   \"I'm not going to say anything more on it,\" he added.   Speaking on CBS' Face The Nation over the weekend, Kelly said Republicans in Congress had not spoken out after the president's threat. \"We've heard very little, basically crickets, from Republicans in the United States Congress about what the president has said about hanging members of Congress.\"   Reacting to the Pentagon on Monday, Kelly said that a post on X from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth \"is the first I heard of this.\"   \"I also saw the President's posts saying I should be arrested, hanged, and put to death. If this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable, it won't work,\" Kelly said in a statement emailed to NPR.   Only Kelly, who is formally retired from the Navy with the rank of captain, could be recalled to active duty for court-martial. Such a move by the Pentagon is exceedingly rare and it's unclear if defense officials will follow through on the threat.   Kevin Carroll, a retired colonel and military lawyer who served in the first Trump administration, told NPR that the only similar example he can think of dates back to 1925, when then-Army Col. Billy Mitchell was convicted by court-martial of insubordination. Mitchell, who later became famous for his singular focus on the need for the U.S. to build military airpower, made \"extremely strong statements, very critical of military leadership,\" Carroll said.   \n   But Mitchell was active duty. Because Kelly is retired and a sitting senator and possible 2028 presidential candidate, his situation \"is really a horse of a different kind,\" Carroll said.   In an email to NPR, Mick Wagoner, a retired Marine Corps lieutenant colonel who was a military lawyer for 17 years and deployed to four war zones, described such a move by the Pentagon as \"very rare\" and \"politically charged.\"   \"This is a real stretch by the administration,\" he said. \"This has generally applied for events that happened on active duty and were discovered post [active-duty] service.\"    \"It is hard to see it going forwards\" because of Constitutional protections for speech  \"made in the act of their official duties,\" he added.   Kelly is married to former Arizona Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords, who was nearly killed in 2011 in an assassination attempt. As a naval aviator, he flew combat missions over Iraq before being selected as an astronaut by NASA. He went on to fly two Space Shuttle missions as a pilot and two more as commander. His twin brother is former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly.   NPR correspondents Tom Bowman and Quil Lawrence contributed to this report.\n",

The decision from U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie on the appointment of Lindsey Halligan as the top prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia marks a significant setback to efforts to go after the president's perceived political enemies.    In dual rulings, Judge Currie said \"all actions flowing from Ms. Halligan's defective appointment,\" including the indictments against Comey and James, \"were unlawful exercises of executive power and are hereby set aside.\" Currie was nominated to the bench by former President Bill Clinton.   \n   The cases were dismissed without prejudice, meaning the Justice Department may be able to bring those cases again.   White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration disagrees with the ruling.   \"Everybody knows James Comey lied to Congress, it is as clear as day, and this judge took an unprecedented action to throw these cases out, to shield James Comey and Letitia James from accountability based on a technical ruling,\" Leavitt said on Fox News. \"We believe that the attorney in this case, Lindsay Halligan, is not only extremely qualified for this position, but she was in fact legally appointed, and I know the Department of Justice will be appealing this in very short order.\"   \n   Former lawyer for Trump   Trump tapped Halligan to serve as acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia after he pushed out the previous top prosecutor, who had expressed doubts about bringing charges against both Comey and James.   Halligan is a former insurance attorney who once served as Trump's personal lawyer before his return to office, when she joined his administration as a White House aide.   Halligan, who has no previous prosecutorial experience, was sworn in as acting U.S. attorney on Sept. 22. Three days later, she secured a two-count criminal indictment against Comey—just days before the statute of limitations expired. He has pleaded not guilty.   \n   \"I'm grateful that the court ended the case against me, which was a prosecution based on malevolence and incompetence,\" Comey said in a video posted on social media. \"A message has to be sent that the president of the United States cannot use the Department of Justice to target his political enemies.\"   \n   His attorney, Patrick Fitzgerald, said the decision recognizes that the case was brought by \"someone who had not authority whatsoever to be the United States Attorney.\"   \"The decision further indicates that because the indictment is void, the statute of limitations has run and there can be no further indictment,\" he said in a statement.   Halligan only one on the indictments   Two weeks after Comey was prosecuted, Halligan secured an indictment against James on charges of bank fraud and false statements to a financial institution. James, too, has pleaded not guilty.   \"I remain fearless in the face of these baseless charges as I continue fighting for New Yorkers every single day,\" James said in a statement.   Her attorney, Abbe Lowell, said they would continue to fight any further charges against her.   \n   \"The President went to extreme measures to substitute one of his allies to bring these baseless charges after career prosecutors refused,\" Lowell said in a statement. \"This case was not about justice or the law; it was about targeting Attorney General James for what she stood for and who she challenged.\"   In both cases, Halligan was the only prosecutor to present before the grand jury, the government has said in court papers.   Days before she was sworn into the role, Trump in a social media post called on Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Justice Department to prosecute Comey, James and California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff.   \n   Schiff is not facing charges but federal prosecutors are investigating him on allegations of mortgage fraud.   —NPR's Carrie Johnson contributed to this report.\n",

But there are lots of signs that support has evaporated. Democrats won big victories earlier this month in elections across the country – with large margins among Latinos. Poll after poll has shown Hispanics declining in support for Trump since he was sworn in for a second term.   And a new, major Pew poll of more than 5,000 Latinos across two surveys underscores this point.   \n   There were some eye-opening findings, including:   Seventy percent disapprove of the job President Trump is doing.    A majority — 55% — said they very strongly disapprove.    Among those who voted for him, Trump is down 12 points. At the beginning of his second term, 93% of Latinos who voted for him approved of the job he was doing. Now, it's 81%.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Pew Research Center\n    \n\n   \n   The economy is a major concern; 4 in 5 see it negatively, and they blame Trump.   The economy was a main reason so many Latinos crossed over to vote for Trump in 2024, but they are really down on how they view it now — 78% rated economic conditions today as only fair or poor. Trump does not escape blame, either. Sixty-one percent said his policies have made economic conditions worse; just 15% said they have made things better.Critically, half of poll respondents said that in the past year, they have struggled to afford food, housing or medical care.    Two-thirds disapprove of Trump's approach on immigration.   71% said Trump is doing too much when it comes to deportations, up 15 points since March.   More than half worry that they, a close friend or family member will be deported.   \n   More than two-thirds say the situation for Latinos has worsened.   That's up 42 points from when it was last asked in 2021. That includes 31% of Trump-voting Hispanics.    While Democrats feel this more strongly, the result is not driven by partisan identity. In two decades of conducting this major poll of Latinos, Pew notes that it has never seen Latinos say their situation is worse than the year before.   Four in 5 said Trump's policies have been harmful to Latinos, including a third of those who voted for him.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Pew Research Center\n    \n\n   \n   Most have serious concerns about their place in America.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Pew Research Center\n    \n\n   \n   Fifty-five percent said they have those serious concerns, up from 48% last year.   Remarkably, a third said they have contemplated leaving the country in the last six months.   Forty-six percent said that's because of the political situation in the country.   Twenty-six percent said it would be to find somewhere with a lower cost of living.\n\n\n",

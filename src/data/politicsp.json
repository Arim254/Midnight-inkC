It comes as polls show that voters are unhappy with many elements of his messaging so far.   Tuesday's speech in Clive, Iowa, is expected to focus on energy and the economy — two areas where Trump's policy changes in the last year have negatively impacted the state.   Trump was last in Iowa on the eve of July 4, 2025, where he kicked off a yearlong celebration of America's 250th birthday and touted Congress' passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which enacted sweeping cuts to taxes and social safety net programs.   \n   As the tax season starts, voters will begin to see the impact of the law's signature policies, like no tax on tips and overtime and an expanded child tax credit. Later this week, the Treasury Department will hold a summit to release more details about the \"Trump Accounts\" created by the law, which will be seeded with a $1,000 government contribution for babies born between 2025 and 2028 and which will serve as investment accounts for newborns.   Much has changed in those six months, though, as polling data suggests the American public has soured on the Trump administration's overhaul of the country's foreign and domestic agenda. That includes an aggressive immigration enforcement crackdown in Minnesota where federal agents shot and killed two people in two different incidents this month.   Last week, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that his message for Iowa was \"straight to the farmers,\" touting the billions of dollars the administration made available as bridge payments to farmers negatively affected by the president's tariff policies.   \"You know, the farmers like Trump, and I like the farmers,\" Trump said. \"The farmers have been very special to me. Very successful.\"   The speech also comes as farming industry groups have expressed frustration that the Republican-led House failed to include a measure allowing higher-ethanol E15 fuel to be sold year-round in its spending plan that passed last week.   \n   Ahead of Friday's deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown, Senate Democrats say they will not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security without additional guardrails for immigration enforcement after the latest shooting of a U.S. citizen by federal immigration agents.   Trump's visit to Iowa also highlights the political gravity that Republicans must overcome in an environment where voters are already primed to express displeasure with the party in power. The president earned 55% of the vote statewide in 2024 and Democrats hold only one statewide office, but that Democrat, auditor Rob Sand, has drastically outraised his opponents in the race for governor.   Control of Congress could hinge on Iowa, too: Three of its four House districts could be competitive, and national Democrats see the retirement of Republican Sen. Joni Ernst as an opportunity as Trump's popularity continues to plummet.   Recent surveys of Trump's approval rating find the president struggling with key demographics that swung toward Republicans in 2024 and also losing support on issues like immigration and the economy. At the state level, Iowa often gives Trump a lower approval rating than any other Republican-led state.\n",

The arrival of the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and guided missile destroyers accompanying it provide the U.S. the ability to strike Iran, particularly as Gulf Arab states have signaled they want to stay out of any attack despite hosting American military personnel.   \n   Two Iranian-backed militias in the Mideast have signaled their willingness to launch new attacks, likely trying to back Iran after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened military action over the killing of peaceful protesters or Tehran launching mass executions in the wake of the demonstrations.   Iran has repeatedly threatened to drag the entire Mideast into a war, though its air defenses and military are still reeling after the June war launched by Israel against the country.   \n   Both the Houthis and Kataib Hezbollah sat out from Israel's 12-day war on Iran that saw the United States bomb Iranian nuclear sites. The hesitancy to get involved shows the disarray still affecting Iran's self-described \"Axis of Resistance\" after facing attacks from Israel during its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.   Activists offer new death toll   The new figures Tuesday came from the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which has been accurate in multiple rounds of unrest in Iran. The group verifies each death with a network of activists on the ground in Iran.   It identified the dead as including at least 5,777 protesters, 214 government-affiliated forces, 86 children and 49 civilians who weren't demonstrating. The crackdown has seen over 41,800 arrests, it added.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A Hezbollah supporter waves an Iranian flag during a rally to show their solidarity with the Iranian government, in the southern suburb of Beirut, Lebanon, Monday, Jan. 26, 2026.\n                \n                    Hussein Malla/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Hussein Malla/AP\n    \n\n   \n   The Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the death toll given authorities cutting off the internet and disrupting calls into the Islamic Republic.   \n   Iran's government has put the death toll at a far lower 3,117, saying 2,427 were civilians and security forces, and labeled the rest \"terrorists.\" In the past, Iran's theocracy has undercounted or not reported fatalities from unrest.   That death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest there in decades, and recalls the chaos surrounding Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.   The protests in Iran began on Dec. 28, sparked by the fall of the Iranian currency, the rial, and quickly spread across the country. They were met by a violent crackdown by Iran's theocracy, the scale of which is only starting to become clear as the country has faced more than two weeks of internet blackout — the most comprehensive in its history.   Iran's U.N. ambassador told a U.N. Security Council meeting late Monday that Trump's repeated threats to use military force against the country \"are neither ambiguous nor misinterpreted.\" Amir Saeid Iravani also repeated allegations that the U.S. leader incited violence by \"armed terrorist groups\" supported by the United States and Israel, but gave no evidence to support his claims.   Iranian state media has tried to accuse forces abroad for the protests as the theocracy remains broadly unable to address the country's ailing economy, which is still squeezed by international sanctions, particularly over its nuclear program.   Some Iranian-backed militias suggest willingness to fight   Iran projected its power across the Mideast through the \"Axis of Resistance,\" a network of proxy militant groups in Gaza, Lebanon, Yemen, Syria and Iraq, and other places. It was also seen as a defensive buffer, intended to keep conflict away from Iranian borders. But it has collapsed after Israel targeted Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon and others during the Gaza war. Meanwhile, rebels in 2024 overthrew Syria's Bashar Assad after a yearslong, bloody war in which Iran backed his rule.   \n   Yemen's Houthi rebels, backed by Iran, have repeatedly warned they could resume fire if needed on shipping in the Red Sea, releasing old footage of a previous attack Monday. Ahmad \"Abu Hussein\" al-Hamidawi, the leader of Iraq's Kataib Hezbollah militia, warned \"the enemies that the war on the (Islamic) Republic will not be a picnic; rather, you will taste the bitterest forms of death, and nothing will remain of you in our region.\"   The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, one of Iran's staunchest allies, refused to say how it planned to react in the case of a possible attack.   \"During the past two months, several parties have asked me a clear and frank question: If Israel and America go to war against Iran, will Hezbollah intervene or not?\" Hezbollah leader Sheikh Naim Kassem said in a video address.   He said the group is preparing for \"possible aggression and is determined to defend\" against it. But as to how it would act, he said, \"these details will be determined by the battle and we will determine them according to the interests that are present.\"\n",

More Republicans are calling for an investigation after a second U.S. citizen was shot by a federal agent in Minneapolis.   The president is expected to tour a local business and give a speech on energy and the economy.   His chief of staff, Susie Wiles, says the trip is the beginning of what will eventually be weekly travel across the U.S. in support of Republican candidates ahead of the midterm elections. But Trump is unlikely to escape the controversy surrounding his administration's immigration tactics in Minneapolis.   \n   \"The primary news story at the moment isn't just the ICE-related shooting. It's the response to the ICE-related shooting,\" said Ryan Williams, a veteran Republican strategist who helped lead Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. \"That's what's going to be the focus. And the president can attempt to focus on the economy, on what he views are successes of his administration on the economic front. But he's going to be stuck talking about this issue for a significant period of time.\"   The Republican Party has struggled with how to respond to Saturday's fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse at a VA hospital.   The shooting happened just weeks after another Minneapolis protester, Renee Macklin Good, was killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.   A number of Republican lawmakers are pushing for more details about the second shooting, including Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas and Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.   This weekend, Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma questioned Trump's broader goals.   \"Americans are asking themselves, 'What is the endgame? What is the solution?'\" said Stitt. \"And we believe in federalism and state rights. And nobody likes feds coming into their state. And so what's the goal right now? Is it to deport every single non-U.S. citizen? I don't think that's what Americans want. We have to stop politicizing this.\"   \n   After his top officials rushed to declare the U.S. citizen killed by federal agents a \"domestic terrorist,\" Trump is now trying to strike a softer tone   Trump spoke with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Monday. Trump said in a social media post that Walz requested that they \"work together.\"   \"It was a very good call, and we, actually, seemed to be on a similar wavelength,\" Trump wrote.   But soon after the call, Trump's team was attacking Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey again.   Press secretary Karoline Leavitt blamed the local Democratic leaders for the tragedies, saying it was a result of their \"deliberate and hostile resistance.\"   She called on the city and state leaders to turn over \"criminal illegal aliens currently incarcerated in their prisons and jails and assist federal law enforcement in apprehending illegal immigrants wanted for crimes.   \"In Minnesota, ICE and local law enforcement can peacefully work together as they are effectively doing in so many other states and jurisdictions,\" she said.\n",

Funding for several federal agencies expires midnight Friday. Senate Democrats have now mobilized to block funding for the Department of Homeland Security in response to Pretti's death. And if lawmakers are unable to break the impasse, that could lead to a partial government shutdown at the end of the week. Joining us now to discuss all of this is NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales. Hey, Claudia.CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Hey, Scott.DETROW: So the Senate was on track to pass this final round of funding bills, with bipartisan support. How has the death of Alex Pretti changed that?GRISALES: Right. And to recap, the House passed this $1.3 trillion spending package to fund big areas of the federal government past Friday night, and it would include funding for the departments of Defense and Health and Human Services and others, and it did draw bipartisan votes. But Senate Democrats, on their end, had signaled this would be easily passed in their chamber this week. However, with the death of Pretti, we saw a 180. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says Democrats will block this entire funding package unless the DHS funding is split off from it. And Schumer said that the legislation, as written, is, quote, \"woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE,\" end quote.DETROW: Now, let's turn our head back to the last shutdown. There was that split among Democrats about holding out for health care subsidies. Are you seeing similar tension, similar splits in the caucus when it comes to what to do with Homeland Security funding?GRISALES: No, this is very different, even as Republicans push back on Democrats' plans to block this entire funding package if DHS is not pulled out of it. One aide told me that when we saw the killing of Renee Good earlier this month, that some said this was a one-off. But they argue that with the death of Alex Pretti, this is now part of a disturbing and alarming trend. And for Democrats, the intensity of the resolve is higher this time. And the Democrats we saw defect last time to end the government shutdown, such as Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, have already said they're nos this time. And so far, we've just seen one Democrat say he'll vote for the package. That's John Fetterman of Pennsylvania. He says he doesn't vote for shutdowns. So he may be on an island for his party this time around.DETROW: What are Republicans saying?GRISALES: Well, most Republicans are standing by the administration's policy in general, but we're seeing more and more call for answers. That includes Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick, who said he agreed with a statement issued by the NRA that there needs to be a full investigation. The NRA had taken issue with comments from Trump officials saying that Pretti was armed, so his killing may have been justified. We also know that the chair of House Homeland Security, New York's Andrew Garbarino, is also calling for an oversight hearing with DHS officials. We know DHS Secretary Kristi Noem will go before the Senate Judiciary Committee in March, but that is not soon enough for many.As for leadership, we're hearing Senate Majority Leader John Thune applaud Trump's decision to send Tom Homan to Minneapolis. He is hoping that will cool down temperatures there. And a spokesman for Thune said Monday, Republicans do not plan to separate the DHS funding bill out. So at this rate, we could be headed for a partial shutdown come this weekend.DETROW: That is NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales.

    "body": "\n      The Trump administration is working to reframe the narrative in Minneapolis on enforcing the law after outrage over killings continues.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  President Trump spoke to Minnesota Democratic Governor Tim Walz today about the federal immigration agents that have now killed two people in Minnesota this month, including 37-year-old nurse Alex Pretti over the weekend. The Trump administration has been trying to explain how those killings happened. It has now announced that border czar Tom Homan will take over running on-the-ground immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota. NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben joins me now with more. Hi, Danielle.DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey, Scott.DETROW: What do we know about what happened in this call?KURTZLEBEN: Well, President Trump and Governor Walz each put out a summary of the call. Now, Walz has given much more detail of the two - first of all, in a statement calling the conversation productive, which he then elaborated on in an interview with Minnesota Public Radio's Clay Masters. And here's what he said.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)TIM WALZ: Whatever has happened here, there is a definite change of tone. There is definitely a more collaborative tone. I want to make sure that I'm not jeopardizing that, that I'm going to take them for their word right now that they're going to reduce this force.KURTZLEBEN: So that's notable. Walz says that Trump said he's willing to reduce the force in Minneapolis. Walz also added that with Homan coming in, his understanding is that Greg Bovino, who had been heading operations in Minneapolis, is leaving and that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem will no longer be there. Trump meanwhile posted on social media about the call and he made it sound friendly. He said he and Walz were on a similar wavelength, as he put it. He also characterized Walz as, quote, \"happy that Tom Homan was going to Minnesota.\" Now, Walz and Trump both really seem to be emphasizing that they want to work together in the wake of these two killings.DETROW: I mean, how does this square with how the administration had previously talked about Walz?KURTZLEBEN: Well, there's a big contradiction, and it was apparent at the White House press briefing today, where press secretary Karoline Leavitt, she blamed Walz along with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for the Saturday shooting.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KAROLINE LEAVITT: But let's be clear about the circumstances which led to that moment on Saturday. This tragedy occurred as a result of a deliberate and hostile resistance by Democrat leaders in Minnesota. For weeks, Governor Walz and the mayor, Jacob Frey, and other elected Democrats were spreading lies about federal law enforcement officers.KURTZLEBEN: So you have Trump emphasizing cooperation, and then you have the White House blaming Walz. It really seems like they're trying to have it both ways here, to put out this red meat of slamming Democratic leaders as these irresponsible extremists while also trying to put out this message of, don't worry - we're trying to work together to improve things.DETROW: So that's their statements. Let's talk about their actions for a moment. The administration says it's sending border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota. What does this change mean? Why is this significant?KURTZLEBEN: Well, it seems clear this administration recognizes they need to change something in Minneapolis, which is something Walz also noted. Now, the whole world at this point has seen these two horrifying shootings on video. In that last one, you saw a man pepper-sprayed, wrestled to the ground by federal agents, one of whom shot him several times. So thus far, DHS Secretary Noem and Bovino, they've been the face of the immigration enforcement surge there. Homan, meanwhile, he is no moderate on immigration, but he did also serve under Obama. And Trump really seemed to emphasize this changing of the guard today. In announcing this, he went out of his way to say Homan hasn't been involved in Minneapolis and that he will be reporting directly to Trump.DETROW: Still though, Danielle, Stephen Miller and Kristi Noem have both called Pretti a domestic terrorist, a would-be assassin. It really seems hard to walk back that rhetoric.KURTZLEBEN: Very much, but they are trying. Today, when Leavitt was asked about that, she said she's never heard Trump characterize Pretti that way. And this is meaningful because Trump, as you know, has no problem being inflammatory. So backing away from this shows they're trying not to repeat that message.DETROW: That is NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben. Thank you so much, Danielle.KURTZLEBEN: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      In the past year, President Trump have often threatened or turned to military force. Yet he likes to present himself as a peacemaker, and that includes his new plan for a global Board of Peace.   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  In the past year, President Trump has often threatened or used military force abroad. Yet he also likes to present himself as the world's leading peacemaker, and that includes his new plan for a Global Board of Peace. We're going to talk through this apparent contradiction with two NPR correspondents. Daniel Estrin is in Tel Aviv. Hey, Daniel.DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise.KELLY: Hey. And Greg Myre is in Washington. Howdy, Greg.GREG MYRE, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise.KELLY: Greg, you kick us off. Explain what we know - where things stand with Trump's Board of Peace.MYRE: So Trump presented this at a ceremony last Thursday in Davos, Switzerland. He invited around 50 countries or so. Twenty or thereabouts have agreed to join. Entry is not cheap. If you want a permanent membership, you're being asked for a billion-dollar contribution. Here's Trump speaking at the event.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Once this board is completely formed, we can do pretty much whatever we want to do, and we'll do it in conjunction with the United Nations. You know, I've always said the United Nations has got tremendous potential, has not used it.MYRE: So Trump says he'll work with the U.N., but the concern among many is that he's looking either to rival or simply replace the U.N. He's been a longtime critic of big, bureaucratic global institutions like the U.N., and he may want an alternative where he'd be at the center and have control. Lots of details are still fuzzy, but it seems Trump would have power indefinitely, and he may be thinking of how he can still play a prominent role in global affairs after his presidency is over.KELLY: Right, because worth stressing that the way this is set up, it's not the U.S. president who is running the board. It is Donald Trump personally. Who are the other members who have signed on?MYRE: Yeah, the leaders who appeared with Trump last week include several autocrats whose countries lack democratic credentials and are accused of human rights abuses. We're talking about Belarus, Hungary, Saudi Arabia, Egypt. And they were happy to join. It seems this would give them a channel, or another channel, to Trump. But in contrast, many traditional U.S. allies in Europe and elsewhere have sounded deeply skeptical or just flat out refused to join. Two key countries, Russia and China, have been invited, but they haven't decided whether they'll take part.The U.N. isn't saying much so far, just noting that it works with many international organizations. But, again, we're hearing from a lot of critics who see this as an extension of Trump's effort to tear down the existing world order and remake it in his own image. Some are describing it as a vanity project for Trump and foreign leaders he likes - almost like a country club, a global Mar-a-Lago, with Trump at the head of the dinner table.KELLY: Daniel Estrin, jump in with the view from the Middle East. How does this Board of Peace fit in? Does this Board of Peace fit with existing efforts to resolve the Israel-Hamas conflict?ESTRIN: Well, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu actually joined the Board of Peace. Trump invited him. He was hesitant at first because of Turkey and Qatar's participation. They are seen in Israel as longtime backers of Hamas. But actually, Mary Louise, the Board of Peace was created and endorsed by the United Nations Security Council for one reason and one reason only, and it was to oversee Gaza reconstruction. So that is going to be the main test of this Board of Peace, and it's part of a bigger structure. It's going to be overseeing several other committees, but the whole goal is to take control from Hamas and to start rebuilding everything in Gaza, from education to policing to infrastructure.And really the bigger dynamic at play here is that the White House wants to move forward with the Gaza ceasefire, and Israel has been very leery for a long time.  That changed today. There was a huge development. Israel recovered the body of the last hostage taken in the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023. The White House and Israel are both welcoming this as a huge sea change and the opening of a new chapter in the ceasefire.KELLY: Daniel, just circling back to Gaza reconstruction, another development - Jared Kushner, Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, just introduced his vision for turning Gaza into something that appears to look like a glitzy beachfront enclave. Realistic?ESTRIN: Yeah, that is the question. Last week, Jared Kushner presented a slideshow. There were illustrations of dazzling skyscrapers on the shores of Gaza, and there was a blueprint he presented that promised to even build an airport in Gaza. And Kushner is calling it New Gaza. We have asked Palestinians in Gaza what they make of all this, and we hear a lot of skepticism. For example, Kushner's plan proposes only about a sixth of the housing units that Gaza used to have before the war. So Palestinians are saying, where are the rest of us going to be living? They don't see themselves reflected in what they see as a real estate project.It's going to need a lot of funding. Kushner is promising a donor conference in Washington soon. It's fundamentally going to be needing security because if you want to go in and clear rubble or begin building, you need security. So Kushner is calling for a phased demilitarization of Hamas. People involved in that issue are telling us that it's still being negotiated. Nothing has been agreed upon yet.Kushner is also calling for more aid and more temporary housing in Gaza in the next 100 days. But Prime Minister Netanyahu said today there will be no rebuilding of Gaza until Hamas is disarmed. So we're going to be seeing that tug-of-war continue between the U.S. and Israel over really how to proceed in Gaza.KELLY: Well, and staying with what is realistic or not in Gaza, I'm thinking back to the ceasefire, the big announcement in October. President Trump billed it as this huge breakthrough. Where does it stand?ESTRIN: Well, despite the ceasefire that was declared, fire has not ceased, Mary Louise. There have been lethal Israeli attacks on basically a daily basis. And now that that last hostage body was recovered today from Israel - to Israel, Israel's now willing to allow a new step - to open Gaza's main border crossing with Egypt.KELLY: Greg, last word to you. The U.S., in another development, is moving military assets to the Middle East for a possible strike against Iran. In about 30 seconds, what's the latest there?MYRE: Yeah, the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Lincoln has sailed into the Indian Ocean south of Iran, and it's in a position where it could strike. And the U.S. has moved other ships and aircraft into the region. And Trump has been intentionally vague about military action. This is the real Trump contradiction. He's bombed seven countries in the past year, but he's also had some diplomatic successes, and now he's pushing his Board of Peace to take a prominent role in other conflicts.KELLY: NPR's Greg Myre in Washington and Daniel Estrin in Tel Aviv, thanks to you both.MYRE: Sure thing, Mary Louise.ESTRIN: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

You can't,\" Rutte told EU lawmakers in Brussels. Europe and the United States \"need each other,\" he said.   \n   Tensions are festering within NATO over U.S. President Donald Trump's renewed threats in recent weeks to annex Greenland, which is a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark.   Trump also said that he was slapping new tariffs on Greenland's European backers, but later dropped his threats after a \"framework\" for a deal over the mineral-rich island was reached, with Rutte's help. Few details of the agreement have emerged.   The 32-nation military organization is bound together by a mutual defense clause, Article 5 of NATO's founding Washington treaty, which commits every country to come to the defense of an ally whose territory is under threat.   At NATO's summit in The Hague in July, European allies — with the exception of Spain — plus Canada agreed to Trump's demand that they invest the same percentage of their economic output on defense as the United States within a decade.   \n   They pledged to spend 3.5% of gross domestic product on core defense, and a further 1.5% on security-related infrastructure – a total of 5% of GDP – by 2035.   \"If you really want to go it alone,\" Rutte said, \"forget that you can ever get there with 5%. It will be 10%. You have to build up your own nuclear capability. That costs billions and billions of euros.\"   France has led calls for Europe to build its \"strategic autonomy,\" and support for its stance has grown since the Trump administration warned last year that its security priorities lie elsewhere and that the Europeans would have to fend for themselves.   \n   Rutte told the lawmakers that without the United States, Europe \"would lose the ultimate guarantor of our freedom, which is the U.S. nuclear umbrella. So, hey, good luck!\"\n",

It's the latest rebuke of the Trump administration's handling of the escalating political unrest in the city, just two days after intensive care nurse Alex Pretti was shot and killed by a federal agent during protests over the weekend. Both Pretti and Good were U.S. citizens and 37 years old.   \n   Despite originally supporting ICE's effort in the city, known as Operation Metro Surge, Madel called it \"an unmitigated disaster\" in his video, arguing it had \"expanded far beyond its stated focus on true public safety threats.\"   \n   \"United States citizens, particularly those of color, live in fear,\" he added. \"United States citizens are carrying papers to prove their citizenship. That's wrong.\"   Madel, a political newcomer, announced his bid for governor in December, vowing to make supporting law enforcement a priority of his campaign. He told the Minnesota Star Tribune earlier this month that he was providing legal counsel for the ICE agent who shot Good and that it did not change his political ambitions.   Despite Madel's exit from the race, there's still a crowded field of GOP candidates vying to lead Minnesota, a state that hasn't elected a Republican governor in roughly 20 years. Several candidates still in the race have not criticized the administration over ICE practices, while others have voiced continued support for the federal response.   The Minnesota gubernatorial race garnered national attention after the state's current governor, Democrat Tim Walz, announced he would no longer seek a third term amid blowback from the White House over his oversight of alleged social service fraud in the state.   \n   The fraud scandal unfolded as Minneapolis was already quickly becoming the center of a political fight between President Trump and Minnesota Democrats over the state's immigration laws and practices.   Both fatal shootings of Good and Pretti this month have further intensified that fight. But it also prompted several national Republicans to call for the Trump administration to cooperate with state and local authorities after shutting them out in both investigations.   \n   \"The events in Minneapolis are incredibly disturbing,\" Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said in a statement on Saturday. \"The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake. There must be a full joint federal and state investigation. We can trust the American people with the truth.\"   Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., echoed those calls for a federal-state probe, adding that \"any administration official who rushes to judgment and tries to shut down an investigation before it begins are doing an incredible disservice to the nation and to President Trump's legacy.\"   Administration officials have claimed that Pretti — who had a lawful permit to carry a handgun — was a \"domestic terrorist,\" and defended the response by federal agents as self-defense. However, footage captured in bystander videos and witness accounts contradicts that argument, and there has been no evidence that NPR has verified of Pretti brandishing his handgun at any time during the encounter with federal agents.   \"Lawfully carrying a firearm does not justify federal agents killing an American—especially, as video footage appears to show, after the victim had been disarmed,\" Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said in a statement Sunday.   \"A comprehensive, independent investigation of the shooting must be conducted in order to rebuild trust and Congressional committees need to hold hearings and do their oversight work\" she added. \"ICE agents do not have carte blanche in carrying out their duties.\"   Oklahoma Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt expressed concern about the administration's handling of the situation in Minneapolis, telling CNN in an interview Sunday that the president was \"getting bad advice.\"   \n   \"President Trump closed the border, promised to get violent criminals out of our country,\" Stitt said, adding that while he believes \"everybody agrees with that,\" Americans are unsure about the administration's \"endgame.\"   \"What's the goal right now? Is it to deport every single non-U.S. citizen? I don't think that's what Americans want,\" he said. \"We have to stop politicizing this. We need real solutions on immigration reform.\"   \n   On Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt doubled down on the administration's goal of deporting criminals living in the country without legal status, but acknowledged that no one in the White House wants to \"see people getting hurt or killed in America's streets.\"   \"This includes Renee Good, Alex Pretti, the brave men and women of federal law enforcement and the many Americans who have been victimized at the hands of illegal alien criminals,\" she said.   In a post on Truth Social Monday, Trump said that he spoke with Walz and that the two \"seemed to be on a similar wavelength\" in trying to reduce additional violence in Minneapolis, and said that the two leaders would speak again in the \"near future.\"   Walz also acknowledged a more \"cordial\" tone with the president in an interview with MPR News on Monday.   \"Whatever has happened here, there is a definite change of tone,\" Walz said. \"There is a definitely a more collaborative tone. I want to make sure that I'm not jeopardizing that, that I'm going to take them for their word right now, that they're going to reduce this force.\"   Walz also said that Greg Bovino, a Border Patrol commander, will be leaving Minnesota.\n",

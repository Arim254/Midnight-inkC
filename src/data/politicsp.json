President Trump welcomed the Olympic gold-winning U.S. men's hockey team to the Capitol for his State of the Union address Tuesday night, amid controversy surrounding FBI Director Kash Patel's celebrations with the team and backlash to comments the president made about the U.S. women's team.   The men's hockey team won the gold medal Sunday in a thrilling overtime final against rival Canada. It's the first U.S. gold in men's ice hockey since 1980, when an underdog American squad pulled off the \"Miracle on Ice.\"   \n   \"Our country is winning again,\" Trump said about 15 minutes into his speech.   \"To prove that point, here with us tonight is a group of winners who just made the entire nation proud: the men's gold medal Olympic hockey team,\" he continued.   The team entered the balcony of the House of Representatives, flashing their gold medals to chants of \"U.S.A\" and an approximately two-minute standing ovation.   \n   Trump also announced he will be giving team goaltender Connor Hellebuyck, who made 41 saves in the gold medal game, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the U.S. government's highest civilian honor.   Trump invited the men's team to the address in a phone call Sunday after the game, and offered to transport them to Washington on a military plane. A video of the phone call was shared on social media.   In that video, the president can be heard saying: \"I must tell you, we're going to have to bring the women's team. You do know that,\" and joking that he would \"probably be impeached\" if he didn't invite the women.   The women's team declined the White House's invitation to Tuesday's address citing \"timing and previously scheduled academic and professional commitments.\"   Trump said in his speech that the women's team would soon be coming to the White House. The team did not immediately respond to an NPR request for confirmation of the upcoming visit.   \n   FBI Director Kash Patel has also faced criticism after he was seen taking part in post-game locker room celebrations from Milan in videos posted to social media.   An FBI spokesman had said in the days leading up to the game that Patel's trip to Milan was primarily for professional purposes, and the government would be reimbursed for any personal expenses. White House spokesperson Steven Cheung reiterated on social media Sunday that Patel was in Italy \"meeting with regional partners and security teams.\"   But Democrats have decried the videos showing Patel drinking and celebrating in the locker room as a sign of government waste of taxpayer dollars.   Patel addressed the criticism on his personal X account Sunday, writing, \"For the very concerned media - yes, I love America and was extremely humbled when my friends, the newly minted Gold Medal winners on Team USA, invited me into the locker room to celebrate this historic moment with the boys- Greatest country on earth and greatest sport on earth.\"   Patel has previously faced scrutiny over his personal travels aboard a government plane. Before he took public office, he frequently criticized his predecessor Chris Wray for his use of the FBI plane.\n",

On Tuesday night, he delivered.   Tuesday's address lasted approximately one hour and 48 minutes making it the longest speech before a joint session of Congress in at least 60 years, according to the American Presidency Project, which tracks the lengths of each speech since 1964.   \n   It beats the record Trump himself set last year, speaking for an hour and 39 minutes in what was not technically a State of the Union (Because it was the first year of Trump's second nonconsecutive term, the speech was not classified as a State of the Union). Before that, the record was held by former President Bill Clinton for his 2000 State of the Union, which came in at an hour and 28 minutes.   The shortest speech of the past 60 years was former President Richard Nixon's 1972 State of the Union, which lasted only 28 minutes, per the American Presidency Project.   The runtime included lengthy pauses for applause, disruptions, recognition of guests, and cheers for the Olympic gold-winning U.S. men's hockey team.   The State of the Union gives the president an opportunity to set or reset the national agenda, and Trump's comes at a moment when most Americans say the country is worse off than it was a year ago, according to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll.   \n\n\n",

    "body": "\n      Facing rough poll numbers, President Trump has a lot at stake for the State of the Union address. Here's how other presidents have handled the moment.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  President Trump delivers tonight's State of the Union at a moment when he's facing considerable political challenges. NPR's Domenico Montanaro takes a look back to see what we might expect.DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Here's something you probably won't hear President Trump say tonight.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GERALD FORD: And I must say to you that the state of the union is not good.MONTANARO: That was Gerald Ford in 1975. He's the only U.S. president to explicitly say in a State of the Union address that the state of the union was, in fact, not good. And he had reason to. He had assumed office only months earlier after President Nixon resigned in the wake of the Watergate scandal. The country was facing a lot of challenges.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)FORD: Millions of Americans are out of work. Recession and inflation are eroding the money of millions more. Prices are too high, and sales are too slow.MONTANARO: Sound familiar? Prices, the cost of living are top concerns for voters now, and Trump has struggled when talking about it, often dismissing concerns. Here he was at a rally in Georgia last week.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They would say affordability. Everybody would say, oh, Trump's caused - no, no. They caused the affordability problem, and we've solved it.MONTANARO: Presidents often get more blame and credit than they deserve on the economy, but polling shows people say Trump's policies, particularly his tariffs, are making things worse. An NPR/PBS News/Marist poll this month finds 59% disapprove of the job that he's doing on the economy. Majorities disapprove of the job he's doing on foreign policy. Two-thirds say his immigration enforcement has gone too far. And perhaps no surprise, then, 57% say the state of the union is not strong. When presidents in the past have faced significant political headwinds, they've often dialed it back in State of the Union addresses, even trying to joke about their fortunes, like Bill Clinton did in 1995.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BILL CLINTON: If we agree on nothing else tonight, we must agree that the American people certainly voted for change in 1992 and in 1994.(APPLAUSE)MONTANARO: Wait for it.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CLINTON: And as I look out at you, I know how some of you must have felt in 1992.(LAUGHTER)MONTANARO: Just months earlier, Republicans rode a conservative wave to win control of Congress two years after Clinton himself won the presidency. As he then tried to position himself for reelection, Clinton sought common ground with a nod to the political right.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CLINTON: The era of big government is over.(APPLAUSE)MONTANARO: Presidents have also tried to find higher ground even after defeat.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GEORGE W BUSH: Tonight, I have the high privilege and distinct honor of my own as the first president to begin the State of the Union message with these words - Madam Speaker...(CHEERING)MONTANARO: George W. Bush in 2007, after his party lost control of Congress, congratulating the then-new speaker of the House, Democrat Nancy Pelosi. Presidents have also tried to address the issues that put them in a difficult position in the first place.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARACK OBAMA: Now, I have heard rumors that a few of you still have concerns about our new health care law.MONTANARO: Barack Obama in 2011, just after his party lost a whopping 63 seats and control of the House.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)OBAMA: So let me be the first to say that anything can be improved.MONTANARO: Even Trump in 2018, also suffering from low approval ratings, called for compromise on a comprehensive immigration overhaul.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: One where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs and must have.MONTANARO: He proposed a path to citizenship for people brought to the United States as children, known as DREAMers, and funding a wall along the southern U.S. border, as well as other restrictions. It went nowhere. Republicans wound up losing control of the House that November. Trump has shown no signs of compromise in this second term, and he has a lot of work to do, starting with this speech, to try to mitigate potential big losses for Republicans this November.

    "body": "\n      President Trump is expected to deliver a lengthy defense of the first year of his second term and make the case for his party ahead of the midterms in his speech Tuesday.   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  OK. Let's hear more about the State of the Union address tonight. It comes at a tense time, both at home and abroad. In the last few days, the Supreme Court ruled against a major part of President Trump's economic agenda. And overseas, he is debating his next move amid the U.S. military buildup around Iran. There is a lot the president could talk about, in other words. And NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben is here to talk with us and give us a little bit of a preview. Hey there.DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hello.KELLY: What do we expect tonight?KURTZLEBEN: Well, first off, we expect it to be a long speech. Trump said so himself yesterday. He just said, there's a lot to talk about. So, you know, put on some coffee.KELLY: Right (laughter).KURTZLEBEN: But beyond that, press secretary Karoline Leavitt - she said today that a large portion of the speech will focus on the economy, and she told Fox News that the cost of living is going to be a big part of that.(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FOX & FRIENDS \")KAROLINE LEAVITT: He'll be sharing these stories, again, of everyday Americans who are directly benefiting from his policies and making a few new policy announcements as well to continue tackling the affordability crisis that Joe Biden created one year ago.KURTZLEBEN: Now, the White House has told reporters, including NPR, that one new proposal will be a plan to make sure tech firms building new data centers, which use massive amounts of energy, pay increased electricity costs. So we'll see what other new policies he outlines and - this is key - if those require the help of Congress at a time when Republicans have slim majorities in both the House and the Senate.But to put a pin in another thing she said there - this White House is still making the case that any economic problems are Joe Biden's fault. Now, that gets harder with every passing day. But no matter what, any new policies aimed at the cost of living are going to come while the president says he's going to push new tariffs. Now, those raise prices. So that could end up giving mixed messages.KELLY: Yeah. On the tariffs, the Supreme Court, as we noted, just ruled against those last week - said they were unconstitutional. We expect he will bring that up.KURTZLEBEN: I would be stunned if he didn't talk about tariffs tonight. After that Friday ruling, he was furious, and he vowed to impose new ones. So maybe he'll say a bit more about what new tariffs he wants to impose. And with Supreme Court justices sitting right there in front of him, he may not be able to resist bringing up that ruling.KELLY: OK. On the world stage, over the past year, he has done a lot. Quite a bit of it has not been popular - things like regime change in Venezuela. What are we expecting there? Will he be defending his foreign policy agenda?KURTZLEBEN: Yeah. Well, I mean, first off, you're right, he's been active. There's Venezuela. There's the huge tariffs on China, tariffs on other countries, the attempts to broker peace in Gaza and Ukraine, threats to take over Greenland, picking fights with Canada, the attack on Iran and now, yeah, that military buildup around Iran. So first...KELLY: Long list. Yeah.KURTZLEBEN: ...Yes. It's wild to think about. I mean, so first off, we're going to be listening for any indications of what he's going to do with Iran. But beyond that, Trump initially ran on an America First policy. His foreign policy actions in this last year, though, haven't looked all that America First to some in his party. And now with this military buildup in the Middle East, the question is whether he makes an effective case for whatever it is he's trying to do there.KELLY: And just - Danielle, the moment that he's speaking in - he's delivering a State of the Union in a moment when many Americans say the state of the union is not strong. How does that affect tonight?KURTZLEBEN: Yeah. According to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll, 55% of Americans see the direction Trump is moving the country in as a, quote, \"change for the worse.\" Now, again, polls show Americans are also worried about their finances and those tariffs, and Trump's immigration policy has gone, over the past year, from a strength to a weakness. After all, it's only been weeks since federal agents killed those two people in Minneapolis. So tonight's speech - he has to assure Americans that he has the right vision for the country. And the question is, does that spur them to get out and vote for Republicans this year?KELLY: NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben, happy coffee brewing. Thank you.KURTZLEBEN: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Democrats pushed back against President Trump's State of the Union address Tuesday night, with some lawmakers boycotting the speech, attending counter-programming or mounting a small number of protests from within the House chamber.   In the lead-up to the address, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., urged Democrats to \"attend with silent defiance,\" or choose not to attend. However, Trump repeatedly sparred with seated Democrats as some interrupted or refused to applaud during his address.   The pushback comes as Democrats enter a midterm year where they hope political headwinds can help them make gains in the House and Senate. In the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll, 57% of respondents said the state of the union is not strong, including 8 in 10 Democrats and about two-thirds of independents. Sixty percent said the country is worse off than it was a year ago, including about two-thirds of independents and 9 in 10 Democrats.   \n   Dozens of Democratic lawmakers skipped Trump's speech, with some addressing a few hundred protesters who congregated on the National Mall for a counter-event dubbed the \"People's State of the Union.\" A number of others walked out as Trump delivered his remarks.   At the start of Tuesday's address, Rep. Al Green, D-Texas., held up a sign that read, \"Black people aren't apes,\" — a reference to the racist video depicting former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes that was posted on Trump's social media account earlier this month. Green was then escorted out of the chamber.   Green was also removed from the chamber last year for protesting Trump's address to a joint session of Congress.   Other protests came as Trump touted his immigration crackdown and criticized liberal cities designated as sanctuary jurisdictions. Democratic Rep. Norma Torres, D-Calif., could be seen holding up photos of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, the two U.S. citizens killed by immigration enforcement officers in Minneapolis last month. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn, also shouted, \"you have killed Americans\" as Trump discussed his immigration enforcement.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Rep.

I'm telling you, they're crazy,\" Trump said minutes later, remarking again that Democrats were not standing up and applauding, prompting more shouts from the crowd. \"We're lucky we have a country with people like this. Democrats are destroying our country,\" he added.   Democrats also invited over a dozen individuals to the State of the Union who say they were victims of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with guests and lawmakers wearing pins that read, \"stand with survivors, release the files.\" It comes as the administration continues to face pressure over its handling of information about Epstein and his network, including some from Republicans.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A woman wears a \"Release The Files\" pin at a press event with survivors of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein,  held by the Democratic Women's Caucus in advance of President Donald Trump's State of the Union address on Capitol Hill in Washington DC on February 24, 2026.\n                \n                    Alex Wroblewski/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wroblewski/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n",

Invitees at Tuesday night's address by President Trump include the gold-medalist men's U.S. hockey team, while Democratic lawmakers have invited several Epstein survivors.\n\n    \n        Politics\n    \n\n\n                  \n            February 24, 20267:24 PM ET\n\n      \n\n      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump is seen during a visit to the Fort Bragg U.S. Army base earlier this month in Fort Bragg, N.C.\n                \n                    Nathan Howard/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Nathan Howard/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   President Trump's guests for his State of the Union address on Tuesday night include a Virginia teen at the center of a legal case involving parental rights and schooling, the U.S. men's hockey team and Erika Kirk, the widow of activist Charlie Kirk.   While the White House kept Trump's full guest list under wraps for now, presidents traditionally extend invites to people who align with issues they support. First lady Melania Trump has picked her own attendees to highlight her platforms on AI education and foster care.   Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has invited the daughter of a Uyghur doctor who went missing in 2018. Several Democratic lawmakers are bringing survivors of alleged sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein.   \n   Traditionally, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle attend the address. However, this year at least five Democratic senators and 14 members of the House are choosing to skip over their opposition to Trump's agenda, and planning to attend an alternate event staged by MoveOn.org called \"The People's State of the Union.\"   Here's who will, and won't, be there.   Who's coming   Among Trump's guests is Saige Blair. Blair is at the center of a lawsuit involving allegations that Virginia school officials made decisions about Blair's well-being and gender identity without informing the then-14-year-old's parents. Erika Kirk will be there. She's the widow of Charlie Kirk and the new CEO and board chair of Turning Point USA, her late husband's right-wing youth organization. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that, with Kirk in the chamber, Trump \"will call on Congress to 'firmly reject political violence against our fellow citizens.'\" Kirk was named to succeed her husband as CEO after he was assassinated in September.First lady Melania Trump is bringing Sierra Burns, a participant in the Melania Trump Foster Youth to Independence Program, and Everest Nevraumont, a 10-year-old public speaker and advocate of artificial intelligence education. \"Sierra and Everest embody my ongoing mission to uplift America's foster youth and expand opportunity for our next generation through education and technology,\" the first lady said. House Speaker Mike Johnson is bringing Ziba Murat. Murat is the daughter of Gulshan Abbas, a retired medical doctor who went missing in China in 2018, after her sister criticized the Chinese government's treatment of Uyghur people, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom says.The U.S. men's hockey team, which brought home the gold medal after defeating Canada at this year's Winter Olympics, is expected to attend, House Speaker Johnson told CBS News.Democratic California Rep. Mark Takano will be attending with George Retes. Retes is a U.S. citizen who was on his way to work in Ventura, Calif., in July, when he said federal immigration agents pepper sprayed him, pulled him out of his car and detained him for three days with no explanation and no judicial hearing.Republican Rep. Pete Stauber of Minnesota is bringing conservative Youtuber Nick Shirley, according to The Minnesota Star Tribune. \"Nick played a significant role in showing the nation the crisis level of fraud and corruption happening in our own state government that's cost taxpayers $9 billion,\" Stauber said on X. Democratic Rep. Suhas Subramanyam of Virginia has invited the brother and sister-in-law of Virginia Roberts Giuffre, one of the most visible victims of abuse by late financier Jeffrey Epstein. Other Epstein survivors were also invited: Jess Michaels was invited by Rep. James Walkinshaw, D-Va., and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., invited Haley Robson.    \n   Who's not coming   The U.S. women's Olympic hockey team, also fresh off its Olympic gold-medal win, has reportedly declined President Trump's invitation due to scheduling conflicts. \"We are sincerely grateful for the invitation … and deeply appreciate the recognition of their extraordinary achievement,\" a USA Hockey spokesperson said, according to NBC News.    Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen, of Maryland, said he won't be at the State of the Union. His name appears on the flier for The People's State of the Union. \"Trump is marching America towards fascism, and I refuse to normalize his shredding of our Constitution & democracy,\" he said last week.Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts said in a statement he's also going to the alternative event. Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California said in a video that, for the first time, he's not attending the State of the Union. He said he'll be outside the Capitol at The People's State of the Union. \"I will not give him the audience he craves for the lies that he tells,\" he said. Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts said she's missing the traditional address to attend the alternative event because she refuses \"to sit and listen to that man spew lies and hate.\"Other politicians expected to attend The People's State of the Union include Sens. Ruben Gallego, Tina Smith and Jeff Merkley; as well as House Reps. Yassamin Ansari, Becca Balint, Greg Casar, Teresa Leger Fernandez, Maxwell Frost, Robert Garcia, Jim Himes, Sara Jacobs, Pramila Jayapal, John Larson, Sydney Kamlager-Dove, Summer Lee, Chellie Pingree, Emily Randall, Mary Gay Scanlon, Delia Ramirez and Bonnie Watson Coleman, according to the event's organizers.   \n\n\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Mary Louise Kelly talks with conservative podcaster Michael Knowles, host of The Michael Knowles Show, about what he hopes to hear from President Trump tonight in the State of the Union.   \n\n    (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's going to be a long speech because I have - we have so much to talk about.MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  A long speech because there's so much to talk about. President Trump giving us a preview there of his State of the Union address tonight. The constitutionally mandated address to Congress is expected to kick off at 9:00 p.m. Eastern. Among those who will be listening live in the room, conservative podcaster Michael Knowles. He is there as a guest of House Speaker Mike Johnson, and he joins us now to share what he will be listening for. Welcome. Good to speak to you again.MICHAEL KNOWLES: Wonderful to be with you. Thanks for having me.KELLY: What do you see as the point of a speech like tonight's? In an era when most Americans have made up their minds what they think about President Trump, what they think of his agenda, what do you think a State of the Union address can achieve?KNOWLES: Well, the first point is he has to do it. It's constitutionally required. But obviously, the president is thinking beyond that, and we're obviously looking ahead at the midterms here. So I think that the point of the speech is not even so much to convey all of the accomplishments of the administration. And I agree with President Trump - I think there have been a lot of accomplishments in the administration on a whole variety of issues. But the poll numbers for the president are mixed, and they're sometimes even mixed on particular issues, the clearest one being, in the wake of the enforcement of immigration law in Minnesota, that the majority of Americans still support mass deportations, and also the majority of Americans want ICE to stop deporting these people. And so there's a little bit of a contradiction.KELLY: And I will just insert - you're talking about polling numbers - the latest Washington Post/ABC News/Ipsos poll has got 58% of Americans disapprove of the way that President Trump is handling immigration.KNOWLES: On ICE, yes. So this is what's so strange, though, is when you dial in on the issue, they still support immigration enforcement. That was one of the reasons President Trump won the popular vote. But then some of the particulars have made people uneasy. And so I...KELLY: But to circle us in on tonight, relate that to...KNOWLES: Yes.KELLY: ...Tonight and what you're hoping the president will hear. You want to hear him explain why he's doing what he's doing on immigration and a whole raft of other issues?KNOWLES: No. I think Ronald Reagan said it best when he said, when you're explaining, you're losing. The reason I mention the contradictions in some of the polling numbers is because I think what Americans want is a sense of safety. I think Americans feel uneasy. They feel uneasy on an issue like immigration. They feel uneasy on the economy. You know, there are a whole host of great economic numbers that have come out - rents falling six months in a row. The jobs numbers are pretty good. Inflation's quite good. The fundamental issues on the economy are looking quite good under Trump in basically every category. And so I think what President Trump has to do is relay the accomplishments across all of those disciplines in the administration. But what he has to convey to the American people is that he is the one who is bringing back security.KELLY: How confident are you that he will stay on message, on that message that you're laying out?KNOWLES: Well, I'm certain he will not stay on script. That is a guarantee. He will weave and go off script. However, I think he's gotten better at it, and he's gotten better at staying on message. I think he's honed in exactly what his message is. So I'm not placing any bets on him following the teleprompter, but I do think he will stay on message.KELLY: Should he use tonight to articulate to A, Congress and B, the American people what his aim would be for a war with Iran?KNOWLES: It will. Knowing President Trump's ability to surprise, you know, some of us might expect the bombs to be flying while he's speaking. Though maybe that's, you know, expecting too much.KELLY: But this is a man who campaigned for the White House on a promise to pull America out of endless wars in the Middle East, not to drag us into another one.KNOWLES: Certainly. But I think President Trump's record on war has been quite good. The action in Venezuela took about 88 minutes, start to finish. His action in Iran was over on the Fordo nuclear base before people even knew it began. And so the case that he has to make, regardless of what he does with regard to Iran, is that what he is doing is prudent. It is expedient. It is chiefly in the American interest, not in some kind of abstract interest, and that it will not be protracted.KELLY: Last thing, Michael Knowles, you know, at the outset of our conversation, I said he's going to be speaking to a lot of Americans who have made up their minds. Do they like him? Do they not? Do they like his policy and his agenda? Do - or not? We're speaking in a midterm year. For Americans, you know, going into tonight's speech who are skeptical, who didn't vote for Trump, who don't like him, is there anything you would wish to hear him say to reach across the aisle to build a bigger tent?KNOWLES: Well, he's built a large tent. I mean, I think we're underselling the fact that the man not only won reelection, but he won the popular vote. So, you know, he won the majority of American voters, which is good. He needs to maintain that coalition, perhaps even rebuild (ph)...KELLY: But again, back to those poll numbers saying 60% say the country is worse off than a year ago.KNOWLES: No, I certainly agree. He has to beef up that coalition. He has to reearn the support of some of that coalition. There's no question about that. But the way that he's going to do it is going to be to remind them why they voted for him in 2024 in the first place, and that is going to be recentering immigration. That's going to be recentering crime. And that's going to be recentering a normal American way of life. Many of the excesses from the Democrats that were rejected in November '24 pertain to the mass migration, to the radical social issues, notably the trans ideology and some other pieces. And so Trump, I think, needs to remind people that he represents normal. It's kind of funny because he's a billionaire reality TV star, but he needs to show them that he is the candidate of the ordinary American way of life and the ordinary American. He has done that before, and so what remains to be seen is whether or not he can do that again.KELLY: And I guess my question would just be what's normal? We're a big country with a huge diversity of people, which is one of our greatest strengths. Is there room in the tent for people who may have a very different view from President Trump's?KNOWLES: Certainly, there is room for people of a wide variety of backgrounds. However, there is still a norm. You know, basic stuff. Most people want to be able to afford a house, get married, have kids, have a brighter future, give their kids a brighter future than they themselves had. They don't want some of the radical ideologies, notably, once again, the gender ideology. They don't want totally open borders. They don't want foreign interventions that are disconnected from American interests. They want pretty basic stuff. And so we can say we're a wide, diverse country, but when it all comes down to it, the majority of people want roughly the same sorts of things. The Democrats had ceased to speak to those desires. Trump was able to really capture that, build a broad new coalition, and that's where he needs to get back to basics tonight.KELLY: Michael Knowles, I hope you packed your PowerBar to get through it, but promises to be a long and interesting night.KNOWLES: (Laughter) Wonderful to speak to you. And maybe I'll speak to you in a few days when the speech is over.KELLY: We will look forward to it. Thanks so much.

Trump's speech came as the public is intensely divided, and as his net approval rating has continued to fall. With midterms approaching, Trump faced the task of outlining an agenda that Americans — and narrow Republican majorities in Congress — could get behind. The challenge is all the more pressing, as the president's party tends to lose seats in midterm elections.   While Trump did outline some future policy objectives, the speech was also a mix of Trump touting his first-year record, slamming Democrats, and creating made-for-TV moments like when he reunited a woman with her Venezuelan uncle who had been kidnapped by Nicolas Maduro's government, or when he opened the evening by welcoming the gold-medal-winning U.S. Olympic men's hockey team. It ended up being the longest State of the Union ever, at more than one hour, 45 minutes.   \n   All about the economy    Trump spent a substantial portion of his speech talking about the economy. That included defending the many tariffs he imposed over the last year, despite the Supreme Court ruling last week that found a swath of those import taxes to be unconstitutional. He repeated his vow to impose replacement tariffs, authorized under different laws from those the Supreme Court struck down.   \n   \"As time goes by, I believe the tariffs paid for by foreign countries will, like in the past, substantially replace the modern day system of income tax, taking a great financial burden off the people that I love,\" he said.   \n   This isn't the first time Trump has said tariffs could replace income taxes. Experts have repeatedly disputed that this is either possible or advisable.   Trump has promised these new tariffs while he has also been mocking Democrats for their focus on affordability and instead making the case that he can ease the cost of living. Studies show that Trump's tariffs have increased prices for businesses and consumers, and a majority of Americans disapprove of his tariff increases, according to a recent Pew Research Center poll.   Trump also touted the tax cuts Republicans passed last year in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, but not without attacking Democrats for opposing them.   \n   \"All Democrats, every single one of them voted against these really important and very necessary massive tax cuts,\" he said.   While Trump spent much of his speech celebrating his first year in office, he also announced policies he wants to put into place, including \"ratepayer protection pledges.\" These would require tech companies building new data centers, which use massive amounts of energy, to pay more for electricity to mitigate price spikes for the communities where those centers are built.   He also said he wants to create retirement accounts for people without access to retirement plans with matching employer contributions. The government, he added, would match up to $1,000 per year in these accounts.   \n   Trump sees immigration enforcement as a win, too   Trump also leaned into the issue of immigration, which propelled him to two presidential wins. Among Trump's guests were the mother of a young woman killed by a person who was in the country illegally, as well as a young girl who was injured in a car accident involving someone in the country illegally.   At one point, Trump asked attendees to stand if they agreed with the statement: \"The first duty of the American government is to protect American citizens, not illegal aliens.\" When Democrats did not stand, Trump angrily and repeatedly told them, \"You should be ashamed of yourself.\"   \n   The moment led to some of Trump's most inflammatory and divisive language of the night as Trump castigated Democrats.   \"These people are crazy. I'm telling you, they're crazy,\" he added. \"We're lucky we have a country with people like this. Democrats are destroying our country, but we've stopped it just in the nick of time, didn't we?\"   While immigration was once a strength for Trump, his approval on the topic has turned negative amid his mass deportations and the deployment of federal agents to Minneapolis. In January, agents killed two American citizens.   \n   Foreign policy focus   Late in his speech, Trump turned to foreign policy, focusing on two main topics: the first was celebrating the freeing of Israeli hostages by Hamas, which his administration had pushed for. The second was Iran, where a U.S. military buildup has the world wondering what his next moves are.   Trump provided little new to answer that question. He said that after the U.S. attacked Iran nuclear facilities last year, Iran is still \"pursuing their sinister ambitions.\"   \"My preference is to solve this problem through diplomacy. But one thing is certain, I will never allow the world's number one sponsor of terror, which they are by far, to have a nuclear weapon,\" he said. \"Can't let that happen. And no nation should ever doubt America's resolve.\"   \n   Democrats respond   In the Democratic rebuttal, Virginia Democratic Gov. Abigail Spanberger emphasized topics Trump did not bring up, including the Epstein files, federal agents sending children to detention centers, Trump's White House ballroom project, and the DOGE mass firings of government employees.   \n   But she paid special attention to the cost of living, a topic that helped carry her and other Democrats to election wins in November. She criticized Trump's tax and tariff policies and praised new candidates running this year: \"Those who are stepping up now to run will win in November, because Americans, you at home, know you can demand more and that we are working to lower costs.\"      Follow for more coverage:📧 NPR Politics newsletter: Breaking down the big stories and why they matter🎧 The NPR Politics Podcast: Our experts provide insights into what's happening   \n",

President Trump delivered the first official State of the Union address of his second term on Tuesday night. The speech gave Trump the opportunity to tout accomplishments and outline his agenda for his administration's second year.    \n   It comes at at time when Americans are divided on whether Trump's first year has been a success. A new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll shows that six in 10 believe the country is worse off than last year and that a majority think the state of the union is not strong.   Reporters from across NPR's newsroom are fact checking his speech and offer context — on topics like immigration, the economy, tariffs and trade and foreign policy.   By topic: Immigration | Foreign policy | Economy | Energy | Government | Health | Crime      \n   Immigration   Do we have the strongest and most secure border so far?   TRUMP: \"After four years in which millions and millions of illegal aliens poured across our borders totally unvetted and unchecked, we now have the strongest and most secure border in American history, by far.\"   This is partly true.   It is not true that there have been zero crossings; for example, there were 237,538 in 2025, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. But Border Patrol encounters with migrants crossing into the United States from Mexico have fallen to their lowest level in more than 50 years, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of statistics from the federal government.   While it is true that there were a historic number of crossings during the Biden administration, it is untrue that the border was wide open for people to cross unvetted: in the final year of his administration, President Biden significantly tightened controls.   — Jasmine Garsd, Immigration Correspondent      Did murderers, ex-convicts and mental institution patients emigrate to the U.S. under Biden?   TRUMP: \"They poured in by the millions and millions from prisons, from mental institutions. There were murderers, 11,888 murders. They came into our country.\"   There is no evidence of this.   \n   A historic number of people came across the U.S. border during the Biden administration, however many were vetted. Programs like parole and the CBP One app required entry screenings and interviews.   There has also been extensive research showing that immigrants, both documented and undocumented, are less likely to commit crimes than citizens. What's more, although the number of people in immigration detention is at a historic high (near 70,000 as of earlier this month), around 74% have no criminal conviction.   — Jasmine Garsd, Immigration Correspondent      Did members of the Somali community pillage $19 billion?   TRUMP: \"When it comes to the corruption that is plundering — really, it's plundering America — there's been no more stunning example than Minnesota, where members of the Somali community have pillaged an estimated $19 billion from the American taxpayer.\"   Almost 100 defendants – many of Somali descent – have been charged by the Department of Justice in connection with alleged fraud connected to federal social safety net and child welfare programs in Minnesota, according to the White House.   In one high-profile case, federal prosecutors charged dozens of people in 2022 connected to a Minnesota nonprofit called Feeding Our Future with stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from taxpayer-funded child nutrition programs during the COVID-19 pandemic.   The president has used that controversy to attack the Somali American community at large in Minneapolis, including calling Somali immigrants \"garbage\" who \"contribute nothing.\"   — Jasmine Garsd, Immigration Correspondent      Foreign policy   Foreign investment    TRUMP: \"In 12 months, I secured commitments for more than $18 trillion pouring in from all over the globe.\"   Trump referenced this figure, but a White House website of total investment at both home and abroad sits at under $10 trillion. And other analyses have found that number inflated as well.   — Saige Miller, Washington Desk Producer      Iran's nuclear program \"obliterated\"   TRUMP: “That's why, in a breakthrough operation last June, the United States military obliterated Iran's nuclear weapons program with an attack on Iranian soil known as Operation Midnight Hammer. For decades, it had been the policy of the United States never to allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon.”   \n   Trump again repeated his oft-stated claim that the U.S. \"obliterated\" Iran's nuclear program during one day of bombing in Iran last June. There's a broad consensus that combined U.S. and Israeli strikes inflicted major damage on Iran's nuclear program. However, Iran has not allowed international inspectors to examine their nuclear facilities, making a precise assessment impossible.   In addition, Trump has not explained why he's considering a new round of attacks on Iran's nuclear program if it was 'obliterated' just months ago.   — Greg Myre, national security correspondent       \"I ended eight wars\"   TRUMP: “In my first 10 months, I ended eight wars.”    President Trump has had diplomatic successes, but his repeated claim that he's ended eight wars is an exaggeration.   Perhaps his biggest success to date was brokering a ceasefire in the Israel and Hamas war in Gaza last October. However, Israel has continued to carry out airstrikes, killing hundreds of Palestinians since the truce was announced. Israel alleges many ceasefire violations by Palestinian militias.   Trump's list also includes Israel and Iran. Israel and the U.S. exchanged airstrikes with Iran for 12 days last June before Trump declared a truce. However, none of the longstanding issues were resolved, and Trump is again threatening to attack Iran.   — Greg Myre, National Security Correspondent      Iranian protesters killed    TRUMP: “And just over the last couple of months, with the protests, they've killed at least — it looks like 32,000 protesters — 32,000 protesters in their own country. They shot them and hung them.\"   Iran's security forces unleashed a brutal crackdown against protesters in January. The Human Rights Activist News Agency has put the death toll at more than 7,000, though various human rights groups say the number could be even higher. Iran's government has acknowledged more than 3,000 deaths in clashes, a figure that includes protesters and security force members.   — Greg Myre, National Security Correspondent      \n   Economy   A \"turnaround for the ages\"   TRUMP: \"When I last spoke at this chamber 12 months ago, I had just inherited a nation in crisis with a stagnant economy, inflation at record levels…\"   The U.S. economy was in solid shape before President Trump returned to the White House for his second term. In fact, in October 2024, The Economist had labeled the U.S. economy \"the envy of the world,\" because it had bounced back from the pandemic recession in stronger shape than most of its peers. To be sure, many Americans were frustrated with the high cost of living, and that dissatisfaction contributed to Trump's victory the following month. However, costs have continued to climb over the last year, and that dissatisfaction is now weighing on Trump's own approval rating. Nearly six-in-ten Americans say the country is worse off now than it was a year ago, according to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll.   — Scott Horsley, Chief Economics Correspondent      Inflated claims about inflation   TRUMP: \"The Biden administration and its allies in Congress gave us the worst inflation in the history of our country, but in 12 months, my administration has driven core inflation down to the lowest level in more than five years, and in the last three months of 2025 it was down to 1.7%.\"   Inflation has cooled in recent months. But the cost of living is still climbing faster than most people would like. A few items have gotten cheaper in the last year, such as gasoline and eggs. But housing, groceries, electricity and natural gas have all gotten more expensive.   Inflation reached a four-decade high of 9.1% in 2022, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent prices soaring around the world. By the time President Joe Biden left office, inflation had fallen to 3%. It dropped as low as 2.3% last April, before rebounding to 3% in September.   \n   Trump's tariffs have raised the price of some imported goods, but the effects on the overall cost of living have been limited. Annual inflation dipped to 2.4% in January. (A separate measure of inflation, which is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, shows that prices are still climbing at roughly the same rate that they were a year ago.)   — Scott Horsley, Chief Economics Correspondent      Stock market    TRUMP: \"The stock market has set 53 all-time record highs since the election. Think of that – one year – boosting pensions, 401(k)s and retirement accounts for the millions and millions of Americans, they're all gaining. Everybody's up, way up.\"   The stock market has enjoyed big gains over the last year, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average topping 50,000 for the first time earlier this month. In 2025, the S&P 500 index jumped 18%, after a 24% gain in 2024. The stock market rally has given a boost to many people's retirement savings. It's important to remember, however, that stock ownership is very concentrated. The richest 10% of families own 87% of all stock market wealth, while half of all Americans own little or no stock.   — Scott Horsley, Chief Economics Correspondent      Job growth   TRUMP: \"More Americans are working today than at any time in the history of our country. Think about that — any time in the history of our country, more working today, and 100% of all jobs created under my administration have been in the private sector. \"   Job growth slowed sharply in the last year. U.S. employers added just 181,000 jobs in all of 2025, compared to more than 1.4 million in 2024. Hiring picked up in January of this year, but the job gains last month were concentrated in health care — an industry that is typically insulated from the ups and downs of the broader economy. Unemployment has remained low — just 4.3% in January — but that's up from 4% a year ago when Trump returned to the White House.   \n   — Scott Horsley, Chief Economics Correspondent      Tax cuts   TRUMP: \"Last year I urged this Congress to begin the mission by passing the largest tax cuts in American history, and our Republican majorities delivered so beautifully.\"   Congressional Republicans voted last summer to extend portions of the 2017 tax cut which otherwise would have expired last year. An analysis by the Tax Foundation found the package — the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — is the sixth largest tax cut in U.S. history, not the largest. The bill also adds new tax breaks on tips, overtime pay and Social Security benefits. The result will be somewhat higher take-home pay for many workers in 2026. The bill also cut government spending on safety-net programs such as Medicaid and food stamps.   The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office says the bulk of the tax savings will go to the wealthy. Middle-income households will see a smaller benefit, between $500 and $1000 a year. For families making less than $55,000 the loss of government benefits will likely outweigh any tax savings, leaving them worse off. The tax cut is also expected to encourage more business investment, which could boost future economic growth.   — Scott Horsley, Chief Economics Correspondent      Standing by tariffs after rebuke by SCOTUS   TRUMP: \"As time goes by, I believe the tariffs, paid for by foreign countries, will, like in the past, substantially replace the modern day system of income tax, taking a great financial burden off the people that I love.\"   The federal government has been collecting about $30 billion every month in tariffs, which is far more than it made from import taxes before Trump returned to the White House last year.   The Supreme Court struck down about half of Trump's tariffs last week, ruling that the president had exceeded his authority. Some of those levies are being replaced with alternative import taxes.   \n   The Constitution gives Congress the power to levy tariffs — though lawmakers have delegated limited tariff powers to the executive branch.   Economists say the vast majority of tariff bills are being paid by businesses in the U.S. that import products. In some cases, those costs are being passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices.   Tariff revenue, while substantial, has fallen short of what the administration projected. This is partly because some imports have been granted tariff exemptions, and partly because importers have shifted production to countries facing lower tariff rates. Imports from China, for example, made up 12% of total imports in 2024. By last fall that had dropped to about 8%.   — Scott Horsley, Chief Economics Correspondent      Tariffs and manufacturing   TRUMP: \"Moving forward, factories, jobs, investment and trillions and trillions of dollars will continue pouring into the United States of America because we finally have a president who puts America first.\"   President Trump argues that high tariffs will spark a renaissance in U.S. manufacturing. But it hasn't happened yet. Factories have been in a slump for most of the last year, shedding 108,000 jobs in 2025, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.   No doubt Trump's taxes on foreign imports have allowed some U.S. factories to raise their prices. But the vast majority of factory managers, many of whom rely on foreign components, say tariffs have been a drag on their business. \"Morale is very low across manufacturing in general,\" one unnamed factory manager told the Institute for Supply Management in December.   — Scott Horsley, Chief Economics Correspondent      Energy   Gasoline prices   TRUMP: \"Gasoline, which reached a peak of over $6 a gallon in some states under my predecessor — it was, quite honestly, a disaster — is now below $2.30 a gallon in most states, and in some places, $1.99 a gallon. And when I visited the great state of Iowa just a few weeks ago, I even saw $1.85 a gallon for gasoline.\"   \n   According to GasBuddy, only the cheapest 10% of stations in the country are seeing prices of $2.31 per gallon or cheaper. And while gasoline was $1.85 a gallon in Iowa in early January, prices have since risen. As for $1.99 gasoline, \"only 8 out of roughly 150,000 gas stations nationwide are selling gasoline below $2 per gallon,\" GasBuddy's Patrick de Haan wrote on Tuesday.   While the specific prices named by President Trump are exceptional rather than representative, gasoline is certainly cheaper now than it was before his inauguration. The national average gasoline price is currently at $2.92 a gallon, according to AAA, or about 22 cents cheaper than this time a year ago.   Those prices are driven by global markets, and a worldwide oversupply of oil is the dominant force keeping prices in check. Presidents do not set gasoline prices. However, politics can be a factor in global markets, and Trump has put pressure on the oil cartel OPEC to keep oil prices down.   — Camila Domonoske, Cars and Energy Correspondent      Data centers and electricity rates   TRUMP: \"Many Americans are also concerned that energy demand from AI data centers could unfairly drive up their electric utility bills. Tonight, I'm pleased to announce that I have negotiated the new ratepayer protection pledge. You know what that is. We're telling the major tech companies that they have the obligation to provide for their own power needs; they can build their own power plants as part of their factory.\"   Electricity prices rose 6.3% in the last 12 months – more than double the overall rate of inflation. That's partly due to the high cost of natural gas, which is a major fuel for power plants. It's also due to increased demand, some of which comes from power-hungry data centers. Rising electricity prices were a big theme in last year's gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia.   \n   — Scott Horsley, Chief Economics Correspondent      Venezuelan oil \"received\" in the U.S.   TRUMP: “We just received from our new friend and partner, Venezuela, more than 80 million barrels of oil.”   Since the U.S. captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro last month, the U.S. government has been helping sell some of Venezuela's oil. The U.S. has worked with two Swiss oil trading companies, Vitol and Trafigura. (Both Vitol and Trafigura have pleaded guilty to bribery and settled cases with the Department of Justice during the Biden administration.)   Secretary of Energy Chris Wright says that U.S.-facilitated oil sales total more than $1 billion. However the Venezuelan government has said it has only received $300 million. In a Senate hearing last month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said $200 million is in a bank account in Qatar. It's unclear where the rest of the money is and if and when it will get to the Venezuelan people.   The U.S. is the biggest producer of oil in the world and the world is currently oversupplied with oil.   – Julia Simon, Climate Solutions Correspondent      Oil and natural gas production   TRUMP: \"American oil production is up by more than 600,000 barrels a day ... American natural gas production is at an all time high because I kept my promise to drill, baby, drill.\"   The U.S. set an annual crude oil production record last year, rising about 400,000 barrels a day from 2024, according to the Energy Information Administration. That was not a new trend initiated by Trump — crude output rose for four years in a row. However, it's expected to drop by about 100,000 barrels a day in 2026, thanks in large part to low oil prices. Globally, the world is currently oversupplied with oil.   It is true that natural gas production is up; the EIA forecasts record natural gas production in 2026 and 2027. Natural gas prices were low in 2024 but jumped sharply last year, due in part to massive exports of liquefied natural gas from the U.S. to other countries, mostly in Europe and Asia.   \n   Oil companies have not been on a drilling spree, as Trump's \"drill, baby, drill\" phrasing would suggest. According to Baker Hughes, a firm that monitors the energy industry, the number of active drilling rigs in the U.S. this week is down about 7% from this time a year ago. Low oil prices and skeptical investors have kept companies cautious. However, technological improvements have helped make U.S. oil production more efficient, squeezing more oil and natural gas out of existing wells, which has helped keep production high anyway.   — Camila Domonoske, Cars and Energy Correspondent      Government   DHS and terrorism prevention   TRUMP: “As we speak, Democrats in this Chamber have cut off all funding for the Department of Homeland Security — it's all cut off. All cut off. They have instituted another Democrat shutdown, the first one costing us two points on GDP. Two points we lost on GDP, which probably made them quite happy, actually. Now they have closed the agency responsible for protecting Americans from terrorists and murderers.\"   Since Trump took office for his second term in January 2025, there have been mounting concerns among former federal employees and field experts about a diminished capacity to counter violent extremism. Many seasoned counterterrorism officials left government service, and budget cuts have fundamentally shifted the core infrastructure that had been devoted to community-based prevention programs, data-gathering and analysis. In the case of one of these programs, the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships, the administration replaced an outgoing head with a 22-year-old without experience in law enforcement or counterterrorism. Outside of DHS, other agencies that have traditionally played a role in countering violent extremism, such as the FBI, have seen manpower diverted to immigration enforcement.   — Odette Yousef, Domestic Extremism Correspondent      Congressional stock trading ban faces tough odds for passage   TRUMP: “As we ensure that all Americans can profit from a rising stock market, let's also ensure that members of Congress cannot corruptly profit from using insider information. They stood up for that? I can't believe it. I can't believe it. Did Nancy Pelosi stand up if she's here? Doubt it. Pass the 'Stop Insider Trading Act' without delay. I wasn't sure if anybody even on this side was going to applaud for that. I was – I’m very impressed.\"   Congress has unsuccessfully pursued a stock trading ban for their members for years. Members of both sides of the aisle have put forth proposals that have drawn broad, bipartisan support. However, those efforts have fallen short of becoming law.   Those failures have spanned several House speakers, including former Speakers Nancy Pelosi and Kevin McCarthy. Pelosi's husband, Paul, has drawn attention as a venture capitalist who has been active in trading.   This time around, the GOP-led Stop Insider Trading Act has little chance of passage, currently without much bipartisan support.   — Claudia Grisales, Congressional Correspondent      Voter fraud is already incredibly rare   TRUMP: \"I am asking you to approve the SAVE AMERICA Act to stop illegal aliens and others who are unpermitted persons from voting in our sacred American elections. The cheating is rampant in our elections. It’s rampant.\"   Trump has been claiming that noncitizens are voting en masse in American elections for more than a decade.   But it's illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal races, and they have never been found to vote in anything but microscopic numbers. In the rare cases they do vote, research has found it's often due to misunderstandings about the rules, as opposed to an attempt to influence election results, as Trump often claims.   Still, since Trump took office for his second term, his government has put more resources than ever before toward trying to find these voters. They've found very little.   \"Even states that are looking everywhere to try to amplify the numbers of noncitizens … when they actually look, they find a surprisingly, shockingly small number,\" said David Becker, an election expert who runs a nonprofit that has been tracking noncitizen voting audits across the country.   In Michigan, an audit after the 2024 election found 16 alleged noncitizen votes out of the state's roughly 5.7 million cast. In Iowa, it was 35 votes out of 1.67 million cast.   Experts often note that for immigrants without legal status, it doesn't make sense to risk prison, deportation and family separation to cast one ballot — especially because the inherent paper trail of voting makes it very easy to get caught.   Trump correctly noted that not every state requires voters to show photo ID at the time they cast a ballot. But he oversimplified the dozen or so states that don't have such a requirement in implying that anyone can easily vote without being verified by officials first.   Federal law already requires identity verification for all voters at registration, by mandating they provide a valid driver's license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number. People who don't register in person are also required to provide ID the first time they vote, regardless of the state they live in.   The SAVE America Act that Trump referenced tonight isn't expected to garner the requisite 60 votes in the Senate needed to overcome a legislative filibuster, but you can still read a breakdown of what's in the proposed Republican election overhaul here.   — Miles Parks, Voting Correspondent      Warrior dividend    TRUMP: \"Every service member recently received a warrior dividend of $1,776. You know, they put it on my desk. We got the money from tariffs and other things.\"   Trump announced military service members would receive a $1,776 \"warrior dividend\" during his prime time address in December.   The money was allocated to service members in the massive omnibus budget bill known as \"One Big Beautiful Bill.\" Congress — which has the power of the purse and is solely responsible for taxation and appropriation — approved $2.9 billion to subsidize housing for military members. Trump rebranded those funds as the \"warrior dividend.\"   — Saige Miller, Washington Desk Producer      Health   Prescription drug prices   TRUMP: “I’m also ending the wildly inflated cost of prescription drugs like it’s never happened before. Other presidents tried to do it, but they never could. They tried. Most didn’t try, actually. But they tried. They said they’d try. They couldn't do it. They didn't even come close. They were all talk and no action, but I got it done under my just-enacted most-favored nation agreements, Americans who have for decades paid by far the highest prices of any nation anywhere in the world for prescription drugs, will now pay the lowest price anywhere in the world for drugs anywhere – the lowest price. ”   This claim is not true. Americans still pay several times more money for prescription drugs than people in peer countries. The Trump administration has taken aim at drug prices in various ways, but how helpful those efforts will ultimately be — and for how many people — is not yet clear.   His biggest move so far has been to use tariffs as leverage to negotiate deals with more than a dozen drugmakers, and then launch a direct-to-consumer website called TrumpRx where people can buy brand-named drugs at a discount. There are only about 40 drugs currently available on the site, and those same companies Trump struck deals with raised prices on hundreds of other drugs they sell. For most people, using insurance and paying a copay for their medications will be cheaper than TrumpRx, according to an analysis by KFF.   What many peer countries do to keep the prices of prescription drugs down is to regulate those prices. President Trump and congressional Republicans have generally rejected that approach, branding it as \"government price setting.\"   — Selena Simmons-Duffin & Sydney Lupkin, health correspondents      Payments to insurance companies   TRUMP: \"That's why I introduced the “Great Health Care Plan.” I want to stop all payments to big insurance companies and instead, give that money directly to the people so they can buy their own health care, which will be better health care at a much lower cost.\"   At this point, Trump's \"Great Health Care Plan\" isn't a comprehensive health policy, but an articulation of policy priorities that Trump has asked Congress to develop into legislation. He supports loosening rules around mandatory benefits required by the Affordable Care Act and promoting health savings accounts, which allow people to set aside pre-tax funds to pay for certain health-related expenses. Under current law, HSA funds can't be used for health insurance costs like premiums.   Even the \"catastrophic\" or skinny plans preferred by Trump are private insurance plans, and the money paid for them goes to big insurance companies. The only way to stop payments to health insurance companies would be to bolster public health insurance options like Medicaid and Medicare.   A recent poll from KFF found Americans are more worried about health costs than any other household expenses. It also found that people plan to vote based on whether they think a candidate will help with health costs.   This year, ACA premiums have doubled on average, and in some cases, have increased much more, because Republicans did not vote with Democrats to extend extra ACA tax credits. Since then, more than a million people have dropped their coverage.   — Selena Simmons-Duffin, Health Policy Correspondent      Transgender youth   TRUMP: \"No state can be allowed to rip children from their parents' arms and transition them to a new gender against the parents’ will. Who would believe that we’re even talking about this? We must ban it, and we must ban it immediately.\"   For the second year in a row, President Trump has brought as a guest a parent with a story about a child who began a gender transition in secret. The children mentioned in both speeches seem to have done some version of \"social transition,\" which involves changing a name, pronouns, clothes, haircuts and the like. All of those things are reversible.   This is a topic he brought up frequently during his presidential campaign, in which he and Republicans spent millions on anti-trans ads.   So far, the Trump administration's efforts to ban trangender care has focused on medical interventions for youth. Using threats of withheld federal funding, investigations, proposed regulations, and subpoenas, the White House has succeeded in shutting down many gender clinics for youth at hospitals across the country. There are also many lawsuits challenging these actions.   — Selena Simmons-Duffin, Health Policy Correspondent      Crime   Declining murder rates    TRUMP: “Last year, the murder rate saw its single largest decline in recorded history. This is the biggest decline, think of it, in recorded history, the lowest number in over 125 years.”   Murders have been on a steep decline following a pandemic-era surge.   The homicide rate in 35 studied cities dropped 21% in 2025, compared with 2024, according to data from the Council on Criminal Justice.   The FBI hasn't released 2025 homicide data for all jurisdictions nationwide yet. However, the Council on Criminal Justice states \"there is a strong possibility\" that the murder rate will be roughly 4 per 100,000 residents. That, according to the council, would be the lowest rate ever recorded, going back to 1900. It would also mark the largest single-year percentage drop in homicides on record.   Murders and violent crime were already declining under the Biden administration. In 2024, President Joe Biden's final year in office, violent crime dropped to a 20-year low.   — Saige Miller, Washington Desk Producer      Was Iryna Zarutska killed by an immigrant?   TRUMP: \"She had escaped a brutal war only to be slain by a hardened criminal set free to kill in America — came in through open borders. Mrs. Zarutska, tonight, I promise you we will ensure justice for your magnificent daughter, Iryna.\"   Iryna Zarutska was fatally stabbed on August 22, 2025 while riding the light rail line in Charlotte, N.C. Zarutska, who was 23, was stabbed by 34-year-old DeCarlos Brown Jr., who has a reported history of mental health issues.   In tonight's address, Trump claimed Brown was an immigrant released into America thanks to an open border policy. There is no evidence of this. Local media has reported that Brown was born and raised in Charlotte and had spent time in and out of North Carolina jails.   — Jasmine Garsd Immigration Correspondent      Drug cartels as FTOs   TRUMP: \"For years, large swaths of territory in our region, including large parts of Mexico, really large parts of Mexico, have been controlled by murderous drug cartels. That is why I designated these Cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations, and I declared illicit Fentanyl as a Weapon of Mass Destruction.\"   Under Trump, the State Department has designated a number of drug cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations, or FTOs. This is a novel use of the designation, which has traditionally been used to go after overseas entities that have threatened the security interests of the U.S., such as al-Qaida or ISIS. This pivot in definition of FTO has raised some concern among those who were previously involved in the designation process and other counterterrorism experts. They say that responding to criminal narcotics enterprises that operate from a profit motive is fundamentally different from disrupting networks that sow ideological and violent opposition to the U.S. government.   — Odette Yousef, Domestic Extremism Correspondent \n",

    "body": "\n   DONALD TRUMP: Well, thank you very much, everybody. It's really an honor. Speaker Johnson, Vice President Vance, first lady of the United States. [Applause] Second lady of the United States. [Applause] Members of Congress and my fellow Americans, our nation is back, bigger, better, richer and stronger than ever before.   [Applause] Less than five months from now, our country will celebrate an epic milestone in American history, the 250th anniversary of our glorious American independence. This July 4th, we will mark two and a half centuries of liberty and triumph, progress and freedom, in the most incredible and exceptional nation ever to exist on the face of the Earth.   And you've seen nothing yet. We're going to do better and better and better. This is the golden age of America. [Applause] When I last spoke in this chamber 12 months ago, I had just inherited a nation in crisis with a stagnant economy, inflation at record levels, a wide open border, horrendous recruitment for military and police, rampant crime at home and wars and chaos all over the world.   \n   But tonight, after just one year, I can say with dignity and pride that we have achieved a transformation like no one has ever seen before and a turnaround for the ages. It is indeed a turnaround for the ages. [Applause] And we will never go back to where we were just a very short time ago. We're not going back today.   Today, our border is secure.   UNKNOWN: USA, USA, USA.   DONALD TRUMP: Thank you. Today our border is secure, our spirit is restored, inflation is plummeting, incomes are rising fast, the roaring economy is roaring like never before and our enemies are scared. Our military and police are stacked and America is respected again, perhaps like never before. [Applause] After four years in which millions and millions of illegal aliens poured across our borders totally unvetted and unchecked, we now have the strongest and most secure border in American history by far.   [Applause] In the past nine months, zero illegal aliens have been admitted to the United States. [Applause]   DONALD TRUMP: But we will always allow people to come in legally, people that will love our country and will work hard to maintain our country. [Applause] The flow of deadly fentanyl across our border is down by a record 56 percent in one year. [Applause] And last year the murder rate saw its single largest decline in recorded history.   \n   This is the biggest decline, think of it, in recorded history -- the lowest number in over 125 years. Year 1900, in fact substantially before my wonderful father -- I had a wonderful father, Fred -- before he was born, substantially before he was born. That's a long time ago. He wouldn't like me to say that.   But that's a long time ago. [Laughter] The Biden administration and its allies in Congress gave us the worst inflation in the history of our country. But in 12 months, my administration has driven core inflation down to the lowest level in more than five years. And in the last three months of 2025, it was down to 1.7 percent.   [Applause] Gasoline, which reached a peak of over $6 a gallon in some states. Under my predecessor, it was quite honestly a disaster; it is now below $2.30 a gallon in most states and in some places $1.99 a gallon. And when I visited the great State of Iowa just a few weeks ago, I even saw $1.85 a gallon for gasoline.   [Applause] Mortgage rates are the lowest in four years and falling fast, and the annual cost of a typical new mortgage is down almost $5,000 just since I took office, one year. [Applause] And low interest rates will solve the Biden created housing problem, while at the same time protecting the values of those people who already own a house that really feel rich for the first time in their lives.   We want to protect those values; we want to keep those values up. We're going to do both. [Applause] And we are going to keep it that way. The stock market has set 53 all-time record highs since the election. Think of that, one year -- boosting pensions, 401(k)s and retirement accounts for the millions and millions of Americans are all gaining.   \n   Everybody's up, way up. In four long years, the last administration got less than $1 trillion in new investment in the United States. And when I say less, substantially less. In 12 months, I secured commitments for more than $18 trillion pouring in from all over the globe. [Applause] Think of it, much less than $1 trillion for four years versus much more than $18 trillion for one year.   What a difference a president makes. [Applause] A short time ago we were a dead country, now we are the hottest country anywhere in the world, the hottest. [Applause] As thousands of new businesses are forming and factories, plants and laboratories are being built, we have added 70,000 new construction jobs in just a very short period of time.   It's getting bigger and bigger and stronger. Nobody can believe what they're watching. American oil production is up by more than 600,000 barrels a day and we just received from our new friend and partner, Venezuela, more than 80 million barrels of oil. [Applause] American natural gas production is at an all-time high because I kept my promise to drill baby drill.   [Applause] More Americans are working today than at any time in the history of our country. Think about that, any time in the history of our country, more working today and 100 percent of all jobs created under my administration have been in the private sector. [Applause] We ended DEI in America. [Applause] We cut a record number of job killing regulations and, in one year, we have lifted 2.4 million Americans, a record, off of food stamps.   [Applause] And for all of these reasons, I say tonight, members of Congress, the state of our Union is strong. [Applause] Our country is winning again. In fact, we're winning so much that we really don't know what to do about it. People are asking me, please, please, please, Mr. President, we're winning too much.   \n   We can't take it anymore. We're not used to winning in our country. Until you came along, we were just always losing, but now we're winning too much. And I say no, no, no, you're going to win again. You're going to win big; you're going to win bigger than ever. And to prove that point -- to prove that point, here with us tonight is a group of winners who just made the entire nation proud.   The men's gold medal Olympic hockey team, come on in. [Applause]   UNKNOWN: USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA. [Applause]   DONALD TRUMP: Go ahead.   UNKNOWN: USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA. [Applause]   DONALD TRUMP: That's the first time I've ever seen them get up. [Laughter] And actually, not all of them did get up. But they beat a fantastic Canadian team in overtime, as everybody saw -- as did the American women who will soon be coming to the White House. [Applause]   DONALD TRUMP: They were in the Oval Office before and I just want to say a second, very big congratulations to team USA. But I have to say that -- and I told them this and we took a vote of the team. I said, anybody votes no, I'm not doing it. So they stood there and they weren't about to say no, because I've never seen a goaltender play as well as goalie, Connor Hellebuyck.   [Applause] Think of it, 46 shots on goal. And I asked him, the one shot, the one where you put your stick in the back and it hit the neck of your stick and bounced off, do you practice that, or was that a little lucky? [Laughter] He refused to answer that question. But I just want to tell you that the members of this great hockey squad will be very happy to hear based on their vote and my vote, and in this case, my vote was more important, that I will soon be presenting Connor with our highest civilian honor, which we will be given and which has been given to many athletes over the years.   \n   But when I say many, not too many, like 12. [Laughter] It's called the highest civilian honor in our country, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. [Applause] Great athletes have gotten that, very great, the best and I thought he deserved it. And I did take a vote, every single one of them. I said, I'm not giving it if anybody says no. And every single one of them rapidly put up their hand.   So I want to thank you all. What a special job you did, what special champions you are. Thank you very much. [Applause] I'm also pleased to say that the next time the Olympic torch is lit, it will be here in America for the 2028 Olympics and it's the summer version right in Los Angeles. We're going to do a good job in Los Angeles.   [Applause] And Los Angeles is going to be safe just like Washington, DC is now one of the safest cities in the country. [Applause] And this year, and I must say, I got them both. I got them in my first term and I was disappointed because I didn't think I'd be the president when this happened. But strange things took place and now I've got them because I got the Olympics and I got the 2026 FIFA World Cup and I wanted to claim the 250th, but I didn't get away with that one.   [Laughter] I couldn't claim that one for myself, but we're getting the World Cup, so we have the World Cup and the Olympics coming and that is exciting news. [Applause] So this will be a year to celebrate our country and the heroes who have kept it free, men like Buddy Taggart. At age 17, Buddy volunteered to defend America in World War II, serving in the Pacific under the great General Douglas MacArthur.   \n   He fought bravely in the famous Battle of Manila, worked so hard. He was badly wounded and almost killed by enemy machine guns in Luzon. And 81 years ago this month, he liberated the largest internment camp in the Philippines, one of the largest anywhere in the world. But he earned many honors, including a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star, came home started a family and tonight he is in the gallery looking forward to July 4th, 2026, his 100th birthday.   [Applause] So Buddy, you're a brave man and we salute you. Even in times of challenge, setback and immense heartache, the spirit of 1776 has always shown through very brightly. It was July 4th of last year when flood waters tore through a girls' summer camp in central Texas, one of the worst things I've ever seen.   I was there. Rising 26 feet in the matter of minutes, tragically claiming many, many lives. You all remember that one. As the waters threatened to sweep her away, 11 year old Millie Kate McClelland closed her eyes and prayed to God. She thought she was going to die. Those prayers were answered when Coast Guard rescue swimmer Scott Ruskin descended from a helicopter above.   Nobody knew where he came from. It was Scott's first ever rescue mission, a young guy, but very brave, very, very top, always top in his class. And he lifted not just Millie Kate, but 164 others to safety. [Applause] People watched Scott from a distance and they couldn't believe what they were seeing. The winds were blowing, the rain was pouring, everything was going and that rapid water, nobody's ever seen anything like it. They said, wow, that's something.   Tonight, Scott and Millie Kate are here together, reunited for the very first time. Thank you, Scott, Millie Kate. [Applause] And Petty Officer Ruskin, I'm pleased to inform you that I am now awarding you the Legion of Merit for extraordinary heroism, which is what it was, extraordinary heroism. Thank you.   \n   [Applause] And I'd like to have the military aid to please come down and take care of the service, military aid. Thank you very much. Take care of that very important service. Thank you very much. From 1776 to today, every generation of Americans has stepped forward to defend life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.   And they really doing it for the next generation, but now it's our turn. Together, we're building a nation where every child has the chance to reach higher and go further, where government answers to the people, not the powerful and where the interests of hardworking American citizens are always our first and ultimate concern.   That is the debt we owe to the heroes who came before us and that is the promise we must keep to America for our 250th year.   DONALD TRUMP: Last year, I urged Congress to begin the mission by passing the largest tax cuts in American history and our Republican majorities delivered so beautifully. Thank you, Republicans. [Applause] All Democrats, every single one of them, voted against these really important and very necessary massive tax cuts. [Applause] They wanted large scale tax increases to hurt the people instead.   But we held strong and with the Great Big, Beautiful Bill, we gave you no tax on tips, no tax on overtime and no tax on Social Security for our great seniors. [Applause] And we also made interest on auto loans tax deductible -- the first time -- but only if the car is made in America. [Applause] Recently in Pennsylvania, I met Megan Hemhauser, a devoted mom who home schools her children -- beautiful, two children -- during the day while waiting tables at night as her husband works overtime operating very heavy equipment.   Megan is here this evening and she's happy to tell you that she is so, so much richer because, with no tax on tips, no tax on overtime and our expanded child tax credit done again by Republicans, Megan and her husband will take home more than $5,000 extra just for the year cutting her tax bill in more than half.   \n   [Applause] Megan, please stand up. We're fighting for you, Megan. Thank you. Thank you, Megan. We're fighting for you, Megan. Under our bill parents like Megan can also activate their children's brand-new Trump Accounts and I didn't name it. [Applause] I didn't name it. I did not name that. Nobody believes me, but I did not name it. It was named by a very tall man sitting right there in the third row.   Nice man, a good man. Tax free investment accounts for every American child. This is something that's so special and has taken off and gone through the roof. Millions will be prefunded courtesy of the US Treasury and private individuals like Michael and Susan Dell, who have donated $6.25 billion to fund the Trump Accounts for 25 million American children.   [Applause] They're great people. You know, I asked Michael Dell, how do you make all that money? He said, well, I just sat in my dorm in school, and I made computers and I'd sell them to people. And I just kept selling and selling and selling and pretty amazing story. That's called the American Dream. He sold a lot of computers, a lot of those laptops.   So, I congratulate him on that, but I really thank him and Susan, as well as others like Brad Gerstner a very tremendous guy. He was behind it right from the beginning, Brad Gerstner. Thank you, Brad. [Applause] So, with modest additional contributions, these young people's accounts could grow to over $100,000 or more by the time they turn 18. Think of it, how much money is that for somebody that started with nothing?   Over $100,000, could be much more than that. To make this investment in our children's future go to TrumpAccounts.gov, TrumpAccounts.gov. And a lot of people are doing it. That setting every record in the book. It's popular. They knew what was going to -- what it was going to take. I'm so proud of them. I'm so proud of the people that got it started.   \n   Now it's just taken off. One of the primary reasons for our country's stunning economic turnaround, the biggest in history where the Dow Jones broke 50,000 four years ahead of schedule and the S&P hit 7,000 where it wasn't supposed to do it for many years, were tariffs. I used these tariffs, took in hundreds of billions of dollars to make great deals for our country, both economically and on a national security basis.   Everything was working well. Countries that were ripping us off for decades are now paying us hundreds of billions of dollars. They were ripping us so badly, you all know that. Everybody knows it, even the Democrats know it, they just don't want to say it. And yet these countries are now happy and so are we. We made deals, the deals are all done and they're happy.   They're not making money like they used to but we're making a lot of money. There was no inflation, tremendous growth. And the big story was how Donald Trump called the economy correctly and 22 Nobel Prize winners in economics didn't, they got it totally wrong. They got it really wrong. And then just four days ago, an unfortunate ruling from the United States Supreme Court, it just came down.   It came down, very unfortunate ruling. [Applause] But the good news is that almost all countries and corporations want to keep the deal that they already made. Right, Scott? Knowing that the legal power that I as president have to make a new deal could be far worse for them. And therefore, they will continue to work along the same successful path that we had negotiated before the Supreme Court's unfortunate involvement.   So, despite the disappointing ruling, these powerful country saving, it's saving our country the kind of money we're taking in, peace protecting. Many of the wars I settled was because of the threat of tariffs. I wouldn't have been able to settle them without them. Will remain in place under fully approved and tested alternative legal statutes and they have been tested for a long time.   \n   They're a little more complex, but they're actually probably better. Leading to a solution that will be even stronger than before. Congressional action will not be necessary. It's already time tested and approved. And as time goes by, I believe the tariffs, paid for by foreign countries, will, like in the past, substantially replace the modern-day system of income tax, taking a great financial burden off the people that I love.   [Applause] Moving forward, factories, jobs, investment and trillions and trillions of dollars will continue pouring into the United States of America because we finally have a president who puts America first. I put America first. I love America. [Applause] For decades, before I came along, we had the exact opposite.   From trade to healthcare, from energy to immigration, everything was stolen and rigged in order to drain the wealth out of the productive hardworking people who make our country great, who make our country run. Under Biden and his corrupt partners in Congress and beyond, it reached a breaking point with the Green New Scam, open borders for everyone.   They poured in by the millions and millions from prisons, from mental institutions. They were murderers, 11,888 murderers. They came into our country; you allowed that to happen. And record-setting inflation that cost the typical family $34,000 in just a speck of time. Now the same people in this chamber who voted for those disasters suddenly used the word affordability, a word -- they just used it. Somebody gave it to them, knowing full well that they caused and created the increased prices that all of our citizens had to endure.   You caused that problem; you caused that problem. [Applause]   DONALD TRUMP: They knew their statements were a lie. They knew it. They knew their statements were a dirty, rotten, lie. Their policies created the high prices. Our policies are rapidly ending them. We are doing really well. Those prices are plummeting downward. [Applause] The price of eggs is down 60 percent. Madam Secretary, thank you.   The cost of chicken, butter, fruit, hotels, automobiles, rent, is lower today than when I took office, by a lot. And even beef, which was very high, is starting to come down significantly. Just hold on a little while, we're getting it down. And soon you will see numbers that few people would think were possible to achieve just a short time ago.   Nobody can believe when they see the kind of numbers and especially energy, when they see energy going down to numbers like that. They cannot believe it. It's like another big tax cut. I'm also confronting one of the biggest rip-offs of our times, the crushing cost of healthcare, caused by you, since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, sometimes referred to as Obamacare.   Big insurance companies got rich. It was meant for the insurance companies, not for the people. With our government giving them hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars a year as their stock prices soared 1,000, 1,200, 1,400 and even 1,700 percent, like nothing else. That's why I introduced the great healthcare plan.   I want to stop all payments to big insurance companies and instead, give that money directly to the people so they can buy their own healthcare, which will be better healthcare at a much lower cost. [Applause] In addition, my plan requires maximum price transparency. That's a big deal. [Applause] Sounds so simple, so big.   And I did that in my first term and the Democrats immediately terminated it with full knowledge that they were doing a very bad thing for the people. Costs we're going to go way up and that's what happened. And now I'm bringing them way down on healthcare and everything else. I'm also ending the wildly inflated cost of prescription drugs like has never happened before.   [Applause] Other presidents tried to do it, but they never could. They tried. Most didn't try, actually, but they tried. They said they tried. They couldn't do it. They didn't even come close. They were all talk and no action, but I got it done. Under my just enacted Most Favored Nation agreements, Americans who have for decades paid by far the highest prices of any nation anywhere in the world for prescription drugs will now pay the lowest price anywhere in the world for drugs, anywhere, the lowest price.   [Applause] So in my first year of the second term, should be my third term, but strange things happen. [Laughter] I took prescription drugs, a very big part of healthcare from the highest price in the entire world to the lowest. That's a big achievement. The result is price differences of 300, 400, 500, 600 percent and more, all available right now at a new website called trump.gov.   And I didn't name that one either, by the way. And here tonight is the very first customer ever to get that big discount, and it is big, Catherine Rayner. For five years, she and her husband have struggled with infertility and they turned to IVF. One drug has been costing Catherine $4,000 to purchase. But a few weeks ago, she logged on to the website and got that same drug that cost costs $4,000, got it for under $500, a reduction of much more actually than $3,500. Catherine, we are all praying for you and you're going to be a great mom.   [Applause] So now I'm calling on Congress to codify my Most Favored Nation program into law. Now the one thing I'm not sure it matters because it's going to be very hard for somebody that comes along after me to say, let's raise drug prices by 700 or 800 percent. But John and Mike, if you don't mind, codify it anyway.   They may do it. Codify it anyway. Thank you. Many Americans are also concerned that energy demand from AI data centers could unfairly drive up their electric utility bills. Tonight, I'm pleased to announce that I have negotiated the new Ratepayer Protection Pledge. You know what that is. We're telling the major tech companies that they have the obligation to provide for their own power needs.   They can build their own power plants as part of their factory, so that no one's prices will go up, and in many cases, prices of electricity will go down for the community and very substantially down. This is a unique strategy never used in this country before. We have an old grid. It could never handle the kind of numbers, the amount of electricity that's needed.   So I'm telling them they can build their own plant. They're going to produce their own electricity. It will ensure the company's ability to get electricity while at the same time, lowering prices of electricity for you and could be very substantial for all of your cities and towns. You're going to see some good things happen over the next number of years.   Another pillar of the American dream that has been under attack is homeownership. With us tonight is Rachel Wiggins, a mom of two from Houston. She placed bids on 20 homes and lost all of those bids to gigantic investment firms that bypassed inspection, paid all cash and turned those houses into rentals, stealing away her American dream.   She was devastated. Stories like this are why last month I signed executive order to ban large Wall Street investment firms from buying up in the thousands, single-family homes. [Applause] And now I'm asking Congress to make that ban permanent because homes for people -- really, that's what we want. We want homes for people, not for corporations.   Corporations are doing just fine, Rachel, thank you very much. Good luck with your home. You'll get one soon. [Applause] We're also working to make it easier for Americans to save for retirement. And under this administration, we will always protect Social Security and Medicare. They are not protecting it for our seniors.   We will always protect Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. [Applause] Since I took office, the typical 401(k) balance is up by at least $30,000. That's a lot of money. We have millions and millions of people, because the stock market has done so well, setting all those records. Your 401(k)'s are way up. Yet, half of all of working Americans still do not have access to a retirement plan with matching contributions from an employer.   To remedy this gross disparity, I am announcing that next year, my administration will give these often forgotten American workers, great people, the people that built our country, access to the same type of retirement plan offered to every federal worker. We will match your contribution with up to $1,000 each year, as we ensure that all Americans can profit from a rising stock market.   Let's also ensure that members of Congress cannot corruptly profit from using insider information. [Applause] They stood up for that. I can't believe.   DONALD TRUMP: [Crosstalk] I can't believe it. Did Nancy Pelosi stand up, if she's here? Doubt it. Pass the Stop Insider Trading Act without delay. [Applause] I wasn't sure if anybody, even on this side, was going to applaud for that. I'm very impressed. Thank you. I'm very impressed. But when it comes to the corruption that is plundering -- really, it's plundering America.   There's been no more stunning example than Minnesota, where members of the Somali community have pillaged an estimated $19 billion from the American taxpayer. We have all the information and, in actuality, the number is much higher than that. And California, Massachusetts, Maine and many other states are even worse.   This is the kind of corruption that shreds the fabric of a nation, and we are working on it like you wouldn't believe. So tonight, although started four months ago, I am officially announcing the war on fraud to be led by our great Vice President JD Vance. [Applause] He'll get it done and, if we're able to find enough of that fraud, we will actually have a balanced budget overnight.   It'll go very quickly. That's the kind of money you're talking about. We'll balance our budget. The Somali pirates who ransacked Minnesota, remind us that there are large parts of the world where bribery, corruption and lawlessness are the norm, not the exception. Importing these cultures through unrestricted immigration and open borders brings those problems right here to the USA. And it is the American people who pay the price in higher medical bills, car insurance rates, rent, taxes and perhaps most importantly crime.   We will take care of this problem. We're going to take care of this problem. We are not playing games. [Applause] Dalilah Coleman was only five years old in June 2024 when an 18-wheel tractor-trailer plowed into her stopped car traveling at 60 miles an hour or more. The driver was an illegal alien let in by Joe Biden and given a commercial driver's license by open borders politicians in California.   Doctors said Dalilah would never be able to walk or talk, have a good life. She wouldn't even be able to eat again. But against all odds, she is now in the first grade, learning to walk. And she's here this evening with her dad Marcus, a fantastic man. Dalilah, please, you are a great inspiration. [Applause] Please stand up. Thank you, Dalilah.   Many, if not most, illegal aliens do not speak English and cannot read even the most basic road signs as to direction, speed, danger or location. That's why tonight I'm calling on Congress to pass what we will call the Dalilah Law, barring any state from granting commercial driver's licenses to illegal aliens.   [Applause] And yesterday, as you probably saw at the White House, I hosted a ceremony with Americans who lost their treasured loved ones to the scourge of illegal immigration. People came into our country -- how we allowed this to happen with our open borders. These are the Angel Moms and Families that for decades our government betrayed and our media totally ignored -- totally.   It was terrible, hard to believe actually. In 2023, a 16-year-old high school cheerleader named Lizbeth Medina was supposed to perform in her town's Christmas parade, but she never arrived. Her mother Jacqueline went home to look for her and she found her lying dead in a bathtub bleeding profusely after being stabbed 25 times.   Lizbeth's killer was a previously arrested illegal alien who had broken in and brutally -- just brutally extinguished the brightest light in her family's life, violently and viciously. Her heartbroken mother is in the gallery to remind everyone in this chamber exactly why we are deporting illegal alien criminals from our country at record numbers and we're getting them the hell out of here fast.   We don't want them. [Applause] Thank you very much, Jacqueline. Thank you. We can never forget that many in this room not only allowed the border invasion to happen before I got involved, but indeed they would do it all over again if they ever had the chance. If they ever got elected, they would open up those borders to some of the worst criminals anywhere in the world.   The only thing standing between Americans and a wide-open border right now is President Donald J. Trump and our great Republican patriots in Congress. Thank you. Thank you. [Applause] As we speak, Democrats in this chamber have cut off all funding for the Department of Homeland Security. It's all cut off.   It's all cut off. They have instituted another Democrat shutdown, the first one costing us 2 points on GDP. 2 points we lost on GDP, which probably made them quite happy actually. Now they have closed the agency responsible for protecting Americans from terrorists and murderers. Tonight, I'm demanding the full and immediate restoration of all funding for the border security, homeland security of the United States and also for helping people clean up their snow.   We have no money because of the Democrats, and it would be nice -- we'd love to give you a hand at cleaning it up, but you gave no money. Nobody's getting paid; it's a shame. So, you have to think about it. We have, in case you didn't know, a pretty large snowstorm out there. One of the great things about the State of the Union is how it gives Americans the chance to see clearly what their Representatives really believe.   So, tonight, I'm inviting every legislator to join with my administration in reaffirming a fundamental principle. If you agree with this statement, then stand up and show your support. The first duty of the American government is to protect American citizens, not illegal aliens. [Applause]   DONALD TRUMP: Isn't that a shame? You should be ashamed of yourself, not standing up. You should be ashamed of yourself. That is why I'm also asking you to end deadly sanctuary cities that protect the criminals and enact serious penalties for public officials who block the removal of criminal aliens, in many cases, drug lords, murderers all over our country.   They're blocking the removal of these people out of our country and you should be ashamed of yourself. [Applause]   UNKNOWN: USA, USA, USA.   DONALD TRUMP: And perhaps most importantly, I'm asking you to approve the Save America Act to stop illegal aliens and others who are unpermitted persons from voting in our sacred American elections. That cheating is rampant in our elections. It's rampant. It's very simple, all voters must show voter ID. [Applause] All voters must show proof of citizenship in order to vote.   [Applause] And no more crooked mail-in ballots except for illness, disability, military or travel, none. And this should be an easy one, and by the way, it's polling at 89 percent, including Democrats, 89 percent. [Applause] And even the new communist mayor of New York City, I think he's a nice guy, actually, speak to him a lot.   Bad policy, but nice guy. Just said they want people to shovel snow. They got hit hard. Wants them to shovel snow. But if you apply for that job, you need to show two original forms of ID and a Social Security card. [Applause] Yet, they don't want identification for the greatest privilege of them all, voting in America.   No, it's no good, no good. Both Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly agree on the policy that we just enunciated and Congress should unite and enact this common sense, country-saving legislation right now and it should be before anything else happens. [Applause] And the reason they don't want to do it, why would anybody not want voter ID? One reason, because they want to cheat.   There's only one reason. They make up all excuses. They say it's racist. They come up with things. You almost say, what imagination they have. They want to cheat, they have cheated and their policy is so bad that the only way they can get elected is to cheat and we're going to stop it. We have to stop it, John.   [Applause] And here is one more opportunity to show common sense in government. In the gallery tonight are Sage Blair and her mother, Michelle. In 2021, Sage was 14 when school officials in Virginia sought to socially transition her to a new gender, treating her as a boy and hiding it from her parents. Hard to believe, isn't it? Before long, a confused Sage ran away from home.   After she was found in a horrific situation in Maryland, a left-wing judge refused to return sage to her parents because they did not immediately state that their daughter was their son. Sage was thrown into an all-boys state home and suffered terribly for a long time. But today, all of that is behind them because sage is a proud and wonderful young woman with a full ride scholarship to Liberty University.   [Applause] Sage and Michelle, please stand up. [Applause] And thank you for your great bravery and who can believe that we're even speaking about things like this. 15 years ago, if somebody was up here and said that, they'd say, what's wrong with him? But now we have to say it because it's going on all over, numerous states, without even telling the parents.   But surely, we can all agree no state can be allowed to rip children from their parents arms and transition them to a new gender against the parents will. Who would believe that we've been talking about that. [Applause] We must ban it and we must ban it immediately. [Applause] Look, nobody stands up. These people are crazy.   I'm telling you, they're crazy. [Applause] Amazing. [Inaudible] boy, oh boy. We're lucky we have a country with people like this. Democrats are destroying our country, but we've stopped it just in the nick of time, didn't we? [Applause] No one cares more about protecting America's youth than our wonderful first lady, now a movie star.   She's a movie star, can you believe it? [Applause] Who would have believed that? Over the past year, she has had an incredible impact championing AI legislation advancing a landmark executive order on foster care and helping secure $30 million to launch the Melania Trump Foster Youth to Independence Initiative.   It's a tremendous -- really, a tremendous thing that happened and had a lot of bipartisan support. She gets much better bipartisan support than I do. I get none. She gets a lot. Someday you're going to have to tell me how you did that. And students and educators in every state have joined the first lady's efforts in the presidential AI challenge, keeping America's next generation positioned to succeed and strongly succeed in the future.   Tonight, we welcome two young people whose lives reflect the first lady's impact, Sierra Burns and Everest Nevraumont. Thank you both. And Melania, thank you. I know how hard you worked on it. Thank you very much. [Applause] I'm very proud to say that during my time in office, both the first four years and in particular this last year, there has been a tremendous renewal in religion, faith, Christianity and belief in God, tremendous renewal.   [Applause]   DONALD TRUMP: Had to do with my great friend Charlie Kirk, a great guy, great man. [Applause] So, last year Charlie was violently murdered by an assassin and martyred, really martyred for his beliefs. His wonderful wife Erika is with us tonight. Erika, please stand. [Applause] Thank you, Erika -- been through a lot. In Charlie's memory, we must all come together to reaffirm that America is one nation under God, and we must totally reject political violence of any kind.   [Applause] We love religion and we love bringing it back and it's coming back at levels that nobody actually thought possible. It's really a beautiful thing to see. Above all, unleashing America's promise requires keeping our communities safe. We have made incredible strides, yet dangerous repeat offenders continue to be released by pro-crime Democrat politicians again and again.   We are honored to be joined tonight by a woman who's been through hell, Iryna Zarutska. In 2022, she and her beautiful daughter -- so beautiful, what a beautiful young woman. Iryna fled war torn Ukraine to live with relatives near Charlotte, North Carolina. And by the way, what's going on with Charlotte? Last summer, 23-year-old Iryna was riding home on the train when a deranged monster, who had been arrested over a dozen times and was released through no cash bail, stood up and viciously slashed a knife through her neck and body.   No one will ever forget -- there were people on that train, no one will ever forget the expression of terror on Iryna's face as she looked up at her attacker in the last seconds of her life. She died instantly. She had escaped a brutal war only to be slain by a hardened criminal set free to kill in America, came in through open borders.   Mrs. Zarutska, tonight, I promise you we will ensure justice for your magnificent daughter Iryna. [Applause] How do you not stand? How do you not stand? I'm asking this Congress to pass tough legislation to ensure that violent and dangerous repeat offenders are put behind bars and, importantly, that they stay there.   [Applause] Starting last summer, I deployed our National Guard and federal law enforcement to restore law and order to our most dangerous cities, including Memphis, Tennessee, big success; New Orleans, Louisiana, big success; and our nation's capital itself, Washington DC where we have almost no crime anymore in Washington DC. How did that happen?   [Applause] In fact, crime in Washington is now at the lowest level ever recorded, and murders in DC this January were down close to 100 percent from a year ago. [Applause] They don't like to hear that. One of the -- sick people. One of the brave service members who helped achieve this stunning turnaround was 20-year-old West Virginia Army National Guard Specialist, Sarah Beckstrom.   After a four-month deployment, she voluntarily extended her service, and her rank was going to be lifted. She was doing so well. They were so proud of her. But the very next day she was on patrol near the White House when she was ambushed and shot in the head by a terrorist monster from Afghanistan, shouldn't have been in our country.   And all because she wore the uniform of our nation, she was shot. He traveled here because he didn't like people wearing our uniform, he was sick and deranged. Shouldn't have been in our country. Sarah Beckstrom died in order to defend our capital. And we are honored to be joined by her wonderful parents.   Gary and Evalea, your daughter was a true American patriot, and she will be greatly missed. She was a great person. I saw reports on her; they've never seen anything like it. [Applause] So sorry, thank you very much. A great young lady. I saw reports that were like perfect. She was perfect. Serving alongside Sarah that day was Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe.   The terrorist shot Andrew in the head, and no one thought he could possibly make it. The two of them, Sarah and Andrew, both shot violently in the head, neither was expected to make it. They weren't even given a chance, except his wonderful mother named Melody who I spoke to the same night, and she was so positive.   The doctors thought that Andrew was gone, but his mother said no, no, Mr. President, Andrew will be fine. He's going to make it. I've never seen anything like it. I mean he was given almost no chance. She said I have no doubt, sir, he's going to be OK. This was a conversation that I had with her that night with her son laying hopelessly in bed, blood all over.   Everybody is praying. She said sir, he will be OK. The doctors didn't understand what she was saying and, after looking at the results of the damage done, neither did I. She was so strong and conclusive that even Andrew's great father felt she didn't really understand the gravity of the situation, but she turned out to be right.   Right, Melody? She turned out to be right. [Applause] Amazing, actually. I said where does this woman come from? She's the most positive person I've ever met. With God's help, Andrew has battled back from the edge of death -- and we're talking about the edge of death, on his way to a miraculous recovery.   He's got a little work to do, but he's doing great. Nice to see -- he's a good-looking guy. Nice to see you. Thanks, Andrew. Thank you very much. [Applause] So, Andrew, while you're up, now I'm going to ask a highly respected General James Seward to present Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe and the great family of Sarah Beckstrom with the award created by our late great president, George Washington himself.   It's called the Purple Heart. [Applause]   DONALD TRUMP: We love you all. Love you. We're proudly restoring safety for Americans at home and we are also restoring security for Americans abroad. Our country has never been stronger. In my first 10 months I ended eight wars, including Cambodia. Isn't it funny? They're sick people. Cambodia and Thailand. Pakistan and India, would have been a nuclear war.   35 million people said the prime minister of Pakistan would have died if it were not for my involvement. Kosovo and Serbia, Israel and Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, the Congo and Rwanda and of course, the war in Gaza, which proceeds at a very low level. It's just about there. And I want to thank Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner for your help.   Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Jared. [Applause] And I also want to thank the man they report to, Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Thank you, Marco. [Applause] People like you. You know, Marco got 100 percent of the votes when he was in -- I think our next one was about 54 percent. And some of the Democrats are now saying, I can't believe we approved that guy.   [Laughter] And he said, it's an honor that they feel that way, right, Marco? You have done a great job, great secretary of state. I think he'll go down as the best ever. [Applause] Under the ceasefire, I negotiated every single hostage, both living and dead has been returned home. Can you believe that? [Applause] Nobody thought it was possible.   Nobody thought that was possible. Both living and dead. And those parents who had a dead son, their boy, they'd always tell me their boy, they wanted him as much as though he were living. It was an amazing period of time and they came back. And when we got all of the living hostages back and many, many before them but I always said those last 20 are going to be very tough, but we got many, many more, hundreds.   But I said those last 20 are going to be tough. We got them back. But we only got back 14 or 15 of the dead, of the 28. And believe it or not, Hamas worked along with Israel and they dug and they dug and they dug. It's a tough -- it's a tough thing to do, going through bodies all over, passing up 100 bodies sometimes for each one that they found.   Tough job. And they finally got it back to 27. And then Steve and Jared, they got it back to 28. They found all 28. Nobody thought that was possible, but we did it. And I remember the family of the 28th. They were so -- grieved, but they were so happy, as happy as it's possible -- possible to be. They had their boy back.   The mother said, sir, we have our boy back. What a period of time that was, but we got them all back. So thank you both very much. Great job. [Applause] And we're working very hard to end the ninth war, the killing and slaughter between Russia and Ukraine, where 25,000 soldiers are dying each and every month.   Think of that, 25,000 soldiers are dying a month. A war which would have never happened if I were president, would have never happened. As president, I will make peace wherever I can, but I will never hesitate to confront threats to America wherever we must. That's why in a breakthrough operation last June, the United States military obliterated Iran's nuclear weapons program with an attack on Iranian soil, known as Operation Midnight Hammer.   [Applause] For decades, it had been the policy of the United States never to allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon, many decades. Since they seized control of that proud nation 47 years ago, the regime and its murderous proxies have spread nothing but terrorism and death and hate. They've killed and maimed thousands of American service members and hundreds of thousands and even millions of people with what's called roadside bombs.   They were the kings of the roadside bomb. And we took out Soleimani. I did that during my first term, had a huge impact. He was the father of the roadside bomb. [Applause] And just over the last couple of months with the protests, they've killed at least, it looks like 32,000 protests -- 32,000 protesters in their own country.   They shot them and hung them. We stopped them from hanging a lot of them with the threat of serious violence. But this is some terrible people. They've already developed missiles that can threaten Europe and our bases overseas and they're working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States of America.   After Midnight Hammer, they were warned to make no future attempts to rebuild their weapons program in a particular, nuclear weapons, yet they continue starting it all over. We wiped it out and they want to start all over again. And are at this moment again pursuing their sinister ambitions. We are in negotiations with them.   They want to make a deal, but we haven't heard those secret words, we will never have a nuclear weapon. My preference -- [Applause] My preference is to solve this problem through diplomacy. But one thing is certain, I will never allow the world's number one sponsor of terror, which they are by far to have a nuclear weapon can't let that happen.   [Applause] And no nation should ever doubt America's resolve, we have the most powerful military on earth. I rebuilt the military in my first term, we're going to continue to do so. Also, we just approved $1 trillion budget, we have no choice, we have to be strong. Because hopefully we will seldom have to use this great power that we built together.   It's really called peace through strength and it's been very, very effective. [Applause] So thanks to Republican in Congress, we're investing that record number of dollars, have no choice, in the United States armed forces, also creating a lot of jobs, but we're not even doing it for that reason. Because as I said, we have more jobs, more people working today than ever before in the history of our country.   And NATO countries, our friends and allies, and they are -- they're our friends and they're our allies.   DONALD TRUMP: Have just agreed at my very strong request to pay 5 percent of GDP for military defense rather than the 2 percent, which they weren't paying; we were paying for almost all of them. [Applause] Now they're paying five as opposed to not paying for it. [Applause] And getting that 5 percent was something which everyone said would never be done, could not happen. We got it really easily with one meeting and a big difference between 2 percent that's not paid.   We were paying the freight of many of them. Very few were paid out. Now 5 percent then they're paid. And everything we send over to Ukraine is sent through NATO and they pay us in full. They pay us totally in full. Every branch of our armed forces is setting records for recruitment. This is so exciting. [Applause] And every service member recently received a warrior dividend of $1,776. [Applause] You know, they put it on my desk.   We got the money from tariffs and other things, a lot of money we have. We have much more money than people understand, have to rebuild that program a little bit, but it won't take long. But we got the money and it was $1,775 and they wanted my approval. And I said what's the number. $1,775. I said, wait a minute, for one more dollar we can have $1,776. It's going to -- I said we're going to figure that out.   I never asked anybody if we could afford it. One more dollar, I said $1,776. And I said that's good. And I'll tell you what, our military -- that was four months ago, our military, I never see a person in the military that doesn't thank me for it. So, we're honored to do it. They deserve it and we call it $1,776, It was great.   And we love our military; we love our law enforcement. We love our firemen, you know the firemen don't get mentioned enough. We love our firemen. [Applause] We're also restoring American security and dominance in the Western Hemisphere, acting to secure our national interests and defend our country from violence, drugs, terrorism and foreign interference.   For years, large swaths of territory in our region, including large parts of Mexico, really large parts of Mexico, have been controlled by murderous drug cartels. That's why I designated these cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, and I declared illicit fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction. [Applause] And with our new military campaign, we have stopped record amounts of drugs coming into our country, and virtually stopped it completely coming in by water or sea.   You probably noticed that. We very seriously damaged their fishing industry also. Nobody wants to go fishing anymore. We've also taken down one of the most sinister cartel kingpins of all. You saw that yesterday. [Applause] In January, elite American warriors carried out one of the most complex spectacular feats of military competence and power in world history.   No one's seen anything like it. Foreign leaders, I won't tell you who, called me and they said very impressive, very good. They couldn't believe -- they all watched; they saw what happened. This is a different fighting force than we had years ago when we fought to tie. No, it's a great fighting force. I'm so proud of it. Look at Space Force.   Space Force is my baby because we did that. My baby's becoming so important. [Applause] And America's armed forces overwhelmed all defenses and utterly defeated an enemy -- good fighters -- to end the reign of outlaw dictator Nicolas Maduro and bring him to face American justice. [Applause] And this was an absolutely colossal victory for the security of the United States.   And it also opens up a bright new beginning for the people of Venezuela. We're working closely with the new president of Venezuela, Delcy Rodriguez, to unleash extraordinary economic gains for both of our countries and to bring new hope to those who have suffered so terribly. They really did suffer. With us tonight is Alejandro Gonzalez.   She grew up in a tight knit Venezuelan family and was especially close to her beloved uncle, Enrique. But after Enrique ran for office and opposed Maduro, he was kidnaped by Maduro's security forces and thrown into the regime's really infamous prison in Caracas. Alejandro feared she would never see her uncle again.   She feared for her own life also. But since the raid, we have worked with the new leadership, and they have ordered the closure of that vile prison and released hundreds of political prisoners already with more to come. Alejandro, I'm pleased to inform you that not only has your uncle been released, but he's here tonight.   We brought him over to celebrate his freedom with you in person. Enrique, please come down. [Applause] Thank you, Enrique. Have a good time. Nice to have you back, Enrique. There were many heroes on that January raid to capture Maduro, really great heroes. It was very dangerous. They knew we were coming; they were all set.   But the deeds of one warrior that night will live forever in the eternal chronicles of military valor, Chief Warrant Officer Five, Eric Slover, planned the mission and was the flight lead in the cockpit of the first helicopter. A big, beautiful, powerful helicopter, it was a massive Chinook carrying, as you can imagine, many, many American warfighters.   Wearing the dog tags his wife Amy had blessed with holy water before he left, she knew it was going to be a rough one. Eric steered the Chinook under the cover of night and descended swiftly upon Maduros' heavily protected military fortress. This was a major military installation protected by thousands of soldiers and guarded by Russian and Chinese military technology.   How did that work out? Not too good. [Laughter] While preparing to land, enemy machine guns fired from every angle and Eric was hit very badly in the leg and hip, one bullet after another. He absorbed four agonizing shots, shredding his leg into numerous pieces. And yet, despite the fact that the use of his legs was vital to a successful helicopter flight -- legs are the most important part of flying a helicopter -- to deliver the many commandos who would capture and detain Maduro was the only thing Eric was thinking about.   Then even as he was gushing blood, which was flowing back down the aisle -- a helicopter lands at a steep angle -- the machine gun stood right in front of him. They were right in front of him, two machine gunners, who escaped the wrath of the previous planes. Eric maneuvered his helicopter with all of those lives and souls to face the enemy and let his gunners eliminate the threat -- turned the helicopter around so the gunners could take care of business, saving the lives of his fellow warriors from what could have been a catastrophic crash deep in enemy territory.   DONALD TRUMP: Only after safely landing the helicopter with all the warriors aboard in the exact right spot, which was vital to the mission, we probably would have had maybe cancel the mission if that didn't happen, Eric told his copilot, also wounded but not as gravely, to take over, I'm about ready to pass out. The success of the entire mission and the lives of his fellow warriors hinge on Eric's ability to take the searing pain, it was unbelievable what's happened to his legs, of the bullets and keep on flying and landing and people knew what was happening.   Everybody in the back of the helicopter knew because they saw the blood pouring down the aisle. Chief Warrant Officer Slover is still recovering from his serious wounds, but I'm thrilled to say that he is here tonight with his wife Amy. Eric and Amy, come on in. [Applause]   UNKNOWN: USA, USA, USA.   DONALD TRUMP: So we have a surprise for Eric and Amy. In recognition of Eric's actions above and beyond the call of duty, I would now like to ask General Jonathan Braga to present Chief Warrant Officer Slover with our nation's highest military award, the Congressional Medal of Honor. [Applause] Well, thank you very much, Eric and Amy, great to get to know you.   I met with them and with a lot of their fellow warriors at Fort Bragg recently. You notice the name Fort Bragg, we have it back, we brought it back. We won the First World War with it, the Second World War with it and then they decide to change the name, but we changed it back. [Applause] Everybody wanted it changed back too.   And 10 of Eric's fellow warriors from that incredible night of victory will also be receiving medals at a private ceremony that will soon be held at the White House, and Eric, you'll be there. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you, Eric. That's a big one. Tonight, We've celebrated many truly extraordinary American patriots, but there is one last living legend to honor before we go. He is one more heroic American aviator, Navy Fighter Pilot Royce Williams served in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, flying more than 220 missions.   In the skies over Korea in 1952, Royce was in the dogfight of a lifetime, legendary dogfight. Flying through blizzard conditions, his squadron was ambushed by seven Soviet fighter planes. It was his first aerial combat of the war and despite being massively outnumbered and outgunned, Royce led the takedown of four enemy jets and almost destroyed the others, vanquishing his adversaries while taking 263 bullets to his own plane and being seriously hurt.   His story was secret for over 50 years. He didn't even want to tell his wife, but the legend grew and grew. But tonight, at 100 years old, this brave Navy captain is finally getting the recognition he deserves. He was a legend long before this evening. Royce, please stand up and I will ask the first lady of the United States to present Captain Royce Williams with his Congressional Medal of Honor.   [Applause] Gilroy said, thank you, Eric. I've always wanted the Congressional Medal of Honor, but I was informed, I'm not allowed to give it to myself and I wouldn't know why I'd be taking it. But if they ever open up that law, I will be there with you someday. But, you know, that's our highest honor, Congressional Medal of Honor.   And that's a big thing and it's an honor to be in the same room with you. Thank you both, very much, Eric, thank you. [Applause] Thank you. 250 years is a long time in the life of a nation, but in another sense, it's really a mere moment in the eye of history. Two of the gentlemen we met in the gallery this evening took their first breaths one century ago, 100 years before that on July 4th, 1826, the author of the Declaration of Independence, brilliant.   Thomas Jefferson drew his last breath. Just a single long human lifespan separates the giants who declared and won our independence from the heroes who stand among us tonight. Everything our nation has done, everything we have achieved has been the work of those few great lifetimes.   DONALD TRUMP: In those brief chapters, Americans built this nation from 13 humble colonies into the pinnacle of human civilization and human freedom; the strongest, wealthiest, most powerful -- most successful nation in all of history. Americans ventured out across the daunting and dangerous continent. We carved paths through an unforgiving wilderness, settled a boundless frontier and tamed the beautiful but very, very dangerous Wild West. From empty marshes and wide-open plains, we raised up the world's greatest cities.   Together, we mastered the world's mightiest industries, shattered history's monstrous tyrannies, and we liberated millions from the chains of fascism, communism, oppression and terror. Americans lifted humanity into the skies on the wings of aluminum and steel. And then, we launched mankind into the stars on rockets powered by sheer American will and unyielding American pride.   We wired the globe with our ingenuity, we captivated the planet with American culture, and now we are pioneering the next great American breakthroughs that will change the entire world. All of this and so much more is the enduring legacy, unmatched glory of the hardworking patriots who built and defended this country and who still carry the hopes and freedoms on all of humanity's backs.   For years, they were forgotten, betrayed and cast aside, but that great betrayal is over and they will never be forgotten again. Because when the world needs courage, daring vision and inspiration, it is still turning to America. And when God needs a nation to work his miracles, He knows exactly who to ask.   There is no challenge Americans cannot overcome, no frontier too vast for us to conquer, no dream too bold for us to chase, no horizon too distant for us to claim. For our destiny is written by the hand of Providence and these first 250 years were just the beginning. From the rugged border towns of Texas, to the heartland villages of Michigan.   From the sun kissed shores of Florida, to the endless fields of the Dakotas. And from the historic streets of Philadelphia, to right here in our nation's capital, Washington DC, the Golden Age of America is upon us. The revolution that began in 1776 has not ended; it still continues because the flame of liberty and independence still burns in the heart of every American patriot.   And our future will be bigger, better, brighter, bolder and more glorious than ever before. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America. [Applause]\n",

    "body": "\n      Some of President Trump's loyal supporters say they're confused and dismayed by the president's aggressive posture toward Denmark and America's European allies.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Europeans, as we've been reporting, are outraged about President Trump's claim that Greenland should be under United States control. But what do Trump supporters in the United States think about his threat of tariffs and refusal to rule out military action? All politics is local. NPR's Brian Mann has been talking with conservative and MAGA voters about this. Brian, good morning.BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve.INSKEEP: What are you hearing?MANN: I'm hearing confusion and wariness and even some real anger over this focus by Trump on Greenland. I traveled over the last couple of days to talk to voters in some of the most conservative counties in the U.S. I was in rural Maryland, upstate New York and Pennsylvania. All of these folks voted for Trump and still broadly support his presidency, but this policy leaves many of them cold. Here's George Rivet (ph) and Frank Juket (ph), two retired service members both in their 60s. We spoke outside the American Legion hall in Whitehall, New York.GEORGE RIVET: I wish he wouldn't step on anybody's toes about Greenland. I was in the Marines. I know we got enough stuff to take care of our country. Why do you want to keep - kind of like what Putin did with Ukraine, you know?FRANK JUKET: And as far as Denmark goes, no.MANN: If a week from now, two weeks from now, we have Marines and Navy folks on the ground in Greenland, are you going to be upset?JUKET: Yes. They don't want us. There's no reason why we should want them.MANN: And, Steve, that comparison of Trump to Vladimir Putin really caught my ear coming from a Trump voter. Both of these men told me they've heard Trump's argument, why Greenland is essential for U.S. security. They don't buy it. Both said they view Denmark as an ally.INSKEEP: Although, I'm thinking there are a lot of times that Trump supporters have disagreed with him about something but then they end up supporting Trump anyway.MANN: Yeah.INSKEEP: Do they see the proposed takeover of Greenland as somehow different than other controversies?MANN: I think that's right. And to be clear, this wasn't a scientific survey. It wasn't methodical. I've been on this road trip, sitting and talking to Trump voters in these conservative counties, asking broadly how they see his first year in office. A lot of these folks back him. They like him personally. But, Steve, Greenland kept coming up, even when I didn't mention it. Here's Gabby Coots (ph), who lives in Cecil County, one of the reddest counties in Maryland.GABBY COOTS: I think he's doing good. The only thing I don't agree with is that Greenland acquiring. I don't agree with that.MANN: Tell me why.COOTS: Because it's not his. That's Denmark. They independent, they don't want it, so why force it?MANN: And I heard this again from Tina Howe (ph), who talked to me in a diner where she works in Pike County, Pennsylvania. This is a place so conservative, some locals call it Trump County, Pennsylvania.TINA HOWE: I'm not real fond of what's going on with him getting us involved in too many countries. He needs to start worrying about America first, which he campaigned on.MANN: And Howe told me she just doesn't understand how taking over Greenland is going to make her life or her neighbors' lives better.INSKEEP: Well, as you went from one conservative county to another, did you hear any support for the U.S. forcing Denmark to give up Greenland?MANN: No, none. I did hear skepticism that Trump would actually launch any kind of military action. Some of his supporters told me they see Trump's fierce language toward Denmark and America's European allies as part of his intense negotiating style. But even there, Steve, most of his voters told me they want him focused on pocketbook issues, on affordability. Some said gas prices have come down but their grocery and energy bills are still sky high. They told me that's what they want Trump working on, not Greenland.INSKEEP: Brian, thanks very much for the insights. Really appreciate it.MANN: Thank you, Steve.INSKEEP: That's NPR's Brian Mann.(SOUNDBITE OF BRANT BJORK'S \"WAITING FOR A COCONUT TO DROP\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      With troops standing by for Minnesota and an escalating campaign for Greenland, NPR's Michel Martin asks former Trump official Miles Taylor if this is a presidency without guardrails.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  President Trump's aggressive moves on Greenland and immigration, among other things, has even some of his supporters questioning his priorities and tactics. So we've called someone who got a close-up view of President Trump in his first term to ask whether something has changed. Miles Taylor was chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security. He wrote anonymously about resisting some of Trump's impulses from the inside. That's before he revealed himself and backed Joe Biden for president.He has since become a target. President Trump yanked his security clearance and told DHS to investigate him. He now leads a nonprofit called DEFIANCE.org that helps people push back against the administration. He's with us now. Good morning, Miles. Thanks much for joining us.MILES TAYLOR: Good morning, Michel. How are you?MARTIN: Good. So let me start with Greenland. Trump did talk about this in his first term. But during your time in the administration, was this seen as a serious discussion? I guess what I'm wondering is, is there something different now?TAYLOR: Well, here's the thing. I mean, Donald Trump always says controversial things. And then aides come out and say that he's joking, but they're not usually jokes. These are trial balloons. And if there's too much blowback, he'll wait until a period where he can move something forward. And if there's not, he'll move forward on the controversial idea anyway and people will see it's not a joke. Greenland was one of those things.When we first heard about it, I will tell you, 2017 was the first time I heard President Trump say he wanted Greenland. And he proposed swapping it for Puerto Rico because he didn't like spending hurricane recovery money there and he wanted to get rid of Puerto Rico. And we said, Mr. President, there are 3.5 million Americans who live in Puerto Rico. And he dismissed the idea until 2018, when he brought it up again. That's when, Michel, I was worried this was one of those things, that if he didn't have sensible people around him, he would try to do in a second term. He was hell-bent on getting the island.MARTIN: Then to another point, the immigration move. Now, the president has always taken a hard line against immigration. I mean, that's been clear. But a U.S. official told NPR the president has put active-duty troops on standby for a possible deployment to Minneapolis. And he's threatened to use the Insurrection Act to put down protests there. And, you know, obviously, sort of there are some issues being mixed there. But this big surge of agents into these mainly Democratic-led cities to kind of support these immigration moves, even some of his supporters have questioned this. Is there something different about this?TAYLOR: Well, look, I will go back to the joke schema. I mean, in, you know, the past 10 years, Donald Trump has joked about locking up his political opponents. He has joked about deploying troops to U.S. cities. He joked about not conceding the election in 2020. And we learned the hard way that these things weren't jokes. And any time he was talked down off the ledge, it was because of sensible folks around him who tried to keep him from going that direction.Another thing he pushed for in the first term was invocation of the Insurrection Act. I remember, on the eve of the State of the Union in 2019, I got tipped off by aides at the White House that the president was thinking about slipping language into his speech to invoke that act. Of course, this was disturbing because we didn't think any circumstances in the United States justified that there was an invasion or a rebellion. So we rushed to the White House, met the president in the map room where he was practicing the speech and convinced him to drop those lines out of the speech.But again, keep in mind, this is something he has wanted to do since the first term. He saw the Insurrection Act - this is his words - as his, quote, \"magical authorities.\" He saw it as the apex of his power. And he has been looking for an excuse to implement it. The only difference is, in the second term, he's brought on people who are willing to carry out those orders.MARTIN: So your - in your view, the president hasn't changed. It's the people around him that have changed. And they are unwilling or uninterested in tempering some of these impulses.TAYLOR: You know, Susie Wiles said something revealing a month ago about the president's mindset. She said that he had an alcoholic's personality. But Donald Trump, of course, is a teetotaler. He doesn't drink. What I would say, and I don't mean this facetiously, the man is drunk on power. He is addicted to, he is deeply attracted to, demonstrations of power. And you can imagine that the greatest demonstration of his power domestically would be to send American troops into cities to enforce his edicts.It is something he has, again, talked about for nearly 10 years. And he sees the opportunity to do it with limited to no pushback inside of his administration. The question will be, will the Article III courts do something about it? And I strongly suspect that this will be challenged, if he does it, almost immediately by the state of Minnesota, if not other states.MARTIN: Let me ask you about something else. And this is a difficult thing to talk about because when you're ever talking about people's personal behavior, you know, this always raises questions of, you know, whose standards are we applying here? Who says or who cares? But the president's use of profanity.I mean, he went to this auto plant the other day. He made this obscene gesture at a heckler who yelled something at him that he didn't like and was - seemed to have been heard to utter an epithet. You know, again, his staff continues to defend this, but it does seem that he is more unfiltered. We heard him uttering expletives in public comments much more frequently than I think we did in the first term. And I just wonder if you have noticed that yourself and what you make of it.TAYLOR: Look, I'm not a doctor. But I think, observing this man from afar, you can conclude he is unwell. He is irascible. He is angry. He is quick to impulsive remarks and judgments, not that this was incredibly different from the first term. But it's, you know, a Donald Trump more unhinged than I think people saw in the first administration. And, you know, you're seeing that, as if there was any filter before, now it seems to be gone.MARTIN: Well, again, I'm not a doctor either. Neither are you. You certainly haven't examined him in any professional capacity here. But I guess it makes me wonder whether, did he use that kind of language in private before in the first term? We just are now being exposed to it publicly because perhaps he just feels more comfortable in doing so? I mean, we know that - we know, like, from the Nixon tapes that, you know, people sometimes talk that way in private. And they forget, perhaps, that other people are listening.TAYLOR: Yeah. I mean, I think...MARTIN: But I'm just wondering if you - if it's as you said before, which is that this is the behavior that was the before behavior, and now we're just seeing more of it. Or has something substantively changed?TAYLOR: Well, I'll give you two direct examples on that, Michel, is, you know, when he said s-hole countries in the first term, that was something he continued to repeat in private, even after aides denied that the president had called third world countries s-hole countries. He continued to say that in meetings. Or a second example would be Somalis. He called the Somali people, Somali Americans, garbage in private. He referred to them derisively. I don't know what the president's biases are towards people from Somalia. But these are things he said in the first term in private in the Oval Office. And in a second term, he's now said those things publicly and almost proudly. And that says to me that he's let that filter drop.MARTIN: That's Miles Taylor. He's former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security. He now runs a group called DEFIANCE.org. Thanks so much for joining us.TAYLOR: Thanks, Michel.MARTIN: We reached out to the White House for comment on Miles Taylor. As you might imagine, they replied by insulting both his work and him personally. Their statement ended with, quote, \"no one should believe anything he says,\" unquote.(SOUNDBITE OF THIS TOWN NEEDS GUNS' \"ELK\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

President Trump has been texting world leaders, and they have been texting him.MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  In one message, Trump told Norway's prime minister that he's trying to seize Greenland in part because he did not receive a Nobel Peace Prize. That was Trump's explanation for shaking the most important U.S. alliance and disrupting the world order. Overnight, Trump shared messages he received. One comes from France's president, who tries flattery on Trump but then raises the issue of Greenland and proposes to discuss it over dinner.INSKEEP: Now, world leaders meet face-to-face at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben is covering all this. Danielle, good morning.DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning.INSKEEP: What's the U.S. delegation doing in Europe?KURTZLEBEN: Well, today, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will be speaking in Davos, then Trump is scheduled to talk on Wednesday. And then on Thursday, there's what the White House is calling a charter announcement for the Board of Peace that Trump created to oversee reconstruction in Gaza after the conflict he's been trying to end between Israel and Hamas. In terms of substance, we don't know much yet. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett has suggested that Trump will unveil a new housing policy. Beyond that, we know he likes to talk about tariffs. And days ago, he threatened to tariff goods from eight European countries until the U.S. has a deal to acquire Greenland.INSKEEP: OK. Thank you for raising that. For those who didn't follow the news over the holiday, what were these threats about tariffs?KURTZLEBEN: Well, Trump posted that he's going to impose 10% tariffs on those eight countries starting on February 1, then raise it to 25% in June - that is, until a Greenland deal happens. Now, we don't really know details here. I've asked the White House, for example, what law would even authorize this, and I haven't received word yet. But those European countries, meanwhile, they're all NATO members, and they've all said they stand in full solidarity with fellow NATO member Denmark, as well as with Greenland, which is part of the kingdom of Denmark.INSKEEP: And Trump has certainly drawn all attention to himself once again with these threats, including personal messages with world leaders. What are these text messages?KURTZLEBEN: Well, maybe most famously over the weekend, Trump texted the Norwegian prime minister that because Trump didn't get the Nobel Peace Prize, he no longer feels the need to think, quote, \"purely of peace,\" adding that the U.S. should have total control over Greenland. Now, of course, the Norwegian government does not decide who gets that prize. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly elaborated to NPR that Greenland is important for national security and that Trump thinks, quote, \"Greenlanders would be better served if protected by the United States.\" That's, of course, certainly not how everyone sees it. In that overnight message from French President Emmanuel Macron that you mentioned, he said at one point, I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland.INSKEEP: A fascinating message also mixed in some flattery. You're doing a great job in Syria.KURTZLEBEN: Right.INSKEEP: Let's get together for dinner. But this is not the only thing Trump is doing on the world stage. There's also that Board of Peace you mentioned, which is what?KURTZLEBEN: Well, that is something that Trump laid out when he talked about how he wants to solve the conflict between Israel and Hamas. And that announcement - that charter announcement that the White House talked about is happening on Thursday. We've learned more about that charter recently. According to a copy obtained by NPR, permanent seats will cost nations a billion dollars each, and Trump is set to be the permanent chair. And as our colleague Daniel Estrin has reported, the charter says there's a need for a more effective international peace-building body, which makes some fear that the board is attempting to create a rival to the U.N. So we're keeping a close eye on that. Russia says Trump has asked President Vladimir Putin to sign on as part of the board. So it's unclear what he'll do and what traditional U.S. allies will do.INSKEEP: OK. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. Thanks so much - really appreciate it.KURTZLEBEN: Of course.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

One of President Trump's top lieutenants, Gor had been in charge of selecting staff to serve in Trump's second-term White House. Now he was getting a promotion.   Jeanine Pirro, the former Fox News personality-turned-U.S. attorney, offered praise for Gor's loyalty, then turned to Trump.   \"There is in this room, a group of people who love you, who believe in you, and who are so proud to be in this Oval Office,\" she said.   \n   That lovefest reflects a real change from Trump's first term, with its rival power centers and steady flow of staff shakeups and firings by tweet. One year into this second Trump presidency, high level staff and Cabinet turnover is significantly lower than it was during the same period in 2017. That's according to a new analysis from Brookings Institution visiting fellow Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, shared exclusively with NPR.   In 2017, Trump oversaw turnover in two Cabinet positions and 35% of senior staff posts. This time around, there's been no turnover at the Cabinet level, and senior staff turnover is at 29%. To keep consistency across administrations, for the Cabinet Tenpas only counts officials in the presidential line of succession.   \"For the other six presidents before President Trump, the average [high level staff] turnover in that first year is typically around 10%, so he's much higher than the average, but I will say it is less than his first term by a good margin,\" Tenpas said in an interview with NPR.   \n   Tenpas also documents the nature of the departures. In the first term, there were a lot of people unceremoniously shown the door by a president whose TV tagline was \"you're fired.\" This time, it has mostly been promotions, such as Gor becoming an ambassador.   \"There are far fewer resignations under pressure in this first year, 2025, than there were in 2017,\" said Tenpas.   In 2017, high-profile aides including chief of staff Reince Priebus, chief strategist Steve Bannon, White House press secretary Sean Spicer, communications director Michael Dubke and the famously 11-day-serving White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci all exited, often with an announcement by tweet.   The people leaving their jobs this time around aren't household names, says Tenpas, further dialing down the personnel drama.   \"You know, I would call these positions influential, but they just weren't public figures, they weren't press secretaries. They weren't chiefs of staff,\" she said.   People who served in the first Trump administration say this time is different, with Trump learning from his first presidency that he prefers loyalists. He has surrounded himself with aides who more closely align with him personally and with his political agenda.   \n   Gone are the big names he brought on because people suggested he should. Now, loyalty is the coin of the realm.   \"I do think that … if you look at what is the core of the stability, it was the emphasis that they put on loyalty in hiring, and that has then subsequently paved the way for less infighting and less drama and a lower rate than in 2017,\" said Tenpas.   A large share of the departures so far this term were on the National Security Council staff, including national security adviser Mike Waltz, who became U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He had been responsible for what was known as Signal-gate, the first major scandal of the term, when he inadvertently added a journalist to a group chat where secret plans for airstrikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen were discussed. But he wasn't fired. He was promoted to a position requiring Senate confirmation.   When Waltz left as national security adviser, he was replaced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who added another job to an already long list of assignments from Trump. It was supposed to be temporary, but it's been more than eight months.   The high-level NSC staff departures Tenpas tracked reflect a much larger shedding of staff assigned to the National Security Council.   A White House official not authorized to speak on the record tells NPR there has been a significant reduction in NSC staffing over the past year to create a more top-down foreign policy process.   The official called it a rightsizing — a strategic choice rather than White House intrigue.   This Brookings data does not capture firings and upheaval among career officials in other areas of the Trump administration, such as at the State Department, Justice Department or the Defense Department, all of which have seen significant turnover.\n",

Russia, Belarus, Slovenia, Thailand and the European Union's executive arm also were among the latest to receive invitations.   It's unclear how many leaders have been asked to join the board, and the large number of invitations being sent out, including to countries that don't get along, has raised questions about the board's mandate and decision-making processes. Also unknown is Israel's potential role on a board in charge of implementing the ceasefire agreement that directly involves them.   \n   A Trump reference in the invitation letters saying that the body would \"embark on a bold new approach to resolving global conflict\" suggested it could act as a rival to the U.N. Security Council, the most powerful body of the global organization created in the wake of World War II.   France, though, does not plan to join the Board of Peace \"at this stage\" despite receiving an invitation, a French official close to President Emmanuel Macron said Monday. The issue is raising questions, particularly with regard to respect for the principles and structure of the United Nations, said the official, speaking anonymously in line with the French presidency's customary practices.   Told late Monday that Macron was unlikely to join, Trump said, \"Well, nobody wants him because he's going to be out of office very soon.\"   \"I'll put a 200% tariff on his wines and champagnes and he'll join,\" Trump told reporters in Florida before a flight back to Washington. \"But he doesn't have to join.\"   Morocco's King Mohammed VI accepted a spot Monday, becoming the first Arab leader and at least the fifth world leader to join. Vietnam, Kazakhstan, Hungary and Argentina also have signed on.   Russian President Vladimir Putin received the invitation, and the Kremlin is now \"studying the details\" and will seek clarity of \"all the nuances\" in contacts with the U.S., said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Trump confirmed Monday night that Putin had been invited.   \n   Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko is ready to take part, according to the country's Foreign Ministry. The Thai Foreign Ministry said it was invited and reviewing the details.   European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill said that Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the commission, would be speaking to other EU leaders about Gaza. Gill didn't say whether its invitation had been accepted, but that the commission wants \"to contribute to a comprehensive plan to end the Gaza conflict.\"   Israel's objections to the board   Israeli far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich on Monday dismissed the Board of Peace as a raw deal for Israel and called for its dissolution.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Donald Trump speaks to reporters before boarding Air Force One at Palm Beach International Airport, Monday, Jan. 19, 2026, in West Palm Beach, Fla.\n                \n                    Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n    \n\n   \n   \"It is time to explain to the president that his plan is bad for the State of Israel and to cancel it,\" Smotrich said. \"Gaza is ours, its future will affect our future more than anyone else's. We will take responsibility for what happens there, impose military administration, and complete the mission.\"   Smotrich, a hard-liner who opposed the Gaza ceasefire, even suggested that Israel renew a full-scale offensive on the territory to destroy Hamas if it doesn't abide by a \"short ultimatum for real disarmament and exile.\"   Netanyahu said later on Monday that while there are differences with the U.S. about the composition of the advisory committee accompanying the next phase in Gaza, it would not harm his relationship with Trump.   \"There will not be Turkish soldiers and Qatari soldiers in the (Gaza) Strip,\" he said.   Netanyahu's office earlier said the formation of an executive board that will work to carry out the vision of the Board of Peace wasn't coordinated with the Israeli government and \"is contrary to its policy\" without clarifying its objections. Turkey, a key regional rival, is among those invited to join the committee.   The final list   The U.S. is expected to announce its official list of members in the coming days, likely during the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland.   \n   Board members will oversee an executive committee that will be in charge of implementing the tough second phase of the Gaza peace plan that includes the deployment of an international security force, disarmament of Hamas and reconstruction of the war-devastated territory.   A $1 billion contribution secures permanent membership on the board, with the money going to rebuild Gaza, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity about the charter as he wasn't permitted to speak publicly about details of the board, which hasn't been made public. A three-year appointment has no contribution requirement.   According to the World Bank's Gaza and West Bank Interim Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (IRDNA) report released last year, it'll take $53 billion to rebuild the strip.   British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Monday the United Kingdom is talking to allies about the Board of Peace.   Running Gaza   Egypt's top diplomat on Monday met with the leader of the newly appointed committee of Palestinian technocrats who will be running Gaza's day-to-day affairs during the second phase.   Foreign Minister Bader Abdelatty met with Ali Shaath, a Palestinian engineer and former official with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, who was named last week as chief commissioner of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza.   Abdelatty expressed the Egyptian government's \"complete support\" of the committee and affirmed its role in running Gaza's daily affairs until the Palestinian Authority takes over the territory, said a statement from the Egyptian ministry.   Gaza humanitarian situation still fragile   The U.N. World Food Program on Monday said it has \"significantly expanded\" its operations across Gaza 100 days into the ceasefire, reaching more than a million people each month with hot meals and food parcels. But it warned the situation remains \"extremely fragile.\"   It noted that malnutrition has been prevented for 200,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women, as well as children under 5.   \n   Still, the most recent Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis in December indicated that 77% the population is facing crisis-level food insecurity.   Israeli forces move into Hebron   Israeli military and security forces launched what they called a large-scale counterterrorism operation in the West Bank city of Hebron to dismantle \"terrorist infrastructure, eliminating illegal weapons possession and strengthening security.\"   The Israeli military said Monday the operation is expected to continue for several days. Israeli armored vehicles and soldiers patrolled city streets and put up barriers where operations were being conducted.   Hebron Mayor Khaled Dudin said Israeli forces targeted the area that's home to 80,000 people because it obstructs the construction of additional Israeli settlements.   Three Palestinians killed   Israeli forces on Monday killed three Palestinians, including a teenager, in southern Gaza, hospital authorities said.   Two men crossed into Israeli-controlled areas east of Khan Younis before being shot dead, while 17-year-old Hussein Tawfiq Abu Sabalah was shot and killed in the Muwasi area of Rafah, according to the Nasser hospital. It wasn't immediately clear whether the teen had crossed into or came close to the Israeli-controlled area.   More than 460 people were killed by Israeli fire and their bodies brought to hospitals since the ceasefire went into effect just over three months ago, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.   The ministry, which is part of the Hamas-led government, maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts.\n",

Tim Walz, expanding the agency's probe alleging that Minnesota officials conspired to impede law enforcement amid the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.   Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her have also been subpoenaed. NPR has not yet confirmed reports that other state and local leaders have also been issued subpoenas.   Frey's subpoena requires him to appear in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis on Feb. 3. The mayor accused the federal government of weaponizing its power to intimidate local leaders.   \n   \"We shouldn't have to live in a country where people fear that federal law enforcement will be used to play politics or crack down on local voices they disagree with,\" he said in a statement.   Earlier Tuesday, U.S. Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino appeared with ICE leader Marcos Charles in a news briefing criticizing Minnesota leaders and defending the work of immigration officers.    \"They're everyday people doing a very hard job, trying to enforce the immigration laws in an environment where local and state politicians have been spreading rhetoric that dehumanizes these officers and agents,\" Charles said.     Protesters in Minnesota have roiled against Immigration and Customs Enforcement after one of its agents shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Macklin Good earlier this month.   \"Less than two weeks ago, federal agents shot and killed a Minnesotan in broad daylight,\" Ellison said in a statement. \"Now, instead of seriously investigating the killing of Renee Good, Trump is weaponizing the justice system against any leader who dares stand up to him.\"   During a White House press briefing Tuesday, President Trump discussed ICE tactics and Good's shooting.    \"They're going to make mistakes. Sometimes ICE is going to be too rough with somebody, or, you know, they're dealing with rough people,\" Trump said. \"Are they going to make a mistake sometimes? It can happen. I feel terribly. I felt horribly when I was told that the young woman who was, who had the tragedy. It's a tragedy. It's a horrible thing.\"   \n   Ellison said the DOJ is asking for records and documents related to his office's work regarding federal immigration enforcement. He pointed out that this action comes shortly after his office sued the Trump administration over ICE's tactics in the region.   \"Let's be clear about why this is happening: Donald Trump is coming after the people of Minnesota and I'm standing in his way,\" Ellison said. \"I will not be intimidated, and I will not stop working to protect Minnesotans from Trump's campaign of retaliation and revenge.\"   NPR has reached out to the White House for comment on the DOJ subpoenas, but has not yet received a response\n",

    "body": "\n         Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer says her swing state is preparing for Trump administration efforts to disrupt voting in 2026 and 2028.   In an NPR interview, Whitmer did not accuse the administration of specific plans to interfere. But, she said, \"it would be a mistake to assume that they're not going to\" and said Democrats are preparing through \"tabletop\" exercises.   The governor sat down with me for the video interview on Thursday during her visit to the Detroit Auto Show, pulling up a chair next to a red Cadillac Escalade. The show is at Huntington Place, the same convention center that was a ballot-counting site in 2020, when pro-Trump protesters banged on windows and tried to stop the count.   \n   Whitmer is beginning her eighth and final year as governor. She is term limited and not currently a candidate for anything, though she is often mentioned as a presidential or vice presidential contender. She has made no public moves toward running in 2028, though as the vice chair of the Democratic Governors Association, she says she is focused on electing other Democrats.   You can watch the full video interview. Below are highlights:   Democratic governors are preparing for further election disruptions    Asked whether she assumed that pro-Trump forces would attempt to interfere with ballot counting, Whitmer said, \"It would be a mistake to assume that they're not going to. So I don't know precisely what it is that they might come up with. But we've got smart, sophisticated, savvy people around the tabletop that we will continue to get prepared.\"   Asked about fears that Trump's immigration crackdown — deploying thousands of federal personnel into American cities — would become a tool for controlling elections, Whitmer said, \"I don't think it's paranoia to have that concern.\"   She said Democratic governors are discussing how to respond and are performing \"tabletop\" exercises, though she gave few specifics. \"There are important reasons that I'm not going to go into a whole lot more detail,\" Whitmer said.   \n   She says Trump's tariffs have \"taken a terrible toll\"   Whitmer used that alliterative phrase during a speech at the Detroit Auto Show. She said U.S. auto manufacturing depended on parts and materials sourced from around the world, especially Canada. U.S. automakers have said tariffs cost them billions of dollars in 2025.   The United Auto Workers union has spoken favorably of tariffs, expressing hope that they would return manufacturing jobs to the United States. Whitmer conceded that \"some of the leadership says they like tariffs,\" but \"we are seeing a contraction of U.S. manufacturing. That's job losses. And ultimately, their rank-and-file members have got to be able to afford to take care of their families.\" Asked how she might persuade union leaders, she said, \"I'm not working to persuade them to change their mind. I'm doing what I know to be the right thing to do for the Michigan economy, for the United States economy.\"   She is trying to understand Democrats' loss of support among men in 2024   Her state of the state speech in 2025 warned of \"a generation of men falling behind their fathers and their grandfathers.\"   Asked to explain her thinking, she said, \"When we look at the efforts that we undertook to make college or skill sets more affordable, women were signing up 2-to-1,\" compared with men. She added, \"When we announced opportunities that bring down the cost of a first home payment, women were signing up 2-to-1 for men. We were not reaching men.\"   Asked about analysts who argue that many men are demoralized or disconnected, she said, \"I'm listening to all, probably a lot, of the same podcasts that you are to understand what can we do. How do we bridge this gap? It is real. And I think that's the first step.\"   She says America is ready to elect a woman president   Last year, former first lady Michelle Obama said to voters at a public event, \"You are not ready\" to elect a woman, judging by the 2024 election results.   \n   \"I love Michelle Obama,\" Whitmer said. \"So the last thing I want to do is disagree with her. But, you know, I think America is ready for a woman president.\" She said Kamala Harris' defeat in 2024 was not \"just gender\" but a variety of factors. \"We have not had a woman president yet. I think we will at some point in the near future,\" Whitmer said.\n",

The couple was in a tight spot. They had three kids and were forced to move because their landlord was selling their rental. That pressure made their search all the more frustrating.   \"We would pull up to a house, our agent would get out and be like, 'There's 10 additional offers, sight unseen, all cash.' Typically that means it's an investor,\" Maxwell recalled.    \n   The couple, who eventually found a place, was one of many whose path to homeownership was stymied by a nationwide surge of institutional investors, then driven by record-low mortgage rates, snapping up single-family homes to rent out.   It's an issue that President Trump now aims to take on. In a recent social media post, he said he wants to \"ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes,\" to help bring down housing costs.   It's a popular idea, especially among some Democrats. But passing such laws has proved difficult, and economists say the link of investor-owned homes to high prices is not so simple.   A cap on investor rentals just took effect in this city   In Fishers, Ind., a suburb of Indianapolis, Republican Mayor Scott Fadness was taken aback when he saw new data in a housing report compiled by his team that showed the extent of investor landlords in his city.   \"We have neighborhoods today that are now creeping up to 35, 38% of the homes have been purchased for investment purposes,\" he said.   It got so bad, he recalled, that one of his employees who was house hunting sent letters to homeowners, explaining that they were going to work for the city \"and would they please consider allowing them to buy the home\" instead of an institutional investor.   \n   To address the problem, Fadness last year proposed capping rentals at 10% per neighborhood to protect local homeownership.   \"It's been a source of generational wealth in our country for a very long time, particularly in the middle class,\" he said. \"I hate to see that go away.\"   \n   It's also more difficult, he said, to deal with code enforcement and other issues when the property owner is an out-of-state corporation.   Realtor groups opposed a cap, arguing it infringed on private property rights and could deprive sellers of the highest bid, but the City Council backed the plan unanimously. The new law just took effect Jan. 1.   \"It was the first time I had proposed an ordinance in our community where outside interests, business interests, came into town and spent money trying to kill the legislation,\" Fadness said.   It was a rare win for such a proposal. Cities and states across the U.S. have debated restricting investor homebuyers, yet most measures have failed to pass. One proposal went nowhere in Congress, which Trump has said would need to codify any ban. California Gov. Gavin Newsom joined Trump this month in saying he's determined to do something.   Economists say large investors are not the biggest factor driving home prices   But housing experts say it's too easy to blame corporate landlords entirely for skyrocketing prices.   \"People see the connection, but they don't necessarily separate out the cause and effect,\" said Laurie Goodman, an economist with the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute.   \n   Prices do go up where investors buy, but she said, \"That is part of their strategy,\" because the places they choose are already growing. And often, they buy serious fixer-uppers.   \"Most of us don't have the knowledge to do the repairs,\" Goodman said. \"[Even] if we did, we couldn't get the financing.\"   Nationally, the largest companies own about 3% of the single-family rental market, with larger shares in some places like the Sunbelt. And the institutional buying spree has cooled from its peak in 2022, as higher interest rates have made homes more expensive.   \n   The main driver of rising prices is a housing shortage, Goodman said, and some investors are actually helping to ease that now, by building their own single-family houses to rent.   \"The best way to make housing affordable is to simply build more of it — to increase supply,\" she said.   The debate continues in Las Vegas   In Las Vegas, Democratic state Sen. Dina Neal still worries that the build-to-rent trend is undercutting people's shot at homeownership. She pointed to one corporate investor near her district that built an entire neighborhood of houses to rent.   \"They didn't build the whole entire neighborhood to give it up,\" she said. \"They wanted to make sure they would secure rental income from 200 different families and keep it.\"   What's more, like Fadness in Indiana, Neal worries that investor rentals are priced so high it can become impossible for many people to save up for a down payment. She said her previous next-door neighbor sold to an investor believing she could trade up, but had to rent a place down the street — from a different corporate investor.   Neal has proposed a cap on corporate landlords three times, but Nevada's Republican governor, Joe Lombardo, has blocked it, most recently last month.   Neal is surprised — and cautious — now that Trump is taking up her cause. \"I am trying to figure out how I entered into a universe where I became aligned with a president who is a nemesis to the Democratic Party,\" she laughed.   But if Trump's interest can persuade more Republicans to join the push, she said she'll take it.\n",

In Ohio, lawmakers are considering a new approach.   \n\n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  A federal appeals court today is hearing arguments about laws in Louisiana and Texas requiring displays of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms. The laws have been blocked by lower courts. Other states are watching for the final outcome of that case, including Ohio, where some lawmakers are backing an approach they hope will survive legal challenges. Ohio Public Radio's Sarah Donaldson reports from Columbus.SARAH DONALDSON, BYLINE: In 1980, the Supreme Court struck down a Kentucky law requiring public schools to hang posters with the Ten Commandments in every classroom. The court ruled the posters were, quote, \"plainly religious in nature.\" But the unsigned decision was close. And now, decades later, Yale Law School professor Justin Driver says dissenters want to test it.JUSTIN DRIVER: More recently, a number of states, including Louisiana and Texas and Ohio, have been taking steps to try to get the court to, in effect, revisit that issue.DONALDSON: Their hopes were boosted a few years ago when the court ruled in favor of a high school football coach who had prayed on the 50-yard line after games, with players free to join. The reading of the First Amendment seems to be in flux.DRIVER: The Establishment Clause has long been understood to prohibit the school from teaching, say, religion as truth.DONALDSON: Laws in Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas, which have been passed but put on hold by the courts, mandate the display of the commandments. But Ohio lawmakers are trying something different. In November, the state Senate passed a bill that requires four historic documents in history and social studies classrooms out of a list of nine options. The legislature assembled the list. Among the choices? The Bill of Rights, the Magna Carta, the Articles of Confederation and the Ten Commandments. The decision is left with the school boards.ANDREW BRENNER: I'm sure there's local school boards in the state that have no problem putting up an LGBTQ+ flag in their schools and/or celebrating it because their locals have made that decision.DONALDSON: That's Republican state Senator Andrew Brenner. He backs the argument heard in other states - that the Ten Commandments is significant as a historical document that shaped the founding of the U.S.BRENNER: There is a basis for everything - that there was a God Almighty and that everything was created from God. And you have to have a moral basis for everything. The Ten Commandments are a basis for a large chunk of our laws if you go back to the Mayflower.DONALDSON: American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio legislative director Gary Daniels says that even though some commandments overlap with secular messaging - don't kill, don't steal - others are just religious.GARY DANIELS: That's what they want to get purposely in front of students, is those exclusively religious messages in the Ten Commandments.DONALDSON: Opponents to the bill in the Senate said it could make children and families of other beliefs feel excluded. And Daniels says some school districts might be pressured to display the commandments.DANIELS: So you're going to have legislators sign this into law - school districts feel forced because there will certainly be lobbying at the local level to include, among those four documents, the Ten Commandments.DONALDSON: With the bill having passed the Senate, it could get a hearing in the Ohio House next month.For NPR News, I'm Sarah Donaldson in Columbus, Ohio.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

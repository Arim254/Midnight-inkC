Hegseth in a social media posting said the vessel was operated by a U.S.-designated terrorist organization but did not name which group was targeted. He said three people were killed in the strike.   \n   It's at least the 15th such strike carried out by the U.S. military in the Caribbean or eastern Pacific since early September.   \"This vessel—like EVERY OTHER—was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,\" Hegseth said in a posting on X.   The U.S. military has now killed at least 64 people in the strikes.   Trump has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States. He has asserted the U.S. is engaged in an \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels, relying on the same legal authority used by the Bush administration when it declared a war on terrorism after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.   \n   U.S. lawmakers have been repeatedly rebuffed by the White House in their demand that the administration release more information about the legal justification for the strikes as well as greater details about which cartels have been targeted and the individuals killed.   \n   Hegseth in his Saturday posting announcing the latest strike said \"narco-terrorists are bringing drugs to our shores to poison Americans at home\" and the Defense Department \"will treat them EXACTLY how we treated Al-Qaeda.\"   Senate Democrats renewed their request for more information about the strikes in a letter on Friday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Hegseth.   \"We also request that you provide all legal opinions related to these strikes and a list of the groups or other entities the President has deemed targetable,\" the senators wrote.   Among those signing the letter were Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as well as Sens. Jack Reed, Jeanne Shaheen, Mark Warner, Chris Coons, Patty Murray and Brian Schatz.   The letter says that thus far the administration \"has selectively shared what has at times been contradictory information\" with some members, \"while excluding others.\"   Earlier Friday, the Republican chairman and ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee released a pair of letters sent to Hegseth written in late September and early October requesting the department's legal rationale for the strikes and the list of drug cartels that the Trump administration has designated as terrorist organizations in its justification for the use of military force.\n",

Ron, thanks for being with us.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.SIMON: What do you believe are the political calculations of the Trump administration when it comes to SNAP benefits?ELVING: No one wants to be in charge when families are forced to go without food. But here we have the Trump administration going to some lengths to find $5 billion to pay the military, while refusing to take a similar amount from a contingency fund specifically meant for food assistance. They call that a rainy day fund for a hurricane or an earthquake, but two federal judges have now said it sure looks like an emergency to them. So now Trump says maybe his lawyers can find a way to release the money after all. And when you think about it, this comes in the same news cycle with release of photos of new gold fixtures in the White House bathrooms and news stories about a lavish \"Great Gatsby\" party at Mar-a-Lago last night hosted by the president. Not great optics.SIMON: The Senate majority leader, John Thune, once more rejected the president's call to eliminate the filibuster. The president sees that as a way of ending the government shutdown on his terms, but his Republican allies in the Senate resist his call. Why is that?ELVING: The filibuster, that 60-vote requirement in the Senate, empowers the minority party regardless of which party that is. And Republicans have long memories. They know they could be back in the minority again themselves someday, maybe fairly soon. And they can easily imagine Democrats with the Senate majority making major moves, such as expanding the Supreme Court or granting statehood to the District of Columbia - things the filibuster has prevented in the past. Now, presidents, of course, have long chafed at the filibuster, and Trump is no exception. It's a barrier to his program in the present, and that matters more to him than what might happen to the Senate in some future situation years from now.SIMON: Of course, Ron, President Trump returned from a tour of Asia this week. Would you call the trip a success?ELVING: It certainly looked like a success - not just the public spectacles, but also the pile of trade deals and other negotiations that seemed to be successfully completed. Now, we've also seen that with Trump and trade, much that seems set can shift. That's part of what he seems to like about tariffs. He can impose them and then change them at will. He's done that many times, and the current Congress has not yet chosen to assert its own role and rein him in. So tariffs become tools for his personal manipulation, which plays to his strengths as a negotiator and as a showman.All the same, there would seem to be real gains made on this trip in terms of securing strategic materials and also in de-escalating the talk of trade war with China. That's certainly good news for business and worldwide. Trump also worked hard on this trip to burnish his credentials as a peacemaker, witnessing the signing of a deal between Thailand and Cambodia over border disputes and so on. He was plainly displeased, however, that the whole trip got upstaged by the government shutdown at home.SIMON: Of course, open enrollment begins today on the Affordable Care Act marketplace. It's going to be on the minds of a lot of people this weekend, isn't it?SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving. Always a pleasure to talk to you and particularly in a week like this with so much happening. Thanks very much.ELVING: Thank you, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

People here are concerned about suburban issues like traffic, rapid development and gas prices.   It's a red area represented by a Republican in Congress. But an election Tuesday will determine whether the state redraws congressional lines and divides people here into districts likely to elect Democrats to the U.S. House.   \"We want to keep our communities that are alike together, right? And so if we get sucked into Sacramento or, you know, somewhere, we don't share the same needs, right?\" says Amanda Cortez, a Republican who serves on the Loomis Town Council.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Republican Amanda Cortez, member of the Loomis, CA., town council, opposes the redistricting map on the ballot.\n                \n                    Laura Fitzgerald/CapRadio\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Laura Fitzgerald/CapRadio\n    \n\n   \n   The result of the election in California on Tuesday could determine not only who represents Cortez and her neighbors in Loomis, but who controls the U.S. House after the midterm elections next year.   \n   California's ballot question was a reaction to Trump's redistricting push   This summer President Trump set off a national redistricting race, starting in Texas, to boost chances for GOP candidates in 2026. Missouri and North Carolina Republicans also redistricted and Trump is urging leaders in Indiana, Kansas and other states to follow. Democrats say the GOP is gerrymandering in ways that dilute the votes of Black and Latino communities.   \n   California's redistricting proposal, Proposition 50, would redraw the state's congressional map to help yield up to five new seats for Democrats. California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom set it in motion after Texas Republicans moved to get the edge in five seats in their state.   Republicans in California could pay the price. Mike Murray, another Republican voter in the third Congressional district that Loomis is in, says the ballot proposal will dilute his community's voice by splitting the county into three separate districts.   \n   \"If we wanted to live in an urban community with the problems and the benefits of an urban community, we would. But we choose to live here. And when we choose to live here, we hope that somebody will represent us in our way of life,\" Murray said.   Eric Schickler, co-director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, says opponents of  California's redistricting plan are concerned it will sideline the state's independent citizens redistricting commission, which has helped give their communities a voice.    \n   \"The basic argument made by opponents of Prop 50 is that the non-partisan process that was set up in 2008 for the legislature and 2010 for Congress has worked well for the state. It's giving rise to more competitive elections,\" Schickler said.   Democrats see a chance to counter Trump's national agenda   But for proponents, mainly Democrats, California's special election is all about Congress and the Trump administration.   \"To the extent that voters care about having a check on President Trump, well, you need a Democratic House to do that, is the argument that Democrats are making,\" Schickler added.   Cyan Samone lives in Truckee, California near Lake Tahoe, a blue dot in the same Republican congressional district as the town of Loomis.   At a recent gathering of local Democrats organizing to support Prop 50, Samone said the redistricting is a chance to push back on the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.   \"I have a lot of friends who are immigrants from different countries who have left authoritarian regimes,\" said Samone. \"You see the patterns and you just don't want to see that happen here and I don't want to have to see people who fled terrible situations having to run again.\"   Samone's husband, Ben Woodard, says redistricting could mean Democrats here are able to elect a representative that'll pay more attention to what his community needs.   \"The Democratic Party representative would do that,\" Woodard said. \"Look over our interests like, you know, the cuts to Medicare definitely impact rural health care.\"   Supporters of California's redistricting measure appear to have the upper hand heading into election week. It's a state with a deep blue electorate and many voters see this as a national struggle.      Laura Fitzgerald covers California state politics for CapRadio.\n",

The president also warned that he \"will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria.\"   \"If the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the U.S.A. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, 'guns-a-blazing,' to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities,\" Trump posted on social media. \"I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action. If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians!\"   \n   The warning came after Nigeria's President Bola Ahmed Tinubu earlier on Saturday pushed back on Trump announcing a day earlier that he was designating the West African country \"a country of particular concern\" for allegedly failing to rein in the persecution of Christians.   In a social media statement on Saturday, Tinubu said that the characterization of Nigeria as a religiously intolerant country does not reflect the national reality.   \"Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so,\" Tinubu said. \"Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it. Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths.\"   Trump on Friday said \"Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria\" and \"radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter.\"   Trump's comment came weeks after U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz urged Congress to designate Africa's most populous country as a violator of religious freedom with claims of \"Christian mass murder.\"   Nigeria's population of 220 million is split almost equally between Christians and Muslims. The country has long faced insecurity from various fronts including the Boko Haram extremist group, which seeks to establish its radical interpretation of Islamic law and has also targeted Muslims it deems not Muslim enough.   \n   Attacks in Nigeria have varying motives. There are religiously motivated ones targeting both Christians and Muslims, clashes between farmers and herders over dwindling resources, communal rivalries, secessionist groups and ethnic clashes.   While Christians are among those targeted, analysts say the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria's Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur.   Kimiebi Ebienfa, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reiterated the commitment of Nigeria to protect citizens of all religions.   \"The Federal Government of Nigeria will continue to defend all citizens, irrespective of race, creed, or religion,\" Ebienfa said in a statement on Saturday. \"Like America, Nigeria has no option but to celebrate the diversity that is our greatest strength.\"   Nigeria was placed on the country of particular concern list by the U.S. for the first time in 2020 over what the State Department called \"systematic violations of religious freedom.\" The designation, which did not single out attacks on Christians, was lifted in 2023 in what observers saw as a way to improve ties between the countries ahead of then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit.\n",

Speaking to U.S. troops aboard an aircraft carrier in Japan, Trump said he planned to expand his crime and immigration offensive because \"we have cities in trouble.\"   \"We're sending in our National Guard, and if we need more than the National Guard, we'll send more than the National Guard, because we're going to have safe cities,\" Trump said, aboard the USS George Washington at the Yokosuka Naval Base. \"We're not going to have people killed in our cities. And whether people like that or not, that's what we're doing.\"   \n   The White House has transformed what started as a focused effort, purportedly meant to address crime in Washington, D.C. into a nationwide campaign to portray Trump and the Republicans as unabashed crime fighters while painting Democrats as coddlers of crime. Violent crime in the city was at a 30-year low prior to the Guard's arrival.   Trump has also deployed troops to Los Angeles, Chicago, Memphis, Tenn., and Portland, Ore, which has triggered protests and lawsuits.   Democratic leaders have accused the White House of exaggerating the challenges in order to launch an illegal military occupation. But Trump is banking on the moves helping him and Republicans in next year's midterms.   At a cabinet meeting in August, Trump called crime a stronger issue for Republicans to run on than transgender athletes in school sports and possibly even immigration.   \"Crime is probably the issue that he fares best on, certainly better than handling inflation or trade or even international relations, despite some of the successes that he's had recently,\" said Jon McHenry, a Republican pollster with North Star Opinion Research.   Political data points to a clear opportunity for Trump and the Republicans.   Though FBI data show that violent crime decreased by 4.5 percent last year, a new Gallup poll released Thursday shows almost half of Americans — 49 percent — feel that crime has risen from last year — while about a third — or 33 percent — feel crime has gone down.   \n   The Gallup poll also reveals some political risks for Trump. More Americans oppose using federal troops to combat domestic crime than support the move — but the divide is largely along political lines, as Republicans overwhelmingly support the use of troops while Democrats are opposed.   \n   Crime shouldn't be looked at through a partisan lens, but Trump has tapped into one of the most basic quality of life issues, said Jillian Snider, a member of the Council on Criminal Justice and retired New York police officer.   She said most people do not look online to see if crime is up or down. They instead walk down the street.   \"That is the real problem here, that general community members, they don't care as much to be schooled by what the stats show us,\" said Snider, who also teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \"They just care about how they feel in their communities.\"   Republicans have long leaned into law and order, but veteran political strategist Alex Conant says Trump embraces the issue in an unprecedented way when you look at troops in cities.   \"He told his base he was going to get crime in American cities under control. And now, when you turn on the TV at night, U.S. troops are trying to do exactly that,\" Conant said. \"Now, obviously, there's going to be a lot of opposition to it, especially amongst Democrats, people who live in some of those neighborhoods. But this is what he told his base he would do, and now he's delivering it. And, he's proud of it.\"\n",

For that reason, he easily has Ash's vote — if only she lived in the city he was running in. Instead, she lives more than 1,200 miles away.   \"I would like to believe one day there could be a Zohran Mamdani for Gulfport, Miss., but I don't think that's ever going to happen, at least not in my lifetime,\" Ash said, acknowledging her state's deep conservative roots. \"But it gives me hope that it can happen in other places across the country.\"   \n   In just a few months, Mamdani, a 34-year-old state assemblyman and Democratic Socialist, has gone from a long-shot fringe candidate to a national figure — securing an upset win in the June primary, where voters 18-29 had the highest turnout of any age group.    \n   Now, on the cusp of Election Day — where polls show him the clear frontrunner over his closest rival, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo — Mamdani is counting on that youth coalition to show up again. But his pledge to address rising costs appears to be resonating with young people far outside of the five boroughs. It's a message that many Gen Z and millennials say speaks to their most pressing concerns at a time when many feel hopeless about their leaders and yearn for new voices willing to break with political norms.   \"When a candidate is able to speak to the concerns of the populace and validate those concerns … I think that that has a big impact, especially when it comes to young people,\" said Ruby Belle Booth, who studies young voters for the nonpartisan research organization CIRCLE.   \"They really feel heard and like they're being respected,\" she added. \"I think any candidate can do that and have success. But right now it's Mamdani and maybe before that, it was [President] Trump.\"   \n   A local movement for Mamdani has gone national   Despite living in ruby red Mississippi, Ash says she's always voted for Democrats. However, in recent years, she's grown frustrated and ignored by political leaders.   It's a feeling exacerbated by her own economic situation. The pandemic cut her college experience short, and she struggled to find work, forcing her to move back home. Now, years later, even with a job, she's unable to afford her own place.   \n   Giving up on that goal, she says, was a hard pill to swallow.   \"When [my mom] was in her twenties, she was married, and she and my dad owned a house by this point, and I can't even afford to rent in a city in Mississippi,\" she said, adding that she's seen housing prices increase despite the state having one of the highest poverty rates in the country. \"It's a little demoralizing.\"   But Ash hopes, if Mamdani wins, it'll send a message to Democrats in other cities around the country to take issues like housing affordability more seriously.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Zohran Mamdani sits with attendees to watch \"The Cost of Living Classic\" soccer tournament on October 19, 2025 in New York City.\n                \n                    Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   A focus on the economy and breaking the status quo    Mamdani has campaigned on a slew of promises, particularly around housing — notably, he's vowing to freeze the rent for rent-stabilized units and build 200,000 new apartments for low and middle-income New Yorkers. Those proposals are part of his larger, ambitious platform aimed at cutting prices, ranging from creating city-run grocery stores to making city buses and childcare free.   His critics on the left say these ideas are unrealistic — even in a liberal bastion like New York City. Among conservatives, including Trump, Mamdani's views have been characterized as extreme or dangerous.   Those warnings, however, don't seem to be fazing many young Americans, who appear most drawn to his message over any political label from either Democrats or the GOP.   \n   \"Mamdani is this candidate who is actively challenging the status quo in a lot of ways rather than representing it,\" said Booth.   She points to a CIRCLE survey from this spring that found that just 16% of those under 30 believe Democracy is working for them, which Booth argues isn't indicative that these voters are thrilled by politics as usual.   Although they hold vastly different ideologies, Booth argues Trump tapped into a similar anti-establishment mentality last year. Economic concerns were the top issue for those 18-29 last fall, and voters who prioritized the economy were also more likely to vote for the president, according to a CIRCLE analysis of 2024 AP VoteCast data.   \"I think that young people, we've seen, are not really thinking about politics in terms of those two parties and are evaluating it more in terms of the issues that they really care about,\" Booth said.   \n   Affordability concerns should cross party lines, argues 26-year-old Democrat Emily Wilson. Based in St. Petersburg, Fla., she's also supporting Mamdani from afar, and says she often talks politics with her colleagues at the spa where they work.   \"Grocery prices and bus prices and rent prices, these are issues affecting both Democrats and Republicans,\" Wilson said.   Though she acknowledges that some people could see Mamdani's candidacy as too radical outside of New York, she argues that a similar economic message could be effective when delivered by a candidate who knows the community.   \"I think if a Floridian or a Texan were to talk about the same issues that Zohran [is talking about], I think he would have the same appeal,\" she said.   Up north in a small town near Ann Arbor, Mich., Daisy Lupa, 25, feels similarly. As someone who has begrudgingly backed national Democrats in recent years, she says Mamdani's campaign is refreshing, and believes many of his proposals could help communities like hers.   \n   \"I think that a lot of stuff that he is trying to push forward in New York … are things that we need even more in rural areas and even more in the Midwest because we don't have it at all,\" she said.   \"It's flawed in New York,\" she added. \"It's absent here.\"   Cautious optimism   Of course, a central question for those who actually can vote in the New York mayor's race is whether Mamdani can truly solve the affordability crisis.   \n   For Dillon Robertson, 32, money is a constant worry. He commutes to college in Connecticut and will graduate with close to $250,000 in student loans. He's supporting Mamdani and says many of his cost-saving proposals could make his life easier, but at the same time, he worries if it's all possible.   \"A lot of the stuff he says sounds nice. But I both wonder, can he do it? Can he pull it off?\" he said. \"Or [is] it just kind of like a Band-Aid on a leaky ship?\"   Still, he admits, if the options are to keep plodding along or try something new, he's ready to give it a shot.\n",

The announcement marks the latest development in the Trump administration's prolonged standoff with Harvard over the White House's demands for reforms at the Ivy League school.   Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a statement Friday that Harvard \"no longer meets the needs of the War Department or the military services.\"   \"For too long, this department has sent our best and brightest officers to Harvard, hoping the university would better understand and appreciate our warrior class,\" Hegseth said. \"Instead, too many of our officers came back looking too much like Harvard — heads full of globalist and radical ideologies that do not improve our fighting ranks.\"   \n   In a separate post on X, Hegseth wrote, \"Harvard is woke; The War Department is not.\"   Starting with the 2026-27 academic year, the Pentagon will discontinue graduate-level professional military education, fellowships and certificate programs, the statement said. Personnel currently attending classes at Harvard will be able to finish those courses.   Similar programs at other Ivy League universities will be evaluated in coming weeks, Hegseth said.   Hegseth earned a master's degree from Harvard but symbolically returned his diploma in a 2022 Fox News segment. A Pentagon social media account run by Hegseth's office resurfaced the clip in which Hegseth, then a Fox News commentator, returned the diploma and wrote \"Return to Sender\" on it with a marker.   The military offers its officers a variety of opportunities to get graduate-level education both at war colleges run by the military as well as civilian institutions like Harvard.   Broadly, while opportunities to attend prestigious civilian schools offer less direct benefit to a servicemember's military career than their civilian counterparts, they help make troops more attractive employees once they leave the military.   Harvard has long been President Donald Trump's top target in his administration's campaign to bring the nation's most prestigious universities to heel. His officials have cut billions of dollars in Harvard's federal research funding and attempted to block it from enrolling foreign students after the campus rebuffed a series of government demands last April.   \n   The White House has said it's punishing Harvard for tolerating anti-Jewish bias on campus. Harvard leaders argue they're facing illegal retaliation for failing to adopt the administration's ideological views. Harvard sued the administration in a pair of lawsuits. A federal judge issued orders siding with Harvard in both cases. The administration is appealing.   Tensions had eased over the summer as Trump teased a deal that he said was just days away. It never materialized and on Monday the president dug deeper, demanding $1 billion from Harvard as part of any deal to restore federal funding. That's twice what he had demanded before.\n",

The post was later deleted, and the White House blamed a staffer for \"erroneously\" posting it. On Friday evening, Trump refused to apologize for the post: \"I didn't make a mistake,\" he told reporters aboard Air Force One.   The post was one of dozens Trump shared in the middle of the night on his platform Truth Social and came at the end of a minute-long video promoting conspiracy theories about the 2020 election.   \n   White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the clip before it was deleted, saying \"please stop the fake outrage.\"    Leavitt said it was from an \"internet meme\" that depicted Trump as king of the jungle while Democrats were shown as characters from The Lion King. Trump's clip did not include any of the longer video Leavitt referred to, which also includes other Democrats, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani, depicted as animals.   The racist trope depicting Black people as apes or animals has historically been used to dehumanize Black people and to justify slavery.   Criticism of Trump and his post came swiftly, including from some otherwise allied with Trump.   South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a Republican, said he was \"praying it was fake.\"   \"It's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House. The President should remove it,\" said Scott, who is Black.   Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One Friday evening that he had spoken to Scott. \"He's a great guy, he understood that 100 percent.\"    Asked if the post had hurt Republican support amongst Black voters Trump said no.   \"We did criminal justice reform. I did the historically Black colleges and universities — I get them funded. Nobody has been — and that's why I got a tremendous, the highest vote with male Black voters that they've seen in many, many decades.    \n   Trump went on to insist that he was the \"least racist president you've had in a long time.\"    Trump has a history of making racist remarks toward Black people and other people of color.   For years he pushed the false narrative that Obama was not born in the U.S., and he has previously used derogatory language to describe African countries.   He also falsely claimed former Vice President Kamala Harris \"turned Black\" during the presidential campaign. Harris identifies as Black and Indian American.\n",

The posts will be internally archived but will no longer be on public view, the State Department confirmed to NPR. Staff members were told that anyone wanting to see older posts will have to file a Freedom of Information Act request, according to a State Department employee who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation by the Trump administration. That would differ from how the U.S. government typically handles archiving the public online footprint of previous administrations.   \n   The move comes as the Trump administration has removed wide swaths of information from government websites that conflict with the president's views, including environmental and health data and references to women, people of color and members of the LGBTQ+ community. The government has also taken down signs at national parks mentioning slavery and references to Trump's impeachments and presidency at the National Portrait Gallery.   The White House has also launched a revisionist history account of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and has replaced the government's coronavirus resource sites with a page titled \"Lab Leak: The True Origins of Covid-19.\"   \n   The removal of State Department X posts from public view appears to be less about ideological differences with past statements and more about control of future messaging. The directive will see the removal of posts from Trump's first term as well as those under then-Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama.   In response to NPR's questions about the removals, an unnamed State Department spokesperson said the goal \"is to limit confusion on U.S government policy and to speak with one voice to advance the President, Secretary, and Administration's goals and messaging. It will preserve history while promoting the present.\" The spokesperson said the department's X accounts \"are one of our most powerful tools for advancing the America First goals and messaging of the President, Secretary, and Administration, both to our fellow Americans and audiences around the world.\"   \n   The State Department did not respond to NPR's specific questions about whether content will also be removed from other social media sites or whether there will be ways for the public to access archived posts without filing a Freedom of Information Act request.   \"All archived content will be preserved in alignment with Federal Record Act requirements and Department policies,\" the spokesperson said.   Some current and former State Department employees as well as academics worry that it will make the historical record of the government's communications and actions harder to trace.   \"For all the many challenges, certainly, that social media has introduced into politics, it has also created this level of an imperfect but certainly some level of transparency,\" said Shannon McGregor, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who studies the role of social media in politics. \"Even if [the X posts are] still accessible in some kind of archive, it still puts up a greater barrier in terms of having access to that information.\"   In a similar but unrelated move this week, the CIA abruptly took down its World Factbook, a widely used reference manual seen as an authoritative source of information about countries, their economies, their demographics and more. The CIA's announcement said the publication, which has been published since 1962 and first went online in 1997, was being \"sunset\" and gave no further explanation for the decision.   Accounts for embassies, ambassadors, bureaus affected   The State Department directive applies to all the department's active official X accounts, including accounts for U.S. embassies and missions, ambassadors and department bureaus and programs, according to screenshots of internal guidance seen by NPR. The department has used its posts on X and other social media sites for years to share everything from policy announcements and speeches by the secretary of state and ambassadors, to fact sheets for travelers and images from around the world.   \n   \"These posts to be removed are not just press statements. They include our embassies' July 4 livestreams, photos of COVID vaccine donations to other nations, holiday greetings, condolences, cultural programming, and the day-to-day record of diplomacy. They show who the U.S. engaged with, when, and how—often the only public record of those moments,\" Orna Blum, a long-serving senior foreign service officer and public diplomacy specialist who retired last year, wrote in a LinkedIn post about the directive.   \"Once removed, there will be no easy public, searchable access to this history. [The Freedom of Information Act] is slow, discretionary, and often redacted. It's a backstop—not a substitute for open archives,\" Blum wrote.   Since Obama, the first president to use an official account on the social media site then called Twitter, left office in January 2017, handing over online accounts has been part of the transition process between administrations. Some content is archived, but those records typically remain in public view.   Federal agency accounts, including @StateDept on X, are passed along to the incoming administration intact, meaning that posts made under earlier administrations remain visible on their timelines. The State Department also has publicly available archived versions of its website under previous administrations dating back to President Bill Clinton.   Some high-profile accounts, including those of the president, vice president, first lady and White House, are handled differently. For example, the @POTUS handle on X is handed over from one president to the next with its existing roster of followers, but posts from the outgoing president are moved to a new archive account, such as @POTUS44 for Obama, @POTUS45 for the first Trump term and @POTUS46Archive for Biden.   The State Department guidance says the X removals do not apply to official accounts that are already dormant and marked as \"archived,\" like the @SecPompeo account used by Trump's first-term secretary of state, Mike Pompeo.   \n   New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani recently faced similar questions and concerns about transparency and preserving government records after his administration began to delete posts made by his predecessor, Eric Adams, under the @NYCMayor handle on X. However, Adams' posts can be found in a public archive maintained by the city.   As the State Department archives old posts, other agencies post extreme content   In isolation, the removal of State Department social media content is a minor change unrelated to larger overhauls of American diplomacy and foreign policy and the administration's widespread changes to the federal bureaucracy.   \n   But Trump's second-term messaging strategy has been defined by a mindset that social media content is governing and that governing is also achieved through content creation.   The Department of Homeland Security, the Labor Department and other federal government accounts have shared posts that contain white supremacist rhetoric and nods to conspiracy theories like QAnon. And Trump administration staffers frequently use X to spar with critics and post memes that support the president.   \n   On Friday, Trump faced uncharacteristic pushback from some fellow Republicans after sharing a video on his social media site that contained false claims of election fraud — and a short snippet of an unrelated video that contained a racist depiction of former President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama as apes.   That post was deleted, after the White House initially defended it as an \"internet meme.\"\n",

It's not just Democrats who are concerned, but also independent voters who are expected to play a major role in the upcoming midterm elections.   \"The base loves it, but it's an issue for the independent voters who decide elections in this country,\" said Alex Conant, a veteran Republican strategist. \"Independents want a strong border and they want to deport criminals, but they're really uneasy with having masked federal agents going around in neighborhoods, deporting anyone that they see — as the Democrats are portraying it.\"   \n   After months of aggressive enforcement, Trump's signature issue that twice got him elected is now turning into a liability ahead of this year's midterm elections.   The outcry over what many saw as militant tactics hit a fever pitch after the second fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen by immigration officers in Minnesota.   A new NPR/Marist poll shows that six in 10 Americans disapprove of the job federal immigration agents are doing.   Even typically loyal Republican supporters have called on the Trump administration to make changes and rebuild trust with law enforcement.   \"They, being the White House, need to recalibrate on what needs to be done to make sure that that respect is going to be re-instilled,\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told conservative radio host Mark Davis.   Trump shook up the leadership of the Minneapolis operation, and directed his team to withdraw 700 federal officers.   \"I learned that, maybe we can use a little bit of a softer touch,\" Trump said in an interview with NBC's Tom Llamas. \"But you still have to be tough. We're dealing with really hard criminals.\"   It's a bit unclear what a \"softer touch\" actually means.     Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt largely defended the administration's enforcement efforts Thursday and pointed to different polling - from a Harvard/Harris survey - that she said showed support for their \"deportation agenda.\"   \n   \"Nearly eight in ten Americans say criminal illegal aliens should be deported,\" she said. \"A solid majority also support deporting all illegal aliens, regardless of additional crimes.\"   She also said the administration is now prioritizing criminals who are in the country illegally.   Theresa Cardinal Brown, who worked on immigration policy under two presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said there may be an \"operational pause\" as the administration retools its efforts, both from a policy standpoint and a public relations standpoint.   \"Operationally, you're not really thinking about politics as you're putting together an operation, said Brown, now a member of the Council on National Security and Immigration. \"But politics comes into everything, right?\"   She points to the announcement that body cameras would be deployed to federal immigration officers in Minneapolis, noting that while video can uncover when officers are doing something wrong, body cameras can also vindicate officers when they have done the right thing.   \"I do think that probably the administration is thinking, 'well, if we had body cam footage of our own, we could put our own perspective on it,' \" she said.   Trump has a big incentive to get a handle on this crisis — and to do so quickly.   Conant, who previously worked on Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign, said Trump has left an opening for Democrats to sound more reasonable on immigration ahead of the midterms.   \"If he loses the immigration issue as a political winner, it's a real political problem,\" Conant said, \"not just for Trump, but Republicans more broadly.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR Political Correspondent Domenico Montanaro joins to discuss the Trump administration's engagement in foreign conflicts, as well as what a recent poll says about what where voters stand on several key issues, including immigration and the economy.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  We just heard, of course, from our colleague Jane Arraf on talks with Iran. The Trump administration's also involved in negotiations between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas. Is this level of involvement in foreign conflicts what President Trump campaigned on?DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: You know, a lot of people who voted for him thought that they were getting somebody who is less hawkish, who is not going to involve the United States overseas as much as he has, and his foreign policy actions have been unpopular of late. You know, he has just a 36% approval rating on foreign policy in our latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll that was out this week. A majority said that they think that a president should go through Congress before taking military action like he did in Venezuela, and almost 7 in 10 said that this idea of taking over Greenland is a bad one.SIMON: I have to ask. Thursday night, President Trump posted a racist meme of former President Obama and Michelle Obama. Republican Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, who is Black and chair of the Republican Senate campaign committee, said on X, it's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House. The president should remove it. Post was ultimately taken down, but it was up for 12 hours. And first, the White House press secretary called the criticism fake outrage. What does this say not just about American politics but America right now?MONTANARO: Well, you know, this was taken down after significant blowback, and Trump himself yesterday was asked about it and said he would not apologize. He said he, quote, \"didn't make a mistake\" because he only saw the beginning of the video. He was asked specifically about the depiction of the Obamas and whether he condemns it. He said, quote, \"of course, I do.\"You know, but most presidents would be mortified by something like this, profusely apologize if it would happen and, you know, hope it doesn't end their political careers if, in fact, it went the way that Trump is saying. But not Trump. You know, he shrugs these things off. His base points at those who are offended by this and dismisses them as too sensitive. You know, and this was what Trump's whole campaign was about a decade ago, essentially campaigning against the, quote, political correctness of polite society. And the fuel to Trump's politics has always been based on white grievance, so this is obviously not the first time that something like this has happened. Probably won't be the last, Scott.SIMON: Can we tell how potential voters feel?MONTANARO: Well, Republicans have shown that they're willing to stand by Trump no matter what, but his voting coalition has frayed significantly. You know, independents, Latinos and younger voters helped put Trump over the finish line in 2024. And our latest poll shows them moving heavily away from him on every issue, from foreign policy and the economy to immigration enforcement. You know, it's really just been a really bad month politically for Trump.SIMON: We heard a lot about the ballots being taken in Georgia a couple of weeks ago. What's the latest?MONTANARO: You know, it's remarkable to me that six years later, after all the lies that Trump has told about the 2020 election, that he's still obsessed with it, and I think we know why. Listen to what he had to say this week at, of all things, the National Prayer Breakfast.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They rigged the second election. I had to win it. Had to win it. I needed it for my own ego. I would've had a bad ego for the rest of my...(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: Now I really have a big ego, though.MONTANARO: Yeah - ego. He said it. You know, it's kind of what we've really known all along. He's needed an off-ramp from that loss, and he did lose. You know, audits, more than 60 court cases certainly prove that. So he's had to resort to chaos and confusion because he's still not over it, despite actually winning again in 2024. And we don't know what he's going to try to do with the Department of Justice in this 2026 midterm election. You know, we've heard him say that Republicans should take it over, that maybe it should be nationalized.SIMON: Yeah.MONTANARO: Of course, that's a really, really difficult thing to do because it's in the Constitution that the states run these elections, so that's not likely to happen. But what does he do with the Department of Justice, with immigration enforcement, potentially, in sending people to polling places, you know, potentially disenfranchising people? I think there's a lot of people really nervous about how this is all going to go down.SIMON: NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Thanks so much for being with us today.MONTANARO: You're welcome.

On Wednesday, Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck E. Schumer sent a letter to their GOP counterparts, House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, urging them to reform ICE. It included a list of several guardrails for federal agents — such as prohibiting masks and requiring that immigration enforcement officers wear body cameras to hold them accountable for their interactions with the public.   \n   It is unlikely that Johnson and Thune will agree to every demand. Many republicans say they will support some changes — like ICE agents wearing body cameras. But some GOP members draw the line at getting rid of masks. Republicans haven't completely shut down the overall proposal, yet, but they will have a short amount of time to negotiate these terms.

Iran wants the talks to focus on its nuclear program. The U.S. wants much more. NPR's Jane Arraf has been following this story and joins us from Amman. Jane, thanks for being with us.JANE ARRAF, BYLINE: Thank you.SIMON: What do we know about what happened at the talks?ARRAF: So this was an indirect meeting in Oman, in the capital Muscat. There was the U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.  They were communicating with Iran's foreign minister through Omani officials. Iran described the talks as lengthy and intensive. And the real importance of this was that the meeting took place at all because it's provided some breathing room in what has been a very tense situation in the region.  Trump had threatened military strikes. Iran had said, if that happened, it could spark regional war. Here's President Trump speaking to reporters on Air Force One last night.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We, likewise, had very good talks on Iran. Iran looks like it wants to make a deal very badly. We have to see what that deal is.ARRAF: He noted there are U.S. warships in the region and said the U.S. was in no rush regarding a deal. So that, too, has diffused some of the considerable tension.SIMON: And how has Iran responded?ARRAF: Well, Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said, following the six-hour meeting, that both sides wanted another round. He told Al Jazeera television today that there was no date set yet, but he thinks it should be soon. And asked about the prospect of war, he said Iran was ready for both peace and war.SIMON: The threat of military attack is not the only strategy the U.S. is using, is it?ARRAF: Totally true. Obviously, that military threat is the biggest one, but this week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told a Senate committee that the U.S. had engineered the latest financial crisis in Iran, which sparked widespread protests. He says they did it by creating a dollar shortage in the country.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SCOTT BESSENT: It came to a swift and, I would say, grand culmination in December. When one of the largest banks in Iran went under, the Iranian currency went into free fall. Inflation exploded. And hence, we have seen the Iranian people out on the street.ARRAF: So that financial crisis left many Iranians unable to afford food, and those protests morphed into anti-regime demonstrations. At least 5,000 people, most of them demonstrators, were believed to have been killed. And, Scott, on Friday, the U.S. levied new sanctions it says are aimed at supporting anti-government protesters. Those sanctions are against companies and people it says they are illegally trading Iranian oil. And the White House has threatened additional tariffs against any country trading with Iran.SIMON: Jane, President Trump has been clear he wants to see regime change in Iran. Is that a popular idea in the region, near as you can tell?ARRAF: It is very divided. Israel is very keen. Other countries are terrified of the consequences. I mean, let's face it, Iran is a powerful oil-rich, very complex country, and what they worry about is the chaos that would result if there were an unplanned change of regime. As for these talks, Iran is insisting they focus on its nuclear program. It says that program is for peaceful purposes. Now, the U.S. bombed Iran in December and insists it was developing nuclear weapons, but the U.N. nuclear watchdog says there's no evidence Iran was building a bomb.SIMON: NPR's Jane Arraf.

In a few minutes, we hear from one of the Democrats in those talks, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. We begin with the facts.FADEL: NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales has been following all this and joins us now. Good morning, Claudia.CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila.FADEL: OK. So Democrats have this new list expanding on specific reforms they want to see. What is new in these demands?GRISALES: Right. They released a 10-point plan for DHS immigration law enforcement agents in a letter to their GOP counterparts, part of a continuing response to the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis last month. And we heard Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries reiterate some of their past asks, such as the removal of masks for DHS immigration law enforcement agents, the mandatory use of body cameras and rules for the use of force. But now they also want these agents to wear identifying information, like their last name, and an end to what they call paramilitary police. And that is why they want standard uniforms and equipment, to bring them in line with civil enforcement. They also want expanded training, and they want officers removed from the job if they do use force for the duration of an investigation.FADEL: There's also big concerns about the warrants used in these deportation actions, right? What can you tell us about that?GRISALES: Yeah. They want to ensure that DHS officers are using judicial warrants instead of what's happening now, where DHS is using warrants written by agency officials. Democrats say judges should be signing off and that these administrative warrants risk violating people's Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures. They also want other basic rights protected, such as immediate access to legal representation for those who are taken into custody and charged. As part of all this, they want heightened oversight, such as allowing members to access detention facilities regardless of who funds them.FADEL: Are Republicans open to these demands?GRISALES: Well, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson are not clear they can get this done. There are some areas Republicans say they'll support - things like body cameras. But there are others that are flatly rejecting, for example, getting rid of masks. That's been a nonstarter for Republicans, who say that doing so would put agents at risk of being targeted. The Democrats argue this is how they're held accountable. So Republicans aren't shutting down the overall proposal as of yet, but there's still a lot of negotiating left to do and not a lot of time. And one option could be another stopgap bill that kicks the can down the road for a few more weeks.FADEL: OK. So it looks like there's openings for negotiation - not much time, like you said. But what if these talks end up breaking down entirely? What happens then?GRISALES: Well, as we know, Immigration and Customs Enforcement got a huge injection of cash last year with the partisan GOP plan they dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill. In fact, they got $75 billion, which makes them the government's largest law enforcement agency. So it wouldn't make much of a difference when it comes to ICE, which is the thing Democrats want to reform. But the rest of the agency would lose out. That includes the Coast Guard, the TSA, disaster response at FEMA. So both sides still, however, want to own this issue, and they want to take a winning message to voters in the midterms this year. So a lot of incentive there as well.FADEL: That's NPR's Claudia Grisales. Thanks, Claudia.GRISALES: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Scott Simon speaks to author Anne Applebaum about how the U.S. may be headed toward authoritarianism.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  Is the United States moving towards autocracy? Many people who study authoritarian regime say they see the seeds of that in President Trump's moves to control the Department of Justice and civil service, the deployment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents around the country and more. Anne Applebaum joins us now. She covered the fall of the Berlin Wall and communism across Eastern Europe and other shifts in history. She now writes for The Atlantic and hosts the podcast \"Autocracy In America\" and joins us now. Anne, thanks so much for being with us.ANNE APPLEBAUM: Oh, thanks for having me.SIMON: What do you think - what do you see happening in the United States today?APPLEBAUM: So I want to make it clear that the United States is not an authoritarian state right now. But what we see is a party in power that is seeking to end or curb the rule of law and to create a situation where we become, in effect, a one-party state. And the path that the Republican Party under Trump - and it's not really the Republican Party, it's the MAGA movement under Trump - is following is one that's very familiar and has been followed by other parties in other democracies, whether in Hungary or Turkey or Venezuela, in the past. And it starts, as you say, with firing civil service - civil servants, in our case, illegally, and replacing them with loyalists. So the Trump administration has asked Department of Justice officials and FBI officials to tell them as a form of knowing whether they can be promoted who won the 2020 election, and, of course, they're supposed to lie and say that Trump won. So they ask people - they put loyalty tests into the system.The control over universities, museums, the Kennedy Center, our cultural institutions, is a way of trying to redirect culture and change the way our understanding of history works. That's another classic move. The use of ICE and the creation of a kind of paramilitary that appears to be personally loyal to the president rather than subject to the rule of law. So they wear masks. They don't have to obey the law about searching and entering. They arrest people based on their race and not based on suspicion of having committed a crime. You know, the idea of a personalized, militarized force loyal only to the leader or to the ruling party.I mean, this is - these are signs that we know from other places. And then maybe the two most important are corruption, so the way in which the Trump administration, and especially people around Trump and his family, have accepted money from foreign governments and others in - seemingly in exchange for U.S. policy. So policies are now not being done in the name of Americans but in the name of the personal interests of people power. And then, of course, the elections, the conversation about nationalizing elections, the pressure on election officials and states. I mean, that seems to be the phase that we're in this year, and that will be the most important.SIMON: Is this just the government that Americans elected in 2024?APPLEBAUM: I don't know that all Americans voted for Donald Trump in order to end democracy. No. I mean, it seemed clear to me during the election campaign based on the kind of rhetoric that they were using and the way they talked about their political opponents that they saw themselves as a group who had a right to power and had no right to be challenged. But I don't know that everybody in America heard that or saw that. And our political system, our Constitution, does provide for opposition politics and different ideas, and I don't think most Americans are yet ready to end that.SIMON: There are still independent courts and only a slender majority in Congress that backs the president. Is that worth noting too?APPLEBAUM: Absolutely. No, no. Again - I state again, we're not talking about the U.S. being an authoritarian state. We're talking about a group in power who are pushing in that direction, who are following all - you know, it's following all - the path that others have taken in the past in order to establish a state. And I - you know, the purpose for them is to create a situation in which they can't lose an election, in which elections are a combination of the way elections are run and the way people are afraid of voting and the way civil service and government departments are oriented to do their bidding, that it just becomes very difficult...SIMON: Yeah.APPLEBAUM: ...For anybody else to win.SIMON: Isn't he - I mean, isn't that often the way of history? A party will come to power by winning an election, and then that's the last free election.APPLEBAUM: Very often, and very often in recent history. And it's not necessarily a right-wing or a left-wing phenomenon. As I said, Venezuela is a great example, you know, Viktor Orban's Hungary.SIMON: There's still plenty of public lampooning of the president. Isn't there still a free press, or do you have concerns about that too?APPLEBAUM: So clearly, there's still a free press 'cause you and I are having this conversation.SIMON: Yeah.APPLEBAUM: But, you know, there is enormous pressure on the press. There's pressure on the broadcasters, whose owners can be pressured by the government because of their different economic interests. We've just seen what happened to The Washington Post. There was a - you know, the owner of The Washington Post has big interests outside of the Post, and he's - he put pressure on the Post that has destroyed its reputation. And so you can see pressure on media - especially bigger media - happening. That doesn't mean, you know, we can't continue to speak. But it's important to look at what they're trying to do and the direction that they're going.SIMON: And I've left 30 seconds for this. Do you think the American people are grappling with this?APPLEBAUM: I think people are beginning to understand it, yes. I mean, I - I'm on the West Coast now. I was in - I was on the East Coast last week, and I hear - everywhere I go, I hear people expressing concern. I think the murders in Minnesota woke a lot of people up to the nature of this administration.SIMON: Anne Applebaum is a staff writer at The Atlantic and host of The Atlantic podcast \"Autocracy In America,\" which is out now. Thanks so much for being with us.APPLEBAUM: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Five and a half years later, that plan has come to fruition, despite vast public opposition.   Starting March 9, an unspecified number of federal employees could lose their current job protections and be converted into at-will employees at Trump's discretion. That's according to a final rule issued Friday by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the agency that handles many human resources functions for the federal government.   \n   Under current law, the civil service is meant to be apolitical, providing continuity for the government from one presidential administration to another. But over the past year, Trump has shown a willingness — and at times an eagerness — to fire those career federal employees whom he perceives as political opponents, such as rank-and-file Justice Department attorneys involved in Jan. 6 prosecutions.   The rule would make firing such staff much easier. Titled \"Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service,\" it allows for the president to move federal employees in \"policy-influencing\" roles into a new category of employees called Schedule Policy/Career. OPM previously estimated some 50,000 positions could be reclassified.   The rule explains that while federal agencies will review their workforces and ask OPM to recommend positions be moved, the president will make the final call on which positions are reclassified.   OPM received more than 40,000 comments during the public comment period — 94% of which opposed the rule. The administration chalked up a lot of the opposition to misunderstandings — of existing federal laws and of the intentions of the rule.   The Trump administration has argued that the change is a necessary step to make the bureaucracy more efficient and accountable, citing the widely held sentiment that it's too hard for the government to fire poor performers, as well as reports of federal employees \"slow walking\" or otherwise obstructing Trump's directives.   \n   The president's critics say the rule further allows Trump — and any future president — to politicize the civil service, and they warn of consequences for the American people.   \"Our government needs serious improvements to make it more effective and accountable, but one thing that doesn't need changing is the notion that it exists to serve the American people and not any individual president,\" said Max Stier, president of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service in a statement. \"This new designation can be used to remove expert career federal employees who place the law and service to the public ahead of blind loyalty and replace them with political supporters who will unquestioningly do the president's bidding.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Max Stier is the president of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service.\n                \n                    Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Maansi Srivastava for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Currently, around 4,000 political appointees within the federal government can be fired at will, a number Stier says is already far higher than in other democracies.   Unclear which positions or how many will be reclassified   It remains unclear which positions will be subject to reclassification. The rule applies to \"policy-influencing positions,\" which, according to the 255-page document, would include supervisors of individuals in such positions.   In the rule, OPM insists that \"the vast majority\" of those appointed under Schedule Policy/Career will still be protected from prohibited personnel practices including retaliation against whistleblowing. However, they will no longer be able to file complaints with the Merit Systems Protection Board, the federal agency that hears employee challenges to personnel actions. The Office of Special Counsel, which investigates whistleblower complaints, no longer operates independently since Trump's firing last year of the Senate-confirmed leader of that agency.   \n   While reclassified employees would theoretically retain the right to file discrimination complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the rule notes that the president himself is not subject to federal employment anti-discrimination laws.   Legal challenges ahead   The rule, which was first announced last year, already faces multiple lawsuits, including one filed by Democracy Forward. The legal organization has filed numerous lawsuits seeking to block the Trump administration's overhaul of the federal government.    \"This is a deliberate attempt to do through regulation what the law does not allow — strip public servants of their rights and make it easier to fire them for political reasons and harm the American people through doing so,\" said Skye Perryman, the group's president and CEO, in a statement. \"We have successfully fought this kind of power grab before, and we will fight this again.\"\n",

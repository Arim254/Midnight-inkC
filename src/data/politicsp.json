    "body": "\n      The latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll shows what Americans think of President Trump and his policies.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  A new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll out today shows Americans are largely opposed to the Trump administration's actions on everything from immigration enforcement to the economy and foreign policy. It's the latest of multiple polls that show similar results, putting President Trump and Republicans in a risky position for a midterm year. NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro is here in the studio to tell us about the results. Hi.DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey. Great to be with you.SUMMERS: Great to talk with you. Domenico, tell us, how bad exactly are these numbers for President Trump?MONTANARO: Well, just 39% say they approve of the job that Trump's doing overall, and it's been below 40% in our poll since November. I mean, just 36% approve of how he's handling foreign policy and the economy. It's a really difficult spot for any president.8And what really jumps out here, though, 51% say they strongly disapprove of the job that Trump is doing. That's tied for the worst score in the decade that Marist has been asking about strong approval and disapproval. The last time it was this high or this bad for Trump was in the days after the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.SUMMERS: And obviously, we've all seen the headlines dominated by immigration enforcement as well as the two U.S. citizens who were killed at the hands of federal agents. Do we know how much that might contribute to these numbers?MONTANARO: Yeah. I mean, it's obviously a big piece of this. Two-thirds in our survey say ICE has gone too far, which has jumped 11 points since last summer. But think about, you know, what's happened this past month. In addition to immigration enforcement, Trump unilaterally, without consulting Congress, had the military go into Venezuela and remove that country's president, Nicolás Maduro, from power. And he continually - Trump made threats about taking over Greenland - all of that very unpopular in our survey and lots of other surveys that we've seen as well.We saw a pretty clear political pattern emerge in this poll. Democrats and independents, heavily against all of those Trump moves. Only 30%, for example, of independents approve of the job that Trump's doing. Republicans, on the other hand, steadfastly sticking with him.SUMMERS: I'm going to focus on independents for a second. They were key to President Trump's reelection. So what does it mean for the president and his Republican Party to have independents seemingly sliding away from?MONTANARO: They're very important in swing districts, given how locked in members of both parties are. But Latinos and voters under 30 also voted for him in substantial numbers and were really big, important reasons for why he won, but he and his policies are really unpopular with them as well. So his voting coalition has really frayed here.Despite all that, we continue to see Republicans standing by Trump. Like I said, 85% of them approve of the job he's doing. Three-quarters of Republicans think ICE is making America safer. Even nearly 7 in 10 are in favor of taking over Greenland. And just to underscore, Republicans are the outlier here. It's really the opposite of what everyone else in the survey was telling us.SUMMERS: OK. Dig into that a little bit. What is going on there?MONTANARO: I asked our pollster from Marist, Lee Miringoff, about that, actually, and here's what he had to say.LEE MIRINGOFF: For those who are always thinking that, ah, this, you know, situation is really going to break loose the Republicans, his base is crumbling - reports of that tend to be overexaggerated based on very, very skimpy evidence.MONTANARO: Yeah. Lee thinks that what could move them is if Trump follows through on some of these big threats against Canada or moving into Greenland or if he doesn't back off of tariffs and prices skyrocket. You know, I guess that's possible, but we have to remember that it's a pretty high bar to move any of these voters. I mean, the economy was really never the reason Trump won in the first place. This really goes much deeper.I also spoke to Christopher Sebastian Parker. He's a political science professor at UC Santa Barbara. He's the author of a book about the Tea Party, \"Change They Can't Believe In.\" He went so far as to call Trump a, quote, \"messianic figure\" for many on the right who are upset over demographic change that's happening in the country.CHRISTOPHER SEBASTIAN PARKER: This is more about cultural - it's a perception of cultural threat. It's about him being the last thing standing between them and the rest of us. That's what this is about.MONTANARO: Yeah. It's been pretty clear for those of us who followed conservatives and the conservative movement leading up to Trump for a long time that it's always overwhelmingly been about culture.SUMMERS: Last thing, Domenico, what does this mean short term with the midterm elections coming up?MONTANARO: Yeah, Republicans are in a real bind. When Trump's not on the ballot, they have a hard time turning out conservatives. And with independents and Latinos being this heavily against Trump's policies right now, it puts them in a perilous position.SUMMERS: NPR's Domenico Montanaro, thanks so much.MONTANARO: You got it.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

WNYC's Mike Hayes discusses the special election for the House seat left open by now-Gov. Mikie Sherrill.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  One of the first congressional primaries of the year is being held today in New Jersey for a special election in a seat left open when Democrat Mikie Sherrill won her race to be the state's governor. While Sherrill won with a message focused on improving the cost of living, recent concerns among Democrats about ICE tactics have changed the dynamics in a Democratic primary race in a district that historically elects moderates. Here to walk us through why this race matters is WNYC's New Jersey politics reporter Mike Hayes. Good morning. Welcome to the program.MIKE HAYES, BYLINE: Good morning. Thanks for having me.FADEL: So, Mike, this is a primary in a safe, Democratic congressional district for a special election. So why are you watching it?HAYES: Yeah, here's why this race is uniquely interesting, Leila. So on the Democratic side, 11 candidates are running to replace Sherrill. So you have a diverse range of candidates across the party spectrum. And what this has set up is an interesting test to see what sort of Democrat voters are favoring at this moment, a progressive outsider or one of the more moderate establishment candidate.FADEL: OK, so tell us about some of the candidates.HAYES: There's Tom Malinowski, Brendan Gill and Tahesha Way, all well-known in New Jersey, strong fundraisers, particularly Malinowski. They're our top tier of establishment, middle-of-the-road Democrats, Leila. Now, challenging them, there's a crop of outsiders in this race trying to upend that establishment wing. And the candidate consolidating the most progressive support is longtime New Jersey labor activist Analilia Mejia. She's run to the left of the other candidates in this race and tried to use their political insider status against them. And she's got some heavy hitters backing her, Leila, most notably Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Elizabeth Warren.FADEL: So Mejia has a lot of progressive supporters. But as we said earlier, this is pretty traditionally a moderate district for Democrats. So does she have a chance of actually winning?HAYES: Yeah, if Mejia were to win Leila, it would definitely be an upset. This is a safe Democratic district, but you're right, it's a moderate district. Something else interesting to note here that speaks to that, before Mikie Sherrill won, this district was held by Republicans for three decades. A lone Republican is running in the GOP primary, but recent shifts in this district make it more favorable to the Democrats. However, we've seen a trend of late with progressives mounting effective challenges against establishment Democrats. Several outsider left-wing candidates won seats on the New Jersey state assembly this November.FADEL: Yeah.HAYES: And if you look to places like Maine, we see progressives running in races we are going to be watching come the midterms.FADEL: And we've seen some upsets before - right? - like New York City. Tell me about how ICE enforcement is factoring into this race.HAYES: Yeah, it's become a big factor here, Leila. Most of the candidates in the race have come out against more funding for ICE. However, Mejia has also taken a stronger stance when it comes to ICE. She says she wants to abolish the agency. Now, concerns over immigration enforcement tactics is something we've seen appear in races across the country after the fatal shootings in Minnesota. And as the results come in tonight, Leila, this will be one of the first times this year we learn if a far-left message on ICE is resonating with voters or if they prefer a more moderate approach.FADEL: That's WNYC's Mike Hayes. Thank you, Mike.HAYES: Thanks so much for having me.(SOUNDBITE OF 2ECOND CLASS CITIZEN SONG, \"ROLL ON\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The map comes in response to the redistricting push President Trump initiated trying to tilt the midterm elections toward Republicans.   Virginia's current delegation in the House of Representatives has six Democrats and five Republicans.   The map and accompanying legislation was posted on the legislature's website Thursday night and Democratic Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas confirmed it was the party's proposed map.   \"Donald Trump knows he's going to lose the midterms. He knows it. That's why he's started this mess in the first place,\" Lucas told reporters Thursday earlier. \"Today we are leveling the playing field. These are not ordinary times, and Virginia will not sit on the sidelines while it happens.\"   \n   But the proposal has more steps to go before it could be in place in time for the 2026 midterms. In addition to approval from the legislature, the redistricting also requires voter approval of an amendment to Virginia's constitution in a special election planned for April 21. Gov. Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat, has yet to approve the special election. She faces a deadline to act by 11:59 p.m. on Feb. 11.   Currently the state constitution gives redistricting power to a bipartisan commission. The amendment would let that commission be sidelined because other states have already redistricted for 2026 — outside the usual once-per-decade cycle.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Speaker of the Virginia House Don L. Scott listens to debate last month as lawmakers propose setting a special election on redistricting for April 21.\n                \n                    Shaban Athuman/VPM News\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Shaban Athuman/VPM News\n    \n\n   \n   The Democrats' redistricting effort is also facing a challenge in the courts. Last week, a circuit court judge in rural southwestern Virginia said the Democratic lawmakers had not followed the law in the amendment process.   Democrats appealed shortly thereafter claiming the Republicans were \"court shopping\" in finding a circuit judge who would rule their way. A Virginia appeals court asked the Supreme Court of Virginia to take up the case in a Wednesday filing.    Republican lawmakers have argued that Democrats' reasoning wasn't strong enough to justify changing the state constitution.   \"When I hear from my good friends on the other side of the aisle that, 'Hey, this is nothing but a little thing. We're just taking care of a little business because the guy across the river is a meanie,'\" Republican State Sen. Bill Stanley said as Democrats debated the legislation to set the referendum date. \"[When] we change the constitution, we do it very deliberately. And we do it for a reason because it requires it as we move forward for Virginia until the end of time.\"   \n   Republicans have a small edge so far in redistricting for 2026   Virginia is key in Democrats' effort to counter Trump's push to tip the scales in favor of Republicans in 2026.   Currently, the GOP has a majority in the U.S. House by just a few seats and holding onto that edge would be important for Trump's agenda and for staving off Democratic-led investigations into his administration for the last two years of his term.   Usually, states redistrict early in the decade after the census count comes in.   But in July, Trump got Texas Republicans to redistrict in a way that could net them five House seats now held by Democrats. Then California Democrats countered. Their map, approved by voters in a special election in November, could help them win five seats held by Republicans.   Missouri, Ohio, North Carolina have also redistricted in the GOP's favor.

The proposal, which is part of a regulatory filing for the test, comes months after President Trump — in the middle of a redistricting push for new voting maps that could help Republicans keep control of the U.S. House of Representatives — put out a call on social media for a \"new\" census that would, for the first time in U.S. history, exclude millions of people living in the country without legal status.   \n   In Congress, a growing number of Republican lawmakers are backing similar controversial proposals to leave out some or all non-U.S. citizens from a set of census numbers used to determine each state's share of congressional seats and Electoral College votes.   According to the 14th Amendment, those census apportionment counts must include the \"whole number of persons in each state.\"   And in federal court, multiple GOP-led states have filed lawsuits seeking to force the bureau to subtract from those counts residents without legal status and those with nonimmigrant visas, such as international college students and diplomats living in the United States. Missouri's case goes further by calling for their exclusion from all census counts, including those for distributing federal dollars for public services in local communities.   Results from the 2026 test are not expected to be used to redistribute political representation. Instead, the test is designed to inform preparations for the next once-a-decade head count in 2030, which include a report on the planned question topics that is due to Congress in 2027.   \n   The planned questionnaire for the test comes from an annual U.S. Census Bureau survey that is much longer than recent forms for the national tally. It's not clear why the bureau is using the American Community Survey to test methods for the census. Spokespeople for the bureau and its parent agency, the Commerce Department, did not immediately respond to NPR's requests for comment.   In addition to citizenship status, the form asks about people's sources of income, whether their home has a bathtub or shower, and whether the home is connected to a public sewer, among other questions.   \n   The form, however, does not reflect changes to racial and ethnic categories that the Biden administration approved for the 2030 census and other federal surveys, including new checkboxes for \"Middle Eastern or North African\" and \"Hispanic or Latino.\" A White House agency official said in December that the Trump administration is considering rolling back those changes.   On Monday, the bureau announced major cutbacks to the census test, which is now set to take place between April and September and involve around 155,000 households in Huntsville, Ala., and Spartanburg, S.C.   As with all surveys conducted by the bureau, federal law bans the agency from putting out information that would identify a person to anyone, including other federal agencies and law enforcement.   \n   Still, many census advocates are concerned the Trump administration's plan will discourage many historically undercounted populations, including households with immigrants and mixed-status families, from participating in the field test at a time of increased immigration enforcement and murky handling of government data.   Previous Census Bureau research has found that adding a citizenship question would likely undermine the count's accuracy by lowering response rates for many of the least-responsive populations.   During the first Trump administration, the U.S. Supreme Court blocked a citizenship question from being added to the 2020 census, while declining to rule on whether the president can carry out an unprecedented exclusion of people without legal status from apportionment counts.   In one of its new filings to the White House's Office of Management and Budget, the bureau says the form for this year's census test \"will ask no questions of a sensitive nature.\" Whether its proposed questions move forward is now for OMB to decide.

The winner of the Democratic primary will go on to face the lone Republican, Randolph Township Mayor Joe Hathaway, in the special general election in April.   Mikie Sherrill resigned from the seat shortly after she won the state's gubernatorial election last November.   The special primary contest is one of the first congressional primaries of the year where we will find out what issues are currently resonating with some Democratic voters. Here are some key things to know about the contest:   \n   1. A labor activist is seeking to upend the race    Analilia Mejia, director of the New Jersey Working Families Alliance, has been endorsed by several progressive groups and politicians including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Locally, she has received the endorsement of Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark, New Jersey's largest city.   \n   Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, campaigned alongside Mejia in January at an event at William Paterson University.   \"In a moment of rising authoritarianism, of economic insecurity, of state-sanctioned violence, any old blue just won't do,\" Meijia said at the event with Sanders. \"If you send weak sauce to Congress, we will get weak sauce back.\"   Meijia also called for ICE to be abolished at the event.   \"You can't reform that. It's not fixable,\" she said. \"Get it out. Kick it over. It is done. Forget it.\"   2. A former congressman, from another district, is aiming for a political comeback   Former Rep. Tom Malinowski, has the backing of New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim.   In a video, Kim said he cited Malinowski's experience among his reasons.   \"Tom Malinowski knows the House of Representatives. He knows Congress. He knows New Jersey,\" Kim said. \"He knows how to be able to stand up to Donald Trump, and that's what I need right now is someone there as a partner with me in the Capitol.\"   \n   Malinowski represented a neighboring congressional district for two terms. Redistricting made his district more Republican, which factored in his loss to Republican Rep. Tom Kean Jr. in 2022.   The fact that voters may already be familiar with his work as a former congressman is an important factor in this race, says Micah Rasmussen, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University.   \"With a short runway of a special election – name recognition, money, experience – all can matter,\" he said.   In addition to Malinowski and Mejia, other candidates on the ballot are: former Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way, Passaic County Commissioner John W. Bartlett, venture capitalist Zach Beecher, attorney and comedian J-L Cauvin, former Obama administration staffer Cammie Croft, Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill, Morris Township Deputy Mayor Jeff Grayzel, Chatham Borough Council member Justin Strickland and community advocate Anna Lee Williams.   3. Immigration is taking center stage    Following the fatal shootings of Nicole Macklin Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minnesota, immigration enforcement has become a focal point in the New Jersey contest. The special election primary will be one of the first races this year showing whether a far-left message on the future of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, is resonating with Democratic voters – or if they prefer a more moderate approach.   At a recent forum hosted by AAPI New Jersey, the 11 Democratic candidates ranged in their responses to ICE tactics, saying either that the powers of the agency need to be limited, or the agency should be abolished outright.    \"Budgets are supposed to be about values,\" said Way, adding that ICE is not being held true to the country's values. \"As a congresswoman, I will definitely look at this budget and, of course, be open to defund it.\"   Beecher said he would be a champion of \"getting rid of ICE.\"   \n   The forum also addressed affordability issues, which remains a concern among residents. It is an issue that Sherrill campaigned on during her run for governor, as New Jersey continues to be a state with a high cost of living.   4. There are regional implications tied to this election   The district includes many residents who commute regularly to New York.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Mikie Sherrill, then a congressional lawmaker running for New Jersey governor, speaks to commuters at a train station where she addressed the Gateway Tunnel Project on Oct. 30, 2025 in Westfield, N.J.\n                \n                    Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Rasmussen, at Rider University, said the winner of the general election in April will immediately have to address funding for the Gateway tunnel project. The $16 billion project includes the building of a new, two-tube rail tunnel beneath the Hudson River connecting New Jersey and Manhattan and rehabilitation of the North River Tunnel, which has been in service since 1910.   \n   Billions of federal dollars for the project were frozen by the Trump administration last October. A lawsuit against the administration was filed Tuesday.   \"It was one of the biggest priorities that was a hallmark of Mikie Sherrill's time in Congress,\" Rasmussen said. While in Congress, Sherrill helped secure federal funding for the project. \"There's a widespread perception that whoever fills Mikie Sherrill's seat, this is going to be front and center in their lap.\"   When Sherrill was elected to the seat in 2018, she flipped a district that had been reliably Republican for decades. Since new maps took effect in 2022 following redistricting, the district has become more Democratic.\n",

The EEOC sought the company's criteria for selecting employees for layoffs, how it tracks and uses worker race and ethnicity data, and information about programs which allegedly provided race-restricted mentoring, leadership, or career development opportunities, according to court documents.   In a statement, Nike said the company has worked to cooperate with the EEOC and the subpoena \"feels like a surprising and unusual escalation.\"   \n   \"We have shared thousands of pages of information and detailed written responses to the EEOC's inquiry and are in the process of providing additional information,\" Nike said in a statement sent to The Associated Press.\"   EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas has moved swiftly to target diversity and inclusion policies that she has long criticized as potentially discriminatory, tightly aligning the agency with one of President Donald Trump's top priorities.   Nike appears to be the highest profile company the EEOC has targeted with a publicly confirmed, formal anti-DEI investigation. In November, the EEOC issued a similar subpoena against financial services provider Northwestern Mutual.   \n   \"When there are compelling indications, including corporate admissions in extensive public materials, that an employer's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion-related programs may violate federal prohibitions against race discrimination or other forms of unlawful discrimination, the EEOC will take all necessary steps — including subpoena actions — to ensure the opportunity to fully and comprehensively investigate,\" Lucas said in a statement.   The disclosure comes two months after Lucas posted a social media call-out urging white men to come forward if they have experienced race or sex discrimination at work. The post urged eligible workers to reach out to the agency \"as soon as possible\" and referred users to the agency's fact sheet on DEI-related discrimination.   \n   The investigation against Nike, however, does not stem from any worker complaint against the company. Rather, Lucas filed her own complaint in May 2024 through a more rarely used tool known as a commissioner's charge, according to the court documents. Her charge came just months after America First Legal, a conservative legal group founded by top Trump adviser Stephen Miller, sent the EEOC a letter outlining complaints against Nike and urging the agency to file a commissioner's charge.   America First Legal has flooded the EEOC with similar letters in recent years urging investigations into the DEI practices of major U.S. companies. It is unclear how many other companies the EEOC may be targeting through such commissioner's charges. The EEOC is prohibited from revealing any charge — by workers or commissioners — unless it results in fines, settlements, legal action or other such public actions.   Lucas' charge, according to court filings, was based on Nike's publicly shared information about its commitment to diversity, including statements from executives and proxy statements. The charge, for example, cited Nike's publicly stated goal in 2021 of achieving 35% representation of racial and ethnic minorities in its corporate workforce by 2025.   \n   Many U.S. companies made similar commitments in the wake of the widespread 2020 racial justice protests that followed the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man. Companies have said such commitments are not quotas but rather goals they hoped to achieve through methods such as widening recruitment efforts and rooting out any bias during hiring process.   Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, employers are prohibited from using race as a criteria for hiring or other employment decisions. Lucas has long warned that many companies risk crossing that line through DEI efforts that would pressure managers to make race-based decisions.   In its statement, Nike said it follows \"all applicable laws, including those that prohibit discrimination. We believe our programs and practices are consistent with those obligations and take these matters seriously.\"\n",

On the heels of two fatal shootings of U.S. citizens in Minnesota at the hands of federal immigration agents, 65% of Americans said Immigration and Customs Enforcement has \"gone too far,\" according to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll. And President Trump is facing the highest intensity of disapproval since just after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.   The percentage of those saying ICE has gone too far in enforcing immigration laws is an 11-point increase since last summer. It's driven by independents and Democrats; both groups went up by double-digits.   \n   Trump's overall approval rating remains low at 39%, with 56% disapproving, and a whopping 51% strongly disapproving. That's the highest Marist has seen in its polling since it started asking how strongly respondents approve or disapprove of presidents dating back to 2017.   \"The thing in the numbers that we've been experiencing is the shift among some of the folks who voted for him — his voting coalition — not necessarily the governing support he has, but his voting coalition,\" said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion.   \n   That coalition included younger people, Latinos and independents, all of whom Trump is struggling with in this survey.   \"Right now, those groups — they're the ones who deserted,\" Miringoff added.   Trump's base, on the other hand, is sticking with him on a range of policies that are otherwise unpopular, from ICE's conduct and the job Trump is doing, to tariffs, the need to consult with Congress before taking military action and even whether the United States should take control of Greenland.   On Greenland, for example, almost 7 in 10 Republicans said they supported taking control of the Arctic Danish territory, while overwhelming numbers of independents and Democrats opposed such a move.   \"For those who are always thinking that, 'Ah! This situation is really going to break loose the Republicans; his base is crumbling,' \" Miringoff said, \"reports of that tend to be overexaggerating and based on very, very skimpy evidence.\"   \n   And despite all of the attention on immigration enforcement, as well as Trump's action in Venezuela and threats to invade Greenland in recent weeks, a majority of voters continue to say, by wide margins, that the Trump administration's focus should be on lowering prices.   \n   Americans largely disapprove of ICE   After two Americans were killed in Minnesota and the uproar that followed, the Trump administration reassigned Greg Bovino, the man who had been in charge of the enforcement operations. On Wednesday, White House border czar Tom Homan, who took over the Minnesota operation, said he was drawing down 700 federal agents in the state.   When asked in an interview with NBC News what he learned from the situation in Minneapolis, Trump said, \"I learned that maybe we can use a little bit of a softer touch. But you still have to be tough. These are criminals. You're dealing with really hard criminals.\"   \n   Neither of the U.S. citizens killed by federal agents — Renee Macklin Good or Alex Pretti — fit Trump's description, but the shift in tone is notable.   There's good reason for it: Public opinion is not on the Trump administration's side. In addition to the two-thirds who said ICE has gone too far, 6 in 10 also said they disapprove of the job ICE is doing overall, and almost the same number think the agency is making Americans less safe.   When it comes to the mass protests against ICE, by a 59%-to-40% margin, more said the demonstrations are mostly legitimate as opposed to people acting unlawfully.    Loading... \n   Republicans marginally increased in saying ICE has gone too far, but they largely remained steady in their support of ICE. Almost three-quarters said they approve of the job ICE is doing, 77% said the agency is making Americans safer, and about three-quarters said the way it is going about enforcement is either \"about right\" (45%) or \"not far enough\" (28%). Three-quarters of Republicans also see the protesters as acting mostly unlawfully.   Trump's job approvals remain low, from the economy to foreign policy   The president's overall job approval rating is just 39%. His approval rating in the Marist poll has now been below 40% since November and is consistent with polling averages also showing a decline.   He is also underwater on how he's handling the economy and foreign policy — 59% disapprove of the president on the economy and 56% disapprove on foreign policy.   \n   Trump's tariffs clearly continue to hurt him. By a 56%-to-31% margin, more people say they hurt rather than help the economy.   On foreign policy, two-thirds oppose the possibility of taking control of Greenland; two-thirds said the U.S. benefits from its relationship with NATO, and 56% of respondents have a favorable view of the alliance; and 72% believe the president should have to consult with Congress before taking military action.   Republicans continue to steadfastly support Trump's policies, but he's lost ground with voters who helped him win in 2024   Trump made it over the finish line in the last presidential election with the help of independents, Latinos and young voters, but this and other surveys show that coalition has frayed.   \n   In this poll, just 30% of independents approve of the job he's doing overall. Almost two-thirds disapprove, 56% strongly so; two-thirds disapprove of how he's handling the economy and nearly 6 in 10 think lowering prices should be the Trump administration's top priority.   \n   In fact, on every single question asked, independents aligned with Democrats — often overwhelmingly.   Trump won a record share of Latinos for a Republican presidential candidate, and as has been the case for months, they have slid heavily away from him. Just 38% of Latinos approve of the job he's doing; 60% disapprove of his handling of the economy and a plurality said lowering prices should be the administration's top priority; 61% disapprove of how ICE is doing its job and 70% think the agency has gone too far.   Trump's base, however, shows no signs of cracks and are outliers in nearly every question. For example:   85% approve of the job Trump's doing; 80% approve of how he's handling the economy; 77% approve of how he's handling foreign policy; 77% think ICE is making Americans safe, including 52% who say \"much more safe,\" whereas 56% of independents and 80% of Democrats say \"much less safe\"; 75% said demonstrators are people acting mostly unlawfully; 66% think tariffs are helping the economy; 58% don't think the president needs to consult with Congress before taking military action; andwhile Democrats and independents said lowering prices should be the administration's No. 1 priority, a plurality of Republicans (44%) said it should be immigration.\n",

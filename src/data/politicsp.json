According to a review of deaths by NPR, at least 20 people have died in ICE custody so far this year. The number comes as ICE is also holding nearly 60,000 people in immigration detention, the highest number in several years.    Loading...\n   Deaths reached a peak in 2025 for the first time since 32 deaths were recorded in 2004, and 20 deaths were recorded in 2005.   Former agency officials are warning that increased detention population, decreased oversight, an increase in street and community arrests and continued difficulties staffing medical teams will result in more deaths. This summer, ICE received about $70 billion to hire more staff, including deportation and detention officers, and increase its detention space. Across the country, media and immigration advocates have reported overcrowding, unsanitary conditions and issues with food and health care access — a byproduct of a rapid scaling-up of immigration arrests.   \"Can staffing actually keep pace with the increase in population? And that becomes particularly challenging in more remote locations where it was already difficult to find qualified staff willing to come out and work,\" said Peter Mina, who worked at ICE for nearly a decade including most recently as the deputy officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. \"And that just places risk all across the system, including, unfortunately, individuals in detention facing medical conditions that might result in their death.\"   \n   ICE did not respond to an immediate request for comment on the count.   Mina's former office at DHS was among those that would conduct investigations following a detainee death. Additional investigations were conducted by the ICE Health Services Corps and the Immigration Office of Detention Oversight. CRCL was among the oversight offices at the department that saw hundreds of staff cuts earlier this year. Other CRCL employees have previously told NPR that the gutting of their office could result in more deaths in custody.   During the ongoing government shutdown, DHS has confirmed, the Office of Detention Oversight is not working.   So far this month, two more detainees have died in custody. Medical conditions surrounding deaths over the last calendar year have included tuberculosis, strokes, respiratory failure and about three possible suicides. Each preliminary report includes a synopsis of the detainees' immigration and criminal histories, as they have for past administrations, as well as the events leading to the time of death.   One reason for the rise in deaths, former employees said, is that there are just simply more people in detention.   \n   \"With that kind of spike in population, there's going to be a need for additional staffing both on the medical and mental health side, as well as even from an officer standpoint,\" Mina said.   The types of arrests being made by federal immigration officers this year are different, too. Claire Trickler-McNulty, a former ICE official who worked under former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, said that previously most of the agency's detainees either came from the border or from local law enforcement custody.   \n   In these cases, she said, those coming from the border tended to be younger and healthier; or health care records were generally established for those who had been previously detained in prisons or jails.   \"Whereas when you pick somebody up on the street, it's a lot of unknowns. Do they have chronic medical conditions they're not even aware of? Do they have addiction issues?\" McNulty said. \"The systems and triaging and maybe even the resources to really appropriately care for people when taking in such a varied population probably should increase.\"   Since the early months of the administration, officials have touted focusing their arrests in the \"interior\" of the country, as numbers of crossings at the southern border have steadily decreased.   DHS Spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told NPR in a statement that detainees receive medical, dental and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility and access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care.   \"With all these healthcare services and access to medical care ICE provides illegal aliens in detention, it should come as no surprise to the media that as we expand detention space, we need to hire more medical professionals,\" McLaughlin said.   \n   But both Mina and McNulty said that hiring medical staff at immigration detention facilities has long been a challenge for the agency. According to a review of detainee deaths since 2004, three detention facilities have held the most deaths: Eloy Federal Contract facility just outside Phoenix; Krome Services Processing Center in Florida; and Stewart Detention Center in Georgia.   A 2021 DHS Office of Inspector General report identified \"remote locations, a cumbersome hiring process, and competing opportunities\" among the challenges to retaining and recruiting medical staff. The Eloy and Stewart facilities were specifically mentioned as among those experiencing these difficulties.   \n   DHS has begun a process to hire more medical professionals including nurses and pharmacists as it expands its hiring across ICE, including deportation officers and detention personnel.   \"ICE is actively recruiting healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, psychiatrists, pharmacists, and health administrators, to support the expanded detention capacity enabled by the historic funding provided under President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill,\" McLaughlin told NPR in a statement.   \n   \"Just like with the general population, unfortunately, people will die over a period of time for any series of medical ailments,\" Mina, former deputy officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties at ICE, said. \"But the real question is: In a given case, were there circumstances or actions taken or not taken that suggest that that death may have been preventable?\"\n",

Here, a post office in Montclair, Calif., is seen last year.\n                \n                    Mario Tama/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mario Tama/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Changes at the U.S. Postal Service are forcing people who rely on postmarks when voting, filing taxes or mailing legal documents to be extra careful when cutting it close to deadlines.   Postmarks include the dates that USPS stamps on envelopes, and those are often used to determine whether a piece of first-class mail was sent on time.   But the Postal Service has proposed revising its mailing standards to say that postmark date \"does not inherently or necessarily align\" with the date that a mail piece was first accepted by a letter carrier or dropped off at a post office or collection box.   \n   \"In other words, the date on a machine-applied postmark may reflect the date on which the mailpiece was first accepted by the Postal Service, but that is not definitively the case,\" USPS said in a recent Federal Register notice.   \n   USPS hasn't changed how it applies postmarks. What has changed is that, as the mail agency continues its controversial reorganization plan, more parts of the country may not get their first-class mail processed until the day after it's collected by USPS.   That's largely because the agency has reduced how often it picks up mail in certain areas more than 50 miles away from one of its new regional processing and distribution centers. The change, USPS says, \"saves money, reduces carbon emissions, and benefits processing operations\" at a time when fewer people and businesses are sending first-class mail compared to decades ago.   Still, in California, which is holding a special election for a closely watched ballot proposition on congressional redistricting, the USPS notice about postmarks has prompted state officials to urge eligible mail-in voters to drop off their ballots before Nov. 4.   \"If you want your vote to count, which I assume you do because you're putting it in the mail, don't put it in the mail on Election Day\" if you're more than 50 miles from a USPS regional processing facility, California Attorney General Rob Bonta advised during a press conference this month, noting that a voter could consider turning in their ballot at an official vote center or drop box instead.   \n   To avoid the risk of your mail not getting a postmark on the same day it's dropped off, USPS recommends stopping by a post office.   \"If a customer — in any community, no matter where it is located — wants to ensure that their ballot or other mailpiece receives a postmark containing a date that aligns with the date it is mailed, the customer should visit a Postal Service retail location and request a manual postmark at the counter in person. It will be provided free of charge,\" USPS spokesperson Cathy Koeppen Purcell says in a statement.   \n   It's advice the agency has tried to emphasize during past voting seasons, when it reminds absentee voters that USPS does not automatically postmark every piece of mail.   However, for those who don't have easy access to a USPS facility, including residents of rural communities and people with disabilities, getting to a post office for a postmark can be a challenge.   And for some mail-in voters, it can be another barrier to the ballot box as more states change election rules to move up deadlines and no longer count absentee ballots postmarked by, but arriving after, Election Day.\n",

The sanctions against oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil followed months of calls from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as well as bipartisan pressure on Trump to hit Russia with harder sanctions on its oil industry, the economic engine that has allowed Russia to continue to execute the grinding conflict even as it finds itself largely internationally isolated.   \"Hopefully he'll become reasonable,\" Trump said of Putin not long after the Treasury Department announced the sanctions against Russia's two biggest oil companies and their subsidiaries. \"And hopefully Zelenskyy will be reasonable, too. You know, it takes two to tango, as they say.\"   \n   The U.S. administration announced the sanctions as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte was in Washington for talks with Trump. The military alliance has been coordinating deliveries of weapons to Ukraine, many of them purchased from the United States by Canada and European countries.   Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the new sanctions were a direct response to Moscow's refusal to end its \"senseless war\" and an attempt to choke off \"the Kremlin's war machine.\"   \n   Bessent added that the Treasury Department was prepared to take further action if necessary to support Trump's effort to end the war. \"We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions.\"   The announcement came after Russian drones and missiles blasted sites across Ukraine, killing at least six people, including a woman and her two young daughters.   The attack came in waves from Tuesday night into Wednesday and targeted at least eight Ukrainian cities, as well as a village in the region of the capital, Kyiv, where a strike set fire to a house in which the mother and her 6-month-old and 12-year-old daughters were staying, regional head Mykola Kalashnyk said.   At least 29 people, including five children, were wounded in Kyiv, which appeared to be the main target, authorities said.   \n   Russian drones also hit a kindergarten in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, later Wednesday when children were in the building, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. One person was killed and six were hurt, but no children were physically harmed, he said.   Rutte, in his Oval Office appearance, went out of his way to underscore that the weaponry the U.S. is selling Europe to provide to Ukraine has been essential to helping stop many attacks like the one that ravaged the kindergarten.   \"We need to make sure that the air defense systems are in place, and we need the U.S. systems to do that, and the Europeans are paying for that,\" Rutte said. \"It is exactly the type of actions we needed, and the President is doing that and trying everything to get this work done.\"   Zelenskyy said many of the children were in shock. He said the attack targeted 10 separate regions: Kyiv, Odesa, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovohrad, Poltava, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhzhia, Cherkasy and Sumy.   Peace efforts stall   Trump's efforts to end the war that started with Russia's all-out invasion of its neighbor more than three years ago have failed to gain traction. Trump has repeatedly expressed frustration with Putin's refusal to budge from his conditions for a settlement after Ukraine offered a ceasefire and direct peace talks.   Trump said Tuesday that his plan for a swift meeting with Putin was on hold because he didn't want it to be a \"waste of time.\" European leaders accused Putin of stalling.   \n   Meanwhile, in what appeared to be a public reminder of Russian atomic arsenals, Putin on Wednesday directed drills of the country's strategic nuclear forces.   Zelenskyy urged the European Union, the United States and the Group of Seven industrialized nations to force Russia to the negotiating table. Pressure can be applied on Moscow \"only through sanctions, long-range (missile) capabilities and coordinated diplomacy among all our partners,\" he said.   More international economic sanctions on Russia are likely to be discussed Thursday at an EU summit in Brussels. On Friday, a meeting of the Coalition of the Willing — a group of 35 countries that support Ukraine — is to take place in London.   \n   Zelenskyy credited Trump's remarks that he was considering supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine for Putin's willingness to meet. The American president later said he was wary of tapping into the U.S. supply of Tomahawks over concerns about available stocks.   Russia has not made significant progress on the battlefield, where a war of attrition has taken a high toll on Russian infantry and Ukraine is short of manpower, military analysts say. Both sides have invested in long-range strike capabilities to hit rear areas.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                In this photo provided by the Ukrainian Emergency Service, rescuers evacuate children after Russian drones hit a city kindergarten during an attack in Kharkiv, Ukraine, Wednesday, Oct. 22, 2025.\n                \n                    AP/Ukrainian Emergency Service\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        AP/Ukrainian Emergency Service\n    \n\n   \n   Ukraine says it hit key Russian chemical plant   The Ukrainian army's general staff said its forces struck a chemical plant Tuesday night in Russia's Bryansk region using British-made air-launched Storm Shadow missiles. The plant is an important part of the Russian military and industrial complex, producing gunpowder, explosives, missile fuel and ammunition, it said.   Russian officials in the region confirmed an attack but did not mention the plant.   Ukraine also claimed overnight strikes on the Saransk mechanical plant in Mordovia, Russia, which produces components for ammunition and mines, and the Makhachkala oil refinery in the Dagestan republic of Russia.   The Russian Defense Ministry said its air defenses downed 33 Ukrainian drones over several regions overnight, including the area around St. Petersburg. Eight airports temporarily suspended flights because of the attacks.   In other developments, Zelenskyy arrived Wednesday in Oslo, Norway, and after that flew to Stockholm, where he and Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson signed an agreement exploring the possibility of Ukraine buying up to 150 Swedish-made Gripen fighter jets over the next decade or more. Ukraine has already received American-made F-16s and French Mirages.   Trump says Russia is on the agenda for upcoming Xi talks   The U.S. president is expected to meet next week with Chinese President Xi Jinping when the two leaders travel to South Korea for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit.   \n   Beijing has not provided Russia with direct support in the war, but has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow in turn is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry for use in its war against Ukraine, according to a U.S. assessment.   Trump has said he believes the Russia-Ukraine war would end if all NATO countries stopped buying oil from Russia and placed tariffs on China of 50% to 100% for its purchases of Russian petroleum.   \"I think he could have a big influence on Putin,\" Trump said of Xi Jinping.   Beijing has yet to confirm that Trump and Xi will meet.\n",

At the heart of both challenges is whether or not to defer to the president's assessment that major cities in both places — Portland and Chicago — are lawless and in need of immediate military intervention to protect federal property and immigration officers, despite local leaders and law enforcement saying otherwise. Both deployments were done against the wishes of Democratic state governors, and were quickly temporarily blocked by district courts.   \n   On Monday, a divided panel on the 9th Circuit court of appeals overturned a temporary restraining order put in place by a federal judge in Portland, siding with the Trump administration, however another temporary restraining order remains in place.   That ruling came days after the 7th Circuit court of appeals upheld a similar block from a federal judge in Illinois on the deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago. The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to intervene.   Movement in both cases is expected in the coming days, in what has been a dizzying pingpong of legal disputes around Trump's use of the military domestically in several Democratic-led cities  around the country. And while any decision will only impact troop deployment in an individual state, they could impact how courts weigh in on such cases going forward — and embolden the administration, legal experts say.   \"This could be a pretty seminal week in terms of the bigger legal fight over domestic deployments,\" says Scott R. Anderson, a fellow at the non-partisan Brookings Institution and senior editor of Lawfare.   The 9th Circuit and Portland, Ore.    The 9th Circuit's decision earlier this week only applies to one of the two temporary restraining orders that U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut issued this month to block the National Guard deployments — meaning that troops can still not be on the streets in Portland. But the federal government has asked Immergut to remove her second temporary order. A court hearing has been scheduled for Friday to discuss the dissolution of that order.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Karin J. Immergut, nominated to be U.S. district judge for the District of Oregon, attends a judicial nomination hearing held by the Senate Judiciary Committee October 24, 2018 in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Win McNamee/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   The 9th Circuit is also deciding whether or not to revisit the ruling made earlier this week with a larger group of judges — and that decision could come before Immergut's deadline.   Trump has said that the 9th Circuit decision has made him feel empowered to send the National Guard to any city where he deems it necessary.   \"That was the decision. I can send the National Guard if I see problems,\" Trump told reporters Tuesday. In recent days, Trump has renewed an interest in sending troops to San Francisco.   \n   Justin Levitt, a law professor at Loyola Marymount University Loyola Law School and an expert in constitutional law, worries the ruling by the 9th Circuit \"authorized blindness to facts.\"   \"It said [Trump] can decide that there's a war when there's nothing but bluebirds,\" he says, noting that's likely why an immediate call for a full review was made. \"I fully expect a larger group of 9th Circuit judges to say we don't have to be blind to what's actually going on in order to give ample deference to the Trump administration.\"   The Supreme Court and Chicago   At the same time, the Trump administration has issued an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court on whether National Guard troops can be deployed in Illinois, after the 7th Circuit court of appeals upheld a district court's block.   It's unknown when, or if, the Supreme Court will issue a decision, although experts expect it in the coming days as well.   The decision, although not precedent-setting, will likely clarify the president's power to deploy federal military resources — and how deferential the courts should be to his administration's presentation of facts — but only to a point. Emergency decisions are usually short, without much reasoning provided by the justices, experts say.   \"It ends up kind of putting the onus on district and appellate courts to read the tea leaves of those interim orders to inform these much larger questions in very different factual environments, you know, possibly months in the future,\" says Chris Mirasola, a national security law professor at the University of Houston Law Center.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                National Guard troops arrive at an immigration processing and detention facility on October 09, 2025 in Broadview, Illinois.\n                \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Scott Olson/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   He says that while the emergency decisions from the Supreme Court don't apply broadly, in recent months, some judges have started to treat them as if they do.   \"I think what we're going to get in at least the medium term is even more confusion than we've had so far,\" he says.   \n   But just how the Supreme Court might weigh in isn't clear.   \"I think it's a harder case for the Supreme Court than some people might think, who go in with the assumption the Supreme Court is just naturally inclined toward the administration's positions on things — and it is in many contexts,\" says Anderson of the Brookings Institution.   He says that while it's standard for courts to be deferential to the president, it's also standard to believe the facts presented by the local courts.   \"That is a tricky, tricky sort of situation here,\" Anderson says.   What could this mean for possible deployments going forward?   These two expected decisions will only directly affect Portland or Chicago. But the implications of both – especially something from the Supreme Court – could have ripple effects in future litigation.   Elizabeth Goitein, senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, says that what's particularly worrying is that the Department of Justice has been expressly celebrating high arrest counts by law enforcement in places like Chicago, while still saying the military is necessary to help.   \"If the bar is so low that the President can use the military at a time when his administration is touting how effective civilian law enforcement is, it becomes hard to imagine a scenario where he couldn't deploy the military,\" she says.   Experts say that these legal challenges are just the beginning of what will surely be a long and winding road through the U.S. court system.   \"This is really just the first battle. There are a lot of legal questions that come after this,\" Anderson says.\n",

    "body": "\n      The assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk has reanimated claims that the left is increasingly responsible for terrorist activity in the U.S. But the data paints a more complicated picture.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  For many years, the far right has been the most lethal and persistent source of domestic terrorism in the U.S., but a new study says violence from the far left has been the greater threat, at least so far this year. NPR domestic extremism correspondent Odette Yousef looks into this claim.ODETTE YOUSEF, BYLINE: President Trump's insistence that the far left has been the primary culprit for domestic terrorism goes back years at this point.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: 'Cause this is not a right-wing problem.JOE BIDEN: His own FBI director said...TRUMP: This is a left-wing problem.BIDEN: ...The threat comes from white supremacists.YOUSEF: That was a 2020 presidential debate when Trump was asked if he would condemn far-right extremist groups. It was also just days after his acting head at the Department of Homeland Security told congressmen that white supremacist extremists were responsible for the most lethal extremist violence. Still, five years later, there is a sense that something is shifting. The nation has seen the killing of Charlie Kirk, the apparent attempted assassinations of Trump, the gunning down of a health insurance executive in New York and more. These events are not clearly coded as right-wing. And so has the violence, in fact, pivoted to the left?DANIEL BYMAN: My hope was to bring some data to the discussion.YOUSEF: Daniel Byman is director of the Warfare, Irregular Threats and Terrorism Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, or CSIS. Data on domestic terrorism is surprisingly hard to come by. There is no public, official, unified and comprehensive database, so researchers like Byman are assembling databases on their own. He looked at incidents between 1994 and July 4 of 2025.BYMAN: We're seeing, you know, from a low baseline, an increase in left-wing attacks, and we're seeing a decrease in right-wing attacks from much higher numbers.YOUSEF: Byman and his co-author found something remarkable. Their tally showed that in the first half of 2025, far-left terrorist activity had overtaken that from the far right. It's a departure from the pattern of the last 30 years. News outlets ran with that headline. But among many professionals in Byman's field, the surprise has been for a different reason.AMY COOTER: Five is a really low case number to try to make any kinds of inference from and try to say that we're having a major increase in any kind of problem.YOUSEF: Amy Cooter is deputy director at the Institute for Countering Digital Extremism. Five is the number of far-left terrorist plots and incidents that Byman's study tallied during the first half of 2025. It's a small number, but it's bigger than previous time periods, and Cooter says that is exactly what can distort conclusions.COOTER: Compared to historical data, almost any increase in left-wing violence is going to look like a big jump.YOUSEF: Byman acknowledges this. Still, he says the trends are what matter. But Jacob Ware, a research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, says there are more questions.JACOB WARE: There have been methodological concerns that have been aired with that product.YOUSEF: This is where the real mess starts. There are a host of subjective calls when it comes to analyzing domestic terrorism. How destructive was the crime? Did people die? Was that by intent? If not, could people have gotten hurt? What was the perpetrator's politics or ideology? Did that motivate the violence? How much fear did the act create? And to what extent did mental health issues factor into the attack? And so some incidents that the CSIS study included and left out have been disputed. Again, Jacob Ware.WARE: Early this year, for example, there were a number of fire bombings at Tesla stores or other Tesla infrastructure. To me, that might qualify as an act of terrorism if somebody is using incendiary devices against civilian targets for political purposes. Those don't seem to be counted.YOUSEF: But the study does count the burning of 11 NYPD squad cars among its five left-wing terrorist incidents of 2025. Ware says that one wouldn't make his cut. Another instance that raises questions involved an individual arrested by U.S. Capitol Police earlier this year for allegedly plotting to kill Trump cabinet members. The individual reportedly turned herself in to law enforcement before following through. Should that count? Some might say no, but this study included it. What about the killings of two Israeli embassy staffers in May? Those are left off this list. Byman says he understands if others arrive at different conclusions on these, as he calls them, edge cases, but 2 or 3 out of 5 can change whether there is, in fact, a trend.Taking a step back, researchers in this field largely agree that something is shifting. Political violence has increased. There is concern that more may be coming from the left, though many told NPR it's just too early still to know. For Jacob Ware, the left/right framework isn't the best way to understand the change.WARE: Terrorism is getting more personal.YOUSEF: Whether it's the killings of a health care CEO, a Minnesota state lawmaker, Charlie Kirk, Israeli embassy staffers, the arson at the Pennsylvania governor's mansion, attempted assassinations of Trump, Ware says this is different from the past. Historically, domestic terrorists in the U.S. have sought a large body count. But in recent cases, Ware says perpetrators or suspects haven't done that even in situations where they could have killed more people. And he says the question of whether their violence stemmed from far-left or far-right tendencies is, more often than not, unclear.WARE: We really need to get statements or justifications, motivations from perpetrators. And I don't think we have that in the Charlie Kirk assassination or the Minnesota assassination, and so I would argue there's a world in which neither of those people should be coded as terrorists. I mean, they're clearly assassins, but I just don't think we have the information yet that would allow us to code them as terrorists.YOUSEF: Ideally, a data-based understanding of who is committing domestic terrorism, how and against whom would help law enforcement allocate resources toward the greatest threats. But as the Trump administration continues to ramp up its efforts against its political opposition, Ware and Byman both say any data are unlikely to shift that agenda.

    "body": "\n      President Trump's expansive interpretation of executive power is continuing to reshape federal spending in a government shutdown.   \n\n    ADRIAN FLORIDO, HOST:  President Trump has a broad interpretation of executive authority. In just the last week, his administration has ramped up military strikes on what the president says are drug boats. And it's paid some federal workers by shifting money around without congressional authorization, perhaps the legislature's most fundamental duty. It's all raising questions, even among some Republicans, about Congress' role under Trump. Joining us now is NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales. Hi, Claudia.CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Hi, Adrian.FLORIDO: I want to start, Claudia, with just a basic question, which is, what is the relationship between the White House and Congress supposed to be like?GRISALES: Right. With coequal branches of government, we should see Congress weigh in on these decisions, such as when to use military force, or at least oversight. Lawmakers should have full control over how the government spends money, as outlined in the Constitution. Instead, we're seeing Trump unilaterally lead strikes on these alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and issue paychecks to some federal workers when a shutdown means no payment should go out. I talked to professor Stephen Vladeck of Georgetown University about how he would characterize this moment for Congress.STEPHEN VLADECK: I think we've seen a radical collapse of congressional power.GRISALES: And we're also seeing Democrats speak out. They've been raising concerns about these moves on a daily basis.FLORIDO: But what about Republican leaders, Claudia? Are they concerned?GRISALES: No, many defend the president. I talked to Senate Majority Leader John Thune about this, specifically on appropriations. Here's how he responded.JOHN THUNE: I mean, we have the power of the purse, obviously. Everybody's waiting for the government to be opened up. Congress has to do that.GRISALES: But he says Trump is helping alleviate some of the pain of a shutdown for federal workers.THUNE: There are things they can do. They're moving money around. They're doing things that any administration has done in the past to try and keep people, as many people as possible, getting paid.GRISALES: So he's trying to say Congress still retains its power of the purse, but they're OK letting Trump do this.FLORIDO: Right. You know, appropriations in particular, Claudia, have, you know, hardly been working smoothly for a long time. So how is this moment different?GRISALES: Well, we haven't seen a president take over this level of power over appropriations before, especially when we consider decisions led by Trump and the head of Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought. That's made more apparent during this shutdown, the extent they're willing to go to handle spending. We started the year with the dismantling of several federal agencies, and now we're seeing Vought direct funds during a shutdown, decisions normally handled by Congress. I talked to another Georgetown law professor, Josh Chafetz, about OMB's moves here.JOSH CHAFETZ: Essentially, what the OMB is saying is we can spend money that hasn't been authorized by Congress. And we don't have to spend money that has been appropriated by Congress. Once you put those two together, there's nothing left of the congressional role.GRISALES: And we know some Republicans are speaking out about this, that Congress should retain the power of the purse. And that includes Kentucky Senator Rand Paul and Maine Senator Susan Collins.FLORIDO: OK, so the administration is taking over some major parts of spending authority. But what about these boat strikes in the Caribbean? How do they fit into this broader conversation about executive authority?GRISALES: Well, a small number of Republicans are concerned these strikes violate domestic and international laws. Congress has the power to declare war. Senator Paul, who I just mentioned, is one of those people. He says Trump has set a new precedent of shoot first, ask questions later.RAND PAUL: I think the idea of indiscriminately killing people without knowing their names, without seeing any evidence, without making a formal accusation or without collecting evidence - it's kind of ironic that we think these people are so dangerous, we're going to kill them without any information.GRISALES: And today, a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly told NPR the U.S. struck another alleged drug vessel last night, but this time in the Pacific.FLORIDO: So Republican leaders are generally OK with Trump taking these actions. Briefly, Claudia, are there any forces on the horizon that could curtail Trump's power?GRISALES: Well, we've seen some challenges to his power in federal courts. That's what experts point out. They also say voters could have the last word when they vote in the midterm elections next year.FLORIDO: That's NPR's congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales. Claudia, thanks.GRISALES: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The president's son-in-law — and former chief adviser — had said he wasn't planning to join the administration for a second time.   He successfully returned to the private sector and was raking in millions in foreign investments from ties nurtured during his first stint at the White House.   But then President Trump drafted him back to help secure a ceasefire in Gaza.   \"We called in Jared,\" Trump told the Israeli parliament last week, recounting efforts to reach a deal. \"We need that brain on occasion. We gotta get Jared in here.\"   Trump sent Kushner back to the Middle East this week, along with special envoy Steve Witkoff, to help secure the ceasefire after a weekend of deadly violence threatened the deal.   \n   At a press conference on Tuesday in Israel, Kushner downplayed the fighting as expected behavior.    \"A lot of people are getting a little hysterical about different incursions one way or the other,\" Kushner said, standing alongside Witkoff and Vice President Vance. \"But what we're seeing is that things are going in accordance. Both sides are transitioning from two years of very intense warfare to now a peacetime posture.\"   Kushner, Vance and Witkoff are also in Israel to continue implementation of Phase 2 of the peace deal, which includes establishing lines of communication to reduce tensions and avoid violations of the ceasefire as well as improve systems to get more aid into Gaza.   Kushner's high-profile involvement has raised ethical questions because of his deep business ties in the region.   During the first Trump administration, Kushner helped broker the historic Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab countries.    \n   Several of the foreign governments in the region have since invested billions in an investment firm, Affinity Partners, which Kushner launched after leaving the administration.   Daniel Shapiro, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Israel during the Obama administration, said it's fair to ask whether Kushner should be doing diplomacy in countries with which he's also doing business.   \"There are reasonable questions about the ethical and conflict of interest concerns that would be associated with people doing business with governments that they are also doing diplomacy with,\" said Shapiro, who is now a fellow at the Atlantic Council a nonpartisan think tank.   \n   But Shapiro, as have others who worked in Democratic administrations, have also given Kushner a lot of credit, acknowledging those same relationships helped him secure this peace agreement.   \"I don't think there's any question that Jared Kushner's involvement in that critical phase after that strike [by Israel] in Doha, given the relationships he has and given the experiences he had working with these governments previously, helped produce a result fairly quickly that brought about the good outcome,\" he said.   \n   Shapiro added that — especially in the Gulf countries — there are few lines between political, business and family relationships.   So someone like Kushner, who has been a partner before, can return to the negotiation table with built-in trust and understanding.   The White House dismisses any ethics criticism.   \n   A senior administration official who was not authorized to discuss the negotiations told NPR that Kushner was critical to finalizing the deal, fostering relationships built through his work on the Abraham Accords.   \"Special Envoy Wyckoff and the President were very grateful for his help, given his really deep understanding of the region and relationships,\" the official said. \"Steve would frequently reach out to him for input. They would bounce ideas off each other.\"   The official dismissed the criticism as largely coming from those who oppose anything the president does.   Kushner calls the business ties he has in the region an asset, as he told CBS's 60 Minutes over the weekend.   \"What people call conflicts of interests, Steve and I call experience and trusted relationships that we have throughout the world,\" he said. \"If Steve and I didn't have these deep relationships, the deal that we were able to help get done, that freed these hostages, would not have occurred.\"\n",

Today's top stories   A federal appeals court is expected to decide on President Trump's authority to deploy National Guard troops to Portland, Ore., within the coming days. A similar case about troop deployments in Chicago is going to the Supreme Court. The federal government deployed troops to both cities against the wishes of the Illinois and Oregon Democratic governors, and district courts temporarily blocked the deployments. Here's what you should know about legal battles over the deployments in both states.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                National Guard Members patrol 14th Street, working with Washington, D.C., Metro police on Aug. 24 in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 The central focus in these cases is determining whose facts to trust when it comes to the situation happening on the ground in these states: the president's or the local officials', NPR's Kat Lonsdorf tells Up First. There are several court cases involving the National Guard's deployments. Chicago is the first one to go to the high court. If the Supreme Court provides an emergency decision on the case, it won't set precedent nationwide, but it will provide more clarity on the power the president has to deploy and federalize the military, even against local officials' wishes.   \n   New reporters now hold Pentagon press passes after U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth informed news organizations that they had to sign off on a new policy for covering the military by the middle of last week. Hegseth rolled out the policy a few weeks ago, asking reporters to sign a document stating that they are not entitled to broadcast, print or ask for information the Pentagon hasn't authorized for release. In response, nearly all the journalists decided to turn in their media passes instead.    🎧 Hegseth said that Pentagon reporters were wandering around everywhere within the building, which NPR's David Folkenflik says is not true. This policy change means that the American people's knowledge of the military will be what Hegseth and company want them to know and nothing else, Folkenflik says.➡️ NPR's Tom Bowman has held his Pentagon press pass for 28 years but decided to turn it in due to the new media guidance. Read why.   European Union leaders are convening in Brussels for a summit to discuss how much more pressure to put on Russia to end its war in Ukraine. At the top of the agenda is a controversial proposal to provide Ukraine with a large loan using frozen Russian assets that are held in Europe. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will attend the summit, where he is expected to advocate for support for the idea to EU leaders.    \n   🎧 The loan to Ukraine would involve a little over $160 billion of money that belongs to the Russian Central Bank. The money has been held in Europe, mostly by Belgium, and was immobilized due to the full-scale war, says Reporter Teri Schultz. The European Commission, the EU's executive branch, wants to provide this loan guaranteed by the Russian money because Moscow will owe at least that much to Ukraine in a future peace settlement. However, Belgium fears that at some point, Russia would have the right to demand this money back, and it would be on the Belgians to supply it. Belgians want each of the EU countries to sign a pledge to share in the loan, which other EU member states have been hesitant to do so far, according to Schultz.

A new 10-week study has provided the first compelling evidence that cognitive training can increase levels of a brain chemical that typically declines as people age. The research, which involved people 65 or older, discovered that engaging in rigorous mental exercises for 30 minutes a day boosted levels of the chemical messenger acetylcholine by 2.3% in a brain region involved in attention and memory. This cognitive training seemed to reverse age-related decline in this brain area by about 10 years.    🧠 Of the 92 healthy participants, half played computer games like Candy Crush for 30 minutes while the other half spent the same amount of time doing cognitive exercises. The results showed no changes in acetylcholine levels for those who played games, while the cognitive training gave positive results.🧠The cognitive exercises were part of a scientifically tested program that challenged users to remember the types and locations of items that appear and disappear at increasing speeds.🧠 Early Alzheimer's drugs reduced symptoms by raising acetylcholine levels. Intensive brain training might offer similar benefits and help prevent cognitive decline, according to Michael Hasselmo of Boston University's Center for Systems Neuroscience.   \n   Picture show   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Cachitas Now!, una banda disidente, le canta a un público universitario y queer en La Plata.

The history of Argentine cumbia cannot be analyzed without considering the role migration plays in the genre, says Luciano Rombolá, host of the radio program Cumbia de la Pura. Around the 1950s, the University of Buenos Aires welcomed foreign migrants, who could study for free, attracting many music students. Among the students was Mario Castellón from Costa Rica, who formed a group with two Colombians, a Peruvian and a Chilean to perform at a wedding. This collaboration led to the formation of Los Wawancó, one of Argentina's most iconic cumbia bands. Since then, other influences like chicha and huayno tropical from Bolivia, cachaca from Paraguay, cumbia chicheras, chacaloneras and norteñas from Peru and Colombian cumbia have made their way to Argentine cumbia.

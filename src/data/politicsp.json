Instead, it will shift money toward transitional housing that requires work and addiction treatment.   In a statement, the Department of Housing and Urban Development said the new policies will \"restore accountability\" and promote \"self-sufficiency\" by addressing the \"root causes of homelessness, including illicit drugs and mental illness.\" It also noted that overall homelessness funding is going up, from $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion.   170,000 people could be at risk of losing their housing    Critics warn the major overhaul could put 170,000 people at risk of losing their housing again. And they say the timing is terrible. Normally, funding notices go out months earlier, but now programs around the country will have little time to start applying for new funding. And in many places, it will leave a months-long gap after current funding runs out and before new money flows.   \n   \"We'll move very, very fast,\" said HUD policy expert Robert Marbut, in response to such concerns. He also noted the federal shutdown delayed the funding notice, though homelessness advocates say it was already behind schedule before that.   In another change, HUD will no longer automatically renew existing programs — creating the possibility that formerly homeless people who've lived in subsidized housing for years will be forced out. The agency is also opening up more funding for faith-based groups.   The National Alliance to End Homelessness says the new policies could upend life for people who've found stability in permanent housing programs, many of them seniors or disabled. \"HUD's new funding priorities slam the door on them, their providers, and their communities. Make no mistake: homelessness will only increase because of this reckless and irresponsible decision,\" CEO Ann Oliva said in a statement.   The new policies could also shift more funding to places that enforce bans on homeless encampments.   \"Donald Trump's approach to homelessness does nothing to address the sky-high cost of rent, which remains the main cause of homelessness,\" Jesse Rabinowitz of the National Homelessness Law Center said in a statement.   The funding shift reflects a conservative backlash to longstanding policies   For two decades, federal funding has prioritized getting people into permanent housing and then offering them treatment. That policy is called Housing First and has long had bipartisan support. Backers say the approach has a proven track record of keeping people off the streets.   \n   But critics counter that it has failed to stem the steady rise of homelessness to what are now historic levels.   Those critics include President Trump, who has long pushed cities to clear homeless encampments from streets and parks. The new funding shift reflects an executive order he signed in July, which also sought to make it easier to confine unhoused people in mental institutions against their will.   \n   Marbut, the HUD policy expert, also said Housing First policies have failed to address rising death rates among unhoused people from meth and fentanyl addiction.   \"The influence of Housing First just became too powerful,\" says Stephen Eide, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think-tank. He calls it a top-down approach, and says for years it was hard to get funding unless a program followed that policy. Eide says that left out a large group of people who may not need permanent housing or who may want the enforced sobriety it does not offer.   \"I think what we're going to be looking for is a reinvestment in transitional housing,\" he says. That means places people can stay for 18 months or so to get sober, or recover in other ways, and then — ideally — move out and succeed on their own.   There's broad agreement that the U.S. needs more of every kind of support for homeless people: permanent housing, rehab and mental illness treatment. But critics of HUD's shift fear this may make it harder for some to get help.   \"It is moving away from trauma-informed care, and that's problematic,\" says Stephanie Klasky-Gamer, president and CEO of LA Family Housing in Los Angeles.   For example, she thinks this will lead more shelters to bar people unless they're already sober or enrolled in recovery or mental health care. But that's a high bar for many people, she says, and it could backfire.\n",

And now, after dropping it from his lexicon for more than eight months, he's saying it again as polls show voters rank the economy and cost of living as their top concern and blame Trump's policies for making things worse.   A senior administration official tells NPR Trump will soon travel around the country with a message that while some things have improved, there is more work to do to help people feeling economic strain. The official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, added that when it comes to affordability, \"there's no finish line.\"   \n   Thus far, Trump has spent far more time boasting about how great the economy and stock market are doing than acknowledging any economic anxiety.   \"Record high, record high, record high,\" Trump said of the stock market last week at a business event in Florida.   \"Costs are way down,\" Trump said at a late night signing ceremony in the Oval Office Wednesday. \"My administration and our partners in Congress will continue our work to lower the cost of living, restore public safety, grow our economy and make America affordable again for all Americans.\"   \n   Trump's affordability challenge marks a dramatic reversal of fortune for a president who returned to office on a promise to bring costs down and whose greatest political strength was on the economy. Now his approval rating on the economy is severely underwater.   After sweeping wins by Democrats in last week's elections where the cost-of-living was a key issue, Trump suddenly had a lot to say about \"affordability.\" But he has frequently come across as dismissive and defensive.   \"The affordability is much better with the Republicans,\" Trump said last week. \"The only problem is the Republicans don't talk about it, and Republicans should start talking about it and use their heads.\"   \n   But earlier this week when Fox News' Laura Ingraham pressed Trump on rising costs of things like coffee and ground beef, he called it a \"con job by the Democrats.\"   Asked why people are anxious about the economy, Trump responded by questioning whether people really are saying that.   \"I think polls are fake,\" Trump said. \"We have the greatest economy we've ever had.\"   \n   To support his positive outlook, Trump points to the booming stock market, his tariff policy and pledges by companies and countries to invest in the U.S.   Inflation this year has been persistent but not dramatic, at about 3%. Eggs have gotten cheaper since Trump took office, but other staples like ground beef and coffee are up. According to Gas Buddy, the average price of gasoline in the U.S. is $3.09 per gallon, slightly higher than this time last year.   \"Consumer confidence is the lowest it's ever been,\" said Jason Furman, a professor of economics at Harvard. \"People are really negative about inflation.\"   It's a political truth — and a pitfall for presidents — that people don't want to hear that everything is awesome if they are struggling.   \n   Furman, who served in the Obama administration, says the messaging team in that White House was very cautious not to brag about the economy, as the nation emerged from the Great Recession.   \"Because they thought anything we said positive about the economy risked people thinking President Obama was out of touch,\" said Furman. \"I didn't see that type of reserve when Biden was president. He bragged about it quite a lot, and I think that [rang] hollow with a lot of people. And President Trump is even less reserved about his bragging.\"   Trump's insistence that the economy is great earned him a rebuke from Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. Appearing on the Sean Spicer Show on YouTube, Greene said she gives Trump credit for holding inflation steady.   \n   \"But that doesn't bring prices down,\" said Greene. \"And so gaslighting the people and trying to tell them that prices have come down is not helping. It's actually infuriating people because people know what they are paying at the grocery store, they know what they're paying for their kid's clothes and school supplies. They know what they're paying for their electricity bills.\"   She called for compassion rather than lecturing.   \n   Former Trump economic adviser Stephen Moore says there are three major cost issues that have to be addressed: grocery prices, home prices and health care costs.   \"It is true factually that the average family has more purchasing power today than they did when Biden left office,\" said Moore. \"And yet people don't feel it. You know, they're not feeling the love. And I can't explain why that is except that people tend to focus on things where their prices are rising.\"   In fact, purchasing power also grew during the Biden administration, because wages rose faster than costs. But voters didn't want to hear it then, and they are in no mood to hear it now.   \"People are kind of in a crabby mood right now when it comes to the economy,\" said Moore.\n",

The notice Norton received from human resources stated that the leave \"is not being done for any disciplinary purpose.\"   Norton is among a number of federal employees who have been openly critical of the Trump administration, both before and during the 43-day shutdown.   \n   In an interview with NPR in early October, she said she believed the Trump administration's deep funding and staffing cuts have created a situation inside NIH that is far worse than the public realizes.   \"I feel like I have this front row seat to the destruction of our democracy,\" she said. \"We are seeing it in real time with a president who is asking us to do things that are illegal and harmful to the American public.\"   \n   NPR reached out to the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIH, for comment on Norton's leave status but did not immediately receive a response.   On Thursday, the Federal Unionists Network, a coalition of former and current federal workers and union members, announced that an Agriculture Department employee who worked on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) had also been put on leave.   Ellen Mei, who also serves as president of National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) Chapter 255, received a notice of proposed termination on Oct. 3, a day after she raised concerns about SNAP cuts in an interview on MSNBC, according to the Federal Unionists Network.    \n   \"I didn't leak secrets or share anything confidential,\" said Mei in a statement released by the group. \"I told the truth about what's happening to hungry families and the people who serve them. I took an oath to serve the public — not to stay quiet while our government turns its back on the American people.\"   In a statement, a spokesperson for USDA told NPR that the department does not comment on individual personnel matters, adding: \"During a lapse in appropriations, furloughed USDA employees are not authorized to perform any official duties, including speaking on behalf of the Department.\"   \n   MSNBC prefaced Mei's interview by stating that she was not representing the government, but speaking in her own capacity.   Norton says she believes federal employees not only have a right but an obligation to speak publicly on matters of the public interest.   \"Allowing civil servants to put up a red flag when we're seeing a problem is critical to maintaining our democracy,\" she told NPR in October. \"These civil service protections aren't really about protecting me as a federal worker. They're about protecting our country.\"   Still, on Friday, Norton told NPR she knew she was putting her job at risk by speaking out.   \"I was never under the impression that my rights would be respected,\" she said. \"I also recognized… that if you don't assert your rights because you're afraid, or because you're demoralized, or for whatever reason, then you've already given them up. You've let them be taken away. And I was determined not to do that.\"\n",

That decision could help determine the fate of the politically charged cases, which were both shepherded by the hastily installed Halligan and together have amplified concerns that the Justice Department is being used as a weapon to target President Donald Trump's perceived adversaries.   Halligan was installed in the job at Trump's urging by Attorney General Pam Bondi in September, just days before Comey was indicted, in what defense lawyers say was an end-run around the constitutional and statutory rules governing the appointment of U.S. attorneys. They say the maneuver was designed to ensure indictments against the president's political opponents after the prosecutor who had been overseeing the two investigations, but had not brought charges, was effectively forced out.   \n   \"Ms. Halligan was the sole prosecutor in the grand jury room, and when the sole prosecutor lacks the authority,\" said Ephraim McDowell, one of Comey's defense lawyers, \"that's not going to be a harmless error.\"   \n   U.S. attorneys, top federal prosecutors who oversee regional Justice Department outposts across the country, are typically nominated by the president and then confirmed by the Senate. Attorneys general do have the authority to name an interim U.S. attorney who can serve for 120 days, but lawyers for Comey and James argued that once that period expires, the law gives federal judges the exclusive say of who gets to fill the vacancy.   The interim US attorney resigned under pressure   After then-interim U.S. attorney Erik Siebert resigned in September while facing Trump administration pressure to bring charges against Comey and James, Bondi installed Halligan, a White House aide with no prior prosecutorial experience. The appointment followed a Trump post on Truth Social in which he complained to Bondi about the lack of prosecutorial action against his political enemies and said, \"JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\"   Siebert had been appointed by Bondi in January to serve as interim U.S. attorney. Trump in May announced his intention to nominate him, and judges in the Eastern District unanimously agreed after his 120-day period expired that he should be retained in the role.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Former FBI Director James Comey's attorney Abbe Lowell talks to reporters as he leaves the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Va., Thursday, Nov. 13, 2025.\n                \n                    Jose Luis Magana/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jose Luis Magana/AP\n    \n\n   \n   But after the Trump administration effectively pushed him out in September, the Justice Department again opted to make an interim appointment in place of the courts, something defense lawyers say it was not empowered under the law to do.   \n   \"If the government were to prevail here,\" McDowell said, then it \"would never need to go through Senate confirmation again for U.S. attorneys.\" He said any dismissal of the indictment must be permanent, with no opportunity to bring the case again, to avoid rewarding the government for a violation.   The Justice Department defends Halligan's appointment   The Justice Department maintains that the law does not explicitly prohibit successive appointments of interim U.S. attorneys by the attorney general. Henry Whitaker, a lawyer for the department, argued that the indictment was properly returned by a grand jury and should not be dismissed over what he described as at most a paperwork or clerical error.   \n   \"The grand jury made a decision based on the facts and the law, and they followed their oath,\" Whitaker said.   He also said that even if there were questions about Halligan's appointment, they were resolved by the fact that Bondi had personally ratified the indictment and reviewed the grand jury proceedings. But Currie, the judge, questioned whether that was possible given that a section of the grand jury proceedings that were produced to her was, for unexplained reasons, missing a section.   A Justice Department spokesperson later said that there was no missing time and that the time period in question concerns when the grand jury was deliberating, which \"would not be included in a transcription.\"   Comey has pleaded not guilty to charges of making a false statement and obstructing Congress, and James, a Democrat, has pleaded not guilty to mortgage fraud allegations. The challenges to Halligan's appointment are part of a multiprong effort to get the prosecutions tossed before trial. Their lawyers have separately argued that the prosecutions are improperly vindictive and motivated by the president's personal animus toward their clients and should therefore be dismissed.   Trump's history with Comey and James   Comey, as FBI director in the early months of Trump's first term, infuriated the president through his oversight of an investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. Trump fired Comey in May 2017. The two have been open adversaries since, with Comey labeling Trump \"unethical\" and comparing him to a Mafia boss and Trump branding Comey an \"untruthful slime ball\" and calling for him to be punished because of the Russia investigation.   \n   James has been a frequent target of Trump's ire, especially since she won a staggering judgment against him and the Trump Organization in a lawsuit alleging he defrauded banks by overstating the value of his real estate holdings on financial statements. An appeals court overturned the fine, which had ballooned to more than $500 million with interest, but upheld a lower court's finding that Trump had committed fraud.\n",

Johnson sent members home after they voted on a continuing resolution to fund the government in mid-September.\n                \n                    Alex Wroblewski/AFP via Getty Images/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wroblewski/AFP via Getty Images/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   After narrowly approving a stopgap funding bill to end the government shutdown last night, the House of Representatives adjourned for the remainder of the week – marking one full day in session after being out for 54 days.   The Wednesday vote was the first time House members voted since House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., sent members home after the chamber passed its initial version of a continuing resolution in mid-September.   \n   \"The House did its job,\" Johnson said on the third day of the shutdown when asked why he wasn't having members stay in town. \"The House will come back into session and do its work as soon as [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer allows us to reopen the government.\"   He kept his word but tensions were high when members returned this week.   \"Long time, no see. I hardly recognize you guys,\" said House Rules Committee ranking member Jim McGovern, D-Mass., at a meeting. \"Where the hell have you been?\"   \n   After repeated comments from Democrats about Republicans being on vacation during the shutdown, Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., stepped in.   \"I am sick and tired of hearing you all say we had an eight-week vacation. I worked every day,\" she said. \"I don't want to hear another soul say that.\"   Although House leadership in both parties held press conferences every day during the shutdown, there was no legislative business of the House for over seven weeks.   \"The halls have been pretty, pretty lonely,\" said California Republican Kevin Kiley on Wednesday. Unlike Republicans, rank and file House Democrats were instructed by their leaders to come to D.C. regularly for caucus meetings.    But Kiley kept showing up to his Capitol office throughout the shutdown.   \n   \"This has not been the finest hour for the United States Congress, having the House of Representatives cancel its sessions while so many people across the country were suffering,\" he told NPR. \"I don't think that either party comes out of this thing in the best light.\"   Kiley said he used the time to work with a colleague on the other side of the aisle to address an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year – the crux of the shutdown itself.   \n   \"That was, I guess, one advantage of being here – that I have had some constructive conversations like that,\" he said. \"But of course, if the entire House was here, then we could have been having the sort of consensus building process that you need to pass legislation like this.\"   Other GOP members, like Missouri Rep. Mark Alford, said the time back home was useful.   \"In a way, this time away working in the district has been very, very helpful,\" he told NPR. \"I got more done in my district than I think in the three years that I've been [in Congress]. We went to farms, we went to businesses, we visited 14 of our 18 rural hospitals in our district, and it gave us a real clear picture of where America stands right now and what we can do to help.\"   Meanwhile, Democrats are still fuming that the chamber was sent home in the first place.   \"I think that the speaker really has exhibited some poor judgment. I think it was disrespectful to the body,\" said Rep. Julie Johnson, D-Texas.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Rep. Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., speak to the press after Grijalva was sworn in at the Capitol on Nov. 12. 2025.\n                \n                    SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images/AFP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images/AFP\n    \n\n   \n   She called it \"poor form\" for the speaker not to swear in fellow Democrat Adelita Grijalva, who won an Arizona special election in mid-September and was waiting to be sworn in during the shutdown.   Grijalva told NPR's All Things Considered she thinks her support of the effort to release the Jeffrey Epstein files played a role in her wait to get seated.   \n   \"I really like this lady. She's going to be an excellent member of Congress,\" Speaker Johnson said after he swore Grijalva in. \"We followed the custom of the House on the timetable and we've had a little, as we say in the deep South, some intense fellowship about that. But she's here now and I promised that we would have the oath administered before we began legislative business so she hasn't missed a vote.\"   Rep. Melanie Stansbury, D-N.M., said swearing in Grijalva during the shutdown is just one of the business items of the chamber that should have been done last month.   \n   \"For the last 54 days, the House has been completely closed and locked out, and there is all manner of legislative business that could have been going on,\" she told NPR. \"People are angry about the lack of accountability.\"   Stansbury added: \"We should have been here for the entire time.\"   Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., agreed with that.   \"We were gone far too long,\" he told NPR. \"I didn't want to go home in August [for recess]. So to be gone for those five or six weeks and then turn around and do it again in October was just – that's just more than Americans should have to put up with.\"   Womack, a longtime appropriator, said he has his eye on the end of January — when Congress has to finish the rest of its spending bills.   \"We're going to be putting Congress on the clock again in another 78, 79 days,\" he said. \"We're going to be right back where we were. I just hope we don't put America back through the same nut roll.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      The House was out of session for the entire government shutdown. Members returned Wednesday with a lot of frustration.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  The House of Representatives came back for one day this week after being gone for more than 50. During the government shutdown, the House was officially out of session. Some members did town halls back in their districts. Others came to the Capitol anyway. But as NPR's Barbara Sprunt reports, there was angst on all sides when everyone reassembled.BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: The House Rules Committee met earlier this week ahead of the full House coming back into session on Wednesday. And let's just say things were tense. Here's Jim McGovern, the top Democrat on the panel.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JIM MCGOVERN: Long time no see. I hardly recognize you guys. Where the hell have you been?SPRUNT: After repeated comments from Democrats about Republicans being on vacation during the shutdown, Chairwoman Virginia Foxx stepped in.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)VIRGINIA FOXX: I am sick and tired of hearing you all say we had an eight-week vacation.YASSAMIN ANSARI: That's exactly what happened.FOXX: I worked every day. I don't know about you.ANSARI: I worked every single day as well.FOXX: But I don't want to hear another soul say that.ANSARI: We all worked every single...SPRUNT: The House passed its version of a stopgap funding bill in mid-September. House Speaker Mike Johnson then sent lawmakers home. He was asked on the third day of the shutdown, why not stay?(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE JOHNSON: My quick answer's very simple. The House did its job.SPRUNT: Then he blamed Democratic leaders in the Senate for not doing theirs. Leadership on both sides of the aisle held press conferences almost every day of the shutdown, but there were no votes, no committee hearings. Wednesday was the first official day back in 54 days.KEVIN KILEY: It's a lot more crowded here. You know, the halls have been pretty lonely.SPRUNT: That's California Republican Kevin Kiley. He kept showing up to his Capitol office throughout the shutdown.KILEY: To be honest with you, this has not been the finest hour for the United States Congress, having the House of Representatives cancel its sessions while so many people across the country were suffering.SPRUNT: He said he used the time to work with a colleague on the other side of the aisle to address an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year. Those subsidies were central to the shutdown.KILEY: That was, I guess, one advantage of being here is that we - I have had some constructive conversations like that. But of course, if the entire House was here, then we could have been having this sort of consensus-building process that you need to pass legislation like this.SPRUNT: Fellow Republican Mark Alford of Missouri said the time back home was useful.MARK ALFORD: Look, I've been here for three years. I got more done in my district than I think in the three years that I've been there. I've been able to visit farms. We went to businesses. We visited 14 of 18 rural hospitals in our district. And it gave us a real clear picture where America stands right now and what we can do to help.SPRUNT: Meanwhile, Democrats are still fuming that the House was even sent home at all.JULIE JOHNSON: This was a ridiculous thing.SPRUNT: That's Julie Johnson, a freshman Democrat from Texas.J JOHNSON: I think that the speaker really has exhibited some poor judgment, and it was disrespectful to the body. And then the speaker refusing to swear in a dully elected, that was poor form.SPRUNT: She's referring to Arizona Democrat Adelita Grijalva, who won a special election in mid-September but wasn't sworn in until yesterday before any votes. The common refrain from Democrats, like New Mexico's Melanie Stansbury, is this.MELANIE STANSBURY: The House has been completely closed and locked out, and there is all manner of legislative business that could have been going on, and we should have been here the entire time.SPRUNT: Republican Steve Womack of Arkansas says he agrees with that.STEVE WOMACK: Listen, I didn't want to go home in August. So to be gone for those five or six weeks and then turn around and do it again in October was just - that's just more than America should have to put up with.SPRUNT: He's a senior appropriator, and he's now looking down the road at what lies ahead.WOMACK: We're going to be putting Congress on the clock again in another 78, 79 days. We're going to be right back where we were. I just hope we don't put America back through the same nut roll.SPRUNT: Funding for much of the government will run out again January 30.Barbara Sprunt, NPR News, the Capital.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

Within the more than 1,000 mentions of Trump in the documents, an email says Trump spent hours at the convicted sex offender's home with a victim. Republican strategist Alex Conant says the documents may not necessarily change people's minds for the next election, but it makes for a not-so-good week for the president.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump arrives for the signing ceremony for the \"Fostering the Future\" executive order in the East Room of the White House on Nov. 13, 2025.\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Conant says that the White House should have handled the Epstein story differently by releasing all the information they had. The White House claims it has been transparent about the situation, but at the same time, Trump doesn't want to answer questions about Epstein, NPR's Deepa Shivaram tells Up First. Conant points out that Trump's strategy is to deflect, attack and then change the story, but due to the slow drip of the Epstein story, it has been harder for the president to overcome this scandal.   The Trump administration has selected Charlotte, N.C., as the next city for its immigration crackdown, according to Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden. The sheriff said yesterday that federal officials contacted him and could arrive as early as tomorrow. The development comes as some Border Patrol agents are leaving Chicago, after weeks of aggressive raids there.    \n   🎧 Charlotte drew national attention this fall following the fatal stabbing of a Ukrainian woman on public transit, says Nick de la Canal with NPR network station WFAE. The suspect was not an immigrant, but Republicans and the White House criticized the city's Democratic mayor for the crime. Violent crime is down 20% over the last year, according to de la Canal, but there have still been calls for the National Guard to deploy to the area. It is currently unknown how many agents are expected to arrive in the city, and the community has been reacting with fear to the news, despite advocacy groups urging calm.   Trump will soon travel across the U.S. to address the economic hardship Americans are feeling, a senior administration official told NPR. Trump's message will be that, while some things have improved, there is still more work to be done. This comes as the president revives the talking point of making America affordable again — a pledge that helped him win the White House again but that has not been much of a focus the past eight months. Currently, voters rank the economy and cost of living as their top concerns in polls, and many blame Trump's policies for exacerbating these issues.   \n   Today's listen   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Why exercise is on the rise.\n                \n                    J_art/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        J_art/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Exercise appears to be more popular than ever in the U.S., from fitness influencers sharing gym tips on social media to fitness being a focus in our politics.

The federal government is reopening. But after 43 days on pause, things may not return to business as usual right away. For instance, federal workers are still awaiting backpay and air travel disruptions are expected to linger.   \n   And some impacts could continue much longer than six weeks, whether that's national parks trying to make up for lost visitor revenue or taxpayers waiting longer for refunds from a backlogged Internal Revenue Service (IRS).   There's also the looming threat of another potential shutdown in the not-too-distant future, since this bill only funds the government through Jan. 30.   Here's a look at where things stand for now.   Keep scrolling for updates, and jump by category here:   Federal workers | SNAP| Smithsonian | Air travel | National parks | Taxes | Economic data   \n   Federal employees return to work, awaiting back pay    Roughly 1.4 million federal workers have gone without pay for six weeks. Roughly half of them were required to keep working without paychecks, while hundreds of thousands of others were furloughed.   Russ Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, told agency heads to direct furloughed employees to return to work Thursday.   \"Agencies should take all necessary steps to ensure that offices reopen in a prompt and orderly manner\" on Thursday, Vought wrote in a Wednesday memo.   \n   The timing of backpay is a different question.   After the government shutdown ending in January 2019 — then the longest in history — Congress passed a law ensuring back pay for federal workers \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"   But Trump appeared to suggest otherwise in public comments last month, leaving many feds worried.   \n   The bill that Congress passed to end the shutdown guarantees back pay. It also reverses several agencies' attempted staffing reductions during the shutdown, which were paused by a federal judge, and prevents additional layoffs of federal employees through January.   Shaun Southworth, a federal employment attorney, said in an Instagram video that the timing of backpay will vary by agency based on their payroll providers, but most employees should start seeing deposits within days.   \"Many employees historically saw deposits within the first business days after reopening,\" he says of the last shutdown. \"A minority may roll to the next cycle if the system needs extra processing.\"   \n   SNAP is back    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Daytona Beach residents wait in their cars during a free food distribution for SNAP recipients organized by the Volusia County Sheriff's Office and The Jewish Federation at the Daytona International Speedway last week.\n                \n                    Miguel J. Rodriguez Carrillo/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Miguel J. Rodriguez Carrillo/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The bill Congress passed to reopen the government funds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) through September 2026.   The program, which some 42 million Americans rely on for food assistance, has been the subject of much uncertainty — and an escalating legal battle — in recent weeks. The Trump administration said last month that it would suspend SNAP funding in November due to the shutdown, prompting a wide outcry and a series of legal challenges.   \n   While the administration initially said it would comply with two rulings requiring it to provide at least partial funding for SNAP in November, it balked — and ultimately appealed to the Supreme Court — after one of those judges said it must fund the program fully for the month. The Supreme Court paused that order (and extended that pause again on Tuesday, with the end of the shutdown in sight).   At this point, beneficiaries in some states have gotten their full monthly allocations, while others have gotten partial payments or nothing at all. Reopening the government means restarting SNAP, but it's not clear how quickly full payments will resume, since that varies by state. And, as NPR has reported, many who rely on the program are worried that benefits could be cut again.   Smithsonian institutions will reopen on a rolling basis   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Smithsonian National Museum of African American History, closed during the government shutdown, is expected to reopen Friday.\n                \n                    Stefani Reynolds/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Stefani Reynolds/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\n   \n   The Smithsonian, which encompasses 21 museums and the National Zoo, says its reopening will be gradual.   Its website says the National Museum of American History, as well as the National Air and Space Museum and its Virginia annex, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, will open their doors on Friday.   All other museums and the zoo — including its beloved live animal cams — will reopen to the public \"on a rolling basis\" by Monday.   Air travel won't bounce back overnight   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A passenger waits for his flight at Los Angeles International Airport on Friday, as flight reductions began at major U.S. airports.\n                \n                    Sarah Reingewirtz/Los Angeles Daily News/SCNG\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Sarah Reingewirtz/Los Angeles Daily News/SCNG\n    \n\n   \n   The shutdown snarled air travel in a tangle that experts say is beyond a quick fix.   \n   Escalating shortages of air traffic controllers — who have been required to work without pay — caused delays and disruptions at airports nationwide since early October. Then, last week, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to reduce air traffic at 40 of the country's busiest airports, starting by 4% and ramping up to 10% by this Friday.   \n   The FAA announced Wednesday that it would freeze flight reductions at the current 6% level, citing a rapid improvement in controller staffing. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said air traffic controllers will get a lump sum payment equal to 70% of their back pay within 48 hours of the shutdown ending.   The agency says it will continue to assess \"whether the system can gradually return to normal operations.\"   Airlines and aviation regulators have warned that flight disruptions are likely to continue once the government reopens. Airlines had to adjust their schedules to reduce flights, and those changes can take time to reverse.   \"It's going to take a bit to unwind, and the responsibility is not going to fall completely on the air traffic control operation,\" former FAA administrator Randy Babbitt told NPR's All Things Considered on Tuesday. \"A good deal of responsibility will be the carriers getting their schedules and the aircraft and personnel back in the right positions to resume normal flying.\"   Air travel experts have told NPR that even after the shutdown, lingering impacts could potentially complicate Thanksgiving travel — which is always a hectic time to fly.   National Parks start to \"pick up the pieces\"       \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A sign posted by the National Park Service warns of closures at the Benjamin Rush Gardens in Philadelphia during the government shutdown earlier this month.\n                \n                    Matthew Hatcher/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Matthew Hatcher/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Most national parks stayed at least partially open during the shutdown, but with significantly reduced staffing (since thousands of National Park Service employees were furloughed) and limited services like visitor centers and trash pickup.   The National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA), a nonprofit that advocates for national parks, said in a statement that it could take months for returning staff to address the damage.   \n   \"For 43 days, many national parks were left open, vulnerable and unprotected,\" said Kristen Brengel, senior vice president of government affairs at NPCA. \"The National Park Service, already pushed to its breaking point after losing 25% of permanent staff, is left to pick up the pieces.\"   \n   National parks were already feeling the strain before the shutdown, forced by federal funding cuts to cancel ranger programs, close visitors centers and pause maintenance and research.   During the shutdown, parks were unable to collect millions of dollars in entrance and recreational fees, which Brengel says could delay construction projects and other visitor services. And nonprofits which diverted resources to help parks stay operational have depleted their budgets in the process, Brengel says, leaving them \"unsure if they will ever fully recover those funds.\"   Congress' bill funds the National Park Service through January. But Brengel calls it \"only a short-term reprieve,\" warning that another government shutdown could dampen the busy season by affecting the hiring of seasonal rangers for next spring and summer.   The IRS is looking ahead to tax filing season   The IRS furloughed nearly half of its approximately 74,000 workers and tried to lay off roughly 1,400 others — though those cuts were reversed as a result of the bill reopening the government.   The agency's operations were limited during the shutdown. It generally did not pay tax refunds during this period, scaled back its live telephone customer service supports, closed walk-in Taxpayer Assistance Centers and cancelled appointments related to cases with the Independent Office of Appeals and Taxpayer Advocate Service — which it says will be rescheduled once the government reopens.   Tax deadlines and laws remain in effect, and the IRS says it has continued critical operations related to next year's tax-filing season.   \n   But some experts worry that the effects of the shutdown — on top of thousands of IRS job cuts enacted earlier this year — could make for a messy 2026 tax season.   In an October letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) urged the IRS to take steps like pausing notice and collection activities during the shutdown. It wrote that since taxpayers can only respond to those by mail, the understaffed agency may not see their letters in time to fix errors or address issues — and will have to deal with an unwieldy backlog when the government reopens.   \n   \"This burden has the real potential to delay the 2026 filing season due to the increased stresses to our entire tax system,\" the accountants wrote.   Such disruptions have happened before.   The 2018-2019 shutdown left the IRS with over 5 million pieces of unprocessed mail, 80,000 unaddressed responses to Fiscal Year 2018 Earned Income Tax Credit audits and 87,000 amended returns waiting to be processed, according to a report by the National Taxpayer Advocate (an independent agency within the IRS).   And years earlier, the 16-day government shutdown in October 2013 delayed billions of dollars of tax refunds and created a backlog of 1.2 million income and Social Security number verification requests, according to the Committee for a Responsible Budget.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A 'We're Hiring' sign is taped to the window of a business in Miami, Florida.  Federal jobs reports were delayed by the government shutdown.\n                \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Delayed economic reports may never be released   The shutdown could leave permanent gaps in economic data.   The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics typically releases employment reports on the first Friday of each month, a practice that was paused in October and November. Even with the government reopening, their future is uncertain.   White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Wednesday that October's inflation and jobs reports will \"likely never [be] released and all of that economic data released will be permanently impaired.\" She blamed Democrats for the shutdown, which she said \"may have permanently damaged the federal statistical system.\"   The Bureau of Labor Statistics has not commented publicly on the status of the reports or updated its calendar of upcoming release dates. Economists expect the bureau to release its September jobs report (which was nearly ready when the government shut down on Oct. 1) first, and say it's an open question when — or whether — any October reports will be published.\n",

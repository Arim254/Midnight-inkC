    "body": "\n      A bipartisan group of Senators is in Denmark speaking to officials there as President Trump announces new tariffs and continues to talk about taking over Greenland.   \n\n    SARAH MCCAMMON, HOST:  President Trump is escalating his effort to acquire Greenland, which is part of the kingdom of Denmark. In a social media post earlier today, he said he will impose a new 10% tariff on several European countries that oppose the idea - including Germany, France and Denmark - that is, until they get on board. This came on the heels of a bipartisan congressional delegation that went to Denmark on Friday to try to turn down the temperature. NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt traveled there also, and she joins us from Copenhagen. Hi, Barbara.BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Hi, Sarah.MCCAMMON: So tell me more about this delegation. Who went, and what was their goal?SPRUNT: Well, this was a group of about a dozen lawmakers, mostly Democrats. There were two Republicans, both of whom have shown a willingness in the past to push back on the Trump administration. And this was, at its core, a reassurance tour. You know, they were coming to listen and hear the concerns of politicians of both Denmark and Greenland, as well as some Danish business leaders. Here's Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski speaking after an event at Parliament yesterday.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LISA MURKOWSKI: I think it is important to underscore that when you ask the American people whether or not they think it is a good idea for the United States to acquire Greenland, the vast majority - some 75% - will say, we do not think that that is a good idea.SPRUNT: You know what's interesting, Sarah - I follow these folks around on Capitol Hill all the time, and it was almost like seeing them in a completely different job. They were diplomats. They were talking to allies who are frankly in crisis mode.MCCAMMON: You know, that's a really interesting distinction - diplomats versus lawmakers. What did you see?SPRUNT: Well, on Capitol Hill, partisanship reigns. When there's an opportunity for Democrats to take a dig at President Trump over policy or politics, more often than not, it happens. But here in Copenhagen, that's not what I saw largely. I heard a lot of careful language, a lot about bringing the knowledge that they've gained here by listening to the concerns of people on the ground back with them to the U.S. Delaware Senator Chris Coons, who led the delegation, said he'd even welcome conversations with the White House about what they've learned.MCCAMMON: Needless to say, a very different tone from what we've heard from President Trump. What was the response from the politicians from Denmark and Greenland?SPRUNT: They said they were pleased that the delegation came, that they had constructive conversations and that it was important for lawmakers to hear directly from officials from Greenland. And although they're clear in their concern about the rhetoric around buying Greenland, I thought their tone was really notable. It was calm. They repeatedly said that they stand ready to work alongside the U.S. Here's Pipaluk Lynge, a Greenlandic politician. Reporters were asking her about Trump and his comments.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PIPALUK LYNGE: I think it's really important not to demonize anyone. It's really important to focus on what we're agreeing on and focus on dialogue.SPRUNT: And I think it's really significant there how measured she is, not at all inflaming what's already a volatile situation.MCCAMMON: Now, of course, President Trump says he wants to take over Greenland because he doesn't want China or Russia to take it over. What are officials there saying about that?SPRUNT: I heard repeatedly from lawmakers that they haven't received any intelligence that suggests that that is an imminent threat. That being said, Greenland and Danish officials did say that they're willing to work with the U.S. to address concerns around safeguarding the Arctic. And I should mention, the U.S. already has a military presence in Greenland.MCCAMMON: What else are you hearing from the people you're meeting there in Copenhagen, Barbara?SPRUNT: Well, I attended a demonstration earlier today, thousands of people marching to protest Trump. Lots of passion, tons of chanting of, Greenland is not for sale. I saw a lot of hats that looked almost like the signature red Make America Great Again hats, but they said, Make America Go Away. I went up to one gentleman who had a sign that showed a image of Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, and it said, Americans, we know there is good in you, come back to sanity. His name is Peder Dam, and he said he doesn't think that Trump's demands are necessarily representative of what all Americans want, but he does wonder why there isn't more outrage.PEDER DAM: I can't understand. If my government said that they would attack Sweden, then I would step up and protest that. Why isn't there more normal, average Americans stepping up, going to demonstrations, trying to protest what is going on?SPRUNT: And this is the overarching sentiment that I heard from people. They feel frankly betrayed by a key ally, and they're very worried about their future.MCCAMMON: NPR's Barbara Sprunt, reporting from Copenhagen.

On Friday, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration urged U.S. aircraft operators to \"exercise caution\" when flying over the eastern Pacific Ocean near Mexico, Central America and parts of South America, citing \"military activities.\"   The president said her administration waited a couple hours until the U.S. government provided \"written\" assurance that there would not be any U.S. military flights over Mexican territory. She said the U.S. government had not given Mexico a heads up about any military operations.   \n   The U.S. government provided precise coordinates for where it was operating and Mexican authorities issued a statement saying the FAA advisory had no implications for Mexico.   Then, images of a U.S. military transport airplane on the tarmac at Toluca's airport about 39 miles (63 kilometers) west of Mexico City began circulating on social media.   Sen. Clemente Castañeda, of the opposition Citizen Movement party, posted on social platform X asking for an explanation from the government, because Mexico's senate is supposed to approve sending Mexican troops abroad or allowing foreign troops into Mexico.   Sheinbaum described it as a \"logistical\" operation that did not require senate approval.   \"The United States plane landed, public servants got on that plane and they went (to the U.S.) for training,\" Sheinbaum said. \"Who authorized this? The Secretary of Defense.\"   Her security cabinet had posted on X Sunday night that such training operations \"occur in conformity with established protocols and in adherence to the bilateral collaboration agreements.\"   Both events highlighted the sensitivity created by not only the Trump administration's unilateral action to capture Venezuela's then-President Nicolás Maduro earlier this month, but the subsequent renewal of offers and threats to take direct military action against the drug cartels in Mexico.   \n   Sheinbaum and Trump spoke again last week on the subject. Both governments continue to say they will collaborate on security issues, with Mexico emphasizing that it will not accept violations of its sovereignty.   Security officials from both countries are scheduled to meet again Friday in an effort to \"continue delivering tangible actions to strengthen security cooperation and meaningful outcomes to counter cartels, and stop the illicit flow of fentanyl and weapons from crossing our shared border,\" according to a joint statement released last Thursday.\n",

Denmark and Greenland are stepping up lobbying of U.S. lawmakers in an effort to head off President Trump's push to take control of Greenland.\n                \n                    Nichlas Pollier/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Nichlas Pollier/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   President Trump escalated his crusade for the U.S. to acquire Greenland this weekend, just as a congressional delegation wrapped up a trip to Denmark to try to turn the temperature down.   On Saturday, Trump announced on social media that he intends to impose a 10% tariff on eight European nations, including Denmark, because of their opposition to his plan. He vowed to raise the tariff to 25% by June if a deal to acquire Greenland isn't reached.   The threat came on the heels of a bipartisan congressional visit to Denmark, where 11 lawmakers attempted to reassure Danish and Greenlandic politicians of U.S. support.   \n   North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, one of two Republicans on the delegation, blasted the president's announcement on social media.   \"The fact that a small handful of 'advisors' are actively pushing for coercive action to seize the territory of an ally is beyond stupid,\" he posted. \"It hurts the legacy of President Trump and undercuts all the work he has done to strengthen the NATO alliance over the years.\"   Over the course of the trip, the delegation met with top Danish and Greenlandic officials, including Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who has said U.S. taking over Greenland would spell the end of NATO.   \"Greenland is a part of Denmark. Denmark is our NATO ally. That should be the end of this discussion,\" Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., who led the delegation, said on Saturday.   \"This is a moment where our very positive relationships have dimmed a bit, and I hope that the people of the Kingdom of Denmark do not abandon their faith in the American people,\" he added.   \n   Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, stressed the importance of not letting this issue \"become a partisan matter.\"   She suggested there is broader Republican opposition to Trump's plans than was reflected in the makeup of the delegation.   \"I don't think that the absence of Republicans is because they don't care about this issue or they have already decided what side of the fence that they may be,\" she told reporters. \"So I would not take that as an indicator of support or lack of support.\"   \n   Pipaluk Lynge, a politician from Greenland who spoke with the delegation, said she's been wanting to meet with the Americans for over a year.   \"Dialogue through social media won't come to a better ending,\" she said. \"Dialogue face to face is really important, and also that they hear from the Greenlandic people themselves.\"   Lynge said fears in Greenland are high and diplomacy is crucial.   \"We are worried, the children of Greenland are worried. But we as politicians have to work on making collaboration,\" she said. \"I'm hoping that this also can be sent to the White House, that we're open for business and open for dialogue, to compromise.\"   Lawmakers as crisis diplomats    The delegation highlighted the role that lawmakers can play on the world stage, meeting not only with political figures but with the business community as well.   \"We continue to hear about the challenges that come with an unpredictable and unstable political environment in the United States and how that can stifle investment,\" said Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del.   McBride said the Greenlandic delegation told lawmakers how existential this threat feels.   \"I think it is easy for people back in the United States to see these headlines and to dismiss it as a show, as pure saber rattling,\" McBride told NPR. \"But I cannot stress for people enough how serious people in Greenland and Denmark are taking this.\"   The delegation also laid a wreath at a memorial acknowledging the sacrifice of Danes deployed in international missions, with inscriptions of the fallen.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Jeanne Shaheen attends a press conference with an American delegation, consisting of senators and members of the House of Representatives, in Copenhagen, Denmark, on Saturday.\n                \n                    Ida Marie Odgaard/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Ida Marie Odgaard/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"A black mark on America\"   Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., told NPR the visit to the memorial is a reminder of the deep sacrifices Denmark has made.   \"They have stood by us in two world wars — Afghanistan,\" she said. \"Danish soldiers stood side by side with Americans. And for America's president to show so little regard, appreciation and understanding for what Denmark has done is a black mark on America.\"   \n   Shaheen, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Trump's actions have \"real ramifications for people here who feel betrayed by America.\"   She added his quest to acquire Greenland threatens the NATO alliance.   \"One of the things that has made America so strong is our allies and partners, and anything that the president does to undermine those relationships, to undermine NATO, does nothing but give Vladimir Putin in Russia and President Xi in China reasons to celebrate,\" Shaheen said. \"And you can bet they're celebrating now.\"   Trump has said that China and Russia are encircling Greenland, but lawmakers have repeatedly said they haven't received any intelligence indicating that threat.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Protesters on City Square during a protest in support of Greenland on Saturday in Copenhagen, Denmark.\n                \n                    Martin Sylvest Andersen/Getty Images Europe\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Martin Sylvest Andersen/Getty Images Europe\n    \n\n   \n   \"Yankee go home\"   This weekend was also marked by a massive demonstration in Copenhagen, where thousands protested against Trump's comments, some waving signs that read, \"Yankee go home.\"   \"It's just absurd,\" said Christian Michaelson, who grew up in Denmark.   \"If you had wanted a higher presence in the Arctic region, you could have just asked,\" he said.   Charlotte Holm held a sign that read: \"Americans want Epstein files. Not Greenland. Greenland not for sale.\"   \"Leave them alone,\" said Holm, who was born and raised in Copenhagen and has family in Greenland. \"I hope [Trump] will get obsessed with something else all of a sudden.\"   She said she worries that NATO will \"implode\" if Trump moves against a NATO ally, echoing comments from the Danish prime minister.    \"If we go across that line, there's no going back,\" she said. \"You can't put the toothpaste back into the tube.\"\n",

In the statement, leaders of the eight countries underscored their commitment to shared NATO goals, saying that they stood in \"full solidarity\" with Denmark and Greenland. They also reaffirmed their willingness to \"engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity\" in response to President Trump's repeated threats to take control of Greenland, which is currently an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark.   \n   On Saturday night, President Trump had written on his Truth Social platform that he would impose tariffs on imports from the eight countries. Trump's words came after the countries, which are all in NATO, deployed military personnel to Greenland in recent days, to participate in a Danish-led Arctic exercise known as 'Arctic Endurance'.   Trump said America would levy a 10 percent tariff on goods from the eight countries starting on February 1. He claimed those tariffs would rise to 25 percent on June 1, and remain in place \"until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland\" by the United States.   In their joint response, the eight NATO countries said that Trump's proposed tariffs \"undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.\"   \n   \"As members of NATO, we are committed to strengthening Arctic security as a shared transatlantic interest,\" the leaders said. \"The pre-coordinated Danish exercise 'Arctic Endurance' conducted with Allies, responds to this necessity. It poses no threat to anyone.\"   The coordinated statement reflects an unusually explicit diplomatic pushback by key U.S. allies. In addition, some individual European leaders issued their own individual criticisms.   British Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the use of tariffs against allies, calling it \"completely wrong\". A spokesman for the UK Prime Minister later said Starmer had shared this view with President Trump in a phone call on Sunday. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said Sweden would not be \"blackmailed,\" while Norway's prime minister stressed that \"threats have no place among allies.\"   \n   Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen also made a statement, praising \"great support\" from European allies. \"I am pleased with the consistent messages from the rest of the continent: Europe will not be blackmailed,\" Frederiksen said.   European foreign policy leaders made clear that trade coercion would harm the broader transatlantic relationship and potentially derail other ongoing negotiations.   One unnamed French official close to Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot told NPR that Paris had mobilized its diplomatic apparatus \"to coordinate a European response to the new, unacceptable tariff threats issued by President Trump.\"   The official added that Barrot had been in talks with his British, German and EU counterparts and was in contact with all affected foreign ministers and European Parliament political groups.   Ordinary citizens have also registered their opposition to President Trump's recent threats, with large protests in Denmark and Greenland against American pressure alongside the broader NATO debates about Arctic security as well as the diplomatic scramble.   In his social media post on Saturday, Trump framed Europe's actions as part of \"a very dangerous situation\" and argued the tariffs were necessary to protect \"Global Peace and Security\" – language that has been widely challenged by European officials and analysts as exaggerated or unfounded given the context of NATO cooperation in the Arctic.   \n   This latest tariff standoff follows weeks of increasingly assertive U.S. rhetoric regarding Greenland and Arctic policy. Trump has repeatedly declared Greenland — a vast, sparsely populated territory — as strategically vital to U.S. national security, citing its location and untapped mineral resources.   Greenlandic and Danish leaders have consistently pushed back, insisting the territory is not for sale, most recently during discussions between the two countries' foreign ministers and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.   Domestically, the tariff decision has sparked pushback not only abroad but among U.S. lawmakers. Bi-partisan voices in Congress have criticized the approach as damaging to NATO cohesion, and warned that it could jeopardize U.S. credibility.   \n   Analysts have pointed out that the United States already maintains a military presence in Greenland, which has shrunk dramatically over the decades, and so question the necessity of coercive economic measures tied to territorial ambitions.\n",

The Democrats tried to turn the 900-page Heritage Foundation-led blueprint to remake the government into a political boogeyman, and succeeded to some degree, but it wasn't enough to win the election.   A year later, many of the policies have been implemented, from cracking down on immigration to dismantling the Department of Education.   \"A lot of the policies from Day 1 to the last day and in between that the administration has adopted are right out of Project 2025,\" said Rob Bonta, the attorney general of California, who has used Project 2025 to prepare legal papers against the administration.   \n   Concerns about the project started to bubble up over the spring of 2024, but really caught fire a few months later when actress Taraji P. Henson singled out Project 2025 while hosting the BET awards.   \"Pay attention. It's not a secret. Look it up!\" she said, speaking directly into the camera during the show. \"They are attacking our most vulnerable citizens. The Project 2025 plan is not a game.\"   \"Ridiculous\"   Then-candidate Trump tried to dismiss the hysteria, calling the ideas \"ridiculous\" — and claiming he did not know who was behind it — even though key people involved in developing the plans served in his first administration.   And when it was clear the firestorm would not go away, Trump went on the attack against those allies who wrote the playbook.   \"They're a pain in the a**,\" said Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, who tore into the organizers of Project 2025 at an event hosted by CNN and Politico during the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.   \"Look, I think that in the perfect world, from their perspective, they would love to drive the issue set, but they don't get to do that,\" he added.   Yet days after winning, Trump tapped Russell Vought, an architect of Project 2025, to lead the Office of Management and Budget — considered the nerve center of the White House. Other contributors followed.   \n   Trump soon unleashed a flurry of orders reshaping the government, many of which were outlined in Project 2025.   \"As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female,\" he said during his inaugural address.   Trump ended diversity, equity and inclusion programs. He launched massive immigration enforcement and took the first steps to overhaul the federal workforce.   Bonta, the attorney general of California, said Project 2025 defined Trump's first year back in office. The country's 23 Democratic attorneys general studied Project 2025, consulted with each other and, he said, prepared a response for every potential action should it be taken.   \"The existence of Project 2025 was the Trump administration telling us exactly what they were going to do and sending it to us in writing,\" Bonta said.   Bonta has filed or joined lawsuits that have successfully blocked Trump's policies requiring states like California to join his immigration crackdown, freeze of domestic federal funding and layoffs at agencies such as the U.S. Department of Education.   The White House dismissed concerns about Project 2025, calling them irrelevant theories from Beltway insiders.   \"President Trump is implementing the agenda he campaigned on and that the American people voted for,\" said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman.   Jackson said the president focused on implementing the agenda he campaigned on — lowering gas prices, accelerating economic growth and securing the border.   Fueling controversy   Trump may have actually fueled the controversy by rejecting Project 2025 during the campaign, said Tevi Troy, a presidential historian and former White House aide to George W. Bush.   \"I would say that Project 2025 was largely standard conservative fare, but with a bit more of a MAGA flavor than previously.\"   Troy sees little difference between what the Heritage Foundation did with Project 2025 and what think tanks on the left and right have been doing for years compiling policy proposals for incoming presidents.   \n   He pointed to the personnel and policy ideas of the Hoover Institution that helped shape the George W. Bush administration and the Center for American Progress' influence on the Obama administration.   \"If the Trump campaign had leaned into it and said, 'sure, this is an agenda that has been put out as a think tank. This happens all the time. We will look at them in due time when the election is over,' \" said Troy. \"By criticizing and disavowing Project 2025, it suddenly became more radioactive.\"   Paul Dans, the director of project 2025, says he never took the attacks personally, which he chalked up to political calculus.    He likened watching the president sign executive orders and directives that first came across his desk to being an animator who watches his or her sketchbook come to life on the big screen.   \"I believe the proof is in the pudding,\" said Dans, who also served in the first Trump administration. \"Every day that President Trump rolls out another Project 2025 item, it's really an endorsement of our work, myself and the work of thousands of patriots who came together.\"   Dans is now highlighting that work in a run for the Senate, against Trump-ally, Republican Lindsey Graham.   Trump did eventually embrace Project 2025 during the shutdown fight last fall.   He boasted of meeting with \"Russ Vought, he of PROJECT 2025 Fame,\" while threatening to dismantle federal agencies.   \"I can't believe the Radical Left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity,\" he said.\n",

    "body": "\n      President Trump announced fresh tariffs on European countries to pressure them on his desire to acquire Greenland. He travels to the World Economic Forum in Davos this week where tensions may be high.   \n\n    AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:  President Trump is back to using one of his favorite tools in an attempt to get what he wants. Yesterday, ahead of his trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump announced additional tariffs on eight NATO members resisting his plans to acquire Greenland. Joining me now is NPR White House correspondent Deepa Shivaram. Good morning, Deepa.DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: Good morning, Ayesha.RASCOE: So tell us more about these new tariffs.SHIVARAM: Yeah. So this is something the president floated Friday for the first time. I was actually at the White House when he said it during this event on rural health care. It was not related to Greenland at all, but he was talking about how he's used tariffs in the past to pressure other countries to work with his agenda. And then he said this.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland 'cause we need Greenland for national security. So I may do that.SHIVARAM: It was the first time he had said that, and then less than 24 hours later, he elaborated. In a post to social media yesterday, Trump said that Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland - which are all NATO allies, I will add - they will face new tariffs on goods sent to the U.S. And Trump says it would start at 10% starting next month, and then increase to 25% in June unless a deal is reached for the U.S. to purchase Greenland.Now, Trump's rhetoric on Greenland was already complicating relationships with European allies, and his tariff announcement is, as you can imagine, causing more tension. And it's happening ahead of Davos, like you said, where Trump is probably going to see the leaders of some of these EU nations and European nations. So, you know, in response, the Danish foreign minister said the tariff announcement came as a surprise, and ambassadors from EU nations are convening today in Brussels for an emergency meeting to respond to this.RASCOE: Does this reach for tariffs mean that Trump is less inclined to use military force, like he's threatened?SHIVARAM: Yeah. I would say it's a little unclear at this point. And just for context, I mean, this conversation has been going on for months now. Like, early on last year is when the president, you know, started bringing this issue up. It's been ongoing. What the president keeps saying is that the U.S. needs Greenland for national security reasons. He says if the U.S. doesn't take this territory, then China or Russia might, and that would give them the advantage. But Denmark, which is a nation in NATO - again, a really critical alliance - has control of Greenland, and they say they have no intention of giving it up. Leaders in Greenland have said they have no interest in being controlled by the U.S.It just seems like at this point, no matter how much officials in these areas - Greenland, Denmark, other countries - emphasize that the U.S. taking Greenland, whether it's purchasing it or by military force - they say it's unacceptable, and Trump just doesn't seem to want to hear that. And in the meantime, you know, things are tense. European countries, including France and Germany and Sweden, have sent over military units to Greenland to help boost security there.RASCOE: What are we expecting to hear from the president at this economic forum?SHIVARAM: Well, Trump has said in the last few weeks that he intends to announce his plan for more affordable housing while he's at Davos. He says he wants to lower home prices by getting private equity groups out of the housing market, but the rest of the specifics around that plan have not yet been released. And that announcement comes, Ayesha, as Trump is trying to tackle other topics around affordability. Remember, it is an election year. Midterms are coming, and the economy remains very top of mind for voters. Last month, there was a lot - a number of polls showing that Trump's rating on his handling of the economy have been really low. So he's trying to talk about saving costs.And in addition to talking about housing this coming week, he's also recently announced other plans. Last week, his health care plan was released. It's more of a broad framework, but he says it will reform things like drug pricing. I will say, though, there are criticisms around that plan - like I said, that it's too broad and that it doesn't do anything to address higher health insurance premiums that a lot of people are paying after Congress denied to extend a provision that would have kept those costs lower. So still some issues to tackle there.RASCOE: OK. So finally, stateside, it looks like President Trump may be moving away from his threat to use the Insurrection Act against Minneapolis, where an immigration crackdown has been met with sustained protest. Is it that Trump is focused elsewhere, or are there worries within the administration around public blowback?SHIVARAM: Yeah. I mean, look. On Friday, the president said he didn't think he needed to use the Insurrection Act, but I will note that he also said, you know, if he needed it, he would use it. So it's sort of that space where it's possible he's backing down on it. At the same time, it's not clear that he's, you know, ruled it out. But it is interesting to keep in mind that it's something that Trump keeps talking about. The last time a president invoked the Insurrection Act was back in the LA riots in the '90s. I will note, though, several news organizations are reporting that about 1,500 U.S. active-duty troops have been ordered to prepare for a possible deployment to Minnesota. NPR, though, has not independently confirmed those reports.RASCOE: That's NPR's White House correspondent Deepa Shivaram. Thank you so much.SHIVARAM: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

Today's top stories   Up to 1,500 active-duty troops in Alaska are on standby for possible deployment to Minnesota, a U.S. official informed NPR. This comes as the Trump administration has escalated pressure on the state, including threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act to suppress protests happening in Minneapolis. Anti-ICE protesters continued to take to the streets over the weekend, even as temperatures plummeted.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Minnesota Army National Guard soldiers post up along a freeway ramp ahead of anticipated protests on Jan. 17, in Minneapolis.

Attorney General Keith Ellison and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul sued the administration, calling its actions an unconstitutional federal invasion that violates the First and 10th amendments. Because Democrats do not control either chamber of Congress, they are pursuing legal channels in federal courts.   President Trump escalated tensions across Europe over the weekend with comments about the U.S. acquiring Greenland. He says the United States needs the territory for national security. On Saturday, he announced plans to impose a tariff on eight NATO allies until there is a deal for the U.S. to purchase Greenland. On Sunday, those eight nations convened an emergency meeting and warned that Trump's tariffs threaten a \"dangerous downward spiral\" for transatlantic relations.    \n   🎧 Lawmakers said multiple times this weekend that they haven't received any intelligence about an imminent threat to Greenland from Russia or China. Regarding U.S. national security, they point out that the Kingdom of Denmark and the U.S. already cooperate, and the U.S. already maintains a military presence in Greenland. NPR's Barbara Sprunt says on Saturday, thousands of people marched peacefully and passionately to the U.S. Embassy in Denmark. She says she saw many Greenland flags and red hats that said \"Make America Go Away.\"   Trump's board of peace for Gaza, advertised as a way to aid the region's reconstruction, now appears more expansive and expensive than initially stated. The president would serve as the board's chairman, with representatives from other nations. A copy of its charter, obtained by NPR, shows that the board claims power beyond Gaza. Trump has also asked other nations to pay at least $1 billion for the privilege of permanent representation.    🎧 The charter excludes the word \"Gaza,\" and instead appears to be a proposal for a rival United Nations Security Council that would handle world conflicts, says NPR's Daniel Estrin. The charter's language expresses a need for a more effective international peace building body, Estrin says. Critics argue that the president is trying to undermine the U.N. to make diplomacy transactional. Israel objects to Trump appointing representatives of Turkey and Qatar to be part of the leadership group because it sees those nations as primary Hamas backers. However, Israel acknowledges that it cannot block the move, and leaders there are skeptical that any international body can get Hamas to disarm.   \n   Life advice   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Kubkoo/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Introverts and extroverts can be good friends even though they move through the world differently.

Kahnweiler shares tips with Life Kit on how both personalities can foster deep connections despite differences.    👭 Don't pigeonhole a person as just an introvert or extrovert. Where they fall within that spectrum isn't static.👭If a friend's behavior is bugging you, consider if a personality difference might be behind it. Then, show them a little grace.👭 Create a code phrase or gesture to signal what you both need, such as a hand signal to remind your friend not to fill the silence.

Bishop Rob Hirschfeld was one of several community and faith leaders gathered in Concord, N.H., for a vigil for Renee Macklin Good just days after she was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis.    \n   Hirschfeld called out the \"cruelty, the injustice and the horror … unleashed in Minneapolis,\" and warned his clergy to prepare for \"a new era of martyrdom.\"   \"I've asked them to get their affairs in order to make sure they have their wills written,\" he said, \"because it may be that now is no longer the time for statements, but for us with our bodies to stand between the powers of this world and the most vulnerable.\"   Hirschfeld's comments quickly went viral.   \n   \"I was actually quite surprised to open up my phone and find my social media blowing up with my own bishop on it,\" said Reverend Jason Wells of St. Matthews Epsicopal Church in Goffstown, N.H.   Wells, a community organizer who regularly prays outside ICE offices, said he and many others took it as a great relief – and a validation of sorts – to hear the bishop speaking openly about the mounting anxiety felt by faith leaders around the nation who've been stepping up their public prayers and protests against ICE, and getting pelted with pepper rounds, roughed up and arrested.   \"People feel like he's giving voice to a feeling in the pit of their stomach about what is going on,\" said Wells. \"It's a relief to hear him naming a concern that I've had on my mind for a while.\"   \n   The Reverend Betsy Hess of St. Barnabas Episcopal Church in Berlin, N.H. added her voice to the chorus of \"amens\" and immediately emailed the bishop to thank him.   Hess believes clergy \"need to quit just being polite Episcopalians, and get out there and do stuff.\" But exactly what she would do, and what level of risk she's willing to take, is something she's still figuring out.   \"It used to be that … you might go to jail, and now you might get shot! So it makes us need to be a lot more brave,\" she said. \"I hope I would be brave, but I can't promise that I would be able to. But definitely, it's time to move beyond 'I won't do anything that has any risk whatsoever.'\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A priest claps as protesters conitnue anti-ICE demonstrations in Los Angeles, California, on June 9, 2025.\n                \n                    David Pashaee/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        David Pashaee/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty\n    \n\n   \n   Others, however, took issue with the bishop's words.   \n   \"My initial reaction is 'Oh boy, this isn't diffusing tension at all. This feels like a war cry,\" said the Reverend Tom Gartin of Faith Episcopal Church who heard about the bishop's comments from his parish in Cameron Park, California.   \"I didn't sign up to be a martyr,\" he said. \"I have a family and a congregation who rely on me. If I was gone tomorrow what would happen to them?\"   Gartin also bristled at the idea of the bishop making the case for physical resistance, based on the bishop's argument that mere statements have not \"moved the needle one bit.\" He sees the bishop's message as \"inflammatory,\" and at odds with one of Episcopalians' guiding tenets – Via Media – that calls for finding a middle path between extremes.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Demonstrators, including many clergy, protest near the immigration processing and detention facility on Oct. 10, 2025 in Broadview, Illinois.\n                \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Scott Olson/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Gartin said the focus of church leadership should be \"to do the work of peacemaking and to deescalate the tension we've seen all around us.\"   \"We're called to do the work of peacemaking and to deescalate the tension we see all around us because it doesn't serve anyone to become the next victim,\" he said, \"but it does serve everyone to build the next bridge.\"   Hirschfeld said he was surprised by the stir his comments created.   \"I don't feel like I said anything that was new,\" he said in an interview with NPR. \"In no way did I intend anything I said to be inciteful of violence or to invite it.\"   Hirschfeld said he understands how some may be hearing his words in ways he didn't intend, but he stands by his message.   \"What I said to the clergy (was) 'I'm just asking you to live your life without fear of death. Be prepared. I'm not asking you to go look for that bullet,'\" He said. \"I'm simply saying be ready, have your affairs in order, have your soul ready, in case you find yourself in trouble.\"   \n   That, Hirschfeld said, is the Episcopal tradition. At the vigil where he made his initial remarks, he listed several church activists who became martyrs, including Jonathan Daniels, a New Hampshire native and seminary student who travelled to Alabama in 1965 to help integrate public places and register Black voters. He took a bullet to protect a black teenager he accompanied.   \"Not everyone can be a Jonathan Daniels,\" Hirschfeld said, but \"we're increasingly called to go into places that feel dangerous.\"   That could be anything, he said, from his venture into the home of a neighbor whose political yard signs made him feel unsafe, to attending public demonstrations against ICE.   \"I increasingly wonder when I go to these rallies or even a peaceful vigil. There are people driving by, honking their horns,\" he said. \"I see people with guns in New Hampshire, this is an open-carry state, and it doesn't necessarily lend itself to a feeling of security and safety. But does that mean I shouldn't show up? I don't think so. I think it means I go and I should be prepared for whatever happens.\"   In a statement to NPR, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said interfering with federal law enforcement is a crime and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. The administration maintains the ICE agent who shot Renee Macklin Good was acting in self-defense.   DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called Hirschfeld's comments about martyrdom \"absurd,\" saying if he \"really wanted to take a stand for the vulnerable\" he would stand by the ICE agents who increasingly are under attack.   Hirschfeld said he does feel compassion for those agents.   \"It's definitely our Christian responsibility to extend love even to our enemies,\" he said, and to love all God's children, even those who may be \"swept up in a maelstrom of hatred and fear and power that is not godly.\"   \n   Hirschfeld added, \"I pray for everyone's conversion of heart.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      Stephen Fowler is NPR's go to reporter for document dumps. He explains how he approaches the day's biggest stories...and its most perplexing datasets.   \n\n    SARAH MCCAMMON, HOST:  If you've spent any time on the internet over the past few years, you've probably heard the name Jeffrey Epstein and the mystery surrounding the files tied to his case. Last month, just a few days before Christmas, some of those records were officially released. Not a handful of documents, but tens of thousands of pages - court filings, emails, photos, all landing at once and instantly lighting up social media, cable news and conspiracy theories.STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: When the first batch of files were released, well, the thing that I thought was something that I can't say on the radio.MCCAMMON: That's Stephen Fowler. He's a political reporter based in Atlanta. We worked together on NPR's Washington Desk.FOWLER: There are a few of us that had started combing through the documents as soon as they came out. We had to download them. We had to file, organize them and sort them and make sure we didn't miss anything, count the total number of pages and documents to see if there was anything missing or anything that needed to be formatted a different way.MCCAMMON: Sorting through that kind of data is exactly what Stephen does. He's become our go-to reporter for digging into large document dumps from government data to the Epstein files to figure out what they actually show and, just as importantly, what they don't show. And I'll admit, I picked up that beat for a day or two during the holidays when everybody was kind of jumping in on whatever needed to be done, and it is a lot of work. So for this week's Reporter's Notebook, I wanted to ask Stephen about his process. Where does he start when these files are released, and how does he go through them? It turns out the work starts long before those documents drop.FOWLER: We did have a story ready to go, saying, hey, the Justice Department has started releasing Epstein files, that we already had in advance of the backstory of how we got to this point, what the law said, directing the release, the political fallout for it. So we didn't really start from scratch.MCCAMMON: How do you go about going through these tens of thousands of pages and just figuring out what's there and what is important?FOWLER: So that prep work that I talked about was important because we didn't know what was going to be released, when it was going to be released, how it was going to be released - things like what file format it would be, if there were going to be pictures or PDFs or videos or anything like that. But we did know that there were tens of thousands of other files that had been made public already - court cases, Freedom of Information Act requests from other agencies. There were files on the FBI's vault and Epstein's private files that were turned over to Congress through a subpoena. So those of us that were looking methodically through these pages had a baseline to look at to understand what was already out there, what it looked like, and to be able to determine, is this new? Oh, this is redacted. Oh, that's a copy of the same email chain that we saw 10 pages ago, so move on to the next thing.There was a spreadsheet that we had and a Slack chat of notable pages and mentions and files that were being uncovered so that we could go back and track and document. And so everything that you saw online or heard people talk about on the air about the Epstein files, there was somebody that personally laid eyes on that document and what it said and made sure that it is, in fact, what it said, and here's where you could find it.MCCAMMON: Yeah, I mean, that was one of the challenges, at least that - during that brief time that I was working with some of these files. You know, a lot of it - I mean, this was taken - these were files that the Justice Department had received from all kinds of people in all kinds of places, right? And just even figuring out what's legitimate was tough.FOWLER: Yeah. I - this is where there were a lot of challenges because the files that were released were not in any sort of order, any sort of organization. There was no road map. There was no table of contents. There was no asterisk or disclaimer to say, hey, by the way, we have to release this by law, but it's actually something that's not true, which is actually something we ran into. There were files that were in there that were submitted tips from the public that contained conspiracy theories about Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein and other things that were completely unverifiable and unvetted, but they were part of the case file that were supposed to be released by law, so they were released. So it made it really, really hard to know what exactly we were looking at.Another thing that made it hard to look at, Sarah, was the sheer volume of things that were redacted. I mean, there were pages and pages where all you could see was black boxes. There was no hidden word there or, you know, this part here. There were just complete pages that were just completely blacked out and blank. So it was difficult to glean information from black rectangles.There was, however, an email sent by federal agents after Epstein was arrested in 2019 for allegedly sex trafficking minors. It mentioned 10 possible co-conspirators, including Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. Most of the other names on that list are redacted, and the law made it clear that information like that should be released if it was there. So really, the big story coming out of the Epstein files ended up being all of the information and files and possibilities that were not released.MCCAMMON: Now, it wasn't just the Epstein files. You also got to dig through some files from DOGE, which I think we all still remember was the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. You were really active in sorting through those during the first few months of Trump's second term. And you broke some news. I mean, tell me more about that. How did you go about looking through those DOGE files?FOWLER: Well, it's a lot different looking at federal government data than a bunch of disjointed documents and files from court cases and things. I mean, the federal government - I don't know if people realize this - has one of the richest and most thorough and easily accessible datasets for things you could imagine. Anything you think of that the government does or thinks about, there is probably a dataset probably sitting there waiting for you to download it. The trick is knowing what you're looking at and how it's used.So over the course of last year, I tracked the change in federal spending data, tens of thousands of alterations to federal contracts under DOGE. There was federal leasing statistics, other things like that that I looked at to understand how the government was working or wasn't working and if DOGE was actually doing the things it claimed it was doing. I mean, showing your work looks a lot different, too, because with the Epstein files, you can say, hey, on this page with this file number, this thing was said.With DOGE data, there were so many spreadsheets. I mean, my editors can tell you - spreadsheet on spreadsheet on spreadsheet that had meticulous calculations that came from on-record and background interviews with all these different experts in these areas to make sure that I understood what I was looking at. And did I mention there were spreadsheets? And so it took a lot of effort to be able to show the work and make sure that I knew what I was looking at so then I could tell the audience what we're looking at.I think the biggest example of that was DOGE's infamous wall of receipts. It was the website where DOGE still claims to track how much taxpayer money it saved through its changes. The data DOGE was putting out there didn't match the source data that the federal government put out. There were overstatements and errors and inaccuracies, and that took a lot of time and effort to kind of - to sort of compare these data sources to get to the truth behind things.MCCAMMON: What else has all of this data reporting during this first year of Trump's second term - what has it taught you about how to cover this moment in politics and what it might mean?FOWLER: I think it's even more important to show the work, to bring receipts and to give people those primary sources that I've been using to do this coverage. One, I want people to trust the reporting and trust what I have to say, and they can see for themselves how I got there and also kind of peel back the curtain for the public to learn how to look at this information on their own. And also, numbers are hard to bring to the radio. If you put too many of them out there, people's eyes start to gloss over. If you have too few, you risk kind of underselling your findings and leaving out important context.So spending the last year really grounding a lot of my reporting in this data - even if not every story starts out with a, here's this insert number fact here to use - I mean, it does help contextualize the scope or the scale or significance of what's going on in politics, whether it's the small fraction of Epstein files or the 58th lawmaker retiring or federal spending.MCCAMMON: That's Stephen Fowler, a political reporter with NPR's Washington Desk.

The message was reported by PBS NewsHour, and was later confirmed by Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre in a statement.   Gahr Støre said he received the message on Sunday in response to a text he and Finland's President Alexander Stubb had sent to Trump, in which they had conveyed opposition to Trump's proposed tariff increases on eight European countries over the recent Greenland dispute.   In their message to Trump, according to The New York Times, which received a copy of the exchange from the Norwegian prime minister's office, Gahr Støre and Stubb wrote: \"We believe we all should work to take this down and de-escalate — so much is happening around us where we need to stand together.\" The pair suggested a joint call   \n   \"Norway's position on Greenland is clear. Greenland is a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and Norway fully supports the Kingdom of Denmark on this matter,\" Gahr Støre said. \"We also support that NATO in a responsible way is taking steps to strengthen security and stability in the Arctic.\"   Gahr Støre also pointed out that while President Trump claimed that Norway \"decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize,\" the government of Norway is not responsible for the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize. The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded by a five member Norwegian Nobel Committee since 1901.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Danish navy's inspection ship HDMS Vaedderen sails off Nuuk, Greenland, on Sunday, Jan. 18, 2026.\n                \n                    Mads Claus Rasmussen/Ritzau Scanpix Foto/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mads Claus Rasmussen/Ritzau Scanpix Foto/AP\n    \n\n   \n   The Peace Prize, which was last awarded to Venezuela's opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, is also awarded for the previous year. That means the most recent prize was awarded for 2024, before President Trump commenced his second term of office. Machado gave Trump her prize last week as a symbolic thank you for his recent actions in Venezuela.   \n   In a phone interview with NBC News on Monday, Trump again claimed that the Norwegian government has control over the Nobel Peace Prize. \"Norway totally controls it despite what they say,\" he said. Trump also said he would follow through on his threats to impose further tariffs. When asked whether he would use force to seize Greenland, the president replied: \"No comment.\"   The European Union is set to hold an emergency summit on Thursday, in which attendees will discuss how to respond to the threats. In a statement on social media, the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the bloc had \"no interest to pick a fight\" but would \"hold our ground.\"   Trump's message to Gahr Støre comes as tensions rise between Europe and the United States over the status of Greenland, an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark that is strategically important and rich in resources.   \n   On Monday, the World Economic Forum said officials from Denmark would not be attending the meeting in Davos, Switzerland, this week. \"We can confirm that the Danish government will not be represented in Davos this week,\" a spokesperson, Alem Tedeneke, told NPR.   On Sunday, in a collective rebuke to President Trump, the leaders of Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom issued a joint statement condemning recent U.S. tariff threats. The eight countries, which are all members of NATO, said that Trump's proposed tariffs \"undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.\"   On Saturday night, President Trump had written on his Truth Social social media platform that he would impose tariffs on imports from the countries, after they had deployed limited military personnel to Greenland to participate in a Danish-led Arctic exercise known as 'Arctic Endurance.'   Trump said America would levy a 10% tariff on goods from the eight countries starting on Feb. 1, which would rise to 25% on June 1, and remain in place \"until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland\" by the United States.   \n   The open dispute comes after weeks of increasingly assertive U.S. rhetoric regarding Greenland, in which Trump has repeatedly said that Greenland is strategically vital to U.S. national security, citing its location and untapped mineral deposits.   In his text message, Trump questioned Denmark's right to claim Greenland. \"Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a 'right of ownership' anyway? There are no written documents, it's only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also,\" Trump said.   Trump made similar comments last week, saying \"the fact that they had a boat land there 500 years ago doesn't mean that they own the land,\" drawing mirth on social media, with comedians like Jon Stewart noting on The Daily Show \"how do you think we got our land?\"\n",

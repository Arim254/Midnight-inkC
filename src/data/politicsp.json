In the statement, leaders of the eight countries underscored their commitment to shared NATO goals, saying that they stood in \"full solidarity\" with Denmark and Greenland. They also reaffirmed their willingness to \"engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity\" in response to President Trump's repeated threats to take control of Greenland, which is currently an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark.   \n   On Saturday night, President Trump had written on his Truth Social platform that he would impose tariffs on imports from the eight countries. Trump's words came after the countries, which are all in NATO, deployed military personnel to Greenland in recent days, to participate in a Danish-led Arctic exercise known as 'Arctic Endurance'.   Trump said America would levy a 10 percent tariff on goods from the eight countries starting on February 1. He claimed those tariffs would rise to 25 percent on June 1, and remain in place \"until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland\" by the United States.   In their joint response, the eight NATO countries said that Trump's proposed tariffs \"undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.\"   \n   \"As members of NATO, we are committed to strengthening Arctic security as a shared transatlantic interest,\" the leaders said. \"The pre-coordinated Danish exercise 'Arctic Endurance' conducted with Allies, responds to this necessity. It poses no threat to anyone.\"   The coordinated statement reflects an unusually explicit diplomatic pushback by key U.S. allies. In addition, some individual European leaders issued their own individual criticisms.   British Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the use of tariffs against allies, calling it \"completely wrong\". A spokesman for the UK Prime Minister later said Starmer had shared this view with President Trump in a phone call on Sunday. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said Sweden would not be \"blackmailed,\" while Norway's prime minister stressed that \"threats have no place among allies.\"   \n   Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen also made a statement, praising \"great support\" from European allies. \"I am pleased with the consistent messages from the rest of the continent: Europe will not be blackmailed,\" Frederiksen said.   European foreign policy leaders made clear that trade coercion would harm the broader transatlantic relationship and potentially derail other ongoing negotiations.   One unnamed French official close to Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot told NPR that Paris had mobilized its diplomatic apparatus \"to coordinate a European response to the new, unacceptable tariff threats issued by President Trump.\"   The official added that Barrot had been in talks with his British, German and EU counterparts and was in contact with all affected foreign ministers and European Parliament political groups.   Ordinary citizens have also registered their opposition to President Trump's recent threats, with large protests in Denmark and Greenland against American pressure alongside the broader NATO debates about Arctic security as well as the diplomatic scramble.   In his social media post on Saturday, Trump framed Europe's actions as part of \"a very dangerous situation\" and argued the tariffs were necessary to protect \"Global Peace and Security\" – language that has been widely challenged by European officials and analysts as exaggerated or unfounded given the context of NATO cooperation in the Arctic.   \n   This latest tariff standoff follows weeks of increasingly assertive U.S. rhetoric regarding Greenland and Arctic policy. Trump has repeatedly declared Greenland — a vast, sparsely populated territory — as strategically vital to U.S. national security, citing its location and untapped mineral resources.   Greenlandic and Danish leaders have consistently pushed back, insisting the territory is not for sale, most recently during discussions between the two countries' foreign ministers and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.   Domestically, the tariff decision has sparked pushback not only abroad but among U.S. lawmakers. Bi-partisan voices in Congress have criticized the approach as damaging to NATO cohesion, and warned that it could jeopardize U.S. credibility.   \n   Analysts have pointed out that the United States already maintains a military presence in Greenland, which has shrunk dramatically over the decades, and so question the necessity of coercive economic measures tied to territorial ambitions.\n",

    "body": "\n      President Trump announced fresh tariffs on European countries to pressure them on his desire to acquire Greenland. He travels to the World Economic Forum in Davos this week where tensions may be high.   \n\n    AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:  President Trump is back to using one of his favorite tools in an attempt to get what he wants. Yesterday, ahead of his trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump announced additional tariffs on eight NATO members resisting his plans to acquire Greenland. Joining me now is NPR White House correspondent Deepa Shivaram. Good morning, Deepa.DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: Good morning, Ayesha.RASCOE: So tell us more about these new tariffs.SHIVARAM: Yeah. So this is something the president floated Friday for the first time. I was actually at the White House when he said it during this event on rural health care. It was not related to Greenland at all, but he was talking about how he's used tariffs in the past to pressure other countries to work with his agenda. And then he said this.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland 'cause we need Greenland for national security. So I may do that.SHIVARAM: It was the first time he had said that, and then less than 24 hours later, he elaborated. In a post to social media yesterday, Trump said that Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland - which are all NATO allies, I will add - they will face new tariffs on goods sent to the U.S. And Trump says it would start at 10% starting next month, and then increase to 25% in June unless a deal is reached for the U.S. to purchase Greenland.Now, Trump's rhetoric on Greenland was already complicating relationships with European allies, and his tariff announcement is, as you can imagine, causing more tension. And it's happening ahead of Davos, like you said, where Trump is probably going to see the leaders of some of these EU nations and European nations. So, you know, in response, the Danish foreign minister said the tariff announcement came as a surprise, and ambassadors from EU nations are convening today in Brussels for an emergency meeting to respond to this.RASCOE: Does this reach for tariffs mean that Trump is less inclined to use military force, like he's threatened?SHIVARAM: Yeah. I would say it's a little unclear at this point. And just for context, I mean, this conversation has been going on for months now. Like, early on last year is when the president, you know, started bringing this issue up. It's been ongoing. What the president keeps saying is that the U.S. needs Greenland for national security reasons. He says if the U.S. doesn't take this territory, then China or Russia might, and that would give them the advantage. But Denmark, which is a nation in NATO - again, a really critical alliance - has control of Greenland, and they say they have no intention of giving it up. Leaders in Greenland have said they have no interest in being controlled by the U.S.It just seems like at this point, no matter how much officials in these areas - Greenland, Denmark, other countries - emphasize that the U.S. taking Greenland, whether it's purchasing it or by military force - they say it's unacceptable, and Trump just doesn't seem to want to hear that. And in the meantime, you know, things are tense. European countries, including France and Germany and Sweden, have sent over military units to Greenland to help boost security there.RASCOE: What are we expecting to hear from the president at this economic forum?SHIVARAM: Well, Trump has said in the last few weeks that he intends to announce his plan for more affordable housing while he's at Davos. He says he wants to lower home prices by getting private equity groups out of the housing market, but the rest of the specifics around that plan have not yet been released. And that announcement comes, Ayesha, as Trump is trying to tackle other topics around affordability. Remember, it is an election year. Midterms are coming, and the economy remains very top of mind for voters. Last month, there was a lot - a number of polls showing that Trump's rating on his handling of the economy have been really low. So he's trying to talk about saving costs.And in addition to talking about housing this coming week, he's also recently announced other plans. Last week, his health care plan was released. It's more of a broad framework, but he says it will reform things like drug pricing. I will say, though, there are criticisms around that plan - like I said, that it's too broad and that it doesn't do anything to address higher health insurance premiums that a lot of people are paying after Congress denied to extend a provision that would have kept those costs lower. So still some issues to tackle there.RASCOE: OK. So finally, stateside, it looks like President Trump may be moving away from his threat to use the Insurrection Act against Minneapolis, where an immigration crackdown has been met with sustained protest. Is it that Trump is focused elsewhere, or are there worries within the administration around public blowback?SHIVARAM: Yeah. I mean, look. On Friday, the president said he didn't think he needed to use the Insurrection Act, but I will note that he also said, you know, if he needed it, he would use it. So it's sort of that space where it's possible he's backing down on it. At the same time, it's not clear that he's, you know, ruled it out. But it is interesting to keep in mind that it's something that Trump keeps talking about. The last time a president invoked the Insurrection Act was back in the LA riots in the '90s. I will note, though, several news organizations are reporting that about 1,500 U.S. active-duty troops have been ordered to prepare for a possible deployment to Minnesota. NPR, though, has not independently confirmed those reports.RASCOE: That's NPR's White House correspondent Deepa Shivaram. Thank you so much.SHIVARAM: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

Bishop Rob Hirschfeld was one of several community and faith leaders gathered in Concord, N.H., for a vigil for Renee Macklin Good just days after she was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis.    \n   Hirschfeld called out the \"cruelty, the injustice and the horror … unleashed in Minneapolis,\" and warned his clergy to prepare for \"a new era of martyrdom.\"   \"I've asked them to get their affairs in order to make sure they have their wills written,\" he said, \"because it may be that now is no longer the time for statements, but for us with our bodies to stand between the powers of this world and the most vulnerable.\"   Hirschfeld's comments quickly went viral.   \n   \"I was actually quite surprised to open up my phone and find my social media blowing up with my own bishop on it,\" said Reverend Jason Wells of St. Matthews Epsicopal Church in Goffstown, N.H.   Wells, a community organizer who regularly prays outside ICE offices, said he and many others took it as a great relief – and a validation of sorts – to hear the bishop speaking openly about the mounting anxiety felt by faith leaders around the nation who've been stepping up their public prayers and protests against ICE, and getting pelted with pepper rounds, roughed up and arrested.   \"People feel like he's giving voice to a feeling in the pit of their stomach about what is going on,\" said Wells. \"It's a relief to hear him naming a concern that I've had on my mind for a while.\"   \n   The Reverend Betsy Hess of St. Barnabas Episcopal Church in Berlin, N.H. added her voice to the chorus of \"amens\" and immediately emailed the bishop to thank him.   Hess believes clergy \"need to quit just being polite Episcopalians, and get out there and do stuff.\" But exactly what she would do, and what level of risk she's willing to take, is something she's still figuring out.   \"It used to be that … you might go to jail, and now you might get shot! So it makes us need to be a lot more brave,\" she said. \"I hope I would be brave, but I can't promise that I would be able to. But definitely, it's time to move beyond 'I won't do anything that has any risk whatsoever.'\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A priest claps as protesters conitnue anti-ICE demonstrations in Los Angeles, California, on June 9, 2025.\n                \n                    David Pashaee/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        David Pashaee/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty\n    \n\n   \n   Others, however, took issue with the bishop's words.   \n   \"My initial reaction is 'Oh boy, this isn't diffusing tension at all. This feels like a war cry,\" said the Reverend Tom Gartin of Faith Episcopal Church who heard about the bishop's comments from his parish in Cameron Park, California.   \"I didn't sign up to be a martyr,\" he said. \"I have a family and a congregation who rely on me. If I was gone tomorrow what would happen to them?\"   Gartin also bristled at the idea of a preacher making the case for physical resistance. Based on his assessment, mere statements have not \"moved the needle one bit.\" He sees the bishop's message as \"inflammatory,\" and at odds with one of Episcopalians' guiding tenets – Via Media – that calls for finding a middle path between extremes.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Demonstrators, including many clergy, protest near the immigration processing and detention facility on Oct. 10, 2025 in Broadview, Illinois.\n                \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Scott Olson/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Gartin said the focus of church leadership should be \"to do the work of peacemaking and to deescalate the tension we've seen all around us.\"   \"We're called to do the work of peacemaking and to deescalate the tension we see all around us because it doesn't serve anyone to become the next victim,\" he said, \"but it does serve everyone to build the next bridge.\"   Hirschfeld said he was surprised by the stir his comments created.   \"I don't feel like I said anything that was new,\" he said in an interview with NPR. \"In no way did I intend anything I said to be inciteful of violence or to invite it.\"   Hirschfeld said he understands how some may be hearing his words in ways he didn't intend, but he stands by his message.   \"What I said to the clergy (was) 'I'm just asking you to live your life without fear of death. Be prepared. I'm not asking you to go look for that bullet,'\" He said. \"I'm simply saying be ready, have your affairs in order, have your soul ready, in case you find yourself in trouble.\"   \n   That, Hirschfeld said, is the Episcopal tradition. At the vigil where he made his initial remarks, he listed several church activists who became martyrs, including Jonathan Daniels, a New Hampshire native and seminary student who travelled to Alabama in 1965 to help integrate public places and register Black voters. He took a bullet to protect a black teenager he accompanied.   \"Not everyone can be a Jonathan Daniels,\" Hirschfeld said, but \"we're increasingly called to go into places that feel dangerous.\"   That could be anything, he said, from his venture into the home of a neighbor whose political yard signs made him feel unsafe, to attending public demonstrations against ICE.   \"I increasingly wonder when I go to these rallies or even a peaceful vigil. There are people driving by, honking their horns,\" he said. \"I see people with guns in New Hampshire, this is an open-carry state, and it doesn't necessarily lend itself to a feeling of security and safety. But does that mean I shouldn't show up? I don't think so. I think it means I go and I should be prepared for whatever happens.\"   In a statement to NPR, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said interfering with federal law enforcement is a crime and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. The administration maintains the ICE agent who shot Renee Macklin Good was acting in self-defense.   DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called Hirschfeld's comments about martyrdom \"absurd,\" saying if he \"really wanted to take a stand for the vulnerable\" he would stand by the ICE agents who increasingly are under attack.   Hirschfeld said he does feel compassion for those agents.   \"It's definitely our Christian responsibility to extend love even to our enemies,\" he said, and to love all God's children, even those who may be \"swept up in a maelstrom of hatred and fear and power that is not godly.\"   \n   Hirschfeld added, \"I pray for everyone's conversion of heart.\"\n",

The crowd, waving Greenlandic flags, chanted \"Greenland is not for sale.\" Many demonstrators wore red hats in Trump's own \"Make America great again\" fashion that read, \"Make America go away.\"   Trump has continued to endorse the idea of acquiring Greenland, which he says the U.S. needs for national security purposes. The U.S. already has a military presence on the island.   \"One way or the other, we're going to have Greenland,\" Trump told reporters recently on Air Force One.   \n   Saturday's protest came on the heels of a bipartisan congressional delegation that travelled to Copenhagen. House and Senate lawmakers met with Danish and Greenlandic officials, as well as members of the Danish business community. The visit was meant to be a reassurance tour — affirming the longstanding relationship between the U.S. and the Kingdom of Denmark in the face of Trump's rhetoric.   \n   Peder Dam, who lives in Denmark, attended the demonstration with a sign that featured an image of Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker from Star Wars that read: \"Americans: I know there is good in you. Come back to sanity.\"   \"We know what is going on in the White House is not representative for all Americans,\" he told NPR.    But he said he wonders why there isn't more widespread outrage from the American public.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Peder Dam attended the protest alongside his son Gorm. They each carried signs: one with a cartoon of Trump stepping on leggos with a caption that read: \"Denmark is small, but we fight with what we have\"; and another with an image of Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker from Star Wars that read: \"Americans: I know there is good in you. Come back to sanity.\"\n                \n                    Barbara Sprunt/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Barbara Sprunt/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"I can't understand. If my government said they would attack Sweden, then Denmark would step up and protest that,\" he said. \"I like protests in the U.S. But why aren't there more normal, average Americans stepping up, trying to protest what is going on? It's crazy.\"   Another demonstrator, Thomas, whom NPR is identifying only by his first name because of concerns about retaliation at work, said the march represents \"an unseen level of resentment towards the U.S.\"    \"I cannot express how deeply disappointed I am — that we have sent our troops to die with you in Iraq, we were with you in Afghanistan,\" he said. \"How dare you turn your back on us in this way?\"   \n   He said while he thinks Americans might not believe that Trump will actually invade Greenland, that's a skepticism that people in the Kingdom of Denmark can't afford.   \"I don't think it's going to happen, but we don't know,\" he said. \"And that's creating an unprecedented level of emotional uncertainty and political uncertainty.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                One demonstrator held up a sign that read: \"Trump: Your need for megalomaniac legacy needs a psychiatrist — not Greenland.\" Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Copenhagen Saturday, protesting against Trump's rhetoric surrounding the proposed U.S. acquisition Greenland.\n                \n                    Barbara Sprunt/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Barbara Sprunt/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Naja Mathilde Rosing said the march felt intensely personal. She and her family are from Greenland.   \"We are here to show solidarity, that we do not wish to be a part of the United States,\" she told NPR. \"We are strong as we are, and we are not interested in having anything to do with America.\"   She pushed back on Trump's claims that Russia and China are encircling Greenland, claiming it's a red herring. The U.S. congressional delegation told reporters that there's no intelligence suggesting that, either.   Rosing said the idea itself of purchasing Greenland is offensive to indigenous communities, who she said respect the land and don't see it as something you can own.   \"America has a sense of feeling they can steal land from the Native Americans, steal land from the indigenous Hawaiian people, steal land from the indigenous Inuit from Alaska,\" she said. \"You cannot buy Greenland, you cannot buy a people. It is so wrong, disrespectful to think that you can purchase a country and a people.\"   Charlotte Holm lives in Copenhagen but has family in Greenland.   \"They're so scared,\" she said. \"They're afraid because they don't know what's going to happen to their society.\"   She said the message to the U.S. is simple: \"Leave them alone. Go focus on the Epstein files, go focus on the midterm elections.\"   She said she hopes Trump will \"get obsessed with something else\" but worries about the ripple effect of any possible U.S. encroachment into Greenland.   \n   \"It's going to reshape fundamentally the world order if he does. NATO's going to implode,\" she said, echoing similar comments from Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. \"We need American citizens to call their Republican representatives and tell them we need to take care of NATO, because if we go across that line, there's no going back. You can't put the toothpaste back into the tube.\"\n",

Ron, thanks for being with us.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.SIMON: I want to ask you - a new poll just out, about a year into Donald Trump's presidency, it finds that 58% of those polled think his first year of his second term has not been a success. Fifty-six percent find the fatal shooting of Renee Good an inappropriate use of force, and less than a third say that ICE operations have made America's cities safer. What do you see in these findings?ELVING: A lot of warning signs for a second-term president facing a fall that brings midterm elections for Congress. And it's not only CNN. The same message comes from other media polls and academic polls. The Associated Press works with people who compile a great deal of public opinion data. Their latest poll shows some erosion, even among Republicans, on some issues. Immigration was his best issue all last year, but even that's underwater for him now. Just 38% approve of his handling of immigration since the last ICE raids in that poll. Yet what is most striking is the disapproval on parts of Trump's foreign policy. It's rare to see any national polling question get a 60% negative response. But the idea of taking Greenland by force is opposed by nearly 70% of Americans.SIMON: And given these poll numbers, why do you think almost no change in course from the White House a year in?ELVING: There have been some efforts to vary the program, if not really change course. The president has changed tactics on household affordability as an issue, saying it's something to take seriously, proposing means of lowering home prices. In response to other controversies, the president has backed off on some of his threats. He hasn't struck Iran yet. He has not declared a state of emergency in Minnesota, as we just heard from Kat. But I'm reminded of two three-word phrases that we heard a lot in the first Trump term. One was flood the zone, and the other was audience of one. Flood the zone meant that if there was a bad story in the news, the best way to handle it was to blow it away with a flurry of actions or statements that were sure to grab attention.So whether the bad story is the Epstein files or the battles over ICE, we are suddenly seeing lots of unexpected stories. We mentioned Greenland and the tariffs, and now the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Jerome Powell, is being investigated. We mentioned the Minnesota governor and mayor of Minneapolis being investigated, possibly charged with obstructing, but no investigation yet for the ICE agent who shot an unarmed woman four times in that city. And as for the audience of one, it's clear that much is said and done in this White House and this administration with just one mind in mind.SIMON: What signals do you see about this administration's plans for Iran?ELVING: Those plans are not entirely clear at this point, but the president has sent an aircraft carrier battle group to the area and done a lot of saber-rattling, not unlike what he did before the incursion into Venezuela. Late in the week, the president backed off a bit on this one, too, after Iran withdrew its threatened mass executions of protesters. The death toll is already in the thousands there. But both the mullahs in Tehran and the president in Washington seem to have heard from allies and partners in the Arab world and elsewhere, all trying to lower the tension, prevent a U.S. strike, and one argument being that such a strike would worsen the situation without solving it. And those entreaties may have been heard and heeded, at least for the moment.SIMON: Finally, this week, Ron, what are your thoughts on the Nobel Peace Prize that President Trump seemed to acquire this week?ELVING: The Nobel Committee made it clear the prize was still María Corina Machado's to keep but not to give away. She did give the president the medal that went with the prize. That was surely a measure of how much she wanted to please and placate the president and a measure of her willingness to sacrifice for her cause and, we might add, a measure of her savvy in dealing with a certain audience of one.SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving. As always, a pleasure to talk to you, my friend. Talk to you later. Take care.ELVING: Thank you, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      It's been a challenging year for the consumer watchdog agency, as the Trump administration has tried to deny it funding and lay off most of its staff.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  This first year of the second Trump administration has been especially tough for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The agency is supposed to investigate fraud, but instead, it's mostly been dealing with work stoppages, layoffs and funding threats. NPR's Stephan Bisaha reports on the yearlong attempt to dismantle the government watchdog.STEPHAN BISAHA, BYLINE: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is probably best known for going after banking giants, like accusing Wells Fargo of doing things like illegally seizing homes and cars and fining the bank billions of dollars. But really, the agency's watchdog duties cover a lot more.LISA ROSENTHAL: Everybody that affects your wallet and your bank account.BISAHA: Lisa Rosenthal's 12-year career as an investigator and manager at the CFPB gives a sense of that scope.ROSENTHAL: I focused on payday loan victims.BISAHA: The auto finance market.ROSENTHAL: The federal student loan market.BISAHA: And debt collectors. And since it's been created, the CFPB's returned nearly $20 billion to consumers.So it sounds like you take a lot of pride in the work you did.ROSENTHAL: I take a lot of pride in the work that we did as a - you know, as an institution.BISAHA: Congress created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2010 after the 2008 financial crisis. Basically, it took the consumer protection duties of other agencies and put them under one roof, along with new supervising and rule-making powers. But throughout the past year, the Trump administration has tried to dismantle the agency through layoffs and cutting off funds. To do that, Trump made one of the CFPB's biggest critics the agency's acting director, Russell Vought.(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE CHARLIE KIRK SHOW\")RUSSELL VOUGHT: All they want to do is weaponize the tools of financial laws against basically small mom-and-pop lenders and other small financial institutions.BISAHA: That was Vought on \"The Charlie Kirk Show\" last fall criticizing some of the agency's staff. We reached out for comment from Vought's office and the CFPB and have not heard back. One of Vought's first actions was emailing workers and telling them to stop working. Bank examinations had been paused, cases were dismissed, regulations withdrawn, all while over the past year, the number of complaints against companies sent to the CFPB to investigate have nearly doubled. Lisa Rosenthal made a decision.ROSENTHAL: This work that I had carried out for these decades and that I cared so deeply about, this was no longer that work.BISAHA: She resigned in February. As for the workers who tried to stay, in April, 84% of them got layoff notices.HELEN SHAW: Everyone was upset.BISAHA: Helen Shaw was one of them.SHAW: Colleagues were crying. It was very worrisome.BISAHA: Shaw regulates interstate land sales, basically making sure property developers are telling the truth to potential buyers. Now, a district court judge has blocked those layoffs while the legal fight continues, and Shaw says she will not be forced out.SHAW: I'm determined to stay because I really believe in the mission of helping individual consumers.BISAHA: The CFPB gets funded from the Federal Reserve, so Vought's recent plan to stop the agency was to refuse to ask for those funds. But in December, that same district judge ordered Vought to make the request, and he did. The judge also wrote in her decision, the agency is, quote, \"hanging by a thread.\" Some work like Shaw's has resumed, but she says bank inspections have essentially been paused, and the threats to the agency's future have not gone away.SHAW: We're still at risk of losing our existence, I think.BISAHA: Even some critics that were never in favor of the CFPB don't like how the Trump administration's doing this.NORBERT MICHEL: Well, I'm conflicted.BISAHA: Norbert Michel runs the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives. And, yeah, he thinks the CFPB should not exist, that it's redundant. But he also thinks Congress - not the administration - should be the one dismantling the CFPB, and he's concerned there isn't any legislation instructing other agencies to fill in the consumer protection gap.MICHEL: Now you have a lot of those things that are not being done, so that gets me a little bit nervous.BISAHA: He does say there are still state and local agencies enforcing consumer protection laws. But Helen Shaw says weakening CFPB goes against one of President Trump's priorities.SHAW: We're the agency to help consumers with the affordability crisis.BISAHA: One of Trump's affordability proposals is capping credit card interest rates. Shaw says enforcing that would naturally be the CFPB's job.SHAW: It's confusing, right? - because they're stating that they'll pursue ways to alleviate the affordability crisis for families, yet we're not fully functional right now.BISAHA: And those early court actions that protected the CFPB from things like layoffs, those were just temporary. The legal battle that could decide the fate of the agency is likely to be long and drawn out - a battle Shaw calls existential.Stephan Bisaha, NPR News.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

    "body": "\n      A bipartisan group of Senators is in Denmark speaking to officials there as President Trump announces new tariffs and continues to talk about taking over Greenland.   \n\n    SARAH MCCAMMON, HOST:  President Trump is escalating his effort to acquire Greenland, which is part of the kingdom of Denmark. In a social media post earlier today, he said he will impose a new 10% tariff on several European countries that oppose the idea - including Germany, France and Denmark - that is, until they get on board. This came on the heels of a bipartisan congressional delegation that went to Denmark on Friday to try to turn down the temperature. NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt traveled there also, and she joins us from Copenhagen. Hi, Barbara.BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Hi, Sarah.MCCAMMON: So tell me more about this delegation. Who went, and what was their goal?SPRUNT: Well, this was a group of about a dozen lawmakers, mostly Democrats. There were two Republicans, both of whom have shown a willingness in the past to push back on the Trump administration. And this was, at its core, a reassurance tour. You know, they were coming to listen and hear the concerns of politicians of both Denmark and Greenland, as well as some Danish business leaders. Here's Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski speaking after an event at Parliament yesterday.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)LISA MURKOWSKI: I think it is important to underscore that when you ask the American people whether or not they think it is a good idea for the United States to acquire Greenland, the vast majority - some 75% - will say, we do not think that that is a good idea.SPRUNT: You know what's interesting, Sarah - I follow these folks around on Capitol Hill all the time, and it was almost like seeing them in a completely different job. They were diplomats. They were talking to allies who are frankly in crisis mode.MCCAMMON: You know, that's a really interesting distinction - diplomats versus lawmakers. What did you see?SPRUNT: Well, on Capitol Hill, partisanship reigns. When there's an opportunity for Democrats to take a dig at President Trump over policy or politics, more often than not, it happens. But here in Copenhagen, that's not what I saw largely. I heard a lot of careful language, a lot about bringing the knowledge that they've gained here by listening to the concerns of people on the ground back with them to the U.S. Delaware Senator Chris Coons, who led the delegation, said he'd even welcome conversations with the White House about what they've learned.MCCAMMON: Needless to say, a very different tone from what we've heard from President Trump. What was the response from the politicians from Denmark and Greenland?SPRUNT: They said they were pleased that the delegation came, that they had constructive conversations and that it was important for lawmakers to hear directly from officials from Greenland. And although they're clear in their concern about the rhetoric around buying Greenland, I thought their tone was really notable. It was calm. They repeatedly said that they stand ready to work alongside the U.S. Here's Pipaluk Lynge, a Greenlandic politician. Reporters were asking her about Trump and his comments.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PIPALUK LYNGE: I think it's really important not to demonize anyone. It's really important to focus on what we're agreeing on and focus on dialogue.SPRUNT: And I think it's really significant there how measured she is, not at all inflaming what's already a volatile situation.MCCAMMON: Now, of course, President Trump says he wants to take over Greenland because he doesn't want China or Russia to take it over. What are officials there saying about that?SPRUNT: I heard repeatedly from lawmakers that they haven't received any intelligence that suggests that that is an imminent threat. That being said, Greenland and Danish officials did say that they're willing to work with the U.S. to address concerns around safeguarding the Arctic. And I should mention, the U.S. already has a military presence in Greenland.MCCAMMON: What else are you hearing from the people you're meeting there in Copenhagen, Barbara?SPRUNT: Well, I attended a demonstration earlier today, thousands of people marching to protest Trump. Lots of passion, tons of chanting of, Greenland is not for sale. I saw a lot of hats that looked almost like the signature red Make America Great Again hats, but they said, Make America Go Away. I went up to one gentleman who had a sign that showed a image of Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, and it said, Americans, we know there is good in you, come back to sanity. His name is Peder Dam, and he said he doesn't think that Trump's demands are necessarily representative of what all Americans want, but he does wonder why there isn't more outrage.PEDER DAM: I can't understand. If my government said that they would attack Sweden, then I would step up and protest that. Why isn't there more normal, average Americans stepping up, going to demonstrations, trying to protest what is going on?SPRUNT: And this is the overarching sentiment that I heard from people. They feel frankly betrayed by a key ally, and they're very worried about their future.MCCAMMON: NPR's Barbara Sprunt, reporting from Copenhagen. Thanks, Barbara.SPRUNT: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Stephen Fowler is NPR's go to reporter for document dumps. He explains how he approaches the day's biggest stories...and its most perplexing datasets.   \n\n    SARAH MCCAMMON, HOST:  If you've spent any time on the internet over the past few years, you've probably heard the name Jeffrey Epstein and the mystery surrounding the files tied to his case. Last month, just a few days before Christmas, some of those records were officially released. Not a handful of documents, but tens of thousands of pages - court filings, emails, photos, all landing at once and instantly lighting up social media, cable news and conspiracy theories.STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: When the first batch of files were released, well, the thing that I thought was something that I can't say on the radio.MCCAMMON: That's Stephen Fowler. He's a political reporter based in Atlanta. We worked together on NPR's Washington Desk.FOWLER: There are a few of us that had started combing through the documents as soon as they came out. We had to download them. We had to file, organize them and sort them and make sure we didn't miss anything, count the total number of pages and documents to see if there was anything missing or anything that needed to be formatted a different way.MCCAMMON: Sorting through that kind of data is exactly what Stephen does. He's become our go-to reporter for digging into large document dumps from government data to the Epstein files to figure out what they actually show and, just as importantly, what they don't show. And I'll admit, I picked up that beat for a day or two during the holidays when everybody was kind of jumping in on whatever needed to be done, and it is a lot of work. So for this week's Reporter's Notebook, I wanted to ask Stephen about his process. Where does he start when these files are released, and how does he go through them? It turns out the work starts long before those documents drop.FOWLER: We did have a story ready to go, saying, hey, the Justice Department has started releasing Epstein files, that we already had in advance of the backstory of how we got to this point, what the law said, directing the release, the political fallout for it. So we didn't really start from scratch.MCCAMMON: How do you go about going through these tens of thousands of pages and just figuring out what's there and what is important?FOWLER: So that prep work that I talked about was important because we didn't know what was going to be released, when it was going to be released, how it was going to be released - things like what file format it would be, if there were going to be pictures or PDFs or videos or anything like that. But we did know that there were tens of thousands of other files that had been made public already - court cases, Freedom of Information Act requests from other agencies. There were files on the FBI's vault and Epstein's private files that were turned over to Congress through a subpoena. So those of us that were looking methodically through these pages had a baseline to look at to understand what was already out there, what it looked like, and to be able to determine, is this new? Oh, this is redacted. Oh, that's a copy of the same email chain that we saw 10 pages ago, so move on to the next thing.There was a spreadsheet that we had and a Slack chat of notable pages and mentions and files that were being uncovered so that we could go back and track and document. And so everything that you saw online or heard people talk about on the air about the Epstein files, there was somebody that personally laid eyes on that document and what it said and made sure that it is, in fact, what it said, and here's where you could find it.MCCAMMON: Yeah, I mean, that was one of the challenges, at least that - during that brief time that I was working with some of these files. You know, a lot of it - I mean, this was taken - these were files that the Justice Department had received from all kinds of people in all kinds of places, right? And just even figuring out what's legitimate was tough.FOWLER: Yeah. I - this is where there were a lot of challenges because the files that were released were not in any sort of order, any sort of organization. There was no road map. There was no table of contents. There was no asterisk or disclaimer to say, hey, by the way, we have to release this by law, but it's actually something that's not true, which is actually something we ran into. There were files that were in there that were submitted tips from the public that contained conspiracy theories about Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein and other things that were completely unverifiable and unvetted, but they were part of the case file that were supposed to be released by law, so they were released. So it made it really, really hard to know what exactly we were looking at.Another thing that made it hard to look at, Sarah, was the sheer volume of things that were redacted. I mean, there were pages and pages where all you could see was black boxes. There was no hidden word there or, you know, this part here. There were just complete pages that were just completely blacked out and blank. So it was difficult to glean information from black rectangles.There was, however, an email sent by federal agents after Epstein was arrested in 2019 for allegedly sex trafficking minors. It mentioned 10 possible co-conspirators, including Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. Most of the other names on that list are redacted, and the law made it clear that information like that should be released if it was there. So really, the big story coming out of the Epstein files ended up being all of the information and files and possibilities that were not released.MCCAMMON: Now, it wasn't just the Epstein files. You also got to dig through some files from DOGE, which I think we all still remember was the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. You were really active in sorting through those during the first few months of Trump's second term. And you broke some news. I mean, tell me more about that. How did you go about looking through those DOGE files?FOWLER: Well, it's a lot different looking at federal government data than a bunch of disjointed documents and files from court cases and things. I mean, the federal government - I don't know if people realize this - has one of the richest and most thorough and easily accessible datasets for things you could imagine. Anything you think of that the government does or thinks about, there is probably a dataset probably sitting there waiting for you to download it. The trick is knowing what you're looking at and how it's used.So over the course of last year, I tracked the change in federal spending data, tens of thousands of alterations to federal contracts under DOGE. There was federal leasing statistics, other things like that that I looked at to understand how the government was working or wasn't working and if DOGE was actually doing the things it claimed it was doing. I mean, showing your work looks a lot different, too, because with the Epstein files, you can say, hey, on this page with this file number, this thing was said.With DOGE data, there were so many spreadsheets. I mean, my editors can tell you - spreadsheet on spreadsheet on spreadsheet that had meticulous calculations that came from on-record and background interviews with all these different experts in these areas to make sure that I understood what I was looking at. And did I mention there were spreadsheets? And so it took a lot of effort to be able to show the work and make sure that I knew what I was looking at so then I could tell the audience what we're looking at.I think the biggest example of that was DOGE's infamous wall of receipts. It was the website where DOGE still claims to track how much taxpayer money it saved through its changes. The data DOGE was putting out there didn't match the source data that the federal government put out. There were overstatements and errors and inaccuracies, and that took a lot of time and effort to kind of - to sort of compare these data sources to get to the truth behind things.MCCAMMON: What else has all of this data reporting during this first year of Trump's second term - what has it taught you about how to cover this moment in politics and what it might mean?FOWLER: I think it's even more important to show the work, to bring receipts and to give people those primary sources that I've been using to do this coverage. One, I want people to trust the reporting and trust what I have to say, and they can see for themselves how I got there and also kind of peel back the curtain for the public to learn how to look at this information on their own. And also, numbers are hard to bring to the radio. If you put too many of them out there, people's eyes start to gloss over. If you have too few, you risk kind of underselling your findings and leaving out important context.So spending the last year really grounding a lot of my reporting in this data - even if not every story starts out with a, here's this insert number fact here to use - I mean, it does help contextualize the scope or the scale or significance of what's going on in politics, whether it's the small fraction of Epstein files or the 58th lawmaker retiring or federal spending.MCCAMMON: That's Stephen Fowler, a political reporter with NPR's Washington Desk.

The administration had already surged federal agents — sometimes accompanied by military troops — to Los Angeles, Portland, Chicago, Charlotte, Memphis, Washington D.C. and New Orleans.   Now the White House is threatening to cut funding for sanctuary cities. Here's a brief explanation of how local governments interact with federal immigration enforcement, and what the White House can and can't require from them.   \n   A fight over federal money    President Trump threatened this week to cut \"significant\" federal funding to sanctuary cities. He hasn't said exactly what money his administration wants to cut, though he gave a deadline of Feb. 1.   Nor has Trump said exactly which cities or states will be targeted, though the Department of Justice did publish a list of more than 30 cities, states and counties in August. (That list includes the state of Minnesota, though not Minneapolis or St. Paul or their respective counties).   \n   In remarks on Tuesday at the Detroit Economic Club, Trump seemed to be focused on places that limit their cooperation with ICE.   \"They do everything possible to protect criminals at the expense of American citizens. And it breeds fraud and crime and all of the other problems that come,\" Trump said. \"So we're not making any payment to anybody that supports sanctuary cities.\"   This is not the first time President Trump has made a threat like this. During his first term, the president tried to withhold some federal funding from sanctuary cities. More recently, Trump signed an executive order nearly a year ago directing the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security to make a list of sanctuary cities and withhold money from them.   \n   But courts have sided against the administration in nearly every case, saying that the federal government cannot use funding to coerce state and local governments into changing their policies on immigration.   \"Here we are again,\" U.S. District Judge William Orrick in San Francisco wrote in April. Orrick granted (and later extended) a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from withholding federal funds from 16 jurisdictions, including San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, Minneapolis, St. Paul and New Haven.   \"The threat to withhold funding causes them irreparable injury in the form of budgetary uncertainty, deprivation of constitutional rights, and undermining trust between the Cities and Counties and the communities they serve,\" Orrick said.   No precise legal definition of 'sanctuary'   There's no exact legal definition of \"sanctuary city.\" But broadly speaking, the term refers to any city, state or county that limits its cooperation with federal immigration authorities.   The legal questions here are nuanced. Local law enforcement cannot block federal agents from doing their work but courts have said that state and city officers can withhold some cooperation.   \n   The legal arguments are rooted in the U.S. Constitution and the division of powers between the federal government, which is in charge of immigration enforcement, and state and local governments, which run their own police and sheriffs' departments.   Courts have backed states that don't want to share data on residents in their records, including information about driver's licenses. And in many places, state and local law enforcement will not honor what's known as a \"detainer request\" from ICE, which essentially asks police to hold someone in detention until immigration authorities can take custody.   Local officials push back    Virtually all the cities and states the administration has focused on so far are led by Democrats, who don't seem to be backing down after Trump's threat to cut federal money.   \n   \"This is just a threat to intimidate states like New York into bowing into submission. And that is something we'll never do,\" New York Governor Kathy Hochul said earlier this week. \"You touch any more money from the state of New York, we'll see you in court.\"   State and city leaders argue there is a fundamental public safety rationale for their sanctuary policies. They say that working with ICE would undermine trust and cooperation between local law enforcement and immigrant communities as they seek to prevent crime.   There's clearly a political aspect to this as well. In many sanctuary cities, voters are asking Democratic leaders not to give in to the White House and its immigration agenda, so local leaders may have a strong incentive to dig in their heels.   Why local cooperation matters    \n   In the past, ICE has found that it's faster and safer to arrest people who are already being held in local jails. And that's one reason ICE was able to make so many arrests during the administration of President Obama, for example, before sanctuary policies were as widespread as they are now.   The White House says a lack of local cooperation is hindering its efforts to build \"the largest deportation operation in the history of our country,\" a pledge Trump made frequently during his reelection campaign.   \"Minnesota's 'leaders' have chosen defiance over partnership,\" the White House said in a statement on Friday.   But Democrats say the administration is deliberately creating confrontations in cities and states that are led by political opponents, provoking chaotic scenes on purpose for reasons that go beyond simply enforcing immigration law.\n",

Kennedy Jr., pictured at the White House earlier this month, promised he would set up the Administration for a Healthy America back in March 2025. It doesn't exist yet.\n                \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was just a few weeks into his new job as health secretary in March 2025 when he unveiled a dramatic plan to remake the Department of Health and Human Services.   Kennedy quickly determined that the size and structure of his agency — which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes for Health — was \"incomprehensible.\" He said it was bloated and that explained why federal health officials had failed to improve Americans' health.   \"We're going to eliminate an entire alphabet soup of departments and agencies while preserving their core functions,\" he said in a social media video. Those \"core functions\" would be preserved, he explained, \"by merging them into a new organization called the Administration for a Healthy America or AHA.\"    \n   The name plays off of Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" slogan.   \n   Weeks into the second year of the second Trump term, many staff and departments of HHS have been eliminated in chaotic cuts handed down on April 1, 2025, but the Administration for a Healthy America does not yet exist.   There's no public information about when AHA might be created, and very little about what staff and programs it would include.   Not a normal process   The most recent public document from HHS about AHA was a budget request published in June. It says that the new agency will \"focus on areas including primary care, environmental health, HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, mental and behavioral health, and workforce development.\"   Those programs are spread out across health agencies, including at the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and several centers at CDC.   Congress didn't include any money for AHA in the latest HHS funding bill. Staffers on committees with jurisdiction over HHS tell NPR there have not even been meetings with Kennedy's staff to help secure support for new funding or authorization to stand up the new agency in the future.   \n   Instead, political appointees at HHS are holding secretive planning meetings about AHA, according to seven current and former employees at federal health agencies who spoke to NPR.   HHS would not answer NPR's questions for this story, but in a statement said that planning for AHA was still underway.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Humphrey Building in Washington, D.C. is the headquarters of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n                \n                    Jose Luis Magana/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jose Luis Magana/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Behind the scenes, rushed and secretive meetings   At CDC in Atlanta, a senior official describes a constant demand for information about budgets, staff and public health work. It's not even clear who is asking for the data or what they plan to do with it, they say, but they understand it is related to AHA planning.   \"All that you're told is that 'they' are asking for this information and they want it now — or they wanted it yesterday.\" The official asked NPR not to use their name because of fears of professional retribution for speaking publicly without authorization. \"'They' can refer to a small circle of people around Kennedy that he trusts, who are either unnamed, or you'll receive a different name each time, so you're never really quite sure where the ask is coming from.\"   A different senior official at HHS, who also asked that NPR not to use their name for fear of professional retribution, echoed that description of political appointees connected to Kennedy holding \"constant meetings in secret about what this new AHA is supposed to look like, but they don't share with anyone in the civil service.\" The source adds there are rumors that Kennedy's team is \"going to stand up AHA in the next few months, like in the spring.\"   \n   There's no public information about who is in charge of planning to create the agency, and HHS did not make anyone available to interview for this story.   \"What does this mean?\"   Dr. Karen Hacker says the process of restructuring HHS has been \"like building and flying the plane at the same time,\" she says. When Kennedy began as secretary, Hacker was the director of CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. She was put on administrative leave on April 1 — along with thousands of others at HHS — then retired from CDC. She now works as an adjunct professor and health policy fellow at Emory University.   \n   She says even though her center worked on chronic diseases, a central priority of AHA, her team was sidelined by the political appointees executing Kennedy's vision. \"We never were asked about strategies for reductions, or about what would be best to move, or whether any of these programs were authorized [by Congress],\" she says. \"My center alone had over 40 line items with specific appropriations language.\"   None of that seemed to matter. A third of the staff in her center were cut during the April 1 reduction in force, and the entire center was slated to be eliminated in President Trump's 2026 budget, published in May. \"I do remember having conversations about — 'What does this mean? Wait a second, are we not going to AHA?'\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. Some centers of CDC are supposed to become part of AHA, but no details about logistics are public.\n                \n                    Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Then and now, there are big logistical questions about how a center in Atlanta with hundreds of staff members and a $1.4 billion budget could become part of a new agency, possibly in Maryland or Washington, D.C.   When it comes to AHA, Hacker says: \"The question remains — what are their plans? Are they planning to roll out a big reorg? Are they planning to consider other alternatives?\"   A former secretary is \"baffled\"   If Kennedy and his team at HHS wanted to reorganize the Department of Health and Human Services and enlist Congress to authorize a new agency, the public would be seeing a very different process unfold.   When it comes to AHA, \"there is no budget authority to create a new agency, there's no congressional framework for what that looks like, there's no staff numbers,\" says Kathleen Sebelius, the former governor of Kansas who served as health secretary under President Obama.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Kathleen Sebelius, pictured at a panel event in 2016, set up the Administration for Community Living when she was President Obama's health secretary.\n                \n                    Charlie Riedel/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Charlie Riedel/AP\n    \n\n   \n   That lack of engagement with Congress, she says, also shows in Kennedy's disregard for lawmakers' intent when he eliminated staff and programs during the DOGE-fueled firings in April 2025.   \"What I found when I was [secretary] is that a lot of the entities that seemed to me to be redundant had underlying congressional authorization — they passed a specific bill, it had specific appropriations — and in my day, with my president, we paid a lot of attention to that,\" she says. The firings directed by Kennedy and DOGE included many offices required by Congress that have not been reconstituted elsewhere at HHS, despite his promise that the \"core functions\" of the health agencies would be preserved.   \n   \"A lot of what I see at least in these restructuring documents under Secretary Kennedy just absolutely are baffling to me,\" Sebelius says. She mentions the plan to dismantle the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), which responds to natural disasters and pandemic threats, and the elimination of several HHS regional offices that states rely on.   Sebelius also has the perspective of having created a new agency during her tenure: the Administration for Community Living, which helps seniors and people with disabilities live at home.   \"We took a year to have listening sessions to really bring a firm proposal,\" Sebelius says. \"It ultimately was in a budget document, and had staff recommendations and jurisdiction recommendations.\"    She says by that time, \"we had buy-in from — not only key members on the Hill — but key members in the communities across the country.\"   When it comes to the Administration for a Healthy America, \"I don't see any of that going on,\" she says.    Incidentally, the Administration for Community Living is one of the entities slated to be dismantled as an independent agency and integrated into AHA.   Staff numbers confusion   While Trump administration officials work quietly on a plan to create an AHA entity at the agency without input or funding from Congress, the American public is left with health agencies diminished by a year of personnel cuts.   Exactly how much HHS has shrunk because of Kennedy's restructuring, DOGE-led buyouts, and retirements, is difficult to pin down. HHS has declined multiple requests from NPR to provide the current number of staff, but the stated goal when the reorganization was announced in March was to reduce the staff by 20,000 people or about 20% of the workforce.   When Kennedy took office, 88,731 staff worked across HHS, according to an official staffing plan from November 2024. The latest version of that plan, dated September 2025, shows 79,717 HHS employees, which represents a cut of only 10%.   \n   It's not clear if that headcount includes staff whose firings have been blocked by the courts and are on administrative leave. Hacker, the former CDC center director, knows of employees who have been in that situation since April. \"They're getting a paycheck, they're getting their benefits, they're just not working in their jobs,\" she says. Other staff who were fired have been brought back.   \n   Just this week, 400 occupational safety staff at CDC who had been on administrative leave were suddenly ordered back to work without explanation. And about a thousand HHS workers fired during the shutdown were brought back as part of a deal to reopen the government. They wonder if they'll be re-fired at the end of January when that deal expires.   All of the agencies that are slated to become part of AHA have had deep RIFs, or reductions in force, especially CDC and SAMHSA, the mental health and substance abuse agency. \"There were people in my center [at CDC] that got riffed multiple times — some were brought back and then some were riffed again,\" says Hacker. \"It's a very chaotic scenario.\"   An exercise in branding?   The current CDC official predicts that Kennedy and his allies will create a pilot or initiative at HHS \"by hook or by crook\" to be able to claim success in creating the Administration for a Healthy America. \"They want things fast, they want it to be bright and shiny, they want to capture the attention of the public, and they want it to look like a success up front.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Secretary Kennedy is pictured at an event called the MAHA Summit in November. Kennedy interviewed Vice President JD Vance, and it was carried live on Fox News.\n                \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The official does not think it will be an actual new agency funded and backed by Congress. They think Kennedy will find teams and initiatives that were already happening at HHS related to nutrition, fitness and chronic disease prevention and \"brand\" them as \"MAHA wins\" to assert that the secretary accomplished the goals of the new AHA agency, without having to engage with Congress.   \n   Sebelius is skeptical of the idea that Kennedy can create anything close to a new agency on his own. \"You can do a lot on paper and play musical chairs all you want, but at the end of the day, they're gonna have to have some funding and some jurisdiction.\"   She says lawmakers in Congress are either going to buy into Kennedy's plan to create AHA or reject it. \"It's really unclear to me what they're gonna do.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      Extensive redactions of the Epstein files add to the political pressure President Trump is already under for his handling of the economy.   \n\n    AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:  It's the Winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, and from San Diego to Detroit to here in Washington, D.C., we've got the least amount of sunlight 2025 has to offer. But we do have NPR White House correspondent Deepa Shivaram. Good morning, Deepa.DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: Hi, Ayesha.RASCOE: And you are a light, I have to say.SHIVARAM: Oh, thank you.(LAUGHTER)SHIVARAM: As are you.RASCOE: Thank you. Sunlight, transparency. Now, making a sharp turn here.SHIVARAM: (Laughter).RASCOE: How much sunlight and transparency are we finding in the evidence in the Epstein files that the Justice Department was legally required to release at the beginning of this weekend?SHIVARAM: Yeah. Well, just to catch up for a second. I mean, this batch of documents started getting released on Friday evening, but there was a lot that was redacted, Ayesha, including some of the documents that were really sought after, like the testimony from the New York grand jury. I will say what was included in this recent release of files was some pictures, significant ones like former President Bill Clinton standing with Jeffrey Epstein. Another one of Clinton in a hot tub with a person whose face has been redacted. Notably, though, President Trump was rarely named in this batch of files. And that really stands out compared to the last round of files that were released by the House Democratic Oversight Committee last month, where Trump was named in that batch more than 1,000 times.RASCOE: Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Friday that the DOJ would make more files public in the coming weeks. Does that satisfy lawmakers across the political spectrum who worked to pass the law mandating disclosure?SHIVARAM: So far, not really. Congressman Ro Khanna - he's a Democrat who co-sponsored the legislation on the Hill to release these files. He called this release of documents on Friday incomplete at best. There were witness interviews with the FBI that he says should be released, as well as a draft indictment from the first Epstein case that was also something he was looking for. And he wants an explanation from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on the timeline of when the rest of these files are going to be made public.On the other side of the aisle, Congressman Thomas Massie, a Republican - he's been posting a lot on social media agreeing with Khanna, saying that not releasing all of these documents means that Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche are violating the law. And Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who, you know, is on her way out of Congress, said that the release of these files is, quote, \"not MAGA.\"So there's a lot of lingering questions after this small release of files from the DOJ, with so many things that were redacted. And then to add on to that concern over the weekend, more than a dozen of the files that were released and made public online were removed from the DOJ website, and that included one file that was, you know, Trump's photo that was on a desk surrounded by other photographs.So this issue of transparency around the Epstein files, you know, is ongoing. It's been dogging Trump for months. And with this recent move by the DOJ, I mean, this news cycle is just not going to go away. It's going to extend into next year, which I will note, is a midterms year, and that could really complicate things for Republicans.RASCOE: And meanwhile, the administration is continuing to ramp up pressure on Venezuela.SHIVARAM: Yeah. There has been mounting pressure from Trump on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Just yesterday, the U.S. stopped another oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela. It's the second time that's happened in the last two weeks. And this second incident comes after Trump announced a, quote, \"blockade\" on sanctioned oil tankers coming in and out of Venezuela that happened earlier this week. Now, Venezuela has responded and called the U.S. actions, quote, \"criminal,\" but this is just a complicated situation that has been growing and growing and growing. As you'll remember, the U.S. has been attacking boats off the coast of Venezuela, claiming that they are smuggling drugs, and more than a hundred people have been killed in those strikes.RASCOE: That's NPR's Deepa Shivaram. Deepa, thank you so much.SHIVARAM: Thanks for having me.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      President Trump won re-election in 2024 on a promise to upend Washington. He pitched a presidency where he alone could solve America's problems. Where does the current reality of these promises stand?   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  President Trump won reelection last year on a promise to upend Washington. He pitched a presidency where he alone could solve America's problems. Now, as we come to the close of 2025, we have asked senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith and senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro to join us to talk about the reality of those promises. Good to talk to both of you.TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hey, Scott.DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey, Scott.DETROW: So President Trump very clear during the 2024 campaign he was pitching a version of the federal government with him at the center of it. Did he follow through on that?MONTANARO: Yeah, he's done more to try and centralize power in the executive branch than any president we can remember, whether that was using DOGE - that informal Department of Government Efficiency that was run by Elon Musk - or putting himself in charge of things from dismantling quasi-independent agencies and demolishing the East Wing of the White House to build a ballroom without going through any of the usual protocols. He signed a record number of executive orders, used them to push back on the media, law firms - taking over the Kennedy Center, even - threatening grants as leverage against institutions of higher education. He's really pushed the limits and bent the guardrails of the presidency.KEITH: There's also been a lot of retribution and just going after his political enemies.DETROW: Let's talk more about that. A big part of how he executed this vision early on was DOGE. This was the big story of the first half of the year.KEITH: Yeah. It can be a little difficult to untangle Elon Musk's DOGE project from White House Budget Director Russell Vought's relentless focus on cutting government and driving out federal employees. But here's a short list of institutions that under Trump have been rapidly dismantled, starved or completely remade this year - the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Voice of America, the Department of Education, the U.S. Institute of Peace - now the Donald Trump Institute of Peace. This week, the White House tweeted, quote, \"federal employment is now at the lowest level since 2014, down by 271,000 jobs since President Trump took office. Promises made, promises kept.\"DETROW: And we should say, as of this week, the Kennedy Center is now the Trump Kennedy Center. Changes all over the place. Let's talk about Congress for a minute, though. The flip side of a powerful presidency has been a Congress that's, is it fair to say, just standing aside and letting things happen?KEITH: Yeah. This Congress, controlled by Republicans in both the House and the Senate, basically only did the things that President Trump said they had to do. If he didn't put political capital on the line, they weren't doing it. So Trump demanded expensive policies, like nearly $4 trillion over 10 years to make his first-term tax cuts permanent, also adding promises he made during the campaign, like no taxes on tips, no taxes on overtime. And Republicans made that happen. He was lukewarm, though, on extending subsidies for health care through the Affordable Care Act, and as of the end of this year, Congress has failed to do anything to prevent those costs from skyrocketing.MONTANARO: The one exception on all of this with Republican pushback has been the release of the Epstein files and his administration's handling of that, which has really become a political liability, and to an extent with moderate Republicans on these health care subsidies wanting to see those extended.DETROW: So that's the legislative branch. What was the story of the judicial branch in 2025 as the Trump White House tried to seize so much power?MONTANARO: Yeah, I think this is a really crucial branch of government right now because Trump has really pushed to see how far the Supreme Court will let him go. Remember, he appointed three of the justices who sit on the high court and flipped the court to a 6-3 ideological conservative majority. And the court gave him huge powers before the second term, saying that he's immune from criminal consequences for any official acts.Given Republicans in Congress are greasing the wheels for Trump, the courts are really the last branch that can spell out what, if any, guardrails exist. You know, this applies on everything from the firings of federal workers, reducing or eliminating those federal agencies we were talking about, and just how far he's trying to go on deportations.KEITH: We are currently watching two major cases in the court that could determine how far the Supreme Court is willing to let the president go, including birthright citizenship and also a challenge to his tariffs policy. And I think tariffs are a great example of how President Trump has led unilaterally in an area that typically would require some congressional involvement. He's imposed these significant tariffs on goods imported to the United States. In some cases, he's actually walked a little bit of it back, like on coffee, where there's been a spike in the price of coffee, then he rolled some of those tariffs back, facing some political pushback on affordability. But just to go more broadly, if his first term was characterized by a man bristling against guardrails, this one is about blowing through them and surrounding himself with people who don't view it as their job to constrain him.DETROW: The thing is, he ran on doing exactly that. He was explicit in his promises. He took office, and he by and large followed through on those promises.KEITH: Yep.DETROW: And polls have showed that voters are not responding. They do not approve. What are we seeing? How should we think about public reaction over the course of the year?MONTANARO: Yeah. I mean, Trump is really at the lowest point in his presidency. Just 38% of people in the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll said that they approve of the job he's doing overall - just 36% on his handling of the economy. People are really struggling to make ends meet, and they're saying that Trump's policies have made things worse. And you could argue the economy and his promises to lower prices are really what got him put back into the White House, not all these other tactics to consolidate power. No matter how much he says loudly that he had a broad and sweeping mandate, it just wasn't the case. I mean, Latinos, for example, crossed over to vote for him. They were saying that the economy was most important. He won a record share of Latinos for a Republican. And now they're hotly disapproving of the job that he's doing.KEITH: And what we're seeing here with these approval ratings is really the answer to the question of what happens if you only govern for your base and yourself.DETROW: That is NPR's Tamara Keith and Domenico Montanaro. Always good to talk to you both. Thanks so much.KEITH: You're welcome.MONTANARO: Thanks, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

U.S. consulates and embassies have been reporting lengthy, sometimes months-long delays, for visa appointments following new rules from the Department of Homeland Security requiring travelers to undergo a screening of up to five years' of their social media history — a move criticized by free speech advocates as a privacy invasion.   \n   For Apple and Google, which together employ more than 300,000 employees and rely heavily on highly-skilled foreign workers, the increased vetting and reports of extended delays were enough for the companies to tell some of their staff to stay in the U.S. if they are able to avoid foreign travel.   \"We recommend avoiding international travel at this time as you risk an extended stay outside of the U.S.,\" Berry Appleman & Leiden, a law firm that works with Google, wrote to employees.   \n   The law firm Fragomen, which works with Apple, wrote a similar message: \"Given the recent updates and the possibility of unpredictable, extended delays when returning to the U.S., we strongly recommend that employees without a valid H-1B visa stamp avoid international travel for now,\" the memo read. \"If travel cannot be postponed, employees should connect with Apple Immigration and Fragomen in advance to discuss the risks.\"   Apple and Google declined to comment on the advisories, which were first reported by Business Insider.   \n   It's the latest sign of how the Trump administration's aggressive immigration policies are affecting the foreign-born workforce in the U.S.   Earlier this year, the White House announced that companies will be subjected to a $100,000 fee for all new H-1B visas, a type of visa popular among tech companies eager to hire highly skilled workers from abroad.   H-1Bs typically last three years, and applicants have to return to an embassy or consulate in their home country for a renewal, but reports suggest such a routine trip could lead to people being stranded for months as a result of the Trump administration's new policies.   \n   On Friday, The Washington Post reported that hundreds of visa holders who traveled to India to renew their H-1Bs had their appointments postponed with the State Department explaining that officials needed more time to ensure that no applicants \"pose a threat to U.S. national security or public safety.\"   At Google, the Alphabet Workers' Union has been campaigning for additional protections for workers on H-1B visas. Those workers would be particularly vulnerable in the event Google carried out layoffs, since losing employer sponsorship could jeopardize their legal status, said Google software engineer Parul Koul, who leads the union.   The need to support H-1B holders at Google, she said, has \"only become more urgent with all the scrutiny and heightened vetting by the Trump administration around the H1B program, and how the administration is coming for all other types of immigrant workers.\"\n",

Some lawmakers said the department's release of files relating to Jeffrey Epstein had too many redactions as well as missing information.\n                \n                    Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Two lawmakers are threatening a seldom-used congressional sanction against the Department of Justice over what they say is a failure to release all of its files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein by a deadline set in law.   Reps. Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie spearheaded the effort to force the Epstein files' release by co-sponsoring the Epstein Files Transparency Act, but both have said the release had too many redactions as well as missing information.   \n   \"I think the most expeditious way to get justice for these victims is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi,\" Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, told CBS's Face the Nation on Sunday. \"Basically Ro Khanna and I are talking about and drafting that right now.\"   Inherent contempt refers to Congress' authority to fine or arrest and then bring to trial officers who are obstructing legislative functions. It was last successfully used in the 1930s, according to the American Bar Association.   Khanna, a California Democrat, noted that the House would not need the Senate's approval to take such action, which he said would result in a fine for Attorney General Pam Bondi.   \"I believe we're going to get bipartisan support in holding her accountable,\" he told Face the Nation.   Justice Department defends partial release   The Justice Department on Sunday defended its initial, partial release of documents, some of which were heavily redacted.   \"The material that we released on Friday, or the material that we're going to release over the next a couple of weeks, is exactly what the statute requires us to release,\" said Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on NBC's Meet the Press, referring to the Epstein Files Transparency Act.   \n   Blanche said the administration has hundreds of lawyers going through the remaining documents to ensure that victims' information is protected. Still, lawmakers from both parties remain unsatisfied.   \"Any evidence or any kind of indication that there's not a full reveal on this, this will just plague them for months and months more,\" said Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky on ABC's This Week. \"My suggestion would be — give up all the information, release it.\"   Blanche told NBC he was not taking the threats of contempt seriously.   \n   \"Not even a little bit. Bring it on,\" he said, adding that lawmakers who have spoken negatively about Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel \"have no idea what they're talking about.\"   Back and forth over Trump photo   The trove of documents released Friday contained little new information about Epstein, prompting accusations that the department wasn't complying with the law. There was a photograph included in Friday's release that showed a desk full of photos, including at least one of President Trump. It was among more than a dozen photographs no longer available in the Justice Department's \"Epstein Library\" by Saturday, NPR found.   \n   On Sunday, the Justice Department re-uploaded the photo of the desk, and provided an explanation on X.   \"The Southern District of New York flagged an image of President Trump for potential further action to protect victims,\" the post read. \"Out of an abundance of caution, the Department of Justice temporarily removed the image for further review. After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction.\"   The Justice Department did not offer an explanation for the other photos whose access had been removed.   Blanche told NBC the Justice Department was not redacting information around Trump or any other individual involved with Epstein. He said the Justice Department had removed photos from the public files \"because a judge in New York has ordered us to listen to any victim or victim rights group, if they have any concerns about the material that we're putting up.   \n   \"And so when we hear concerns, whether it's photographs of women that we do not believe are victims, or we didn't have information to show that they were victims, but we learned that there are concerns, of course, we're taking that photograph down and we're going to address it,\" he said.   Earlier Sunday, the Justice Department also posted to X a new version of the 119-page transcript of grand jury proceedings in the case of Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell. The original version had been entirely redacted.   \n   \"Here is the document now with minimal redactions. Documents and photos will continue to be reviewed consistent with the law and with an abundance of caution for victims and their families,\" the Justice Department wrote in its post.\n",

Solis/AP\n    \n\n   \n   JACKSON, Miss. — A judge on Friday ordered special elections for the Mississippi Supreme Court after earlier finding that the electoral map used to select justices violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.   U.S. District Judge Sharion Aycock in August ordered Mississippi to redraw the map, which was enacted in 1987, concluding the current configuration dilutes the power of Black voters. The Friday ruling gives the Mississippi Legislature until the end of its 2026 regular session to redraw the map.   \n   Section 2, which is the primary way plaintiffs can push back against racially discriminatory election practices, is currently being challenged at the U.S. Supreme Court.   Once the legislature approves a new map, Aycock wrote that she will move quickly to meet any deadlines necessary to hold the special elections in November 2026.   Aycock also wrote that she will defer deciding which seats will be subject to a special election until after the new map has been adopted.   The order follows a 2022 lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union, which argued the current map cuts Mississippi's Delta region — a historically Black area — in half, diminishing the Black vote in the Central District.   \n   \"Mississippi is nearly 40% Black, but has never had more than one Black Justice on the nine-member Court,\" Ari Savitzky, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, wrote in a statement. \"We couldn't be happier to see justice on the horizon.\"   In her August ruling, Aycock noted only four Black people have served on Mississippi's Supreme Court. All of them held the same seat in the Central District and were first appointed to the position by a sitting governor.   The Mississippi Secretary of State's Office is appealing Aycock's August ruling. The Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has stayed its proceedings pending the outcomes of the SCOTUS case and other related cases.   \n   The Mississippi Secretary of State and Attorney General's offices did not immediately respond to requests for comment.   In December, two Mississippi Supreme Court justices were appointed to federal judgeships. Gov. Tate Reeves will appoint replacements to serve until new justices can be elected.   In Mississippi, Supreme Court elections are nonpartisan.   \n",

It is the group's largest assembly since its founder, Charlie Kirk, was assassinated in September, and the event has highlighted growing divisions in what's called the MAGA movement. NPR senior contributor Ron Elving joins us. Ron, thanks for being with us.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.SIMON: The podcaster Ben Shapiro took the podium and blasted other speakers to come as, quote, \"frauds and grifters.\" And later, Tucker Carlson said that Shapiro was pompous. Is this contention over what conservatism ought to be post-Trump?ELVING: There's a highly specific leadership vacuum here. Charlie Kirk is gone, and no one has begun to replace him. His wife, Erika, has taken a high-profile role after her husband's death, but she does not yet have the mobilizing power her husband had. Neither does anyone else, which is why we see this leadership struggle between the would-be champions of different elements in the MAGA movement. Charlie Kirk could reach most all of them and provide a point of connection for them. That includes those who are most supportive of Israel and those most suspicious of Israel. The danger for the movement is that this highly visible fighting brings down the big tent. It reduces the appeal for younger voters as well as some Hispanics and African Americans. A squabbling party is a less-inviting party.SIMON: Of course, all is not amity among Democrats. Reports this week that party leaders will not publicly release the autopsy of why they lost the 2024 presidential election. What are the divisions here?ELVING: The same need for unity applies to Democrats, and it has been historically elusive for Democrats. Tactically speaking, their 2024 was a disaster because when the incumbent Joe Biden pulled out of his own reelection bid, it was far too late for the primary process, and that could have made Kamala Harris a stronger candidate or found a candidate stronger than Kamala Harris. And yes, Democrats have their own policy divisions, especially on the Middle East. Historically, the Democrats have been strong supporters of Israel. But in recent years, younger Democrats and others in the party coalition have shown increasing sympathy for the plight of Palestinians.Strategically speaking, Democrats are as divided as ever as to whether to seek votes in the center of the American political spectrum or play to their own party's most passionate progressives. The trick is getting enough Democrats to unite the factions or to accept some sort of shared power so as to actually get some national power to share.SIMON: President Trump addressed the nation in a primetime speech this week, and last night he spoke to supporters in North Carolina. What have you noticed?ELVING: It's notable that he's trying to be both the incumbent and the anti-incumbent, acting as though Joe Biden were still president and responsible for the economy. That's a tough sell right there, but then Trump turns around and insists the economy is great. We did get a hopeful inflation number this past week, but it was somewhat suspect because the government shutdown affected the numbers - only gave us numbers for one month, not two. And whether inflation was 2.7 or actually higher, the most important measure is the way the voters are feeling. And right now, the most trusted measure that we have for consumer confidence shows that confidence is all the way down to where it was in 2009, the start of the Great Recession.SIMON: The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., was designated by Congress as a living memorial to President Kennedy in 1964, the year after he was assassinated, of course. Yesterday, President Trump put his name on the building too. Why?ELVING: Well, it shouldn't be a shock. We've known for some time that Trump likes seeing his name. Earlier this month, he put it on the U.S. Institute of Peace, now the Trump Institute of Peace. And now the president's hand-picked board members have tacked his name onto the Kennedy Center. We should add that there are still some questions about whether or not that's legal, and members of Congress and the Kennedy family still want to resist.SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving. Thanks so much for being with us. Talk to you soon.ELVING: Thank you, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Many documents, which include interview transcripts and call logs, have been heavily redacted.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  The Justice Department has released files relating to the life, death and criminal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein - well, at least some of them. The law signed by President Trump last month had directed the DOJ to turn over the documents by Friday. NPR's Stephen Fowler has been reviewing the files and joins us. Stephen, thanks for being with us.STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Good morning.SIMON: What exactly was released?FOWLER: Well, on the surface, it sure looked like a lot. Justice.gov/epstein went live around 4 p.m. And there was a queue you had to wait in before accessing the page. The Epstein library contained well over 100,000 pages of court records, Freedom of Information Act files, memoranda from the Justice Department and videos from outside Epstein's federal prison cell, where he died by suicide in 2019, and documents that the Epstein Files Transparency Act, signed into law last month, compelled the Justice Department to hand over.SIMON: Feels like there's more to the story.FOWLER: Well, yeah. It's not all the files. And in the grand scheme of what was released, there aren't that many things that are actually new, Scott. Notably, there aren't many mentions of the president in this latest release. He was a longtime friend of Epstein before they had a falling out and has appeared in previously released files. Eighty percent of it comes from public court records from more than 50 cases against Epstein, his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell and others. There's about 4,000 files, 8,500 pages, that fall under this new Transparency Act. Most of those are photos of Epstein's estate and his travels with people like former President Bill Clinton, among others. And there's this previously undisclosed FBI report from 1996 - 30 years ago - that accused Epstein of child pornography crimes and allegedly threatened to burn the accuser's house down if she told anyone about it. Even then, there are hundreds of pages, just straight-up redacted black boxes all over things like grand jury information that do leave a lot of questions.SIMON: The law directed the Justice Department to release all of their files by yesterday. That apparently didn't happen. What did department officials say?FOWLER: The DOJ says its review of the files found more than 1,200 victims and families and wrote in a separate court filing Friday that redactions include people who may not actually be victims, as they err on the side of what they say might be viewed as an over-redaction, taking out more than may be required by law out of an abundance of caution. This could also explain why there will be more than one release of documents. On Friday night, there were more files that were uploaded.SIMON: What's been the reaction from members of Congress?FOWLER: Not all of them are happy. Remember, this was a near unanimous law that was passed through Congress. Democratic Representative Ro Khanna of California, who cosponsored the Epstein Files Transparency Act, told All Things Considered yesterday that the released files weren't what he expected or wanted. He says there's too many redactions and missing information altogether. Here's an example.RO KHANNA: There's a draft indictment of the first Jeffrey Epstein case that really implicates other rich and powerful men who knew about the abuse or participated in it. That indictment should be released.FOWLER: His Republican cosponsor, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, said that impeachment could be on the table for officials involved, though Congress is out of session for a while over the holidays.SIMON: Stephen, what can we expect to happen now?FOWLER: Like Khanna said, it's notable all of the things that aren't in the files that have been released and that some people think will never be. There's an FBI memo from over the summer that said about 300 gigabytes of evidence is in their possession. And the way President Trump has handled this by fanning flames of conspiracy on the campaign trail, then attacking his supporters for wanting to know more once he took office has basically made it where nobody is set to be satisfied with the information that is and could be put out there.SIMON: NPR's Stephen Fowler. Thanks so much.FOWLER: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Lowery and other members of the tribe gathered in Washington, D.C., to mark the passage of a bill granting full federal recognition on Wednesday.\n                \n                    Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n    \n\n   \n   After a 137-year struggle, the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina has finally received full federal recognition from the U.S. government.    Members of the Native American tribe shed tears as it reached the historic milestone in Washington, D.C., this week. Tribal Chairman John L. Lowery witnessed President Trump sign the bill that extended acknowledgment to the tribe at the White House on Thursday.   \"I'm so thankful today for everyone who has helped us along this way — everyone from our ancestors from the late 1880s all the way up to present day. So many people have been a part of this fight,\" Lowery said in a video posted to the tribe's social media accounts.   \n   Federal lawmakers included the Lumbee Fairness Act in the $900 billion annual military spending package.   The Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina has 55,000 members. The tribal territory is located in the southeastern part of the state in Robeson, Hoke, Cumberland, and Scotland Counties.   Federal recognition opens the door to an expanse of federal resources for tribes. Federally recognized tribes are eligible to receive federal funding from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Benefits include support for housing, education and health care.   \"I do believe that the biggest benefit we're going to receive as a tribe is Indian Health Services,\" Lowery said during a press conference Friday. \"For our people who do not have health care insurance, or our people who have high health care insurance, they will be able to work through Indian Health Services to get services provided to them.\"   \n   In 2022, after the measure was introduced in the House, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the federal government would spend nearly $250 million in providing health benefits to Lumbee Tribe members over four years through the Indian Health Service.   Federally recognized tribes hold certain rights to self-governance. The designation expands tribal control over economic development by authorizing the BIA to take land into trust for the benefit of the tribe.   The Lumbee first petitioned Congress for federal recognition in 1888. The tribe then only received partial recognition in 1956.   \n   North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein applauded this week's milestone. \"The state has long recognized the Lumbee Tribe,\" he said in a news release. \"Full federal recognition will allow members access to the federal health care, education, housing, child care, and disaster relief benefits afforded other federally recognized tribes. These benefits will in turn create economic opportunities for the Tribe and the surrounding community.\"   Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., sponsored the bipartisan Lumbee Fairness Act in the upper chamber. He credited Trump in a statement, calling the designation long overdue for the Lumbee people.   \n   He said \"a historic injustice has been corrected, and the Lumbee people can finally access the full federal benefits they have long earned and deserve.\"   Trump issued a memo in January directing the Interior Department to develop a plan to assist the tribe in obtaining full federal recognition.   The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians opposed the recognition. Tribal leaders said the Lumbee circumvented proper federal eligibility procedures that require historical evidence of Native heritage. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians had been the only federally recognized Native American tribe in North Carolina. The Lumbee is now the 575th federally recognized tribe in the United States.   \"I know with every fiber of my being that our ancestors are smiling down on us today,\" Lowery said in a statement as the bill was headed to Trump's desk. \"After decades of waiting, praying, and fighting, our Tribe has finally crossed a barrier that once seemed impossible to overcome.\"   \n   More than a dozen tribes from several states are listed online as petitioning the Interior Department for federal acknowledgment. The Office of Federal Acknowledgement website says decisions are based on factors that include anthropological, genealogical, and historical research.   The Department has denied petitions that it deems fail to meet its seven-part criteria that define an Indian tribe under federal law. The requirements include that \"the petitioner comprises a distinct community and demonstrates that it existed as a community from 1900 until the present.\"   \n   Petitioners may wait decades for a resolution.\n",

Files continued to be posted on its \"Epstein Library\" website on Saturday.    But NPR identified more than a dozen files released by the DOJ on Friday that are no longer available Saturday afternoon, including one that shows President Trump's photo on a desk among several other photographs. The removed files also show various works of art, including those containing nudity.    On its website, the Justice Department directs people to report any files that should not have been posted by notifying the agency using a dedicated email address. A statement at the top of each page of the website said: \"In view of the Congressional deadline, all reasonable efforts have been made to review and redact personal information pertaining to victims, other private individuals, and protect sensitive materials from disclosure.\"   \n   The DOJ acknowledged, though, \"because of the volume of information involved, this website may nevertheless contain information that inadvertently includes non-public personally identifiable information or other sensitive content, to include matters of a sexual nature.\"   The DOJ in a statement on Sunday clarified that it removed an image of President Trump due to a request from the Southern District of New York, where judges had overseen the last cases against Epstein and his longtime confidant Ghislaine Maxwell. The Justice Department had returned the image of Trump's photo to its website as of Sunday afternoon.   \"Out of an abundance of caution, the Department of Justice temporarily removed the image for further review. After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction,\" the department said in a statement posted to social media.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                This photo illustration taken in Washington, DC, on Dec. 19, 2025 shows a court document after the Justice Department began releasing the long-awaited records from the investigation into the politically explosive case of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n                \n                    Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Congressional concerns   After the initial release of files, some members of Congress raised concerns about what was missing from the data sets.   \"There are powerful men, bankers, politicians who we know from survivors - they've told us this — who were at these parties where there were many young women, and a few were under age, and these powerful men knew about it, and they didn't say anything,\" Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., told NPR. They need to be at least publicly held accountable.\"   \n   Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who cosponsored the Epstein Transparency Act in the House along with Khanna, criticized the redactions.    Posting on X, he said the release \"grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law.\" He also warned \"a future DOJ could convict the current [Attorney General] and others\" for not properly releasing all files the law mandated be made public.   Apart from the photo that is no longer available to download, Trump's name and image appears rarely in the new documents available. There are a few pictures of him with women and a framed photo of Epstein and a redacted woman with a $22,500 oversized check signed by Trump.   While Trump wasn't mentioned much this time around, he was a frequent subject of emails and text messages in another Epstein file tranche released by the House Democratic Oversight Committee — with well over a thousand different mentions — though mainly as the subject of Epstein's near-obsession with his presidency, as the latter positioned himself as a Trump whisperer of sorts to his powerful associates.   NPR's Rahul Mukherjee and Stephen Fowler contributed reporting.\n",

It has a pulse, but not many brainwaves,\" said former Rep. Jim Cooper, a Democrat who represented Tennessee for 32 years. \"It's hard to tell that it's even alive as an institution.\"   A record number of lawmakers are calling it quits ahead of the midterm elections next year and are running for the Capitol exits, pursuing different offices or retiring from political life altogether.   While there's a temptation to look at a diminished House as a symptom of the first year of the second Trump administration, former members told NPR that legislative stagnation and low morale have been building for quite some time.   \n   Barbara Comstock, a Virginia Republican who serves as president of the Association of Former Members of Congress, said the issues are growing deeper.   \"We've done studies showing the reason a lot of people are leaving is because it's not functional, because of death threats, because they're not getting anything done,\" she said in an interview.   \"The polarization is just dramatically different from even from the 'good old days' when you had the Clinton impeachment, but you got things like welfare and tax reform done,\" said Comstock, who was a congressional staffer in the 90s and served in Congress from 2015 to 2019. \"Even while Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton were going at each other, they realized you still had to get governing done.\"   More than a dozen former House members told NPR they see significant challenges for lawmakers and the institution of Congress.   \"I don't think anybody wants to have a job where you can't get the job done,\" said Illinois Democrat Cheri Bustos, who helped recruit candidates to run for office when she led the party's House campaign arm.   \"Right now,\" she said, \"it's increasingly difficult to get the job done.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Alicia Zheng/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"You go to Congress because you have ambition to try to fix problems that you see. I got tired of just voting on a bunch of messaging bills that were never going to be taken up by the Senate, that were all pretend.\" — Former Rep. Reid Ribble, R-Wis., 2011-2017   \n   Former members detailed an increasing centralization of power in party leadership they said comes at the expense of committees. Members once saw committee leadership roles as a path to wield influence and power.    Dan Lipinski, an Illinois Democrat who served from 2005 to 2021, said a committee gavel means less now than it used to.    \"The speaker's office will tell the committee chair, 'this is what we want to see in this bill, this is what we don't want in this bill,'\" he told NPR after a day back on Capitol Hill talking to current members about their concerns. \"If the committees aren't working, then members don't really have an opportunity to be legislators.\"   Former members described how over time, intervention from leadership in processes like debates and amendments has limited the involvement of rank-and-file members.   \"The House operates from the leadership position top-down rather than from subcommittees moving up to full committees, where you have more bipartisanship,\" said Fred Upton. The Michigan Republican served from 1987 to 2023 and chaired the Energy and Commerce Committee, where he played a critical role in his party's debate over the future of the Affordable Care Act.    Patrick McHenry, a North Carolina Republican who served from 2005 to 2025, made it clear he left Congress \"loving it\" and finds it \"sour grapes and unbecoming\" when former members complain that Congress is diminished.    McHenry was once a member of House GOP leadership and chaired the Financial Services Committee. He pointed to a \"brokenness of the legislative process\" that he said has risen over the last fifty years.   \"The work stacks up in summer and then we leave the month before the budget is supposed to be done,\" he said. \"The rules of the Senate dictate you have to have 60 votes to do anything on policy, so everything for the majority party when they have the White House comes resting on the third piece, which is the budget process, to get everything you could possibly get done in the budget reconciliation process.\"   \n   McHenry said most of the agenda \"hinges upon one big piece of legislation\", which means if a measure isn't included in that bill, it's hard to get it through at all.   Former members said the congressional calendar — which now typically has the House working 3.5 days a week — leaves little time to build consensus.    \"There's real opportunity to get things done when you're able to spend time and you can see unity of purpose,\" McHenry said. \"But it's difficult with the congressional calendar.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Alicia Zheng/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"One member said, ‘I'll be traveling more days this year between home and Washington than I’ll actually be in Washington.' That’s an issue.\" — Former Rep. Dan Lipinski, D-Ill., 2005-2021    When Newt Gingrich became speaker in 1995, he shortened the congressional work week to roughly three days so that members would have more time in their districts — and so they could spend more time fundraising for re-election.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Alicia Zheng/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Jim McDermott, D-Wash., who served from 1989 to 2017, said it completely transformed the culture.   \"We didn't get barbecues together, we didn't do any of the things that used to happen on the weekends to make it a community and make compromises easier,\" he said. \"You have to know somebody a little bit before you trust them, and getting to know somebody is not just on the floor listening to speeches, for heaven's sakes. It's watching them deal with their kids. It's how fair they are on the basketball court.\"   Former members said the less time lawmakers spend with colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle, the more partisanship deepens.    \"When I arrived in Congress, I thought there was a lack of bipartisanship, that the degree of comity and cooperation had reached a new low,\" said Dan Kildee, a Democrat from Michigan who served from 2013 to 2025. \"But I didn't realize those were actually the good days of my time in Congress.\"   \n   Multiple members said partisanship is increasingly rewarded when lawmakers with the most partisan rhetoric get more media coverage and fundraising dollars.    \"I got to the point where I wanted to have a conversation with a Republican colleague that I didn't know and [I said], 'I want you to know that I don't view you as my enemy,'\" said Anna Eshoo, a Democrat who represented California from 1993 to 2025. \"Isn't that something, that I felt like I needed to say that?\"   The nature of the congressional calendar reveals another lifestyle challenge former members cited — the toll on families.   \"The biggest sacrifice is your spouse, your kids,\" said Upton. \"If you're in a district like mine, 650 miles away from D.C., you're gone half the time. So you're missing birthdays, school events, or just taking a walk with your spouse.\"   While it used to be fairly common for members to sleep in their offices while in D.C. to avoid the financial burden of paying for two homes, Congress has boosted what members can reimburse for living expenses. But Congress has not adjusted its salary for cost of living increases in line with the rest of the federal workforce.   \"I don't know any American citizen who would think their employer is being fair to them if they had not gotten a raise for their work since 2009,\" said Reid Ribble, R-Wis., who served from 2011-2017.   Raising pay — which sits at $174,000 — is a tough sell. But Charlie Dent, R-Pa., said it has practical implications for Congress, too.   \"Certainly a person with a lot more money who doesn't have to live on a congressional salary can do just fine without a raise, but there are others who cannot,\" said Dent, who served from 2005-2018. \"And so it's probably keeping some good people from running for Congress.\"   \n   Kildee said all these factors combined can make it hard to see why it's worth it.    \"A person thinking about running for Congress, realizing that will mean spending a lot of time away from home, going back and forth to Washington — but for what purpose?\" he said. \"Many of us were willing to do that because we saw a purpose. At the end of a week or the end of a month, you can look at what you did and see you made a difference in somebody's life and it was you making it happen. Whereas now it's much more difficult to see that.\"    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Alicia Zheng/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"It just feels like the moment we live in is much more dangerous and our politics more fractured than at any point I can remember.\" — Former Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa.,  2005-2018    Members said they've also seen the number of threats lawmakers face skyrocket in recent years.   \"There were always threats, but when I first arrived, those threats were rare, isolated instances,\" said Kildee. \"Now, rank-and-file members have to deal with threats that are routine.\"    Bustos described a major shift between when she was first elected in 2012 and when she left in 2023.    \"The first office I opened was in a secure building where you had to have a code to get in. I viewed it at the time as obstacles to reach our staff or to reach me,\" she said.    \"I made a decision to get out of that building because I wanted to be very accessible,\" she said. \"Fast forward toward the end of my career in Congress, and the staff didn't feel safe. We had to install these little buttons that would go to the local police department in case somebody was there and threatening. In the course of less than ten years, the mindset about accessibility changed because of the threats — and it's only gotten worse since then.\"   \n   Congress has a longstanding mutual aid program that allows local law enforcement to be reimbursed for providing security for members when they're in their home districts.   And in the aftermath of the targeted violence of state lawmakers in Minnesota this summer, the House launched a pilot program to increase lawmakers' security allotment.    U.S. Capitol Police told NPR its agents are on track to work through roughly 14,000 threat assessment cases by the end of the year.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Alicia Zheng/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"The Constitution intended Congress to be the most important branch of the government. It turns the lights on. It can shut government down. But now, Congress is so functionless, it's taken itself out of the game.\" — Former Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., 1983-1995, 2003-2023   Beyond concerns about the shift of power towards leadership at the expense of rank-and-file members, former lawmakers in both parties decried what they view as Congress abdicating its responsibilities to the executive branch.   \"I'm most concerned about the erosion of Congress' power of the purse authorities,\" said Dent. \"We're seeing on tariffs how the president is unilaterally able to raise taxes without a vote of the Congress. That's deeply troubling to me.\"   The Trump administration has defunded agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and utilized what's called a pocket rescission to cancel funding that has already been appropriated by Congress.   \"The ceding of power from Congress to the president has historically been an issue, but it has gotten much worse over the last 25 years and it has reached probably the highest level of congressional deference that we have ever seen,\" said Lipinski.   He described a recent conversation with a member who's part of  the whip team, which is responsible for counting heads on key legislation.   \"If a member says, either I'm undecided or I'm not going to vote with the party, then that member who is part of the whip team says, 'well, do you want a call from the president today or tomorrow?'\" Lipinski recalled. \"That kind of deference to a president, it doesn't matter who the president is, that is not the way our democracy is supposed to work.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Alicia Zheng/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"It's a very contentious time for many members of Congress, dangerous, challenging times. I think better times will come again, but we need patriots.\" — Former Rep. Annie Kuster, D-N.H., 2013-2025   \n   Multiple former members told NPR when people ask if they should run for Congress, they recommend state offices instead.   \"I always tell people, really look at running in the state because you can make a difference there,\" said Comstock, pointing to two former House members — Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill — who won gubernatorial elections last month. \"They're still functioning.\"   Others insisted despite the growing challenges, there's still opportunities for good work to get done on Capitol Hill.   \"You can still make a difference,\" said McHenry. \"It is hard. It is definitely a beast that you can never master, you can just seek to improve day by day.\"   Cooper put it more bluntly: \"There are certain things that are more important than having work life balance in your job. If you want a decent country to live in, we better have a good Congress.\"   He said the country needs \"more good people to run.\"   \"Now, I'm embarrassed to teach at Vanderbilt Law School when the dumbest student in my class will make more in their first job than I made after 32 years in Congress. But hey, that's life, and a good congressman will never be paid what he or she is worth,\" he said. \"But you'll have a better country as a result. And you'll have a better place for your kids and grandkids to live. Isn't that worth something?\"\n",

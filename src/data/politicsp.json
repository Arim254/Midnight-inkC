It didn't provide evidence of their alleged drug trafficking but posted a video of a boat moving through water before exploding.   President Donald Trump has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States and asserted the U.S. is engaged in an \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels. But the Trump administration is facing increasing scrutiny from lawmakers over the boat strike campaign, which has killed at least 95 people in 25 known strikes since early September, including a follow-up strike that killed two survivors clinging to the wreckage of a boat after the first hit.   \n   The latest boat strikes come on the eve of briefings on Capitol Hill for all members of Congress as questions mount over the Trump administration's military campaign.   Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other top national security officials are expected to provide closed-door briefings for lawmakers in the House and Senate.   \n   The campaign has ramped up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who has been charged with narcoterrorism in the U.S. In a sharp escalation last week, U.S. forces seized a sanctioned oil tanker that the Trump administration has accused of smuggling illicit crude. Maduro has insisted the real purpose of the U.S. military operations is to force him from office.   The U.S. military has built up its largest presence in the region in decades and launched a series of deadly strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean. Trump says land attacks are coming soon but has not offered any details on location.\n",

The House is set to vote this week on a plan proposed by Speaker Mike Johnson that does not include an extension of the ACA credits that expire at the end of this year.   GOP Rep. Kevin Kiley of California, who supports a temporary extension of the credits, said in an interview with Morning Edition that Johnson's plan was \"hastily thrown together\" and does not address \"the crisis in front of us.\"   \n   Kiley said the more than 20 million people who currently rely on the ACA credits \"shouldn't be forced to pay the price for congressional inaction.\"   Speaking to NPR's A Martínez, Kiley also discussed other efforts in the House to address the looming health care cost spike and whether Republicans and Democrats will be able to find a bipartisan solution.

Reiner's son Nick had a history of addiction, which inspired the 2016 movie Being Charlie, which Nick Reiner worked on with his dad.    Republican Rep.

But this time there's an extra complication. Though it's the middle of open enrollment, lawmakers are still debating whether to extend the subsidies that have given consumers extra help paying their health insurance premiums in recent years.   The circumstances have led to deep consumer concerns about higher costs and fears of political fallout among some Republican lawmakers.   According to a KFF poll released in December, about half of current enrollees who are registered to vote said that if their overall health care expenses — copays, deductibles, and premiums — increased by $1,000 next year, it would have a \"major impact\" on whether they vote in next year's midterm elections or which party's candidate they support.   \n   For those caught in the middle — including consumers and leaders of the 20 states, along with the District of Columbia, that run their own ACA marketplaces — the lack of action on Capitol Hill has led to uncertainty about what to do.   \"Before I sign up, I will wait and see what happens,\" said poll participant Daniela Perez, a 34-year-old education consultant in Chicago who says her current plan will increase to $1,200 a month from about $180 this year without an extension of the tax credits. \"I'm not super hopeful. Seems like everything is in gridlock.\"   In Washington, as part of the deal to end the recent government shutdown, a Senate vote was held Dec. 11 on a proposal to extend the subsidies. Another option, which was advanced by Republicans and included funding health savings accounts, or HSAs, was also considered. Neither reached the 60-vote mark necessary for passage.   On the House side, Speaker Mike Johnson plans this week to bring to the floor a narrow legislative package designed to \"tackle the real drivers of health care costs.\" It would include expanded access to association health plans and appropriations for cost-sharing reduction payments to stabilize the individual market and lower premiums. It would also increase transparency requirements for pharmacy benefit managers.     \n   Like the bill put forward by Republicans in the Senate, it would not extend the ACA enhanced subsidies. Lawmakers are likely to vote on such an extension at some point, but it is not clear when.     In general, Democrats want to extend the life of the more generous subsidies, created in response to the COVID pandemic. Those are set to expire at the end of the year. Republicans are split, with many balking at the cost of a straightforward extension, as well as the policy and political implications that might come with a vote to buttress the ACA, which many have long viewed as public enemy No. 1.   And a few back various proposals that would extend the tax subsidies, fearing that failing to do so will result in political fallout in next year's midterm elections.   The result is that differing policy positions are being advanced by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers of Congress.   The White House, though supportive of HSAs in principle, has not made clear its choice among the various Capitol Hill plans.   Meanwhile, the clock is ticking for shoppers. People needed to choose their ACA plan by Monday for coverage to begin Jan. 1. Open enrollment continues in most states until Jan. 15 for coverage beginning Feb. 1.   The marketplaces, too, must have contingency plans in case Congress intervenes. These adjustments could take days or weeks.   \"We have a plan on the shelf\" to go update the website, including notifying consumers of any changes, said Audrey Morse Gasteier, executive director of the Massachusetts Health Connector, a state-based ACA insurance marketplace.   Still, not many working days remain on Congress' 2025 calendar, and \"in many ways, it feels like they are farther apart than they were even a few months ago,\" said Jessica Altman, executive director of Covered California, that state's ACA marketplace.   \n   Waiting for numbers   Both Altman and Gasteier said it's still too early to tell how final enrollment tallies will come out, but already there are indications of how sign-ups will compare with last year's record high of about 24 million.   The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services on Dec. 5 released figures from about the first month of open enrollment, showing 949,450 new sign-ups — people who did not have ACA coverage this year — across the federal and state marketplaces. That's down a bit from approximately the same period last year, when there were 987,869 new enrollees by early December.   Up slightly, however, are returning customers who have already selected a plan for next year. That stands at about 4.8 million, according to CMS, compared with about 4.4 million at this time last year.   That initial finding — lower new enrollments but quicker action by some already covered — may reflect that \"people who come back early in the enrollment period are those who need the coverage because they have a chronic condition or need something done,\" said Sabrina Corlette, co-director of Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms. \"So they are more motivated in the front half.\"   And the final number of federal marketplace enrollments takes time to shake out. \"The rubber meets the road when people have to pay the first premium,\" Corlette said. \"With the federal marketplace, we won't know that for some time.\"   Some states have also released information from the first few weeks, with the caveat that many people may wait until mid-December or later to make coverage decisions. Affordability has emerged as a pressure point.   In Pennsylvania, for example, in the first six weeks of open enrollment there was a 16% decrease in people signing up for the first time compared with last year, according to data posted by Pennie, the state's ACA insurance marketplace. For every one of those new enrollments, 1.5 existing customers canceled, Pennie reported.   \n   There were some indicators that income is a factor: Most of those canceling earned 150% to 200% of the federal poverty level, or $23,475 to $31,300 for a single adult.   Most states automatically reenroll existing customers into the same or similar coverage for the following year. Letters and other notifications are sent to consumers, who then can let the coverage continue or go online during the open enrollment period to change their plan or cancel it.   California reported a 33% drop in new enrollments through Dec. 6. And Altman said she's also seeing some other changes.   She said more people are opting for \"bronze\"-level plans, which have lower premium payments than \"silver\" or \"gold\" plans but also higher deductibles — the amount people have to pay before most insurance coverage kicks in.   Nationally, the average bronze-plan deductible will be $7,476 next year, while silver plans carry an average $5,304 deductible, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.   \"That people are being forced to opt for plans with really high deductibles is a warning sign,\" Altman said.   In Massachusetts, consumer calls to the state's marketplace in the first month were up 7% over last year, Gasteier said.   Additionally, \"our call centers are getting heartbreaking phone calls from people about how they can't understand how they can possibly remain in coverage,\" she said.   Detailing the difference   If the enhanced tax credits expire, Obamacare subsidies will revert to pre-pandemic levels.   Households will pay a percentage of their income toward the premium, and a tax credit subsidy will cover the remainder, with the payment generally made directly to the insurer.   The enhanced subsidies reduced the amount of household income people had to pay toward their own coverage, with the lowest-income people paying nothing. Also, there was no upper limit on income to qualify — a particular point of criticism from Republicans. Still, in reality, some high earners don't get a subsidy, because their premiums without it are less than what they are required to contribute.   \n   Next year, without the more generous subsidies, those in the lowest income brackets will pay at least 2.1% of their household income toward their premiums, with the highest earners paying nearly 10%. No subsidies would be available for people earning more than four times the federal poverty level, which comes to $62,600 for an individual or $84,600 for a couple.   For those now shopping for coverage, that cap means a sharp increase in coverage costs. Not only have insurers raised premiums, but now that group's subsidies have been cut entirely.   \"They said, based on our salary, we don't qualify,\" said Debra Nweke, who, at 64, is retired, while her husband, 62, still works. They live in Southern California and are looking at coverage going from $1,000 a month this year to $2,400 monthly next year if they stay in the same ACA plan. \"How can you have health insurance that is more than your rent?\"   Senate Majority Leader John Thune said in early December that Republicans want to find a solution that will lower health care costs, but not one with \"people who are making unlimited amounts of money being able to qualify for government subsidies.\" He also objected to granting free coverage to those at the lower end of the income scale.   Even those getting subsidies say they are feeling the pinch.   \"Our prices are going up, but even at that, I don't have any other options,\" said Andrew Schwarz, a 38-year-old preacher in Bowie, Texas, who gets ACA coverage for himself and his wife. His three children are on a state health insurance program because the family qualifies as low-income. Both Schwarz and Nweke took part in the KFF poll.

Over the past year, the U.S. has paused visa and other programs for Afghan nationals, among others. Those already in the country have also been stripped of temporary permission to stay.   Further immigration restrictions followed after an Afghan national was charged in the deadly shooting of a National Guard member in Washington, D.C., last month.   Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, N.C., cautioned against a \"knee-jerk reaction\" that could block a number of Afghans with valid cases for temporary or permanent immigration status from coming to the U.S.   \n   \"One thing we've forgotten is how important that is for our special operators,\" Tillis said, referencing examples of his own constituents with deep attachments to Afghans abroad. \"It puts them in a more dangerous spot if we lose sight of that.\"   Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, also worried about the impact on Afghans from the cuts.   \"There are Afghan citizens who acted as guards, drivers, interpreters, cooks for our troops,\" Collins said. \"I've talked to veterans who have been very concerned about the safety of Afghans who have helped us. So I think the answer is more intensive and careful vetting than occurred during the Biden administration.\"   \n   The GOP divisions come as President Trump spent the bulk of his 2024 presidential campaign vowing to launch the largest deportation effort in American history.   Some Republicans have also pushed back against changes to visa programs for migrant laborers and in favor of more permanent status for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.   Afghan soldiers who assisted U.S. troops have, in the past, enjoyed bipartisan support for their immigration cases.   Meanwhile, Trump has promoted the idea that only some people are welcome in the U.S.   \"I've also announced a permanent pause on Third World migration, including from hellholes like Afghanistan, Haiti, Somalia and many other countries,\" Trump said last week at an event in Pennsylvania.   \n   Policy changes throughout the year   On his first day in office, Trump paused the refugee resettlement program, effectively stranding thousands of people already approved to come to the U.S.   This included Afghans who had helped U.S. troops, immigration advocates said. Afghanistan was one of the top countries sending refugees to the U.S. in fiscal year 2024, according to Homeland Security Department data; out of just over 100,000 refugees admitted that year, 14,680 were from Afghanistan.   \n   Some Republicans first raised concern about the pause's impact on those who had assisted U.S. armed forces.   The refugee program has since been significantly scaled back, and the target demographic for entrants is now white South Africans, according to the administration.   In June, Trump added Afghanistan to a list of 19 countries for which travel to the U.S. would be restricted.   And after the attack on National Guard members in D.C. around Thanksgiving, the Trump administration paused processing asylum cases, green cards and other immigration services for those from the countries listed in June's travel ban. It also paused processing all visas specifically for Afghans.   \n   Trump has argued that those who came from Afghanistan were not properly vetted under the Biden administration.   Rahmanullah Lakanwal, the man charged in connection with the shooting, was admitted to the U.S. in 2021 under the Biden administration's Operation Allies Welcome program. He was then granted asylum earlier this year under the Trump administration.   \"This animal would've never been here if not for Joe Biden's dangerous policies which allowed countless unvetted criminals to invade our country and harm the American people,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in response to a request for comment about the Republican divisions.   \n   It is not clear what could have been uncovered through additional vetting before Lakanwal arrived to the U.S.   Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said the suspect could have been radicalized after coming to the U.S. At the same time, advocates have long criticized agencies such as the CIA and DHS for failing to provide resources, including for mental health, for Afghan soldiers transitioning to life in America after experiencing harrowing violence.   Questions about Congress's role   Immigrant advocacy groups accuse lawmakers of ceding their power to the president when it comes to immigration policy.   \"Instead of asserting its constitutional role, Congress has allowed itself to be sidelined, failing to provide meaningful oversight,\" Shawn VanDiver, the founder of the organization AfghanEvac, which advocates for Afghans who worked with U.S. troops, said during a press conference. \"Failing to modernize the asylum, refugee, or [special immigrant visa] systems. The vacuum they have left is being filled with fear-mongering, not facts; politics, not policy.\"   Congress this year has passed very few immigration-related bills, mostly focusing on funding the Department of Homeland Security's enforcement efforts. Many other legislative efforts to facilitate or reform immigration processes have been at a standstill.   \n   But some Republicans are happy to leave immigration in the administration's hands.   \"Primarily, that's an executive branch issue,\" Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., who sits on the Homeland Security Committee, said about the vetting process of Afghans and other immigrants.   \"Our staff are not the ones that are actually doing the vetting. The vetting process does exist and is out there. It's just a matter of its execution at this point.\"   Republican leaders also appear aligned with the Trump administration on the topic.   \n   House Republicans stripped a bipartisan provision from the National Defense Authorization Act that would have brought back an office at the State Department that relocates Afghan refugees. The legislation passed the House last week and is set for a Senate vote this week.   \n   \"Republican leadership tanked months of bipartisan work,\" Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, D-Calif., who introduced the provision, said in a statement. \"It is truly shameful that my Republican colleagues, some of whom served in Afghanistan and uniquely understand the debt we owe our allies, have once again put blind loyalty to Trump over American principles and obligations.\"   Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., told NPR that one solution to the question of Afghan vetting would be to pass the \"Fulfilling Promises to Afghan Allies Act,\" which provides a pathway for Afghans to apply for legal permanent residency, following additional vetting, and is supported by senators of both parties. The bill was introduced in August, but has not seen a committee vote.   \"I'd like to see the bill that I sponsored, which would have increased vetting on anybody applying here, to take effect before we make another decision,\" Cassidy said.   Still, enthusiasm to tackle anything immigration-related in this Congress is low.   John Cornyn, R-Texas, has in the past supported measures for special immigrant visas for Afghan military interpreters and translators. But he told NPR that now is not the right time to restart that conversation, without elaborating on his reasons.   \"It's premature to talk about that,\" Cornyn said.\n",

But long before his son's political ambitions, Mamdani was a prominent scholar whose work examined colonialism and anti-colonialism in Africa.   That scholarship is rooted in his own experience as a Ugandan citizen of Indian origin who was twice rendered stateless due to political turmoil in East Africa during the 1970s and 80s.   \n   \"We were migrants, and under the colonial system, migrants were defined as non-Indigenous,\" Mamdani said.   That meant people like him were never made to feel fully at home in Uganda and were stripped of core rights. Those experiences shaped a lifelong quest to understand, as he puts it, \"who belongs, who does not, and how it has changed over time.\"   \n   Mamdani has been a professor of government in the department of anthropology at Columbia University since 1999.   \n   His latest book, Slow Poison, focuses on the making of the Ugandan state post British colonialism and the two autocrats that largely shaped it. Mamdani argues that Idi Amin and the current president Yoweri Museveni, who has been in power since 1986, inherited and governed within an within an intractable colonial legacy handed down from the British.   Speaking to NPR's Leila Fadel, Mamdani discussed the book and the parallels between his experiences in exile and his son's quest to challenge ideas of power and belonging in the country's largest city.

(Yes, One Battle After Another is a Warner Bros. movie).   This isn't the first time Warner Bros. has been at the center of headline-grabbing merger or acquisition. Actually, Warner Bros. has a long history of messy corporate marriages and divorces. It could be a cautionary tale about the dangers of mergers and acquisitions. You could even call it the Warner Bros. Curse.   Over the last decade alone, the Warner Bros. Curse has shown itself at least twice. In 2018, after a two-year regulatory battle, AT&T acquired what was then called Time Warner for $85.4 billion, and renamed the company WarnerMedia. Many believed AT&T overpaid for the company, and the stock market never seemed to really love this deal. WarnerMedia struggled to find big profits in streaming, its movie business was devastated by the pandemic, and the companies' cultures never really jibed with each other.   \n   And so — in a deal that represented tens of billions of dollars in losses for its shareholders — AT&T sold shares and ceded control of WarnerMedia to Discovery Inc. The two officially merged in 2022, forming Warner Bros. Discovery, which is still this Frankenstein of a company's name (Frankenstein is another Warner Bros. property).   Since then, the company has made a series of bizarre decisions, like rebranding its streaming service HBO as HBO Max and then Max and then back to HBO Max. There were other debacles. Like, despite the movie being nearly done — and despite the fact they had spent nearly $90 million making it — Warner Bros. Discovery shelved BatGirl (and apparently wrote the loss off on their taxes). More recently, the company bought the rights to stream the show Mad Men, and as part of its release on the streaming platform, it sought to remaster the series into a widescreen, 4K format. But the production team apparently failed to do their due diligence and make sure it all looked good before releasing it. The result: those who watched Mad Men on HBO Max saw things like the production crew in the frame, including, in one scene, a technician holding a \"vomit hose\" as one of their actors pretended to throw up. This whole chapter of Warner Bros. history has proven to be, um, Looney Tunes.   \n   Economists who study mergers and acquisitions have long puzzled over why so many corporate marriages go wrong. \"Study after study puts the failure rate of mergers and acquisitions somewhere between 70% and 90%,\" wrote the legendary Harvard Business School scholar Clayton Christensen and colleagues in Harvard Business Review back in 2011. The story of Warner Bros. is a pretty interesting case study to get an understanding of why so many mergers and acquisitions fail.   The most glaring example of the Warner Bros. Curse happened at the turn of the millennium. It's widely considered to be one of the worst — if not the worst — mergers of all time. It was so bad that it's still studied in business schools.   Today in the Planet Money newsletter, we look at that disastrous merger. And we ponder some reasons why so many mergers and acquisitions fail.   The merger of the century   In October 1999, Steve Case, the CEO of America Online (AOL), made a fateful phone call to Gerald Levin, the CEO of Time Warner.   At the time, Case was only 41 years old, but, over the previous 15 years, he had built one of the most exciting companies in America. Before AOL, the internet was largely a place for geeks and bureaucrats. Case's company had made the internet accessible to tens of millions of normal Americans. In 1998, the company's popularity even inspired a zeitgeisty rom-com, You've Got Mail (which, you guessed it, was produced and distributed by Warner Bros.) In the midst of dotcom mania in the late 1990s, AOL's share price was rocketing through the stratosphere.   But Case was also worried. He was worried about mounting competition. He was worried that the stock market was in a speculative mania that wouldn't last. And he was worried what would happen to his company if there was a crash. AOL didn't really own much when it came to hard assets and the internet was changing fast. Case wanted to leverage his company's inflated share price, buy something big and tangible, diversify his company's business model, and secure a more resilient corporate future. Time Warner had serious appeal. For one, AOL was increasingly getting into the content game, and Time Warner offered exciting intellectual property to distribute. Even more, Case coveted Time Warner's sprawling network of cable lines, which would prove valuable as consumers ditched dial-up modems and adopted high-speed internet.   \n   Gerald Levin, on the other hand, was disgruntled with the direction of his company. Time Warner was by then a sprawling media conglomerate which, after a series of mergers and acquisitions, controlled media entities like Time magazine, Warner Bros. Pictures, a record company, HBO, CNN, TBS, and Sports Illustrated. But his company's stock price was underperforming during the dotcom stock mania. He worried his company was failing to thrive at the dawn of the digital age. He was floundering while trying to usher in Time Warner's digital future in house, and he yearned for what he called another \"transforming transaction\" — a merger or acquisition — to revolutionize his company and secure his legacy.   When Case called Levin, he didn't beat around the bush. \"Jerry? I've been thinking: we should put our two companies together. What do you think? Any interest?\" he said, according to an excellent 2004 book by journalist Nina Munk, Fools Rush In: Steve Case, Jerry Levin, and the Unmaking of AOL Time Warner.   Levin was interested, but he also played hard to get. \"I don't think so, Steve. But I'll think about it,\" he reportedly said.   By then, Case had grown insanely rich, had a second marriage he wanted to preserve, and he had grown tired of the intensive work of being the CEO of his company. He was now hobnobbing with bigwigs at places like White House state dinners and the World Economic Forum in Davos, and he was on his way to a more cushy life as an investor, thinkfluencer, and philanthropist. Case was prepared to step down as CEO and take a less time-intensive role as chairman of the board, and he knew exactly what to say to Levin to pique his interest: Levin would take the helm of this new corporate juggernaut.   But Levin was still wary. And he had reason to be. Before he had become Time Warner's CEO, Levin had a long career in the lower rungs of its executive team. In late 1980s and early 1990s, when Time Inc. sought to merge with Warner Bros. (then known as Warner Communications) and form what would become Time Warner, the transaction encountered serious difficulties (the Warner Bros. Curse!). A company known as Gulf & Western — which would soon be renamed Paramount Communications, and today is known as Paramount Skydance — tried to stage a hostile takeover of Time Inc. (Sound familiar?) That hostile takeover ultimately failed, but it cost Time a lot of stress and money — and time — to avoid it, and Levin worried this was the beginning of another similar story.   \n   After some back and forth over the next few weeks, Case and Levin decided to meet. They wanted this meeting to be a secret. So they rented a suite at a hotel in Manhattan, near Time Warner's headquarters, and spent an evening together.   They ordered room service for dinner, drank fancy wine, ate chocolate mousse, and dazzled each other. Through deep philosophical conversations about business and life, they decided they were simpatico. That night, they decided they would marry their two corporations, forming the world's largest media and entertainment company.   There were still thorny details to work out. Like, what percentage of shares in this new company would each side get? AOL had a stock market capitalization that was nearly double Time Warner's, and its stock price was growing much faster. But when it came to the meat and potatoes of actual revenue, Time Warner actually made much more money. And it had valuable assets, including a sprawling array of media properties and physical cable infrastructure. Levin wanted a 50-50 split in a new merged company. Case rejected 50-50. After months of negotiations, Levin ultimately settled on Time Warner getting 45% of their new, merged entity.   On January 10, 2000, AOL announced it was acquiring Time Warner for $182 billion. It was one of the largest — if not the largest — corporate mergers in history. When they officially merged, the two companies would be worth $350 billion. It was a wedding between old and new media, creating what looked like a power couple that would dominate the 21st century. Many analysts thought it was brilliant. The new company promised astounding rates of profit growth.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                America Online Chairman Steve Case (L) and Time Warner Chairman Gerald Levin (R) announce their companies' merger Jan. 10, 2000 at a New York news conference. The new company will be called AOL Time Warner.\n                \n                    Stan Honda/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Stan Honda/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   A star-crossed marriage   But almost immediately, the marriage between AOL and Time Warner turned rocky. Levin had negotiated this deal while keeping much of Time Warner in the dark. He had treated his executives and his board of directors like a rubber stamp. Many felt the deal was rushed and sloppy. From the outset, many executives and employees were angry about the merger.   \n   And, as the companies began to merge, AOL and Time Warner had big culture clashes. Time Warner was old school. Its board meetings were structured and formal. AOL meetings tended to be freeflowing and chaotic. Time Warner's divisions — from HBO to CNN to Warner Bros studios to its magazines — had operated autonomously. AOL wanted them to be under more centralized control, and pursue cross-platform advertising deals. AOL was obsessed with beating expectations, stoking investor excitement, and juicing their stock price. Time Warner executives were less obsessed with metrics and chasing short-term stock gains. Each side thought the other side knew nothing about their side of the business. There was a lot of animosity as the two teams became one.   Maybe it would have all worked out in a rosier market. However, as luck would have it, the two companies negotiated their deal just three months before the peak of the dotcom bubble: March 10, 2000. After that, the bubble started to deflate. It would still be almost a year until federal regulators would approve this deal and make the proposed merger official. In the meantime, AOL's stock began sinking.   The whole deal between Time Warner and AOL was predicated on an explosive rate of growth at AOL. But as the stock market crashed and the economy turned sour, companies began cutting back on advertising. Advertising was crucial to AOL's business (and also Time Warner's). Meanwhile, AOL's new subscriber growth began to slow down. And AOL's stock descent picked up pace.   By January 11, 2001, when federal regulators officially approved of the merger, AOL Time Warner was already in serious trouble. But things got much worse after the spring of 2001, when America officially entered a recession. Then came 9/11, and the economy got even worse.   The newly formed AOL Time Warner went into panic mode as their business soured. The company began doing share buybacks, trying to signal to the market that their stock was undervalued (even as its top executives sold shares). They laid off thousands of employees and began making drastic cuts. They got super petty about employee expenses, like eliminating free soda and forcing employees to buy from vending machines. Worst of all, AOL executives resorted to cooking their books, trying to make it seem like their advertising revenue was solid when really it wasn't.   \n   The bad news for AOL Time Warner kept mounting. Fighting over what the company should do, the bromance between Case and Levin turned to man-imosity, and Case began rallying their board against Levin.   The writing was on the wall. On December 5, 2001, Levin announced he was going to go into early retirement. \"I'd never cried before,\" Levin told Nina Munk, when she was writing her 2004 book about this corporate fiasco. \"I'd never cried. And now I cry all the time.\"   With Levin exiting, a civil war broke out within the company. The two sides hated each other. Levin's replacement as CEO, Richard Parsons, would later tell The New York Times, \"It was beyond certainly my abilities to figure out how to blend the old media and the new media culture. They were like different species, and in fact, they were species that were inherently at war.\"   In the summer of 2002, The Washington Post got a scoop that — both before and after its merger with Time Warner — AOL had been essentially cooking the books, pretending that it was getting more ad and other revenue than it really was. That story inspired lawsuits and investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and AOL Time Warner's stock price went into a free fall.   By the end of this fiasco, over $200 billion in shareholder value had been wiped out (over $350 billion in today's dollars). The company was forced to pay big fines. AOL Time Warner ended up firing basically every senior AOL executive. Under pressure, Steve Case resigned as the board chairman. In 2003, AOL Time Warner dropped AOL from its name and, in 2009, officially separated from it. (AOL is still around; an Italian tech company called \"Bending Spoons\" recently announced it was buying it for $1.5 billion).   What is today called Warner Bros. Discovery still bears the scars — including billions of dollars in debt — from its disastrous merger a quarter century ago.   \n   Netflix promises it will avoid the Warner Bros. Curse   Interestingly, Netflix executives, with their eyes set on acquiring Warner Bros., recently promised Wall Street that, basically, don't worry, we won't fall victim to the Warner Bros. Curse like so many have before us.   \"A lot of those failures that we've seen historically is because the company that was doing the acquisition didn't understand the entertainment business,\" said Greg Peters, co-CEO of Netflix, on a recent call with Wall Street analysts, according to Deadline. \"They didn't really understand what they were buying. We understand these assets that we're buying, the things that are critical in Warner Bros. are key businesses that we operate in, and we understand. A lot of times, the acquiring company, it was a legacy non-growth business that was looking for sort of a lifeline. That doesn't apply to us. We've got a healthy, growing business that we're super, super excited about.\"   But their potential merger with Warner Bros is already off to a rocky start. Paramount is attempting a hostile takeover. The two are now involved in a battle that could prove to be an intense bidding war, increasing the chances that Warner Bros. could be involved in another ill-fated merger.   What causes so many mergers and acquisitions to fail? One big reason is that the buyers tend to overpay for what they're acquiring. There are a lot of potential reasons for that. One is related to something we wrote about in a recent newsletter and covered in The Indicator. Behavioral economists have long observed that winners in auctions — or really any market where people competitively bid against each other for something — are often the ones who overpay for what they're buying. They call it \"the winner's curse.\" In other words, the winning bidders often win precisely because they are the ones who most overestimate the value of what they're buying.   \n   At heart, corporate leaders may overpay in mergers and acquisitions because they're bad at judging what those companies — and what those companies and their companies combined — will actually be worth. There's a well-known insight in personal finance that people, for the most part, shouldn't pick and choose individual stocks. The basic idea is that stock prices already reflect available information, and it's hard to beat the market. Maybe that extends even to many CEOs and expert executive teams buying or selling companies.   If you're a company seeking to buy another company, \"[y]ou are almost always going to pay more – often significantly more – than the firm is currently worth,\" writes Melissa Schilling, a scholar at the NYU Stern School of Business. \"If you didn't, the target's current owners wouldn't sell. Their outside option is always to hold or sell to another bidder at a higher price. That means your acquisition is only going to pay off if you know something the market doesn't know, or you can do something significantly better with that firm's assets than its current owners are doing.\"   Apparently, that is really hard to do. But cocky executives often think they know something that the market doesn't, and they may overestimate the actual 'synergies' that can be found when two companies become one. Ultimately, they may overvalue what they're buying or merging to create.   Or maybe company leaders sometimes do foresee the real value, but it's for themselves, and not necessarily for their employees or shareholders. In a 2022 book, titled The Merger Mystery, scholars Geoff Meeks and J. Gay Meeks, both of the University of Cambridge, argue that \"misaligned incentives\" between executives and their companies is one common reason why, despite a high failure rate, so many corporate leaders are so gung-ho to do mergers and acquisitions. Basically, company leaders and advisors can often make huge sums of money from M&A transactions — kind of like Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav has in the transactions he's been involved with — even if those transactions ultimately fail to boost their company's profits and serve their shareholders and employees.   The benefits for corporate bigwigs pushing for mergers and acquisitions goes beyond just money. For example, it can also be quite an ego boost to suddenly be in charge of a much bigger company or control something that gets lots of public attention.   Meanwhile, dealmaking like this is often hindered by what economists call asymmetric information. When different parties in a deal have unequal information about the thing that is being bought or sold, it can lead to mispricing and market failures. For instance, maybe the troubles at AOL were more apparent to insiders with intimate knowledge about their company's performance. Had Time Warner gotten better information about the company they were forming a relationship with — and not rushed through their due diligence in prodding and poking the deal — maybe they would have killed the deal or structured it differently.   There are many other potential reasons why mergers and acquisitions can go wrong. But the story of AOL and Time Warner's disastrous merger really highlights how the actual work of making two companies into one can be really messy. Culture clashes, personal animosities, and the headaches of implementing new processes, structures, and strategies can be demoralizing to employees and hurt a newly merged company's performance, detracting from the synergies that the companies were originally hoping for.   We look forward to seeing how this new sequel to the decades-old franchise of Warner Bros. mergers and acquisitions turns out. Sure, it could prove to be like The Dark Knight, a commercial and critical success. However, there is a big risk it could be more like Joker: Folie à Deux, another Warner Bros. flop.\n",

    "body": "\n      The House is expected to vote this week on several proposals this week to avert rising costs as the deadline for the Affordable Care Act subsidies fast approaches.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Today is the last day to sign up for health care coverage next year through Affordable Care Act marketplaces. Congress has not passed a bill to address rising prices for around 22 million people. Tax credits for them expire. House Speaker Mike Johnson has promised a vote this week on his health care proposal, which does something different, which NPR's Luke Garrett is here to tell us about. Luke, good morning.LUKE GARRETT, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve.INSKEEP: What is Speaker Johnson's health care plan?GARRETT: So, Steve, to start, it's worth noting what Speaker Johnson's health care proposal leaves out. It does...INSKEEP: OK.GARRETT: ...Not extend ACA tax subsidies, which millions of Americans have really grown accustomed to. This makes the proposal a nonstarter for Democrats, as well as some moderate Republicans. Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called it, quote, \"toxic legislation.\" And Speaker Johnson's package also doesn't include President Trump's idea to send money directly to those personal health saving accounts.INSKEEP: OK. So nothing for health savings accounts here, and also no subsidies here. So what is in the plan?GARRETT: Right. Let's get into it. So the plan puts forward a long-sought GOP proposal to increase access to employer-sponsored health insurance plans. This bill would give eligible Americans access to what's known as association health plans. A lot of names there, but basically, small businesses and self-employed folks could band together, leverage their power and purchase health care. The idea is it would create competition and therefore lower prices.INSKEEP: OK.GARRETT: The GOP proposal would also require pharmacy benefit managers to report more data, in hopes of shrinking drug costs. Speaker Johnson said this initiative tackles the real drivers of health care costs. And the Rules Committee is set to mark up the bill Tuesday, and GOP leadership tells me that they're eyeing a Wednesday vote. And that's according to a senior aide not authorized to speak publicly.INSKEEP: So Johnson is aiming at larger problems in the health care system, in the hopes of eventually driving down costs. Is that the only plan before the House?GARRETT: It's not. There are a couple other ideas circulating in the House, but they don't have the support of the speaker, so their sponsors are filing discharge petitions. That's a procedural maneuver to try to get around leadership and force a vote.INSKEEP: Right.GARRETT: Republican Representative Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania filed one of these discharge petitions last week, defying his leadership and teaming up with a few other moderate GOP members and Democratic ones. Democratic Representative Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey also filed another discharge petition. Both would extend ACA subsidies for two years. So far, these petitions have at least a dozen signatures from either side of the political aisle, building momentum. But they still have to reach that 218 threshold mark, which is a long way to go.INSKEEP: Especially since the Democratic Party leaders have not gone along with this yet, right?GARRETT: That's right.INSKEEP: OK. Is this going to be the new norm - discharge petitions, even from Republicans who are dissatisfied with their own leaders?GARRETT: Well, it certainly represents growing dissatisfaction within the Republican conference in the House. Speaker of the House controls floor votes. But in the last few months, we've seen GOP members challenge Speaker Johnson's power with a handful of these petitions. You know, most notably, we saw this with the release of the Epstein files bill, which members forced onto the floor with a discharge petition. We'll see if this happens with the health care bills.INSKEEP: Can you just tell me about the Senate? Are they working on anything after two plans failed last week?GARRETT: So as it stands, there are no scheduled health care votes in the Senate. But Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said he sees a deal coming together. He told CNN that he was optimistic about a compromise that would extend ACA subsidies in exchange for reforms to the government health care program.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BILL CASSIDY: If we do that, I think there could be interest in a short-term extension. I think that could be the deal.GARRETT: But Cassidy was also optimistic about his bill that failed last week.INSKEEP: OK. No idea what, if anything, is going to pass. Luke, thanks so much.GARRETT: Thanks, Steve.INSKEEP: NPR's Luke Garrett.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      Despite being in control of the White House and Congress, Republicans have been unable to pass their health care agenda. We look at why that's the case, as well as a new lawsuit against the president.   \n\n    AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:  Another week passed without lawmakers being able to agree on a health care plan with the current subsidies expiring in less than three weeks. And a new plan that replaces the Affordable Care Act - often called Obamacare - is something President Trump has been promising for years. Here he is in 2011, speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I will fight to end Obamacare and replace it - replace it with something that makes sense for people and business and not bankrupt the country.RASCOE: Fast-forward 14 years, and here he is on Thursday night at a White House holiday party.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: And I really believe we can work on health care together and come up with something that's going to be much better, much less expensive for the people, less expensive for our nation.RASCOE: But so far, neither the president nor his party have come up with a plan that'll pass Congress. We're joined now by NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Good morning.TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning, Ayesha.RASCOE: So, you know, things are at this critical stage, but Republicans are in control of the White House as well as Congress. Is there a way for them to turn health care into a win for their party?KEITH: I mean, anything is possible. There are 24 million people who get their insurance on the Affordable Care Act exchanges, and an analysis by KFF estimates that they will see their insurance premiums more than double without an extension of these tax credits, but there isn't a cohesive Republican plan or position. The party is really divided amongst itself. President Trump isn't engaged in the details and certainly isn't throwing his weight behind getting something passed. Dueling Republican and Democratic plans failed in the Senate last week. The House heads home for the holidays on Thursday. So the clock is really ticking on a solution, and it just doesn't look like there's enough Republican support for a clean extension of the tax credits - at least not yet. If people want coverage on January 1, they have to sign up for a plan by tomorrow. So that's what I mean by the clock ticking.RASCOE: Well, is there any polling on this to show how the president's base feels about these, you know, ACA subsidies expiring?KEITH: KFF polled people who get their coverage through the marketplaces. So these are people that would be directly affected by the tax credits expiring. In that group, 72% of Republicans say Congress should extend the tax credits. Also, according to KFF, nearly 6 in 10 people who get their insurance through the ACA marketplaces live in congressional districts that are represented by a Republican.RASCOE: OK. So turning to a new lawsuit against the president now. He's being sued by a preservation group over his White House ballroom renovations. What's that about, and how is the White House responding?KEITH: The National Trust for Historic Preservation is trying to temporarily halt construction on the $300 million ballroom. They're arguing that President Trump hasn't gone through the proper approvals. You will remember in October, the entire East Wing of the White House was demolished to make way for a 90,000-square-foot ballroom. That was without any plans being submitted to the appropriate commissions for approval and without public comment until after the fact, when there was a lot of negative public comment. Now there are cranes and pile drivers operating on the White House grounds, but still no plans submitted. The president says he loves the sound, but Carol Quillen, the president and CEO of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, is concerned by the lack of transparency and public input.CAROL QUILLEN: We feel like we have no choice here. We need to fulfill our mission. We need to speak on behalf of the American public. And we need to make the case that these processes are important and that respecting them matters because our history matters.KEITH: White House spokesman Davis Ingle told me, quote, \"President Trump has full legal authority to modernize, renovate and beautify the White House, just like all of his predecessors did.\"RASCOE: And briefly in the time we have left, quote, \"very serious retaliation\" after two U.S. service members and an American civilian were killed in an ISIS attack in Syria. Do we know more about what that might entail?KEITH: We do not. President Trump spoke briefly on the south lawn of the White House, saying that he blames the Islamic terrorist group ISIS for the attack and said it was an attack on both Syria and the United States. In a post on social media, Trump said that Syria's president is extremely angry and disturbed by the attack and that it was in an area that is not fully controlled by the government.RASCOE: That's NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith.

The third-generation Black row crop farmer estimated picking almost 1,300 pounds of cotton, an average of 50 bushels of soybeans, and an average of around 155 bushels of corn on 2,500 acres of his farmland in northeast Louisiana.   But with U.S. commodities facing steep retaliatory tariffs overseas, he says he and many other farmers can't sell their crops for enough to cover the loans they take out to fund the growing season.   The tariffs, Davis said, are making it almost impossible to survive.   \n   \"To have that kind of yield and still not be able to pay all your bills, that tells you something is broken in the farming industry,\" Davis said.   In order to plan for next year, farmers need relief now, Davis said. At a recent meeting with his banker, the bank projected 2026 revenues in order to secure crop loans, and the cash flow math wasn't adding up — the farm's expected income wasn't enough to cover operating loans once input costs, equipment notes, land rent and insurance premiums were factored in.   \n   The Trump administration announced just this week  a new $12 billion package of one-time bridge payments for American farmers like Davis, aimed at helping them recover from temporary market disruptions and high production costs.   \"This relief will provide much needed certainty as they get this year's harvest to market and look ahead to next year's crops,\" Trump said during a White House roundtable event. \"It'll help them continue their efforts to lower food prices for American families.\"   Davis says that type of help can't come soon enough.    \"Without bailouts, it is hard to make crop loans work on paper,\" he said in an interview with NPR on Monday.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                James Davis asks a question at a panel on farm finances at the National Black Growers Council conference in New Orleans on Dec. 10, 2025. Davis is a third-generation Black row crop farmer who said that despite having the best year he's ever had in his farming career, he's still struggling to pay his bills.\n                \n                    Drew Hawkins/Gulf States Newsroom\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Drew Hawkins/Gulf States Newsroom\n    \n\n   \n   At the same time, however, the Trump Administration dismantled decades-old USDA programs designed to assist Black farmers by eliminating the \"socially disadvantaged\" designation, including programs like the 2501 Program, which many Black row-crop farmers rely on for access to credit, technical assistance, and conservation support that are otherwise difficult to secure at county-level USDA offices. The USDA did not respond to requests for interviews or comment.   \n   Those supports, experts said, were designed to help smaller farmers and farmers of color remain on the land.   Welcome relief may not come in time   The Farmer Bridge Assistance Program accounts for up to $11 billion of the newly announced package, and offers proportional payments to farmers growing major commodities, including row crops like soybeans, corn and cotton.   Payments are expected to begin by February of next year, and are designed to offset losses from the 2025 crop year.   \n   For many farmers, that isn't soon enough. While the bridge payment may help with crop loans, there are immediate bills due for many in the coming weeks.    \"This needs to show up like Santa Claus underneath the Christmas tree, to be honest with you,\" said PJ Haynie, a fifth-generation Black farmer with rice operations in Virginia and Arkansas and chairman of the National Black Growers Council, which met in New Orleans this week for its annual conference.   \"Our landlords want their money by the end of the year — our seed and input and chemical and equipment companies that we have to make payments by the end of the year,\" he said.   Some farmers may have relationships with bankers and companies that will work with them and extend payment deadlines a few months, Haynie said — others don't. And farmers are grateful for any support they receive, but, Haynie said, the one-time bridge payments aren't enough.   \"They still won't make us whole because of the losses that we've incurred because of the markets, the tariffs, the trade,\" he said. \"But every dollar helps.\"   Farmers already face challenges like unpredictable weather, pests and stagnant commodity prices, as well as rising input costs including machinery and fertilizer purchases. \"We plant and we pray,\" as Haynie put it. Tariffs have only compounded those challenges.   Black farmers face additional challenges   Black farmers like Haynie and Davis make up less than 2% of all U.S. farmers — and Black row-crop farmers, like those at this week's conference, are an even smaller slice of that.   \n   \"Our herd is small,\" Haynie said, \"and if we can protect the herd, the herd will grow.\"   Black farmers have asked the federal government for loan relief and other assistance for decades. A century ago, Black farmers owned at least 16 million acres of land. Today, Haynie said they hold around 2 million.    \n   Following the Civil War, Black Americans were promised \"40 acres and a mule\" by the federal government, but many say that promise never came to pass.   Over the course of the past 100 years, the amount of Black-owned farmland dropped by 90%, according to Data for Progress, due to higher rates of loan and credit denials, lack of legal and industry support and \"outright acts of violence and intimidation.\"   Advocates say the inability for Black farmers to get a start, and later the sharp drop in farming population, is in part due to what they call USDA's discriminatory lending practices, and often specific loan officers' biases. The agency is the subject of an ongoing discrimination class action lawsuit by Black farmers and additional litigation due to those and other allegations.   Much of that history plays into how Black farmers approach the Trump administration.   \"The Black row crop farm community needs the support of the administration,\" Haynie said. \"I can't … buy an $800,000 combine to sell $4 corn. The math doesn't math on that.\"   All farmers — \"Black or white\" — are responding to the same depressed prices, he said. But Black farmers, he argues, already a small percentage of total U.S. growers, and often operating at a smaller scale, have less buffer to absorb sudden market shocks.   As farmers look at their projected costs next year, economists say they're also navigating deep uncertainty in global markets.   \"I think that a lot of farmers are still very much looking at the next year with some trepidation, thinking that their margins will continue to be very, very tight,\" said Joseph Glauber, a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington D.C.   \n   U.S. trade with China — historically the top buyer of American soybeans and other row crops — has not rebounded to pre–trade war levels despite a new agreement. Meanwhile, Glauber said, countries like Brazil have expanded production dramatically, seizing market share during the trade war and becoming the world's top soybean exporter — a long-term structural shift that U.S. growers now have to compete against.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Finis Stribling III (left) and John Green II (right) take a break during the National Black Growers Council conference in New Orleans on Dec. 10, 2025. Both Stribling and Green were plagued by bad weather at the start of this year's growing season, and both said tariffs have only made things harder.\n                \n                    Drew Hawkins/Gulf States Newsroom\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Drew Hawkins/Gulf States Newsroom\n    \n\n   \n   He added that crops grown in the Mississippi River Delta, such as cotton and soybeans, have been hit especially hard by low prices and retaliatory tariffs.   Finis Stribling III farms 800 acres of cotton, rice, corn, soybeans and wheat in Arkansas and Tennessee. At the National Black Growers Council's conference, he told NPR 2025 was another year of what he calls \"farming in deficit.\"   \"We had too much rain early, then drought,\" he said. \"And when you finally get a crop in the field, the price support isn't strong enough to cover the cost of production.\"   Sitting next to him during a lunch break at the conference, another Arkansas row crop farmer John Lee II, put it bluntly: \"What I'm worried about is next year. What do we do in 2026 when we go to the bank to try and get a loan? I'm concerned about the notion of going to the bank this upcoming year and not being able to get a loan because we can't make the loan cash flow.\"   Both also said the new tariff relief will help — but not nearly to the degree many outside agriculture may think.   \"From the outside looking in, non-farm community, you say $12 billion seems like a lot of money,\" Stribling said. \"But when you look at the cost of production and the money that's spent in agriculture, $12 billion is really just a drop in the bucket. It's almost like putting a Band-Aid on a bullet wound.\"\n",

Since the first attack was announced on Sept. 2, these strikes have occurred nearly every week, killing dozens of people.   NPR compiled a list of these boat attacks using posts on Truth Social and X by President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. These posts show grainy video footage of vessels being blown up. The administration has not publicly released further evidence that the boats were actually carrying drugs and who was on board. Select lawmakers have been briefed about  the U.S. attacks, though some of them, including the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee, have requested additional information.   \n   The strikes are part of a larger Trump administration  strategy to target what officials call \"narco-terrorists.\" In a post on X on Nov. 4, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth vowed to \"find and and terminate EVERY vessel with the intention of trafficking drugs to America to poison our citizens,\" adding that \"NO cartel terrorist stands a chance against the American military.\"   Of specific interest to Trump is targeting Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang that his administration designated a foreign terrorist organization in January 2025. In dozens of speeches since taking office, Trump has accused Tren de Aragua of violent criminal activity within the United States' borders.   \"Such organizations torture, maim, mutilate and murder with impunity,\" Trump said in an address to the United Nations on Sept. 23. \"And for this reason, we've recently begun using the supreme power of the United States military to destroy Venezuelan terrorists and trafficking networks led by [Venezuelan President] Nicolás Maduro.\" The Venezuelan government denies the charges that it plays a role in drug trafficking.    \n   Legal scholars question whether the executive branch has the unilateral authority to launch these attacks in international waters without an authorization of force from Congress. The administration claims it does have the authority, and the president has said he doesn't need a congressional declaration of war.   There are also reports that these strikes have endangered and killed civilians. Colombian President Gustavo Petro accused the U.S. of murdering a Colombian fisherman with no ties to drug smuggling in a September strike. Relations between the United States and some Latin American countries had already begun to strain since Trump took office. This latest high-profile military operation in the region marks a significant further erosion.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Steve Inskeep speaks with House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts about the pending vote on a measure to end the government shutdown.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Now let's go to the House Democratic whip, the minority whip, Katherine Clark, the No. 2 Democrat in the House. Welcome back to the program.KATHERINE CLARK: Oh, good morning, Steve.INSKEEP: Quite a debate. But first, do you assume this measure is going to pass the House today?CLARK: I do. I think that we have seen Republicans consolidate time and time again. When Donald Trump asked them to do something, they do it. And they have shown in the House, they weren't even willing to come to work for over 50 days in order to avoid any negotiation around health care, any discussion about how we can make life easier and less expensive for the American people. So I fully assume they are going to fall in line and vote yes as a block and pass this today.INSKEEP: OK. Well, let's talk now about this debate within the Democratic Party about what happened and what you do now. We had earlier on today Josh Barro, longtime journalist, who made the case that Democrats may have actually gained here, even though they gave up and they lost in the end. You made your point. The president's approval declined. Now you move on. Is there anything to that argument?CLARK: I think it is not just moving on. It is continuing this fight. Listen, our point has been from the beginning of this president's term that he should hold true to his promise. He promised he'd lower costs on Day 1. And everything that they have done - everything the House and Senate GOP and this president have done has made life harder and more expensive. The entire system doesn't work for people, and the Republicans are hell-bent on rigging it further against them and in favor of the very wealthy in this country.So whatever frustration and disappointment we had last week, we don't have time to dwell there. We have to unite and keep this fight up. The American people who are facing a cliff on whether they will be able to afford and keep health insurance for themselves and their families are depending on us to act as the fighters that we have proven to be.INSKEEP: Well, let's figure that out because the Senate has promised to vote on extending these Obamacare subsidies, which are effective for millions of people. The House leadership, Mike Johnson, has not promised a vote. Do you have any means to compel a vote, or do you have reason to think that enough Republicans will want to vote that you're going to get one?CLARK: Listen, we're going to use every tool that we have, and we are keeping close track of those Republicans who are trying to have it both ways, say, oh, I am really concerned about people's health care. And I hope that, you know, we can do something about that and prevent the misery and the anxiety that they are inflicting on the American people. So let's do it.I would start by rejecting this budget and its extreme attacks on people's ability to be able to afford and access health care. But we will have another chance in December when the Senate votes again. What is your response going to be? I think what we have done is expose that the Republicans don't have a plan except to further enrich the very wealthiest of Americans. And so put your cards on the table, and that will start today with the vote that we are going to take in the House.INSKEEP: OK. So you're challenging them to come up with a plan or to vote for yours. But let me ask about the underlying issue here. The reason that Democrats extended Obamacare subsidies, expanded them in 2021, the reason you want them back now is because health care costs have continued to increase over time. We discussed this with Mike Lawler, a Republican, in the other hour of the program, and he pointed out correctly that Obamacare was supposed to bring down, bend the curve on costs. It was supposed to lower costs, as well as covering more people. That seems not to have happened. Would you agree there's a fundamental problem in that costs keep going up and up, and you keep having to subsidize them more?CLARK: Oh, I would certainly agree that we have a fundamental problem with the delivery of health care in this country. It is too expensive for people. But I would ask Mike Lawler and the other House Republicans, where have they been? Instead of coming together and working with us, they have had one plan for health care. They have voted to repeal the ACA over 70 times. And since they took the power - they have the majority in the House, the Senate, and they control the White House - their only plan for health care is to shift the cost burden even more onto hardworking Americans - cuts to Medicaid, cuts to the ACA, cuts to Medicare, cuts to medical research and the promise of future interventions for people who are looking for a cure. So spare me this, you know, oh, we wish we could come together. We've been waiting since 2017 for them to deliver a plan. Their only plan is to shift costs to the American people who are just trying to get by.INSKEEP: Katherine Clark is the No. 2 Democrat in the House of Representatives. Always a pleasure talking with you. Thank you so much.CLARK: Thank you, Steve.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Steve Inskeep speaks with Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York about the imminent House vote on a deal to end the longest shutdown in U.S. history.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Let's hear a Republican view of all this. Congressman Mike Lawler represents a good part of upstate New York, suburbs of New York City. Congressman, welcome back.MIKE LAWLER: Good morning. Thanks for having me.INSKEEP: Glad you're with us. Do you assume this is going to pass the House today?LAWLER: It will, and there'll even be a few Democrats to vote for it, so it will be bipartisan. But this is, you know, 42 days overdue. It never should've happened. Chuck Schumer chose to shut the government down for his own political purpose, trying to appease a far-left radical base that wants him and Senate Democrats to fight back against President Trump. At the end of the day, that's what this was always about. It was not about health care. It was not about any specific policy issue. It was about, quote-unquote, \"fighting back against Trump.\" And...INSKEEP: I think there's been a lot of analysis to that effect that this was part of the Democrats' calculus. They felt they needed to fight. But there was this substantive issue on the table having to do with Obamacare subsidies. And assuming this passes today in the House, you move on, the Senate is going to at least vote on extending subsidies for Obamacare. House Speaker Mike Johnson is not guaranteed a vote in the House, though. Do you believe the House should vote on those subsidies?LAWLER: I do. I've been a co-lead on a bill since the beginning of September to extend the ACA subsidies by one year. Remember, these were put in place during COVID to help ease the pressure on families in the middle of a health pandemic. These subsidies go directly to the insurance companies. And so the question really is, is the federal government paying 78% of the premium or 88% of the premium? That's what the fight is over right now. I'm supportive of extending it by a year, but it really requires a larger discussion, which is, how do we actually make health care affordable? Because if you look at premiums since Obamacare took effect, 96% increase in the private insurance market since Obamacare took effect, and 114 to 125% increase in the Obamacare market since it took effect in 2010. That is unsustainable. It is not affordable, and it is something that we have to address long-term. So there's the short-term issue of the subsidy.INSKEEP: Yeah.LAWLER: There's the longer term issue of how we actually reduce health care costs in America.INSKEEP: I guess we should note this is a Republican argument here. Obamacare was about extending health care to more people, but it was also supposed to be about bending the curve, as they said, bringing down costs over time. I think you're saying that part of it didn't work.LAWLER: No question. And again, I think this is incumbent on all of us - Republicans and Democrats - to work together to address this. Everybody should be able to acknowledge that health care is not affordable. And if it's not affordable, that means that what was done did not work. And so the question is, how do we fix it? How do we actually make progress on improving upon the current situation? I'm not advocating for repeal and replace. I'm saying, let's look at this. Let's fix it. This is a problem for the American people.INSKEEP: I want to ask about another issue, Congressman, because you live in suburban New York, and I - I'm thinking about that area. And you must have a lot of constituents who might like to live in New York City, but they could never afford to live there. And New York City has now elected a mayor who says, I'm going to hold down the rent. I'm going to hold down costs and expenses, and that seems to have been a big factor in elections across the country last Tuesday. And President Trump is talking about it now, saying that maybe people should have 50-year mortgages so they can have a slightly lower mortgage payment. What do you make of all that, and what do you think that people should be focused on?LAWLER: Look, affordability is the No. 1 issue. It always has been. As James Carville famously said, it's the economy, stupid. If people cannot afford where they live, if they cannot afford to put food on the table, then other issues result. And so, to me, that has to be the focus. I believe housing is a major crisis in this country. We're about 8 million units underbuilt nationwide. It's basic supply and demand. Health care costs obviously are a major challenge. Grocery bills are coming down but still a challenge. And so the question is, how do we tackle this issue? You look at New York City and the irony of Zohran Mamdani claiming there's an affordability crisis, Democrats have controlled New York City for well over a decade. They've controlled New York State for well over two decades now, and you look at the challenges facing the state and the city. They've increased, for instance, state spending by $100 billion in 10 years. That creates the challenge of unaffordability. And so the question is, how do you deal with these issues...INSKEEP: I want to focus - yeah. Yeah. In a few seconds, I just want to focus on the housing part of this. I can accept the argument that rent control hasn't worked very well for decades in New York. I'm not sure this 50-year mortgage really helps people's mortgage payments that much, but you talked about supply. Is there something you can do to increase the housing supply?LAWLER: No question. I've introduced a bill to revitalize America's housing market. It's 208 pages, 39 provisions. The objective is to actually lessen the regulatory burden on housing, construction and financing, making sure that we are opening up our capital markets to contractors and investors. There's key components to ease up, for instance, regulations on manufactured housing. In the most recent tax bill, we increased the low-income housing tax credit, which will help build a million units of housing over the next decade. I have a bill...INSKEEP: OK. We'll keep following that. I'm afraid we got to stop it there, but Congressman Mike Lawler of New York, thanks so much. It's a pleasure talking with you.LAWLER: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "\n      Morris Katz is a 26-year-old political strategist who wants to take the Democratic party in a new direction. Leila Fadel talks to him about the candidates he's backing and his vision for the future.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, BYLINE: There's a fight for the future of the Democratic Party. A 26-year-old political strategist named Morris Katz is the tip of the spear. He's been backing candidates like 34-year-old democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, who won the mayor's race in New York City last week. I asked him recently about what happened in New York and the way the Democrats have reacted.MORRIS KATZ: You know, Andrew Cuomo, with his super PAC, was running attack ads with the word jahada (ph) stamped on Zohran's forehead. There are people who want to still live in this kind of pre-2008 world, and that's not where we are anymore. What people are frustrated with is a politics of politeness in the face of deep division, in the face of deep income inequality.FADEL: You also saw Democrats - people like Pete Buttigieg - not congratulating Mamdani, which was arguably the most-watched race in the country, even though it's typically a Democrat who wins that seat.KATZ: I think - one thing that - is I think that anyone who's scared to congratulate Zohran publicly or privately is very unlikely to be the nominee for president in 2028. I don't know how you look at someone who turned out young voters at a unprecedented level, who won back immigrant communities that helped deliver Donald Trump his victory, and say that there's nothing worth celebrating there.FADEL: You've said in the past this race was about defeating more than Andrew Cuomo, but the politics of Andrew Cuomo. You call it the pettiness and desperation for power that's willing to style anyone out. It's a rot that's at the core of everything that's wrong with our politics and the party. Tell me more about what you meant here.KATZ: When you look at our party, when you look at the results of the past election, the reality is we had the White House for 12 out of 16 years. During that time, we had control of both chambers multiple times, have governor mansions under our jurisdiction, and things have gotten worse.Income inequality has gone up. Quality of life has gone down. Mental illness is on the rise. Depression is on the rise. We would be doing a deep disservice to our party and to the country if we were not looking in the mirror. We've become incredibly complacent with a status quo that's literally killing people, that's literally allowing people to be pushed out of their homes. Kids can't afford college. And so I think we don't need to be this party. We don't need to be scared of our own shadow. We don't have to be scared of billionaires and lobbyists and corporations. And I think we started that work in New York and hopefully can continue it.FADEL: You've worked with other candidates and are working with other Democratic candidates, and candidates, a lot of the times, the establishment of the party don't like, don't back, don't support. How do you see your role? Are you trying to remake this party?KATZ: I think I want to see a party that reflects what this country looks like, and I think right now we have a party that reflects what a lot of different C-suites and Ivy League reunions look like. You know, like, Congress should be a place where we have farmers and where we have mechanics as well as having lawyers, as well as having business owners. And, you know, it's - only 2% of Congress right now is from the working class. For so many in power right now, it's been decades since they were actually working a nine-to-five or since they knew what it means to struggle to make that mortgage payment or put your kid through pre-K.And so when I talk to candidates, I look for an authenticity, a clear vision of what's wrong and what needs to be better. Are you willing to listen to constituents, or are you more connected and beholden to lobbyists and donors and a status quo? And I think so many of those in power right now spend far more time talking to donors than they do to their districts.FADEL: Katz sees that in Graham Platner, a military veteran, an oyster farmer in Maine trying to unseat five-term Republican Senator Susan Collins. But he's been mired in controversy in recent weeks. Old online posts surfaced showing Platner playing down sexual assault in the military, saying things like Black people don't tip and rural Americans are racist and stupid. Soon after that, a tattoo on his chest widely recognized as a Nazi symbol also came to light. Platner disavowed the comments, saying they were from a dark time in his life. He's covered up the tattoo, apologized for it and says he didn't know what it meant when he got it. Katz is still working with Platner, going into this primary as a political strategist.KATZ: If we want to move past a time in which the only people who are able to run for office are people who, since they were children, had been planning a run for office or who have closely choreographed every move to position them for a run for statewide office or for a run for president, that's going to require running real people. And real people who haven't thought they were going to run for office have lived imperfect lives.You know, like, we're dealing with a mass kind of loss of young men in the Democratic Party - angry young men who are lost to, you know, the internet, to different podcasts or to different, you know, Reddit threads. And then we have someone in Graham who was a person who was struggling, who, after four tours in the Middle East, came back and has talked about openly his PTSD, his depression, and who then came out the other side. And to me, that's the perfect messenger to win back those young men.FADEL: But you don't feel like this is disqualifying.KATZ: If voters feel like it's disqualifying, it's up to them. That's why we have primaries, and that's why we have elections. But I think an era in which, like, Washington D.C. gets to decide that that's a liability or that that's disqualifying is out of touch with the real craving for real human beings who are relatable and authentic, flaws and all.FADEL: These details all emerged after Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer recruited Maine Governor Janet Mills to join the Democratic primary field.KATZ: I think you have a culture in the Democratic Party establishment of being so protective of a status quo that there's even a desire to kind of eat your own.FADEL: Interesting.KATZ: And, you know, like, they have someone like Graham Platner, who went - like, might not even have been 20 yet when he served his first tour in a war that many of these senators voted to send him to, who is the exact kind of Democrat, the exact kind of person that we have been talking about since 2016. How do we win back? And then we have him and the response is to attack him, to take things out of context, to throw everything you've got at him, despite the excitement he's bringing, despite what he's bringing to this party. Feels frustrating. You know, and that's not moving us any closer to getting a Senate majority back.FADEL: That's political strategist and ad-maker Morris Katz talking about the future of the Democratic Party.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt.\"   \n   The correspondence shared Wednesday is part of 23,000 additional documents the committee is reviewing from the Epstein estate, Oversight Ranking Member Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., said in a statement.   \"The more Donald Trump tries to cover-up the Epstein files, the more we uncover,\" Garcia wrote. \"These latest emails and correspondence raise glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding and the nature of the relationship between Epstein and the President.\"   \n   Another email Epstein sent in 2011 to Ghislaine Maxwell, his associate who was also convicted on trafficking charges, called Trump the \"dog that hasn't barked\" and says Trump spent \"hours at my house\" with one of the alleged sex trafficking victims.   The last email shared is a 2019 message between Epstein and Wolff in which the disgraced financier wrote that \"of course [Trump] knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop.\" The email does not elaborate any further.   NPR has not independently confirmed the veracity of the correspondence.    In September, House Democrats released more than 200 pages of a birthday book for Epstein created more than two decades ago that includes a lewd drawing and letter that appears to be signed by Trump.    The president has consistently denied any meaningful connection to Epstein, the veracity of the birthday book and paid little heed to his own supporters who have called for a full release of files kept on Epstein and his alleged crimes, before and after he died by suicide in 2019 while in federal custody.   \n   White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt sent a statement to NPR that said in part \"the Democrats selectively leaked emails to the liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.\"   \"These stories are nothing more than bad-faith efforts to distract from President Trump's historic accomplishments, and any American with common sense sees right through this hoax and clear distraction from the government opening back up again,\" Leavitt wrote.   In July, he told reporters that he and Epstein fell out because Epstein hired away young female employees who worked at the spa at Mar-a-Lago.   The release timed with House votes   The latest Epstein files revelation comes as the House returns to session for votes that could reopen the federal government after the longest shutdown in U.S. history.    House Democrats and four Republicans have been pushing for a vote to release additional files related to the Epstein case since before the government shutdown began in October.    But House Speaker Mike Johnson was able to delay the vote by keeping the chamber out for seven weeks, and most recently by refusing to swear in Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva of Arizona. Grijalva is expected to be sworn in on Wednesday afternoon.   Critics on both sides of the aisle viewed Johnson's refusal as a means of avoiding the vote to direct the Department of Justice to release the Epstein documents.   On the campaign trail, Grijalva, who won a special election Sept. 23, promised to sign onto the bipartisan petition spearheaded by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., to force a House vote on the Epstein matter. Grijalva's signature marked the 218th one needed to force a vote on the matter.   The Epstein files continue to be a political thorn in the president's side, after Trump campaigned on releasing the documents as part of a broader message painting his candidacy as a way to expose powerful people hiding the truth.\n",

In a moment, we'll hear from Republican Congressman Mike Lawler.STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  We have also been hearing from Democrats, many of whom are upset with this deal and the handful of their Senate colleagues who voted for it.MARTÍNEZ: NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales has been following this - what? - 43 days of a shutdown. Is this the end? Is this over with now?CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: It truly could be. House lawmakers will be back in town today for the first time since House Speaker Mike Johnson let them go home in September before the shutdown even began. The House Rules Committee met for more than seven hours last night. And they moved this bill to the floor just a few hours ago, and that sets the stage for a final vote later tonight. And as you recall, this deal came together after a group of Senate Democrats broke ranks to vote with Republicans to end the government shutdown, and they sent this bill to the House. Now, the package includes a stopgap measure to fund the government at least through the end of January, with full-year appropriations plans funding some of those federal agencies and services.MARTÍNEZ: The thing is that Senate deal does not include anything about extending the health care subsidies that Democrats were dug in on. So what did they get instead?GRISALES: Right. Exactly. That was a key demand from Democrats, and this deal doesn't address that. Instead, they secured a promise for a vote in December on health care and a commitment to negotiate a plan to address those subsidies. Those who broke with the party in the Senate said they got the best deal possible. And that includes those full-year appropriations plans, which were negotiated between the parties over several months. Meanwhile, other Senate Democrats who voted no argued they weren't making good to reopen the government in exchange for addressing these expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies. That's spiking premiums.So those who are upset - it carries over to the House. And the fury is only worse there, where we expect most Democrats to vote no on this plan. Several progressives, for example, have called for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to be ousted from his leadership role, even as he voted no on the plan. And last night, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries dodged a question on this with reporters in terms of Schumer's role. And so a reminder the party's really struggling to reconcile the various factions around this deal.MARTÍNEZ: Claudia, the promise to vote...GRISALES: Yeah.MARTÍNEZ: ...In December on the Affordable Care Act subsidies - what might come out of that?GRISALES: Well, we could see a deal come out of that, possibly, but it's a very tall order. It's going to be a really difficult negotiation for Congress, especially in these ultrapartisan times. And we already know that Republicans have demands on ACA reforms that many Democrats won't be able to stomach, such as installing new restrictions for care related to abortions. And even if it can pass the Senate, it's not clear Speaker Mike Johnson will bring it up for a vote in the House. But we do know Democrats have warned, if Republicans do not hold up their end of the deal and negotiate a plan to extend these subsidies, they will hold Republicans' feet to the fire when most of the government's funding ends January 30 under this current plan. So it could be something we're still talking about come next year and into the midterm elections.MARTÍNEZ: And we'll be here for all of it. That's NPR's Claudia Grisales. Thanks a lot.GRISALES: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is expected to administer the oath of office for the Arizona Democrat after the chamber returns to session this afternoon to take up a plan to reopen the government after a record shutdown.   \n   Speaking with All Things Considered on Tuesday, Grijalva argued her support to release the Jeffrey Epstein files played a role in her wait to get seated.    \"I do believe that there is absolutely a connection,\" Grijalva said. \"That has resulted in denying representation to more than 800,000 Arizonans for the last seven weeks.\"    On the campaign trail, Grijalva promised to sign onto a bipartisan petition to force a vote to release the Epstein files. Hers would be the decisive 218th signature on the petition to trigger that vote — an effort that's been led by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif.   \n   The fight over the delay in swearing her in has galvanized Democrats, who have accused Johnson of stalling in order to put off the vote.   Johnson has rejected those accusations, recently saying he would allow a vote on the Epstein files.   He had previously said he would swear in the winner of the Arizona race as soon as they wanted, but later said he would not do so until after the government reopened. Johnson kept members away during the government shutdown. The chamber's last legislative session before Wednesday was Sept. 19.   \n   Grijalva won her seat on Sept. 23 in a special election to represent the state's 7th Congressional District — a border district that includes parts of Tucson.   During that time, Grijalva and other Democrats worked to meet with Johnson, marching to his office and in some cases, confronting him.    \"I have no staff ... The phones don't work. There's no computer,\" Grijalva told NPR last month. \"We don't have a government email.\"   Grijalva told All Things Considered she \"absolutely\" still planned to sign the Epstein discharge petition once she is sworn in, explaining she wants \"justice for the survivors and consequences for those who committed crimes against children and women.\"   Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said the delays were \"unbelievable,\" but \"those days are over.\" The top Democrat on the House Rules Commitee, Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, said the petition could trigger the vote by early December \"if all goes the way we want it to go.\"    \n   Before that, one of Grijalva's first votes is expected to be on whether to reopen the government. Grijalva said she would not support the bipartisan plan passed by the Senate on Monday, saying the concessions secured by Democrats \"weren't significant in making a difference for anybody who's fighting to keep their health care.\"\n",

The guidance, issued in a cable the State Department sent to embassy and consular officials and examined by KFF Health News, directs visa officers to deem applicants ineligible to enter the U.S. for several new reasons, including age or the likelihood they might rely on public benefits.   The guidance says that such people could become a \"public charge\" — a potential drain on U.S. resources — because of their health issues or age.   \n   While assessing the health of potential immigrants has been part of the visa application process for years, including screening for communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and obtaining vaccine history, experts said the new guidelines greatly expand the list of medical conditions to be considered and give visa officers more power to make decisions about immigration based on an applicant's health status.   The directive is part of the Trump administration's divisive and aggressive campaign to deport immigrants living without authorization in the U.S. and dissuade others from immigrating into the country. The White House's crusade to push out immigrants has included daily mass arrests, bans on refugees from certain countries, and plans to severely restrict the total number permitted into the U.S.   The new guidelines mandate that immigrants' health be a focus in the application process. The guidance applies to nearly all visa applicants but is likely to be used only in cases in which people seek to permanently reside in the U.S., said Charles Wheeler, a senior attorney for the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, a nonprofit legal aid group.   \"You must consider an applicant's health,\" the cable reads. \"Certain medical conditions – including, but not limited to, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, cancers, diabetes, metabolic diseases, neurological diseases, and mental health conditions – can require hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of care.\"   \n   About 10% of the world's population has diabetes. Cardiovascular diseases are also common; they are the globe's leading killer.   The cable also encourages visa officers to consider other conditions, such as obesity, which it notes can cause asthma, sleep apnea, and high blood pressure, in their assessment of whether an immigrant could become a public charge and therefore should be denied entry into the U.S.   \"All of these can require expensive, long-term care,\" the cable reads. Spokespeople for the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the cable.   Visa officers were also directed to determine if applicants have the means to pay for medical treatment without help from the U.S. government.   \"Does the applicant have adequate financial resources to cover the costs of such care over his entire expected lifespan without seeking public cash assistance or long-term institutionalization at government expense?\" the cable reads.   The cable's language appears at odds with the Foreign Affairs Manual, the State Department's own handbook, which says that visa officers cannot reject an application based on \"what if\" scenarios, Wheeler said.   The guidance directs visa officers to develop \"their own thoughts about what could lead to some sort of medical emergency or sort of medical costs in the future,\" he said. \"That's troubling because they're not medically trained, they have no experience in this area, and they shouldn't be making projections based on their own personal knowledge or bias.\"   The guidance also directs visa officers to consider the health of family members, including children or older parents.   \"Do any of the dependents have disabilities, chronic medical conditions, or other special needs and require care such that the applicant cannot maintain employment?\" the cable asks.   Immigrants already undergo a medical exam by a physician who's been approved by a U.S. embassy.   \n   They are screened for communicable diseases, such as tuberculosis, and asked to fill out a form that asks them to disclose any history of drug or alcohol use, mental health conditions, or violence. They're also required to have a number of vaccinations to guard against infectious diseases like measles, polio, and hepatitis B.   But the new guidance goes further, emphasizing that chronic diseases should be considered, said Sophia Genovese, an immigration lawyer at Georgetown University. She also noted that the language of the directive encourages visa officers and the doctors who examine people seeking to immigrate to speculate on the cost of applicants' medical care and their ability to get employment in the U.S., considering their medical history.   \"Taking into consideration one's diabetic history or heart health history — that's quite expansive,\" Genovese said. \"There is a degree of this assessment already, just not quite as expansive as opining over, 'What if someone goes into diabetic shock?' If this change is going to happen immediately, that's obviously going to cause a myriad of issues when people are going into their consular interviews.\"   KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF.\n",

The House could vote on the plan as early as Wednesday.\n                \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Win McNamee/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The House of Representatives is expected to approve a funding bill on Wednesday that would bring an end to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.   The measure, which extends funding levels for much of the government through Jan. 30, also includes a trio of appropriation bills that would fully fund some federal programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) through Sept. 30, 2026. Payments for SNAP, which provides food assistance to nearly 42 million people, have been locked in a court fight as a result of the shutdown.   The Senate approved the legislation late Monday, with seven Democrats and one Independent joining most Republicans. The bill includes a provision to reverse the layoffs the Trump administration imposed during the shutdown.   \n   Most Democrats on Capitol Hill angrily denounced the deal because it failed to address the central issue prompting the standoff — how to address health care subsidies that are expiring at the end of the year.   As part of the compromise, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., agreed to hold a vote by mid-December on legislation Democrats will craft to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits. Some Republicans agree Congress needs to do something to head off steep premium increases for those relying on the subsidies, but it's unclear there are enough GOP votes to pass a bill through the chamber. Even if a deal comes together in the next few weeks, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has declined to guarantee a vote.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., attends a Veterans Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery on Tuesday.\n                \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a moderate who helped broker the deal with Thune, told reporters on Monday that the shutdown increased political pressure on the GOP to negotiate some solution on health care.   \"If the Republicans don't come to the table, if Donald Trump, who claims he can make a deal, is not willing to say to Speaker Johnson, 'you need to have a vote, you need to get something done,' then come next election, in the midterms, the American people are going to hold them accountable and we are going to continue to make this an issue.\"   \n   House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., panned the deal shortly before the Senate passed it, and urged House Democrats to vote no.    \"We're not going to support a partisan Republican spending bill that continues to gut the health care of the American people,\" Jeffries said.    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries,D-N.Y., speaks during a news conference Monday on Capitol Hill.\n                \n                    Tom Brenner/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Tom Brenner/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Jeffries and other opponents of the deal argue the results of last week's elections, which featured big Democratic wins in gubernatorial contests and other local elections, sent a signal that voters backed the shutdown strategy, and wanted action on health care.   \n   Hill Republicans maintain that flight delays due to staffing shortages and disruption in government services over several weeks will harm Democrats who blocked bills to reopen the government. But President Trump suggested after GOP candidates were defeated last week that the shutdown harmed the party.   With the midterm elections a year away it's unclear just how far the longest shutdown on record will factor into voters' decisions, especially if concerns about the economy persist.\n",

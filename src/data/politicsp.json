In a new lawsuit, President Trump is seeking $10 billion from the BBC for defamation.\n                \n                    Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Not content with an apology and the resignation of two top BBC executives, President Trump filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit Monday against the BBC in his continued strategy to take the press to court.   Beyond the legal attack on yet another media outlet, the litigation represents an audacious move against a national institution of a trusted ally. It hinges on an edit presented in a documentary of the president's words on a fateful day. Oddly enough, it also hinges on the appeal of a niche streaming service to people in Florida, and the use of a technological innovation embraced by porn devotees.   \n   A sloppy edit   At the heart of Trump's case stands an episode of the BBC television documentary program Panorama that compresses comments Trump made to his supporters on Jan. 6, 2021, before they laid siege to the U.S. Capitol.   The episode seamlessly links Trump's call for people to walk up to the Capitol with his exhortation nearly 55 minutes later: \"And we fight, we fight like hell, and if you don't fight like hell you don't have a country anymore.\"   Trump's attorneys argue that the presentation gives viewers the impression that the president incited the violence that followed. They said his remarks had been doctored, not edited, and noted the omission of his statement that protesters would be \"marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.\"   As NPR and other news organizations have documented, many defendants in the Jan. 6 attack on Congress said they believed they had been explicitly urged by Trump to block the certification of President-elect Joe Biden's victory.   Trump's lawsuit calls the documentary \"a false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction of President Trump.\"   The lawsuit alleges that the depiction was \"fabricated\" and aired \"in a brazen attempt to interfere in and influence the Election to President Trump's detriment.\"   \n   While the BBC has not filed a formal response to the lawsuit, the public broadcaster has reiterated that it will defend itself in court.    A Nov. 13 letter to Trump's legal team on behalf of the BBC from Charles Tobin, a leading U.S. First Amendment attorney, argued that the broadcaster has demonstrated contrition by apologizing, withdrawing the broadcast, and accepting the executives' resignations.   Tobin also noted, on behalf of the BBC, that Trump had already been indicted by a grand jury on four criminal counts stemming from his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, including his conduct on Jan. 6, 2021, on the Capitol grounds.   The appeal of BritBox   For all the current consternation about the documentary, it didn't get much attention at the time. The BBC aired the documentary twice on the eve of the 2024 elections — but never broadcast it directly in Florida.   That matters because the lawsuit was filed in Florida, where Trump alleges that the program was intended to discourage voters from voting for him.   Yet Tobin notes, Trump won Florida in 2024 by a \"commanding 13-point margin, improving over his 2020 and 2016 performances in the state.\"   Trump failed to make the case that Floridians were influenced by the documentary, Tobin wrote. He said the BBC did not broadcast the program in Florida through U.S. channels. (The BBC has distribution deals with PBS and NPR and their member stations for television and radio programs, respectively, but not to air Panorama.)   It was \"geographically restricted\" to U.K. viewers, Tobin wrote.   Hence the argument in Trump's lawsuit that American viewers have other ways to watch it. The first is BritBox, a BBC streaming service that draws more on British mysteries set at seaside locales than BBC coverage of American politics.   Back in March, then-BBC Director General Tim Davie testified before the House of Commons that BritBox had more than 4 million subscribers in the U.S. (The BBC did not break down how many subscribers it has in Florida or how often Panorama documentaries are viewed by subscribers in the U.S. or the state, in response to questions posed by NPR for this story.)   \n   \"The Panorama Documentary was available to BritBox subscribers in Florida and was in fact viewed by these subscribers through BritBox and other means provided by the BBC,\" Trump's lawsuit states.   NPR searched for Panorama documentaries on the BritBox streaming service through the Amazon Prime platform, one of its primary distributors. The sole available episode dates from 2000. Trump does not mention podcasts. Panorama is streamed on BBC Sounds. Its episodes do not appear to be available in the U.S. on such mainstream podcast distributors in the U.S. such as Apple Podcasts, Spotify or Pocket Casts, according to a review by NPR.   Software that enables anonymous browsing - of porn   Another way Trump's lawsuit suggests people in the U.S. could watch that particular episode of Panorama, if they were so inclined, is through a Virtual Private Network, or VPN.    Trump's suit says millions of Florida citizens use VPNs to view content from foreign streamers that would otherwise be restricted. And the BBC iPlayer is among the most popular streaming services accessed by viewers using a VPN, Trump's lawsuit asserts.    In response to questions from NPR, the BBC declined to break down figures for how many people in the U.S. access the BBC iPlayer through VPNs.   Demand for such software did shoot up in 2024 and early 2025. Yet, according to analysts — and even to materials cited by the president's team in his own case — the reason appears to have less to do with foreign television shows and more to do with online pornography.   Under a new law, Florida began requiring age verification checks for visitors to pornographic websites, notes Paul Bischoff, editor of Comparitech, a site that reviews personal cybersecurity software.   \"People use VPNs to get around those age verification and site blocks,\" Bischoff says. \"The reason is obvious.\"    An article in the Tampa Free Press cited by Trump's lawsuit to help propel the idea of a sharp growth of interest in the BBC actually undercuts the idea in its very first sentence - by focusing on that law.   \n   \"Demand for Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) has skyrocketed in Florida following the implementation of a new law requiring age verification for access to adult websites,\" the first paragraph states. \"This dramatic increase reflects a widespread effort by Floridians to bypass the restrictions and access adult content.\"   Several legal observers anticipate possible settlement    Several First Amendment attorneys tell NPR they believe Trump's lawsuit will result in a settlement of some kind, in part because there's new precedent. In the past year, the parent companies of ABC News and CBS News have each paid $16 million to settle cases filed by Trump that many legal observers considered specious.   \"The facts benefit Trump and defendants may be concerned about reputational harm,\" says Carl Tobias, a professor of law at the University of Richmond who specializes in free speech issues. \"The BBC also has admitted it could have done better and essentially apologized.\"   Some of Trump's previous lawsuits against the media have failed. He is currently also suing the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Des Moines Register and its former pollster, and the board of the Pulitzer Prize.\n",

During the 2024 presidential campaign, his promises to lower prices in a country grappling with post-COVID inflation propelled him back into office.   But toward the end of his first year in office this term, just 36% of Americans approve of his handling of the economy, according to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll. It's his worst mark in the six years that Marist has been asking the question.   \n   The only time in that span that Americans had a similarly negative view of a president's handling of the economy in the poll was in February 2022, when Joe Biden was president. Now Democrats are slightly more trusted to handle the economy than Republicans — 37% to 33%. That's not a wide margin, but it's a sharp turnaround from the 16-point advantage Republicans had on the question in 2022.   There are a number of other stark findings in this wide-ranging survey that focused on the economic pressures Americans are facing. The poll found that many Americans are having difficulty making ends meet, they worry about the economic outlook for themselves and the country, and most believe the country is already in a recession — with notable divides by race, age and gender on many questions.   The White House recognizes the challenge the current economy poses and is trying to make it a focus of events going forward. But the president has his work cut out for him to convince Americans his administration will make it better. He has struggled to do so, often returning to culture war arguments, particularly immigration, instead.   Trump's political standing is at the nadir of his presidency   Trump's handling of the economy has him under water with several key groups, including some that are important to his coalition. For example, 49% of people who live in rural areas disapprove of the job he's doing on the economy, while just 43% approve; 48% of white women without college degrees disapprove vs. 41% who approve. In the suburbs, which are often critical in swing districts, more disapprove by a 60%-33% margin.   \n   In addition to Trump's low approval for his handling of the economy, his overall job approval rating stands at a meager 38%. That's the lowest of his second term and the lowest number he's seen in Marist's surveys since April 2018.   \n   That year, his approval rating did not go much higher. It sat at 41% in the last Marist poll before the 2018 midterm elections. Republicans lost 40 seats in the House that year.   The intensity of disapproval of the president is particularly high — 50% of registered voters said they strongly disapprove.   Just 30% of independents and 8% of Democrats approve of the job Trump's doing. But, as has been the case for the entirety of Trump's time on the political stage, he retains robust support from Republicans. In this survey, 84% of Republicans approve of the job he's doing. That's down 5 points from last month, but within the margin of error.   Prices leap out as the top economic concern   By far, the biggest financial factor straining Americans is prices.   Asked for their top economic concern, 45% of respondents said prices. Nothing else came close — housing was second at 18%, followed by tariffs at 15% and job security at 10%.   Loading...\n   Tariffs are certainly closely tied to higher prices in this administration. Two-thirds in this survey said they're very concerned or somewhat concerned about tariffs' impact on their personal finances.   That's down from 81% in June, but still a significant majority. The decline is driven by Republicans. In June, 70% of Republicans said they were concerned about tariffs' potential impact. Now, it's just 38%, while overwhelming majorities of independents and Democrats continue to say they're concerned about them.   Most say the country is already in a recession   When a country is in a recession is not always clear, but it is marked by a significant downturn in economic activity. The technical definition is two consecutive quarters of negative growth as measured by the country's gross domestic product, or GDP.   That's not where the country is right now, though there are signs of a slowing labor market. Just 64,000 jobs were added in November, as of the delayed jobs report released Tuesday, for example, and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.6%.   Loading...\n   For many, especially those who are Black, Latino, and under 45 years old, times feel particularly tough. Latinos, for example, were 22 points more likely than those who are white to say the country is in a recession.   Respondents under 45 were 17 points more likely than those over 45 years old to say the country was in a recession. Women were also 15 points more likely to say so than men.   \n   Prices in many sectors remain high and, overall, people say affordability is a major issue. In fact, 70% in this survey said the area where they live is not very affordable or not affordable at all for the average family. That's up from 45% when Marist asked the same question in June, a whopping increase and a sign of how much people are feeling the economic pinch.   Republicans and independents were sharply more negative now than they were in June on affordability of the area they live in. In June, by a 64%-36% margin, Republicans said the cost of living was affordable or very affordable. But in this survey, they were split, 51%-49%.   \n   Independents in June were more positive, with 54% saying the area they live in was affordable. But that has cratered, down 30 points.   A strong majority also say the economy simply isn't working for them   Roughly 6 in 10 said the economy is not working well for them personally, and more said their financial situation has gotten worse in the past year than better (35% vs. 21%).   There was a sharp partisan divide; it's become common over the past decade or so for the strength of the economy to be viewed through a political lens, like so many other things.   In this survey, most Democrats and independents said the economy isn't working well for them personally, while two-thirds of Republicans said it is.   \n   Here, again, there were also significant divides by race, age, income, education and gender. For example, three-quarters of those who are Black and two-thirds of Latinos said the economy isn't working for them, compared to 56% of white people who said so.   Notably, there was also a sharp divide between men and women without college degrees — 69% of white women without degrees said the economy wasn't working for them, compared to 51% of white non-degreed men. This split was evident on several questions among this group, which is core to Trump's coalition.   Many are barely getting by, and they're worried about health care costs   Seven in 10 people surveyed said their expenses either match or exceed their income every month, and it's far worse for non-whites and younger people. While 68% of people who are white fall into this category, a far higher percentage of those who are Black (77%) and Latino (78%) said so.   It was a similar story for those who are younger, lower income or don't hold a college degree.   A quarter of people said their expenses consistently exceed their income, which translates to roughly 64 million adults who are accruing debt month to month. That was highest among people who make less than $50,000 a year, white women without college degrees, Millennials, those who are Black, Latino and those who have children under 18 years old.   \n   This socioeconomic divide shows up throughout the survey, including on the question of whether people are satisfied with their savings. Fifty-four percent of those who are white are at least somewhat satisfied with the amount of money they currently have saved, versus just 41% of those who are Black and 40% of Latinos.   Similar gaps are clear by age and education, with a particularly wide chasm between those who have college degrees (60% satisfied with their savings) and those who do not have college degrees (41%).   \n   The cost of health care is a major concern. In fact, a majority (54%) said they're concerned that their household will be unable to pay for needed health care services in the next year. Again, this was highest for those who are Black (69%), Latino (65%), make less than $50,000 a year (67%), are under 45 (61%), especially those 18-29 (63%) and women (61%).   People are pessimistic about the future and the state of the country   As the new year approaches, almost 6 in 10 said they are more pessimistic about what's ahead for the world in 2026.   Among those most pessimistic were Democrats, white women with college degrees, independents and Latinos. Those most optimistic included Republicans, white evangelical Christians, people who live in rural areas and whites without degrees (particularly white men) — all generally solid pro-Trump groups.   A significant share of respondents said the country is headed in the wrong direction — 63% — though there were similar demographic splits.      The survey was conducted from Dec. 8-11, reaching 1,440 adults through live interviewers, text and online. The survey has a margin of error of +/- 3.2 percentage points. The survey includes 1,261 registered voters. Where voters are mentioned, there is a +/- 3.4 percentage point margin of error.\n",

Several companies are now pursuing experimental reactor designs in the hopes of upending the nuclear power industry.\n                \n                    Idaho National Laboratory\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Idaho National Laboratory\n    \n\n   \n   In May, President Trump sat in the Oval Office flanked by executives from America's nuclear power industry.   \"It's a hot industry. It's a brilliant industry,\" the president said from behind the Resolute desk.   It's also an industry that's having a moment. Billions of dollars in capital are currently flowing into dozens of companies chasing new kinds of nuclear technologies. These are small modular designs that can potentially be mass produced in the hundreds or even thousands. Their proponents say these advanced designs promise to deliver megawatts of power safely and cheaply.   But there's a problem, Joseph Dominguez, the CEO of Constellation Energy, told the president.   \n   New nuclear plants keep getting caught up in safety regulations.   \"Mr. President, you know this because you're the best at building things,\" Dominguez, whose company runs about a quarter of America's existing nuclear reactors, said. \"Delay in regulations and permitting will absolutely kill you. Because if you can't get the plant on, you can't get the revenue.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                In May, President Trump signed an executive order to launch the new Reactor Pilot Program as nuclear executives and members of his cabinet looked on.\n                \n                    Evan Vucci/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Evan Vucci/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Now, a new Trump administration program is sidestepping the regulatory system that's overseen the nuclear industry for half a century. The program will fast-track construction of new and untested reactor designs built by private firms, with an explicit goal of having at least three nuclear test reactors up and running by the United States' 250th birthday, July 4, 2026.   If that goal is met, it will be without the direct oversight of America's primary nuclear regulator. Since the 1970s, safety for commercial reactors has been the purview of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. But the NRC is only consulting on the new Reactor Pilot Program, which is being run by the Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Energy.   \n   The existing staff of that office recently asked outsiders for help. In an email seen by NPR, the Office of Nuclear Energy requested volunteers from universities to assist in speeding up safety reviews. \"DOE is currently evaluating creative ideas to help manage anticipated resource constraints,\" read the November 17 email, which was addressed to members of the National Organization of Test Research and Training Reactors.   In an email to NPR, the DOE said that approximately 30 subject matter experts are reviewing the proposals. \"The request for additional support staff from academia was to gauge if there were disciplines that could further augment federal staff and help expedite reviews,\" the statement read.   \n   \"DOE upholds the highest standards of safety in our work with the nuclear industry,\" it added. Four projects have already met with DOE to present their preliminary design reviews and the first approvals could come early next year.   Loading...\n   The new pilot program may be an unproven regulatory path run by an agency with limited experience in the commercial sector, but supporters say it's energizing an industry that's been moribund for decades.   \"This is exactly what we need to do,\" said Isaiah Taylor, founder and CEO of Valar Atomics, a small nuclear startup headquartered in Hawthorne, Calif. \"We need to make nuclear great again.\"   Valar and other companies plan to build smaller reactors than those currently used in the nuclear industry, and that makes a Chernobyl or Fukushima-type accident impossible, noted Nick Touran, an independent nuclear consultant. \"The overall worst-case scenario is definitely less when you're a smaller reactor,\" he said.   Critics, however, worry that the tight July 4 deadline, political pressure and a lack of transparency are all compromising safety. Even a \"small\" release of radioactive material could cause damage to people and the environment around the test sites.   \"This is not normal, and this is not OK, and this is not going to lead to success,\" warned Allison Macfarlane, a professor at the University of British Columbia who served as chairman of the NRC under president Barack Obama. \"This is how to have an accident.\"   AI's need for speed   The AI boom needs a lot of electricity. According to the International Energy Agency, the energy needs of large data centers in the U.S. will skyrocket by about 130% between now and 2030. Many technology companies are committed to buying energy that doesn't contribute to global warming, and that, in turn, has sparked huge interest in nuclear power. Companies like Amazon and Google have turned to nuclear power to quench their insatiable need for electricity.   \n   Nuclear power also occupies a political sweet spot. Unlike renewable technologies, nuclear power has not drawn the ire of the Trump administration. That may be in part because it has strong backing from Trump-aligned Silicon Valley billionaires like Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen. Both Thiel and Andreessen are among the many Silicon Valley elite who have invested in nuclear startups in recent years.   The investment is seeking to disrupt an industry that has remained largely unchanged for decades. Tech companies and investors are backing new designs, said Touran. They're pouring money into small nuclear reactors. These reactors are designed to be mass produced and collocated with data centers, directly powering the sites. By one estimate, more than $6 billion in private equity, venture capital and public investments have gone into reactor development in recent years. The money has led to \"dozens and dozens of new companies,\" Touran said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A data center owned by Amazon Web Services, front right, is under construction next to the Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Berwick, Pa. Tech companies like Amazon and Google are investing in nuclear to power their next generation of data centers.\n                \n                    Ted Shaffrey/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Ted Shaffrey/AP\n    \n\n   \n   As those companies prepare to test their designs, their path is now being helped by the executive order Trump signed on the day he met with the nation's nuclear executives. The order explicitly placed oversight of commercial test reactors with the Energy Department, and it required Energy Secretary Chris Wright to \"approve at least three reactors pursuant to this pilot program with the goal of achieving criticality in each of the three reactors by July 4, 2026.\"   \n   This past June, with the deadline for building three new nuclear reactors looming a little over a year away, Energy Department officials in charge of the Reactor Pilot Program met with the heads of companies in Washington, D.C.   \n   Right from the start it was clear that, unlike the slow and deliberate safety culture that has dominated nuclear power for decades, this new program would be all about speed.   \"Our job is to make sure that the government is no longer a barrier,\" said Seth Cohen, a lawyer at the Department of Energy responsible for implementing Trump's executive orders. Cohen said the officials responsible for overseeing safety would do \"whatever we need to ensure that the government is not stopping you from reaching [nuclear] criticality on or before July 4, 2026.\"   A new regulator   Before the executive order, the Energy Department did not regulate the safety of commercial nuclear reactors. That job fell to another body: the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.   The commission was set up in 1975 by Congress as an independent safety watchdog, said Allison Macfarlane, the former NRC chair. Part of the reason the NRC was formed was because the predecessor to the DOE, known as the Atomic Energy Commission, oversaw both safety and promotion of nuclear power at the same time.   \"This was a very strong conflict of interest,\" Macfarlane said.   But in recent years, companies, particularly those trying to build new kinds of reactors, had become frustrated with the NRC, Macfarlane said. \"The promoters of these small modular reactors were becoming very vociferous about the NRC being the problem,\" she said.   In 2022, the NRC rejected a combined license application for Oklo, a new nuclear startup. Oklo had submitted an application to build and operate its small reactor, called the Aurora powerhouse. But the NRC denied the application because it contained \"significant information gaps in its description of Aurora's potential accidents as well as its classification of safety systems and components.\"   \n   Oklo was told it could resubmit its application to the NRC, but it never did.   Then at the May signing of the executive order, Oklo's CEO Jacob DeWitte appeared behind President Trump applauding the new reactor program at DOE.   \n   \"Changing the permitting dynamics is going to help things move faster,\" DeWitte said to the president. \"It's never been more exciting.\"   Oklo had another connection to the Energy Department — the Secretary of Energy, Chris Wright, was a member of Oklo's board of directors until he took the helm at the DOE. Wright stepped down following his confirmation in February.   In August, a little over a month after that initial meeting between industry executives and the DOE, the Office of Nuclear Energy announced the 11 advanced reactor projects had been selected for the Reactor Pilot Program. Three of Oklo's reactors were part of the new pilot program, including a test version of the reactor design rejected by the NRC.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                In September, nuclear startup Oklo broke ground on its first Aurora powerhouse small modular reactor. The reactor design had been previously rejected by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission due to gaps in Oklo's safety analysis. The company is now proceeding through a new approval process with the Department of Energy.\n                \n                    Oklo\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Oklo\n    \n\n   \n   Bonita Chester, a spokesperson for Oklo, said the company had won its awards through DOE's \"open competitive opportunities.\" It had already been working with the department for several years, in part because the government had operated a reactor similar to the design Oklo is pursuing.    Oklo had been working on additional safety analyses required by DOE, and moreover, Chseter said in an email to NPR, the company intends to complete an NRC licensing process for operation of its first Aurora reactor just as soon as it's built.   \"We've continued safety and accident analyses continuously — before, during, and after 2022,\" she said.   Hopes and fears   Other supporters of the DOE's new Reactor Pilot Program say the NRC was never equipped to review the type of advanced reactors many of the latest nuclear startups hope to build.   \"The NRC is not built for R&D,\" said Isaiah Taylor of Valar Atomics. \"R&D has to be done in the real world, you actually have to turn reactors on.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Isaiah Taylor the Founder and CEO of Valar Atomics says he wants to \"Make nuclear great again.\" Valar is one of several companies that hopes to begin testing its new nuclear reactor design before July 4 of next year.\n                \n                    Valar Atomics\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Valar Atomics\n    \n\n   \n   Valar's design looks far different from the reactors that are running today. It will use a special type of fuel together with a high-temperature gas to generate heat and electricity. Taylor said gathering real data will speed development and increase safety over the long-term.   \n   \"Innovation drives safety,\" he said.   (Valar is also party to a lawsuit against the NRC arguing the commission does not have the authority to regulate small reactors. In his interview, Taylor told NPR the company intends to file for an NRC license \"when we're ready.\")   Government labs run by the DOE have built experimental nuclear reactors for decades, and the agency has an established program for reviewing safety, added Jordan Bramble, the CEO of Antares, a nuclear startup that hopes to build microreactors for space and military applications.   \"We believe that licensing through a DOE pathway is absolutely the best way to build prototype reactors, and you absolutely have to build prototype reactors before you build commercial reactors,\" Bramble said.   Both Valar and Antares say they intend to have their test reactors running by the July 4 deadline.   \"Safety remains paramount as we expedite the process,\" the DOE said in its email. In a separate statement, the NRC said it had detailed a dozen staff to the program to help with the reviews.   But critics question whether the pilot program will really produce safe nuclear reactors.   The July 4, 2026 deadline puts enormous pressure on the program, said Heidy Klaaf, the chief AI scientist at the AI Now Institute, which recently published a report warning that AI development could undermine nuclear safety.    \"I think these manufactured timelines are actually incredibly concerning,\" Klaaf said. \"There's no timeline for assessing a new design and making sure it's safe, especially something we haven't seen before.\"   Then there's the question of public transparency. The NRC makes many of the documents around its decisions available publicly. It also frequently allows the public to comment as well, added Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists. The new pilot program is far more opaque and \"is really an attempt to subvert the laws and regulations that go around commercial nuclear power,\" he said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A control panel to the historic Experimental Breeder Reactor II at the Idaho National Laboratory. Supporters say the Department of Energy has decades of experience with advanced reactor designs being pursued by nuclear startups. But critics worry whether it can be a truly independent regulator.\n                \n                    Bloomberg via Getty Images/Bloomberg\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Bloomberg via Getty Images/Bloomberg\n    \n\n   \n   While many of the test reactors are small and tout themselves as inherently safer than existing nuclear power plants, they are still capable of leaking radiation in an accident, Lyman noted. \"If they are located closer to populated areas, if there aren't any provisions for offsite radiological emergency planning… then you are potentially putting the public at greater risk, even if the reactors are small,\" he said.   \n   Perhaps most worrying, said former NRC Chair Macfarlane, is how the DOE's safety assessment might be used to build more small reactors across the country, once the pilot reactors are built.   While the NRC remains the body in charge of licensing reactors for commercial purposes, a recent memorandum of understanding between the NRC and the DOE called on the commission to establish \"an expedited pathway to approve advanced reactor designs that have been authorized and tested by DOE.\"   In other words, once the DOE has approved a pilot reactor, the NRC now has to use its own sped-up process for approving the commercial version.   In its email to NPR, the DOE said \"Safety standards will be upheld and maintained as the top priority regardless of which regulatory body is utilized for authorization or licensing.\"   Th NRC said in its statement it was prepared to accept the DOE's findings. Assuming the safety analysis is sound, \"the NRC will build on that work, not repeat it\" when it undertakes commercial licensing.    But Macfarlane is unconvinced. She said relying on the hasty DOE analysis for the construction of potentially dozens or even hundreds of small reactors around the U.S. is the real risk.   \"They can look at what the DOE did, they can take it as a piece of input, but they have to do their own separate analysis,\" she warned. \"Otherwise none of us are safe.\"   Reach out to Geoff Brumfiel through encrypted communication on Signal at gbrumfiel.13\n",

The move is part of ongoing efforts by the administration to tighten U.S. entry standards for travel and immigration, in what critics say unfairly prevents travel for people from a broad range of countries. The administration suggested it would expand the restrictions after the arrest of an Afghan national suspect in the shooting of two National Guard troops over Thanksgiving weekend.   \n   People who already have visas, are lawful permanent residents of the U.S. or have certain visa categories such as diplomats or athletes, or whose entry into the country is believed to serve the U.S. interest, are all exempt from the restrictions. The proclamation said the changes go into effect on Jan. 1.   In June, President Donald Trump announced that citizens of 12 countries would be banned from coming to the United States and those from seven others would face restrictions. The decision resurrected a hallmark policy of his first term.   At the time the ban included Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen and heightened restrictions on visitors from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.   \n   On Tuesday, the Republican administration announced it was expanding the list of countries whose citizens are banned from entering the U.S. to Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan and Syria. The administration also fully restricted travel on people with Palestinian Authority-issued travel documents, the latest U.S. travel restriction against Palestinians. South Sudan was also facing significant travel restrictions already.   An additional 15 countries are also being added to the list of countries facing partial restrictions: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Ivory Coast, Dominica, Gabon, Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia and Zimbabwe.   \n   The restrictions apply to both people seeking to travel to the U.S. as visitors or to emigrate there.   The Trump administration said in its announcement that many of the countries from which it was restricting travel had \"widespread corruption, fraudulent or unreliable civil documents and criminal records\" that made it difficult to vet their citizens for travel to the U.S.   It also said some countries had high rates of people overstaying their visas, refused to take back their citizens whom the U.S. wished to deport or had a \"general lack of stability and government control,\" which made vetting difficult. It also cited immigration enforcement, foreign policy and national security concerns for the move.   The Afghan man accused of shooting the two National Guard troops near the White House has pleaded not guilty to murder and assault charges. In the aftermath of that incident, the administration announced a flurry of immigration restrictions, including further restrictions on people from those initial 19 countries who were already in the U.S.   \n   The news of the expanding travel ban is likely to face fierce opposition from critics who have argued that the administration is using national security concerns to collectively keep out people from a wide range of countries.   \"This expanded ban is not about national security but instead is another shameful attempt to demonize people simply for where they are from,\" said Laurie Ball Cooper, vice president of U.S. Legal Programs at the International Refugee Assistance Project.   Advocates for Afghans who supported the United States' two-decade long war in Afghanistan also raised alarms Tuesday, saying the updated travel ban no longer contains an exception for Afghans who qualify for the Special Immigrant Visa. That's a visa category specifically for Afghans who closely assisted the U.S. war effort at great risk to themselves.   \n   No One Left Behind, a longtime agency advocating for the Special Immigrant Visa program, said it was \"deeply concerned\" about the change. The organization said it appreciated the president's commitment to national security but allowing Afghans who'd served the U.S. to enter the U.S. — after extensive vetting — also contributes to the country's security.   \"Though intended to allow for review of inconsistent vetting processes, this policy change inadvertently restricts those who are among the most rigorously vetted in our history: the wartime allies targeted by the terrorists this proclamation seeks to address,\" the organization said in a statement.   Countries that were newly placed on the list of banned or restricted countries said late Tuesday that they were evaluating the news. The government of the island nation of Dominica in the Caribbean Sea said it was treating the issue with the \"utmost seriousness and urgency\" and was reaching out to U.S. officials to clarify what the restrictions mean and address any problems.   \n   Antigua and Barbuda's ambassador to the United States, Ronald Saunders, said the \"matter is quite serious\" and he'll be seeking more information from U.S. officials regarding the new restrictions.   The Trump administration also upgraded restrictions on some countries — Laos and Sierra Leone — that previously were on the partially restricted list and in one case — Turkmenistan — said the country had improved enough to warrant easing some restrictions on travelers from that country. Everything else from the previous travel restrictions announced in June remains in place, the administration said.   The new restrictions on Palestinians come months after the administration imposed limits that make it nearly impossible for anyone holding a Palestinian Authority passport from receiving travel documents to visit the U.S. for business, work, pleasure or educational purposes. The announcement Tuesday goes further, banning people with Palestinian Authority passports from emigrating to the U.S.   \n   In justifying its decision Tuesday, the administration said several \"U.S.-designated terrorist groups operate actively in the West Bank or Gaza Strip and have murdered American citizens.\" The administration also said the recent war in those areas had \"likely resulted in compromised vetting and screening abilities.\"\n",

Today's top stories   With two days until Congress's scheduled holiday recess, lawmakers will likely leave Washington without extending Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies. The enhanced subsidies for ACA marketplace plans will expire at the end of the year. Millions of Americans can expect a spike in their premiums, and some may see the price of their plans double or triple in the new year.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) discusses rising health insurance premiums as U.S. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) (L) and House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN) look on during a press conference in the U.S. Capitol Building on Dec. 10, 2025, in Washington, DC.\n                \n                    Heather Diehl/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Heather Diehl/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 The House expects to vote today on a package of long-favored conservative ideas around health reform, NPR's Sam Gringlas tells Up First. The proposed policies include association health plans and revising pharmacy benefit manager regulations. Rank-and-file congressmembers continue to hold bipartisan talks on subsidies, but lawmakers have acknowledged that a solution is unlikely to come this year.   As President Trump nears the end of his first year of his second term, only 36% of Americans approve of his handling of the economy, according to the latest NPR/PBS Marist poll. This marks his lowest score in the six years that Marist has been asking the question. Democrats now hold a slight 37% to 33% lead over Republicans on economic trust. This is a sharp turnaround from the 16-point advantage the GOP had on the question in 2022. The wide-ranging poll also showcases other stark economic pressures Americans face.   \n   The Trump administration unveiled a program earlier this year to fast-track the construction of new and untested nuclear reactor designs. The goal is to have three new nuclear test reactors by the U.S.' 250th birthday on July 4, 2026.    🎧 The Reactor Pilot Program is fast-tracking 11 new reactor designs by nuclear startup companies, according to NPR's Geoff Brumfiel. The program is run by the Department of Energy, not the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which has one of the world's strongest nuclear regulatory agencies. Some companies believe the NRC has been too strict and the Energy Department will be easier to work with. Isaiah Taylor of Valar Atomics tells Brumfiel that he believes the NRC is more relevant for a plant that is 100% ready to be constructed all over the U.S. However, critics of the pilot program believe that the Energy Department is the wrong regulator and that it compromises safety for the sake of speed.

Scott Applewhite/AP\n    \n\n   \n   This story was adapted from an article that first published on Nov. 5, 2025.   With only two days to go before a scheduled holiday recess, it is looking increasingly likely that members of Congress will leave Washington without extending Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies.   The enhanced subsidies for ACA marketplace plans will expire at the end of the year, spiking premiums for millions of Americans. Many are seeing the price tag of their plans double or triple.   The deadline to sign up for plans on the ACA exchange was Monday, and some subscribers say they will forgo health insurance because they can no longer afford the premiums without the subsidies.   \n   So far, that has not spurred Congress to coalesce around a plan to address health care costs.   The Affordable Care Act may be more popular than ever. Polls show support from voters across the political spectrum for extending the enhanced subsidies, which were first passed in 2021.   But 15 years since the ACA became law, the debate over health care has endured in Congress – and seems poised to spill into 2026, when every House seat and a third of the Senate is on the ballot.   Where the subsidies debate stands    Groups of rank-and-file members on both sides of the Capitol have been trying to advance a bipartisan measure to extend the subsidies, along with some reforms.   But so far, the only measures to come up for votes have been dueling partisan measures, one backed by Senate Republicans and another from Senate Democrats. Both failed to garner enough votes.   The House is expected to vote Wednesday on a separate package of health reforms rolled out last Friday by House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. The narrow measure wraps together a handful of longstanding ideas favored by conservatives, like association health plans. But as with the GOP bill that failed in the Senate, the House package would not extend the expiring subsidies.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., speaks during a news conference following a vote on health care premiums at the Capitol on Dec. 11. Senate Democrats were unable to garner enough support to advance legislation to extend enhanced ACA subsidies for three years.\n                \n                    Heather Diehl/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Heather Diehl/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Top Democrats in the House have continued to insist on the same plan tried by Democrats in the Senate: a standalone three-year extension, without any reforms that could help entice enough Republicans.   \n   Four Senate Republicans voted with Democrats on that bill: Susan Collins of Maine, Alaska's Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, and Josh Hawley of Missouri.   \"I do know the effect on people at home,\" Hawley told NPR after the Senate vote. \"Right now, people at home are saying we need our health care prices to be lower. So I'm doing everything that will help lower the cost of health care.\"   Why some Obamacare critics want to extend subsidies   Democrats spent the fall trying to force an extension of the subsidies. For weeks, they withheld their votes on legislation to fund the government, resulting in a record-long shutdown. Even some Republicans warned against letting the enhanced subsidies expire.   \"Twenty-two million people shouldn't be forced to pay the price for Congressional inaction,\" Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., told NPR this week. \"We're talking about small business owners and their employees, independent contractors, gig workers, early retirees who'll be forced to pay a price that many simply can't afford.\"   About a dozen House Republicans have signed onto a pair of proposals to maneuver around leadership to force a vote on extending the subsidies. It is not clear whether either could attract enough support. Even if they did, it is very unlikely they would receive a vote before the subsidies expire.   Even the conservative firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., has called for keeping the subsidies, despite sharp criticism of Obamacare, saying the cost of health care is a top issue in her deep red district.   \"The toothpaste (Obamacare - ACA) is out of the tube,\" Greene wrote on X in October.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., speaks during a hearing on Capitol Hill on Dec. 11. Despite her criticism of Obamacare, Greene has been among the Republicans in Congress calling for an extension of enhanced ACA subsidies.\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   When the ACA passed with no Republican votes, this acceptance would have been hard to imagine.   Fights over the ACA helped fuel a 2013 shutdown. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, held the Senate floor for more than 21 hours, railing against Obamacare and memorably reading from Dr. Seuss' Green Eggs and Ham.   \n   Former Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor says backlash against the law helped give rise to the Tea Party and later the Make America Great Again movement.   \"There was a lot of trepidation as to what Obamacare was going to mean,\" Cantor told NPR. \"Whether you were going to be able to keep your doctor, whether there were going to be 'death panels,' and honestly a concern about the unknown.\"   Over the years, Republicans repeatedly tried to repeal and replace Obamacare, but now many acknowledge that it is here to stay.   \"We still faced opposition from within our own ranks,\" said former Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., who chaired a key committee that tried to work on a substitute. \"Here we are today, and there's still no alternative. It's been 15 years. It's not gonna go away.\"   Johnson has traded the refrain \"Repeal and Replace\" for a new one: \"Reduce and Repair.\"   \"The roots of Obamacare, the Unaffordable Care Act, have gotten so deep in the system that it's no longer possible to just pull it out at the root and chop it off and start over,\" Johnson told reporters on Tuesday. \"It's too deeply ingrained, so now we have to take it step by step, to reduce and repair – reduce costs and repair the system.\"   But for months, Johnson and other Republicans, including President Trump, who talked about \"concepts of a plan\" to replace the ACA during a debate last fall, struggled to articulate concrete reforms.   \"It's been hastily thrown together,\" Kiley said of the GOP legislation up for a vote on Wednesday. \"It doesn't address the immediate crisis in front of us.\"   Polls show a majority of Republicans still oppose Obamacare, but the law's popularity has grown, says Ashley Kirzinger, director of survey methodology at the health policy organization KFF. More than half of marketplace enrollees live in Republican congressional districts.   \n   \"They're more likely to live in rural areas, to own a small business or be farmers,\" she said.   An October survey of competitive congressional districts by Republican pollster John McLaughlin, who has worked with Trump during each of his campaigns, also found overwhelming support for extending the subsidies. He says the results have been put in front of top advisers at the White House.   \"Voters are definitely more likely to vote for somebody who's gonna support a health care tax credit that they can use versus those who might oppose it,\" McLaughlin said in an October interview.   Why top Republicans are pushing back against the subsidies   Some Democrats hoped Trump would cut a deal on subsidies. But Trump has continued to bash Obamacare and has yet to embrace an extension.   And many rank-and-file Republicans remain skeptical of the ACA, including Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a gastroenterologist, who helped craft the Senate GOP health plan that failed last week.   \"Obamacare has become the 'Unaffordable Care Act,'\" Cassidy said in October. \"And the reforms that were supposed to lower costs are now being papered over with more and more subsidies.\"   Cassidy's plan would have deposited up to $1,500 annually in health savings accounts for people making up to 700% of the federal poverty line with high-deductible ACA plans. The money could be used for expenses like copays and medicine, but not for premiums.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., speaks to reporters on Nov. 10. Cassidy has been a vocal advocate in the Senate for moving away from enhanced ACA subsidies and instead giving Americans money for health savings accounts.\n                \n                    Tom Brenner/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Tom Brenner/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"Who gets the money? The insurance companies,\" Cassidy said last week of the enhanced subsidies. \"Under our program, the patients and the families get it.\"   In the House, Republican leadership squashed an effort by moderates to tack onto the GOP bill a vote to extend the subsidies.   Rep. Jeff Hurd, R-Colo., one of the moderates who has called for extending the subsidies, agrees the subsidies only address a symptom of the ballooning cost of health care. Still, he says extending them is an imperative – and hopes this can be an opportunity for a bipartisan conversation about health care.   \n   \"Whether it's something they're public about or not, if you're genuinely serious about serving your constituents, this ought to be something on your radar screen,\" Hurd said in October.   Why Democrats are all-in on their health care push   Democrats bet enormous political capital as they held out for a subsidies deal, emboldened by 2018, when candidates running on health care helped sweep the party back into the House majority.   That year, Democrat Andy Kim ran for a Republican-held congressional district in New Jersey. The incumbent, Rep. Tom MacArthur, was a key player in efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, authoring an amendment that would have allowed states to waive the ACA ban on denying coverage over pre-existing conditions.   \"Everyone was furious,\" Kim recalled in October. \"He really touched a third rail.\"   That year in Michigan, Democrat Elissa Slotkin also challenged a Republican incumbent on health care.   \"I think it was the dominant issue,\" Slotkin said. \"My experience with my mom not having insurance when she was diagnosed with Stage 4 ovarian cancer just meant that a lot of people wanted to talk about it and I had a lot to say.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Elissa Slotkin speaks at a Democratic rally on Oct. 26, 2018 in Detroit. Slotkin's victory that year after running on health care helped sweep the party back into the House majority.\n                \n                    Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Kim and Slotkin won their races — part of a blue wave that gave Democrats control of the House. Eight years later, they are in the Senate, where Democrats refused to back a stopgap spending bill without a deal to extend expiring ACA subsidies.   \"You're talking about people who are going to be doubling their costs and then therefore deciding not to keep health care coverage,\" Slotkin said.   Ultimately, a handful of Democratic Senators relented, voting last month to reopen the government in exchange for the promise of a vote on extending the health subsidies.   \"I think what's really telling is that we see not just majorities, but large majorities, of Republicans, independents and Democrats saying that they want Congress to extend the enhanced premium tax credits,\" KFF's Kirzinger said.   \n   KFF has been polling on the ACA for years. The 2010 law is more popular than ever, a sea change from 15 years ago, when Americans were more evenly divided on the law.   \"The best thing that happened to the Affordable Care Act politically was when Republicans started trying to take it away,\" said Meredith Kelly, a top Democratic congressional committee staffer during the 2018 midterms.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                An Obamacare sign is displayed outside an insurance agency on Nov. 12, 2025 in Miami.\n                \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Leading up to that cycle, Kelly worried that Obamacare was a political liability for Democratic candidates. But then, with Trump in office, Republicans moved to destroy it.   \"I think that the 2018 cycle was a massive turning point for the popularity of the ACA,\" Kelly said. \"And I think that's in great part because Democrats worked really hard that cycle to help Americans understand what Republicans were ripping away.\"   If Republicans decline to back a plan to extend the subsidies, many Democrats think that will give them a powerful message in next year's midterm elections.   Hustling to a vote in October, Slotkin said she did not know whether health care will play the same driving role it did in 2018. But she says there is reason to believe it will.   \"Among all of the major ways people are paying more and the cost of living is going up, I can't think of something that is more personal than health care,\" she said.   What's next for the subsidies debate   The House is expected to vote Wednesday on the health care bill backed by Speaker Johnson, which does not address the subsidies.   Some lawmakers hope the failed partisan votes will recharge efforts to find a bipartisan compromise.   \"You can't get something done until you get started,\" Murkowski said after the failed votes last Thursday. \"And so what we did today is we demonstrated what we can't do.\"   But lawmakers are set to leave town soon – and with new premium rates set to take effect in less than two weeks, the time for a deal to stave off those price spikes seems to be running out.   \n      More on the debate in Congress over health care   \n",

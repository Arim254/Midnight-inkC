In the fake video, a crown-wearing Trump is in a fighter jet emblazoned \"KING TRUMP.\" Accompanied by Loggins singing \"Danger Zone\" — a hit single from the 1986 movie Top Gun — the plane dumps sludgy brown material over crowds of protesters carrying American flags and signs in what appears to be New York City's Times Square.   The video was published as an apparent reply to the widespread No Kings protests that took place across the U.S. on Saturday. (On Saturday evening, the official White House account posted a fake image on X of Trump and Vice President Vance wearing crowns, juxtaposed with a fake image of Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in sombreros.)   \n   In a statement sent to NPR on Monday morning, Loggins wrote: \"This is an unauthorized use of my performance of 'Danger Zone.' Nobody asked me for my permission, which I would have denied, and I request that my recording on this video is removed immediately.\" (\"Danger Zone\" was written by Top Gun's score composer, Giorgio Moroder, and songwriter Tom Whitlock, with Loggins as the performer.)   Loggins continued: \"I can't imagine why anybody would want their music used or associated with something created with the sole purpose of dividing us. Too many people are trying to tear us apart, and we need to find new ways to come together. We're all Americans, and we're all patriotic. There is no 'us and them' – that's not who we are, nor is it what we should be. It's all of us. We're in this together, and it is my hope that we can embrace music as a way of celebrating and uniting each and every one of us.\"   There is a long history of musicians objecting to the current president (among other political leaders) using their work to send political messages. However, such use is generally legal, as long as rights holders are paid correctly; the only use that performers and songwriters can specifically prohibit is the use of songs in campaign advertisements. Even so, many artists choose to make such objections public so that a general audience is aware of their stance.   \n   NPR reached out to the White House for a response to Loggins' specific objections and his request that his performance be removed.   In reply, White House spokesperson Davis R. Ingle did not respond to NPR's questions but sent NPR an image from the film Top Gun of stars Tom Cruise and the late Val Kilmer, captioned: \"I FEEL THE NEED FOR SPEED.\"   Various musicians and their representatives, including The White Stripes and the estate of Isaac Hayes, have filed civil suits against Trump alleging copyright infringement. The White Stripes dropped their suit in November 2024. The Hayes suit, which was filed against the president, his reelection campaign and the activist group Turning Point Action, is continuing to wend its way through federal court in Atlanta.\n",

It's unclear what impact this ruling will immediately have on the ground. The 9th Circuit's decision applies to only one of the two temporary restraining orders that U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut issued this month blocking the deployment.   \n   \"Right now, until the district court acts on the second TRO, national guard members from Oregon, or any other state cannot deploy,\" Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek said in a statement.   The ruling comes in the wake of a series of Trump authorizations to deploy National Guard troops to American cities including Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Chicago. President Trump has said the deployments are necessary to protect the work of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and reduce crime.   On Oct. 16, a federal appeals court upheld an earlier District Court ruling in Illinois, temporarily blocking the president's federalization and deployment of the National Guard there. The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to intervene.   Trump called the National Guard to Portland last month   The Trump administration federalized 200 members of the Oregon National Guard on Sept. 28 after the president described Portland on social media as \"War ravaged\" and \"under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists.\"   This characterization is false, according to local and state officials, residents and journalists on the ground. Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek told NPR on Oct. 6 that the president's portrayal was \"ludicrous.\"   \"We had thousands of people on the streets of Portland for the Portland Marathon,\" she said. \"The city is beautiful. The city is thriving.\"   \n   The federal government has argued in court documents that the National Guard is needed to protect an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Portland that has been the site of protests since June. They wrote that protesters had assaulted federal officers \"with rocks, bricks, pepper spray and incendiary devices, causing injury.\"   In their own court documents, attorneys for the city of Portland and the state of Oregon wrote that the protests had been small and largely peaceful for months.   \n   In a declaration provided to the court, Craig Dobson, an assistant chief with the Portland Police Bureau (PPB), stated that the protests have never been so out of control that local officers couldn't respond.   \"In fact, on any given weekend,\" he stated, \"the nightlife in Portland's entertainment district has warranted greater PPB resources than the small, nightly protests in front of the ICE facility.\"   The federal government, however, has argued that things have been quieter because 115 federal police officers were sent to Portland this summer to help protect the ICE building there. It says some of those federal officers have since been sent back. And while it's unclear how many remain, the federal government says their deployment is a strain on resources.   In response, attorneys for the state of Oregon have said such deployments are a normal part of the federal police's responsibilities.   Lower court blocked the deployment    On Oct. 4, Immergut, the U.S. district judge, granted the city and state a temporary restraining order, preventing the federal government from deploying the National Guard to Portland.   The president can federalize National Guard members if there's a foreign invasion, a rebellion or a danger of one, or an inability to carry out federal laws with \"regular forces.\"   Immergut wrote that the Trump administration did not have a legitimate basis for federalizing the National Guard because the protests in Portland had been \"generally peaceful\" since June and did not prevent federal law enforcement officers from doing their jobs.   \n   She wrote that the Trump administration described only a few incidents of protesters clashing with federal officers in September before the National Guard federalization. They involved people shining overpowered flashlights in the eyes of drivers, \"posting a photograph of an unmarked ICE vehicle online\" and \"setting up a makeshift guillotine to intimidate federal officials.\"   \"These incidents are inexcusable,\" Immergut wrote, \"but they are nowhere near the type of incidents that cannot be handled by regular law enforcement forces.\"   The following day, despite her ruling, Trump sent 200 federalized California National Guard members to Oregon. A memo from the Department of Defense also authorized up to 400 members of the Texas National Guard to deploy to Portland and Chicago.   \n   Immergut then granted a second order blocking the Trump administration from sending any federalized members from any National Guard to Oregon.   \n   In its appeal to the 9th Circuit, the Trump administration said in court documents that the lower court judge had \"impermissibly second-guessed the Commander in Chief's military judgments.\"   On Oct. 6, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a press briefing: \"With all due respect to that judge, I think her opinion is untethered in reality and in the law.\" She went on to say that the president was using his authority as commander in chief.   Appeals court sides with the president   The majority opinion for the 9th Circuit was authored by judges Ryan Nelson and Bridget Bade, who were both appointed during Trump's first term.   They wrote that the District Court erred when it discounted \"the violent and disruptive events that occurred in June, July, and August\" outside the ICE facility and focused \"on only a few events in September,\" the month Trump federalized the National Guard.   The law, they argued, didn't put such limitations on the facts or circumstances that the president could consider when making a decision to deploy the National Guard.   \"The President can, and should, consider the totality of the circumstances when determining whether he 'is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States,'\" they wrote.   \"Rather than reviewing the President's determination with great deference,\" the panel of judges wrote, \"the district court substituted its own determination of the relevant facts and circumstances.\"   \n   Appeals court Judge Susan Graber, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, dissented, writing there was no justification to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard.   \"Given Portland protesters' well-known penchant for wearing chicken suits, inflatable frog costumes, or nothing at all when expressing their disagreement with the methods employed by ICE, observers may be tempted to view the majority's ruling, which accepts the government's characterization of Portland as a war zone, as merely absurd,\" Graber wrote.   Officials at the White House praised the court's ruling Monday, saying it affirms that the lower court's ruling \"was unlawful and incorrect.\"   \n   \"As we have always maintained, President Trump is exercising his lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel following violent riots that local leaders have refused to address,\" Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement.   Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield also responded to Monday's ruling with a statement: \"Today's ruling, if allowed to stand, would give the president unilateral power to put Oregon soldiers on our streets with almost no justification,\" he wrote. \"We are on a dangerous path in America.\"   Clarification: An earlier version of this story said the 9th Circuit decision removed \"the\" legal impediment to Trump's deployment of the national guard troops to Portland, implying it was singular. While the court granted a stay for one temporary restraining order, at the time of publication a second order is still in force, so the immediate impact of this ruling is unclear.\n",

The Trump administration wants schools to sign a \"compact\" in exchange for priority access to federal grants.\n                \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Monday is the deadline for a handful of universities to agree to a list of commitments that align with the Trump administration's political priorities, in exchange for preferential access to federal funds.   The Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education was sent on Oct. 1 to nine colleges — both private and public — and would require schools to bar transgender people from using restrooms or playing in sports that align with their gender identities, freeze tuition for five years, limit international student enrollment, and require standardized tests for admissions, among other things.   Of the original nine schools that received the document, as of Sunday night, six had indicated they are not planning on signing.   \n   MIT was the first school to issue a public statement: The document \"includes principles with which we disagree,\" MIT President Sally Kornbluth wrote in a letter to Education Secretary Linda McMahon on Oct. 10. \"And fundamentally the premise of the document is inconsistent with our core belief that scientific funding should be based on scientific merit alone.\"   \n   Following that rejection, President Trump wrote on Truth Social that all colleges would be able to sign on, not just those that received the letter.   Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Southern California followed, with statements \"respectfully\" declining the offer.   On Friday, the White House held a virtual meeting with colleges that hadn't yet sent rejection notices, including the University of Arizona, the University of Texas at Austin, Vanderbilt University, Dartmouth College and the University of Virginia. Three additional schools were also invited: Arizona State University, Washington University in St. Louis and the University of Kansas, according to The Wall Street Journal.   \"Today's conversation with national higher education leaders is an important step toward defining a shared vision, and we look forward to continued discussions in the weeks ahead,\" McMahon wrote on X after the meeting. She said attendees had a \"positive and wide-ranging conversation about the Compact.\"   \n   But following that meeting, two schools, the University of Virginia and Dartmouth College, announced they also would not be signing on to the agreement. Dartmouth President Sian Leah Beilock said in a letter to students and faculty on Saturday that she did not think \"a compact — with any administration — is the right approach to achieve academic excellence.\"   UVA said it wanted \"no special treatment\" when it comes to federal funding.   \"A contractual arrangement predicating assessment on anything other than merit will undermine the integrity of vital, sometimes lifesaving, research and further erode confidence in American higher education,\" wrote Paul Mahoney, the interim president of UVA. He said the university had provided the administration with comments and that the university agreed with many of the principles laid out in the compact.   \n   UVA's previous president resigned this summer under pressure from the Trump administration over the university's response to President Trump's order to end diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.   The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday on its plans for the compact going forward. An automated emailed response said there were staff shortages due to the government shutdown and blamed Democrats.   Since Trump took office, the administration has canceled billions of dollars in federal research grants at many universities over a number of issues, including transgender policies, diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and antisemitism on campus.\n",

Some reporters watched from a park near the Treasury Department, which is next to the East Wing.   Trump announced the start of construction in a social media post and referenced the work while hosting 2025 college baseball champs Louisiana State University and LSU-Shreveport in the East Room. He noted the work was happening \"right behind us.\"   \n   \"We have a lot of construction going on, which you might hear periodically,\" he said, adding, \"It just started today.\"   The White House has moved ahead with the massive construction project despite not yet having sign-off from the National Capital Planning Commission, which approves construction work and major renovations to government buildings in the Washington area.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A model is seen as President Trump addresses a dinner for donors who have contributed to build the new ballroom at the White House on Oct. 15 in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    John McDonnell/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        John McDonnell/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Its chairman, Will Scharf, who is also the White House staff secretary and one of Trump's top aides, said at the commission's September meeting that agency does not have jurisdiction over demolition or site preparation work for buildings on federal property.   \"What we deal with is essentially construction, vertical build,\" Scharf said last month.   It was unclear whether the White House had submitted the ballroom plans for the agency's review and approval. The White House did not respond to a request for comment and the commission's offices are closed because of the government shutdown.   The Republican president had said in July when the project was announced that the ballroom would not interfere with the mansion itself.   \"It'll be near it but not touching it and pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of,\" he said of the White House.   \n   The East Wing houses several offices, including those of the first lady. It was built in 1902 and has been renovated over the years, with a second story added in 1942, according to the White House.   Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said those East Wing offices will be temporarily relocated during construction and that wing of the building will be modernized and renovated.   \n   \"Nothing will be torn down,\" Leavitt said when she announced the project in July.   Trump insists that presidents have desired such a ballroom for 150 years and that he's adding the massive 90,000-square-foot, glass-walled space because the East Room, which is the largest room in the White House with an approximately 200-person capacity, is too small. He also has said he does not like the idea of hosting kings, queens, presidents and prime ministers in pavilions on the South Lawn.   Trump said in the social media announcement that the project would be completed \"with zero cost to the American Taxpayer! The White House Ballroom is being privately funded by many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly.\"   The ballroom will be the biggest structural change to the Executive Mansion since the addition in 1948 of the Truman Balcony overlooking the South Lawn, even dwarfing the residence itself.   At a dinner he hosted last week for some of the wealthy business executives who are donating money toward the $250 million construction cost, Trump said the project had grown in size and now will accommodate 999 people. The capacity was 650 seated people at the July announcement.   The White House has said it will disclose information on who has contributed money to build the ballroom, but has yet to do so.   Trump also said at last week's event that the head of Carrier Global Corp., a leading manufacturer of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, had offered to donate the air conditioning system for the ballroom.   \n   Carrier confirmed to The Associated Press on Monday that it had done so. A cost estimate was not immediately available.   \"Carrier is honored to provide the new iconic ballroom at the White House with a world-class, energy-efficient HVAC system, bringing comfort to distinguished guests and dignitaries in this historic setting for years to come,\" the company said in an emailed statement.   The clearing of trees on the south grounds and other site preparation work started in September. Plans call for the ballroom to be ready before Trump's term ends in January 2029.\n",

Today's top stories   The ceasefire in Gaza was tested this weekend when Israel launched an assault on the territory in response to an attack on its troops. The Israeli military said Sunday that \"terrorists\" attacked Israeli troops operating in the Rafah area resulting in two soldiers being killed. Hamas denied involvement in any attacks. Gaza officials say dozens were killed in the Israeli strikes. Both sides are accusing the other of violating the ceasefire deal brokered by the United States.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Smoke billows following an Israeli strike that targeted a building in the Bureij camp for Palestinian refugees in the central Gaza Strip on Oct. 19. Gaza's civil defence agency said a series of Israeli air strikes on October 19 killed at least 11 people across the territory, as Israel and Hamas traded blame for violating a ceasefire.\n                \n                    Eyad Baba/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Eyad Baba/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Yesterday's events mark the most significant threat to the ceasefire deal since both sides signed the agreement, NPR's Rob Schmitz tells Up First. Despite what happened, Hamas and Israel say they are still committed to the spirit of the ceasefire. U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and President Trump's adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, arrive in Israel today and Vice President JD Vance is expected to arrive tomorrow to get the ceasefire deal back on track. The group will try to facilitate the return of the remaining Israeli hostage bodies, which is an important part of the first phase of the agreement.   \n   The government shutdown is entering day 20 with no serious negotiations underway to bring it to an end. The longest shutdown was 35 days and happened during Trump's first term in the White House. However, this time it is different as there is less pressure to get a deal because some of the impacts are not being widely felt, NPR's Deirdre Walsh says.    🎧 Instead of feeling pressure to fold due to their projects being targeted, Democrats are digging in and saying that this is more of the same tactics the Trump administration used before the shutdown happened. The Senate has unsuccessfully voted 10 times on a House-approved stopgap bill to fund the government. The next vote is expected tonight. Senate Democrats are expected to keep blocking that bill, not budging on their position that health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year need to be extended.   The U.S. plans to stop all subsidies to Colombia and implement new tariffs after the country's leader, Gustavo Petro, said Trump's attacks on boats coming from Venezuela amount to murder. U.S. forces have destroyed boats in the open waters in what the government describes as a counternarcotics operation.    🎧 The U.S. government says it has struck at least seven vessels and claims they were loaded with drugs headed to the U.S. NPR's Eyder Peralta says the big picture is that it has been decades since the U.S. military has taken a position like this in the Americas. This has created tension in the region. Renute Roberts, a fisherman in Trinidad, says he can hear drones circling at night. While Roberts says he believes drugs are a problem, he says Trump can handle it without bombing boats.   \n   Cost of living    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                As health insurance prices are surging, some companies are covering their employees' medical plans.\n                \n                    Getty Images/Emily Bogle/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Getty Images/Emily Bogle/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   NPR's series Cost of Living: The Price We Pay is examining what's driving price increases and how people are coping after years of stubborn inflation.    U.S. health care is the most expensive in the developed world and the price point is only rising. Last year, the average annual premium for an employer-based health insurance plan for a family of four was over $25,500. Of that average total, employers contributed about $19,200 and workers contributed the rest. Total premiums have risen over 24% since 2019 and are widely expected to surge next year. Here's how the increasing costs are impacting people and companies:    ⚕️ Drugmakers, hospitals, insurance companies and other for-profit companies have driven up the costs of accessing medical care in the U.S. For example, drugmakers are developing more effective medications, but they are charging a lot for them.⚕️ For many of the millions of people who get health insurance through their employer, their paycheck deductions could surge next year by 6% to 7% on average.⚕️ Some companies are covering all insurance premiums. Offering zero-premium health insurance can help to recruit new employees, reduce turnover rates and help workers stay focused on their job, instead of expenses.   Listen to more about what companies are doing to help with health insurance premiums, or read a conversation about it.

The first cumbia song recorded in Ecuador in the 1960s had just one verse and it was called \"Cumbia Triste.\" Written by Polibio Mayorga, the song combined the rhythms of the San Juanito — traditional Andean music — with rural Colombian cumbia, which arrived to the country by way of the record industry. The result marked a new identity for many migrants who came to live in Ecuador's urban centers. Mayorga laid the groundwork for the Ecuadorian cumbia sound and musicians like Medardo Luzuriaga, who transformed the genre into a national sensation. Luzuriaga recorded over 100 albums, and his emblematic cumbias still live in the collective conscience of the entire country.

When they started dating, Surovtsev was honest about his past. He told her that he had come from the former Soviet Union as a refugee at the age of 4. And that when he was a teenager, his green card was revoked after pleading guilty to carjacking and burglary charges in California.   He explained that after being released from prison, in 2014, he spent time in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody while they tried — and failed — to deport him to Ukraine and Russia.   Both countries, according to legal filings reviewed by NPR, could not provide or confirm Surovtsev's citizenship since he left before the fall of the Soviet Union. They couldn't give him the travel documents needed for deportation.   \n   Since then, each year, Roman Surovtsev did a check-in with ICE.   In the meantime, the Surovtsevs' lives followed the path of thousands of immigrants in the U.S. who are considered stateless. They got married, had kids, and launched a small commercial painting business in Texas.   Then, one day in early August, what should have been a 10-minute errand at a kiosk at the Dallas ICE field office for one of those regular check-ins turned into 30 minutes of waiting in the parking lot, \"praying that he wouldn't be detained,\" his wife told NPR.   \n   \"There were tears involved, just not knowing what was on the other side of that appointment,\" Samantha Surovtsev recalled. Then she got that call: \"I panicked. I panicked because it said, 'This is a call from a detainee.'\"   Roman Surovtsev joined the trend of others who are detained at their regularly scheduled check-ins with ICE, to meet the administration's 1 million-person annual deportation target.   The \"human element\"   What makes his case different is that his wife has marshaled a team of lawyers on his behalf. Unlike hundreds of others the Trump administration has vowed to deport as part of its mass deportation goal, Surovtsev has a chance to make his case in front of a judge.   \n   \"People need to understand that there's a human element involved with immigration, that every story is unique,\" his wife said. \"Every case deserves to be heard in front of a judge. This is not a black-and-white situation.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Surovtsevs on their wedding day on Sept. 29, 2019.\n                \n                    Credit: Surovtsev family\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Credit: Surovtsev family\n    \n\n   \n   According to the Surovtsevs' lawyers and court filings, ICE has been trying for a second time to deport Roman to Ukraine, which does not have the documentation to prove his citizenship and could draft him into armed conflict. In court filings, his lawyers argue that his re-detention is unconstitutional since there's been no change to make it easier to deport him to his place of birth and that there is \"not a significant likelihood that Roman would be removed in the reasonably foreseeable future.\"   \n   The absurdity of his situation was highlighted at the Bluebonnet Detention Center in Texas. The north Texas detention site, which was over its population capacity this summer, also housed Venezuelan migrants.   Surovtsev was given deportation travel paperwork in Ukrainian, according to a court declaration from Zachery Hagerty, the deportation officer processing Surovtsev. Surovtsev, who is fluent in English, does not speak or read Ukrainian.   In court filings, the Justice Department, which argues these cases on behalf of the government, said that the re-detention is legal because the agency has once again requested new travel documents from Ukraine.   Hagerty in his declaration said he believes Surovtsev could at least be deported to a third country, if not Ukraine.   \n   The Department of Homeland Security didn't respond to a request for comment about his specific case.   In the meantime, his legal team has successfully vacated his carjacking criminal conviction, arguing that he was not informed of the consequences to his immigration status when he originally pleaded guilty as a teen.   \"It's not a complex question. It's not a discretionary issue,\" said Eric Lee, a partner at the law firm Lee and Godshall-Bennett, one of the firms handling the case. \"He's going to get his green card back in a matter of time, which only makes it all the more callous and absurd that the administration continues to try and remove him to a country to which removal is effectively going to be a death sentence.\"   \n   Navigating due process   In the more than two months that Surovtsev has been in detention, he has missed his wedding anniversary, his wife and daughter's birthdays and his mother's recent health issues. His wife, Samantha, has had to cancel about two months' worth of jobs for their painting business and their two employees are out of work.   Every day, she told NPR, she turns down about five work leads, letting customers know that there is a family emergency. She has instead spent her time working with several attorneys across the country to vacate her husband's conviction, reinstate his green card and release him from detention.   \n   Immigration advocates have argued that the Trump administration's rapid approach to increase arrests and removals reduces the limited due process immigrants get. That due process is in part to minimize the chances of mistakes and prevent someone from being removed when they may have valid claims to stay, they said.   Lawyers say the Trump administration has taken steps to undermine due process. Earlier this year, the president said it wasn't possible for all the people he wants to remove to get a trial.   Immigration officers have been told to make arrests in court, even as judges told immigrants to come back to their case. And the Homeland Security Department has mandated that immigrants be detained while undergoing their proceedings, with such detention as mandatory for those who entered without legal status.   \"Yet there are lots of people in this situation. And there have been several habeas cases filed over the summer on very similar facts regarding re-detention,\" said Chris Godshall-Bennett, a constitutional and civil rights attorney and another of Surovtsev's lawyers, referring to the legal avenue for people to claim their detention is unlawful.   \n   The process can be slow, and most people in immigration detention and in immigration court do not have legal representation to argue the particulars of their cases. Lee, the other attorney on Surovtsev's case, said this process shows that the government is trying again to do something it can't: deport Surovtsev to Ukraine.   \"The danger here is not simply that people will be sent somewhere wrongly. The danger is that the government is going to do it on purpose in a way that disregards those protections,\" Godshall-Bennett said. \"By disregarding those protections for a subset of individuals, it has opened the door to disregarding them. Period.\"\n",

Good morning, Danielle.DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Good morning, Don.GONYEA: So how do you assess the significance of these demonstrations?KURTZLEBEN: Well, they're definitely significant. I mean, first of all, they were huge. You saw these full city blocks just densely packed with people in New York, D.C., Chicago. You saw some big protests worldwide and still sizable protests in smaller cities, suburbs and small towns.But also, I just keep thinking back to covering protests right after Trump was first inaugurated in 2017. You immediately had the Women's March. You had those demonstrations at airports about immigration, pro-science demonstrations. But they were all separate.This has been a slower build, but it's like you're seeing all of that energy rolled into kind of one big protest movement. And furthermore, as Trump has gone further and faster with his agenda this time, these protests feel existential. They're not about issues. As the protesters keep saying, this is about democracy itself.GONYEA: And the president, meanwhile, continues to make foreign policy a top priority. He talked on the phone to Russia's President Vladimir Putin last week before hosting Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House. That was on Friday. What would you say is the state of play when it comes to those relations?KURTZLEBEN: Well, it's really striking to me how big events keep happening in this whole saga, and yet we haven't seen President Trump make a lot of headway. There was that disastrous Oval Office meeting earlier this year where Zelenskyy, Trump and Vice President Vance came to a near-shouting match. There was that meeting in Alaska with the Russian president on U.S. soil. That was momentous. And there were several foreign leaders coming to the White House to talk about peace this year. And then this week, this two-hour phone call with Putin and Zelenskyy visiting the White House. And yet for all of that sounded fury, there just hasn't been a lot of movement.GONYEA: Anything come out of these latest talks?KURTZLEBEN: Well, one big topic was these long-range Tomahawk missiles. Prior to that Thursday Putin call, Trump had signaled he might supply those missiles to Ukraine. But after that call, talking to Zelenskyy, he seemed to have softened on it, saying he hopes to end the war without those missiles. But we do now have some more big meetings to come. Trump says he will meet Putin soon in Budapest, Hungary, to discuss an end to the war. And in addition, Secretary of State Marco Rubio says he will hold talks with the Russian foreign minister before all of that. But as we've seen, none of that means progress.GONYEA: And then finally, Danielle, it is Day 19 of the government shutdown. Any glimpse of a deal?KURTZLEBEN: No, in a word.GONYEA: OK.KURTZLEBEN: On Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats alike are dug in, and Trump doesn't seem himself to be in a hurry to fix things. He's using the shutdown to pick winners and losers within the government. He has said he's trying to hurt what he calls Democrat programs. And meanwhile, while some workers are starting to go unpaid, he says he's going to make sure that some - military, FBI, ICE - that they will get paid.Now, one more development. The administration has been trying to do layoffs across government during the shutdown. They said they had planned around 4,000 at one point. A U.S. district court judge issued a temporary restraining order halting some of those layoffs. What happened was some unions representing government employees argued, look, you can't just shut down programs because funding runs out, and the judge agreed with them.But that restraining order only protects some employees. And so the Trump administration, as of Friday, had only paused work on a small share of the firings. Now, meanwhile, White House Budget Director Russ Vought - he said layoffs eventually could total more than 10,000. So this fight just is not going to go away.GONYEA: That's NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben. Danielle, thank you, as always.KURTZLEBEN: Thank you, Don.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Steve Inskeep asks Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas about the impact of the government shutdown on his constituents, including military families in the state.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Republican Congressman Tony Gonzales joins us next. He represents the 23rd District in Texas, which includes roughly 800 miles of the southern border. It's a district the size of a state. Congressman, good morning.TONY GONZALES: Good morning, Steve. Thanks for having me on.INSKEEP: Heard your wife was furloughed because she works for the Air Force. So what are the conversations like at home?GONZALES: Yeah. There's a lot of people that have been impacted by this, and my family's included. My wife is furloughed. And I think back to my time in the military. I served 20 years in the military. There were multiple times where there were government shutdowns where our family didn't get paid. Thankfully, in this shutdown, President Trump is making sure that the troops are getting paid and now some DHS employees. But the sooner we can get back - we, being Congress - can get back to passing our bills, the better off all Americans will be.INSKEEP: It's true that the president is finding money elsewhere to pay military members and some other people. But I am curious. With a federal worker right in your family, how do you view the administration also responding to the shutdown by firing federal workers?GONZALES: Well, it's a mixed bag. One, I do believe there is too much bureaucracy in government, period. I don't care what department you're in. But, two, there are also some amazing federal employees all throughout our country that are doing great work. So really, in my eyes, you need to go through with a scalpel and kind of find out how do you make a department more efficient without, you know, gutting the functions of what they do. That's the balance of it, and frankly, that's the role that Congress needs to be playing. In the House, we've done that through the appropriations process. I sit on the Appropriations Committee. We've passed all 12 bills out of committee and several bills out of the House floor. I hope the Senate takes up many of these bills.INSKEEP: You're pointing out that it would be good to go through carefully and that it's Congress' job. Do you agree that the president has the authority on his own to be firing people not, apparently, based on the criteria that you laid out, but based on what he considers to be Democrat agencies?GONZALES: I don't know exactly if there - people are getting fired yet. You know, there have been some mixed reporting on that. I do appreciate the fact that the president is ensuring that agencies are getting paid, like - once again, like our troops are getting paid. That is important. That's an important aspect of it. But the sooner we can get back to regular order, the better we will be. You know, in the House, we had a bipartisan bill that passed over 20 days ago. To me, that is going to be the bill that ultimately passes to reopen the government. Whether that's today, two weeks or two months from now, that is going to be the way we're going to get out of this.INSKEEP: As you probably know, there's been some criticism of the House for staying out of session. Speaker Mike Johnson says he refuses to bring you back until the government is reopened. The minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, says Republicans are starting their fourth week of vacation. Do you see it that way?GONZALES: Well, one, any time members are back in the district, I think that's a positive for everybody. We're closest to the people, and we can hear directly from our constituents. But, you know, every member is different. I've been up to Washington every week during the shutdown. I'll be back up there on Wednesday and Thursday, meeting with, you know, world leaders, meeting with constituents, kind of doing business as usual, trying to find a way - if there's anything that I can do to be helpful to get us out of this shutdown. And I honestly think a lot of my Republican colleagues are doing the exact same thing. So yeah, no. This is far from a vacation, especially as you alluded to, you know, when my wife isn't getting paid.INSKEEP: Yeah.GONZALES: And we've got a small Catholic family of six to provide for, so a lot of us are anxious. And my family's included.INSKEEP: Can you imagine a compromise?GONZALES: No. There will be no compromise. Republicans aren't going to budge. We're not going to break. We're not going to bend. This is going to - the government will shut down when Senate Democrats pass a clean CR. And then after that clean CR, I think there'll be a huge opportunity to pass these appropriation bills for the duration of the year, because I think everybody will be exhausted with the shutdown.INSKEEP: Do you expect then Democrats simply to give in entirely and go along with the Republican agenda?GONZALES: I expect what has already happened. You've had some bipartisanship in the House when we passed this bill. You've seen some bipartisanship over the 10 votes. You've had some Senate Democrats come on board. I suspect you will see more Senate Democrats come on board at whatever time they choose, and that's how we will get to 60 votes. It won't be something different, though. It'll be a clean CR, which kicks the can down the road but gives us a few extra weeks to, once again, pass these appropriation bills that - I think there's already a - I know for a fact there's already a package teed up. The ag bill, the ledge bill and the military VA bill is already teed up. And then there's a package right behind that that is also teed up. So I think once we get out of this shutdown, we'll be in a much better spot than we are now.INSKEEP: We've just got about 20 seconds left, but aren't there constituents of yours who will be affected by this drastic increase in Obamacare subsidies.GONZALES: That's a complicated issue. And that's one reason why I think Congress needs to get back to work, so we can discuss these things. These aren't things you just kind of sign with a pen or erase with an eraser. This is what Congress needs to be doing - having these tough conversations. The longer we're in this shutdown, the harder it is for us to have those tough conversations.INSKEEP: Congressman Tony Gonzales, Republican, of Texas. It's a pleasure talking with you, sir. Hope to have you back. Thanks so much.GONZALES: Thank you, Steve.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

His retirement was announced by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth this week on social media. NPR's Quil Lawrence reports.QUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE: Secretary Hegseth announced that Admiral Alvin Holsey would retire after 37 years in the military and praised what he called the admiral's unwavering commitment to mission, people and nation. U.S. Southern Command later posted a message from Admiral Holsey thanking his troops. It's highly unusual for an officer not to finish the full three years of a command like this, and even stranger in the middle of a military buildup, which has seen thousands of U.S. troops move into position off the Venezuelan coast. Admiral Holsey is Black. The Trump administration has let go several senior military leaders who are non-white or female, implying that they'd been promoted for that reason. But there's another theory this time, says retired Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery.MARK MONTGOMERY: I'd probably lean more towards we're conducting extremely unusual operations in Southern Command right now that a reasonable person could disagree with the legality of.LAWRENCE: At least six times recently, the U.S. military has made lethal strikes on small civilian vessels. The White House says they carry drugs. Critics say the strikes are illegal under both U.S. and international law and that they amount to execution without trial. Montgomery says the military is ill-suited to that job.MONTGOMERY: As much as I absolutely want to prevent all drugs coming into the country, this kind of law enforcement action against narcotic deliveries is best handled by law enforcement that does appropriate due process.LAWRENCE: A U.S. official not authorized to speak publicly has confirmed with NPR that Admiral Holsey recently met with Hegseth at the Pentagon to express his concerns and then stepped down. After that news broke, President Trump confirmed the most recent strike on what he described as a drug-carrying submarine. Trump said without evidence that this was, quote, \"not a group of innocent people.\" A second U.S. official who is not permitted to speak publicly said U.S. troops seized two survivors after that strike, and they're being brought elsewhere for possible legal proceedings.Quil Lawrence, NPR News.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

Instead, they think that we don't know what's best for ourselves.\"   Missouri is the second state in the country, alongside Texas, to gerrymander its congressional map after President Donald Trump set off a nationwide redistricting battle in July to try to maintain control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterms.   \n   Multiple other states, including North Carolina, Indiana, Florida, Ohio and Kansas could soon follow. California is trying to counter the Republican effort by redistricting in favor of Democrats, if voters pass a constitutional amendment next month.   Missouri's Republican Governor, Mike Kehoe, signed the new map into law late last month. The state had six Republicans and two Democrats in Congress, but the new plan targets longtime Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II's seat in Kansas City.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Leann Villaluz (right) has been going door to door for weeks to collect signatures for a petition to put Missouri's new congressional map to voters. She says most people she's talked to are willing to sign.\n                \n                    Savannah Hawley-Bates/KCUR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Savannah Hawley-Bates/KCUR\n    \n\n   \n   But with Villaluz and about 3,000 other volunteers, a group called People Not Politicians Missouri is working to overturn the state's new map. If they're successful in getting more than 106,000 signatures across the state by December 11, a referendum will go on the ballot in 2026 for voters to decide whether to want to keep or reject it.   The group says it's already gathered more than 100,000 signatures and is still collecting more. If they get the signatures they need, the referendum would stall the map until voters weigh in next year.   Villaluz says everyone she's spoken to has been excited to sign. She's visited five neighborhoods so far around Kansas City, which would be split into three Republican-leaning districts under the new map. Villaluz even took her petition to the recent Chappell Roan concert to get signatures.   \n   \"Just about anyone that stops and hears what the petition is about is ready and willing to sign,\" Villaluz says. \"Whatever your vote is, it's going to be diluted with the maps, and nobody wants that.\"   Missouri attorney general and secretary of state fight back    Not only does People Not Politicians Missouri have to gather enough signatures, it also has to take on pushback from top state election officials. The state's Attorney General Catherine Hanaway filed a lawsuit in federal court arguing that a referendum on redistricting violates both the U.S. and Missouri constitutions.   Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins did approve the group's referendum petition this week after initially rejecting it. But in a press release, Hoskins claims that none of the signatures gathered before his approval date are valid.   \"The process is clear,\" Hoskins said in the release. \"Every Missourian deserves confidence that ballot measures follow the law — not out-of-state agendas or confusion campaigns. Missouri values fairness and integrity, and this process reflects that.\"   The executive director of People Not Politicians Missouri, Richard von Glahn, said in a statement that Hoskins is \"deliberately spreading misinformation for political purposes,\" and that, according to the state constitution, the group was allowed to begin gathering signatures before the secretary of state's approval.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A group called People Not Politicians Missouri has been working to gather signatures to overturn Missouri's new congressional map. Signers have to leave one column on the petition, their congressional district, blank, because with the map changes, many don't know which district they're in.\n                \n                    Savannah Hawley-Bates/KCUR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Savannah Hawley-Bates/KCUR\n    \n\n   \n   \"Our campaign has gathered signatures at a historic pace — I've never seen Missourians unite and mobilize this quickly,\" von Glahn said in the statement. \"We will not be intimidated or distracted. This referendum will qualify, and Missourians — not politicians — will decide the future of fair representation in our state.\"   The Democratic National Committee has joined the referendum effort and is contributing more staff and money to the cause. A slew of lawsuits have also been filed challenging the new districts.   A legal effort, too    Rebeca Amezcua-Hogan is one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit that seeks to block Hoskins from using the map to hold a congressional primary or general election and argues mid-decade redistricting without a new census is unconstitutional.   \n   \"My own voting power would be watered down,\" Amezcua-Hogan says. \"I would feel like I'm not being represented. And I think that at least personally, for the issues that are close to my heart that I've been working on for years, it would be incredibly discouraging.\"   Amezcua-Hogan is running as a progressive for the Kansas City Council. The area she wants to represent would be split into three different congressional districts if the new map holds. When she talks to voters for her campaign, Amezcua-Hogan is also gathering signatures for the referendum effort.   She says Kansas City is already competing for federal resources and splitting it up into three districts will only make that more difficult.   \"Kansas City is already at a point where we're dealing with lack of affordable housing, lack of mental health resources, lack of transportation,\" says Amezcua-Hogan. \"It already feels like we're fighting an uphill battle, and that uphill battle is only going to get worse.\"   Most, but not all Republicans, are on board   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Lawmakers convene in an extraordinary legislative session at the Missouri State Capitol on Monday, Sept. 8, 2025, in Jefferson City, Mo.\n                \n                    Brian Munoz/St. Louis Public Radio\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brian Munoz/St. Louis Public Radio\n    \n\n   \n   Missouri's new congressional map easily passed the Republican-dominated Missouri Legislature in its week-long special session.   Michael Davis represents a suburb south of Kansas City and is one of the lawmakers who championed the new map. He's part of the state's Freedom Caucus, a group of Republican legislators who aim to push the party further to the right.   Davis says Missourians elected Republican lawmakers because they trust them to do what they think is best with redistricting.   \"We should send a conservative message to D.C.,\" Davis says. \"The best way to do that is by sending seven Republicans who are going to ensure that Republicans keep control of the U.S. House of Representatives.\"   But 15 Republicans — including Jon Patterson, the speaker of the Missouri House — voted against the map in the state legislature. Nearly all of them are from parts of the state targeted by redistricting or in areas that would be moved into new districts.   \n   Republican state Rep. Bill Allen represents a part of Kansas City's northland that is evenly split between parties. He opposes mid-decade redistricting and said he was disappointed that Missouri seemed to follow Texas and Trump's lead in doing so.   \"I think I heard from one or two constituents that wanted me to vote in favor, and almost every other one that I heard was in opposition,\" Allen says. \"The job of the representative is to represent the district, not the party, certainly not the president. Just the district that I represent, the 39,000 people. Their will is my responsibility.\"   Villaluz says she plans to keep gathering signatures for the next two months, until the group finds out if it has done enough to put redistricting on the ballot and potentially reverse Missouri's gerrymandered map.   \"I feel that Missouri is used as a guinea pig by the GOP,\" says Villaluz. \"They think that the average Missouri voter is dumber than we are, and they think that they can get away with a lot more here in a red flyover state, but that's not the case.\"   Villaluz says voters across Missouri won't stand idly by, and she believes they'll get the last word.\n",

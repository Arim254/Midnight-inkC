Today, his Brooklyn tech company makes a free app for people on the federal government's anti-hunger Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.   About 5 million people use Propel's app to check their SNAP balances, and get coupons and discounts on groceries. That gives Chen a pretty good view into how they're being affected by the federal government's unprecedented delay in sending out November payments.   \"Their budgets are already extremely tight. There's usually not a lot of wiggle room,\" Chen says. \"So a delay of even a few days on an expected deposit ends up being a really, really huge deal.\"   \n   Now his company is trying to bridge that gap, joining other private businesses, nonprofits, and individuals scrambling to offset the government's delayed SNAP payments. On Saturday, Propel started giving payments of $50 to people using its app, prioritizing those with children and little or no income.   \n   \"We understand that $50 is not enough,\" Chen says, adding that Propel is trying to reach the largest number of families and \"provide an amount that gives them a little bit of breathing room.\"   The company has identified about 230,000 users who fit this \"high need\" profile. It has donated $1 million of the total $10 million it needs to fund $50 payments to most of them, and is hoping to beat that target.   Looking for partners   Propel has also lined up some donations from its corporate partners, including the New York anti-poverty nonprofit Robin Hood and ecommerce platform Babylist. It also set up a crowdfunding campaign with the nonprofit GiveDirectly, which runs similar programs all over the world and which has worked with Propel in the past.   GiveDirectly says it's raised a total of $6 million, including Propel's contributions, so far.   \"The sheer scale and volume of this need is so immense. We're talking about millions of low income Americans who are at risk of not getting this assistance,\" says Sarina Jain, GiveDirectly's senior program manager focused on U.S. disaster responses.   \n   Even as they've scrambled to launch this donation program, Chen and Jain acknowledge that all of the efforts from non-profits and private companies can never replace the federal government, which spends $8 billion every month on the country's largest anti-hunger program.   \"At the end of the day, the single biggest thing we can do in this country is to get SNAP back online, depositing on a predictable schedule to the people who receive it,\" Chen says.   42 million SNAP recipients face delayed payments    Almost 42 million people rely on SNAP. Now they're waiting for payments that the government stopped making on Saturday — and they're facing delays that could stretch into months.   After two federal judges ruled that freezing SNAP payments is unlawful, the Trump administration on Monday said it would restart partial SNAP payments.   But the government added that states would only receive about half the amount of federal funding they usually get. It plans to use money from an Agriculture Department contingency fund, which contains only $5 billion — well short of the $8 billion it costs to provide full SNAP benefits each month.   The government also warned that it could take some states \"anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months\" to process the reduced payments.   That could be disastrous for many SNAP recipients, such as Shenita Melton. The 37-year-old lives in rural Anson County, North Carolina, and relies on SNAP to help feed her four children.   Propel connected NPR to Melton, who said last week that she was already starting to scramble to find enough food for her kids — especially her three teenagers, who \"eat a lot.\"   There aren't many food banks in the rural area where she lives. The few that do exist only allow people to pick up groceries once or twice a month.   Melton also says that many of the groceries at those food banks are expired.   \n   \"I'm kind of scared to give my kids expired food,\" she says. \"But sometimes you have to do what you have to do.\"\n",

A special election in California allows the state's voters to weigh in on what is now a cross-country redistricting battle between the two major parties ahead of next year's midterm elections.   \n   Here are details on that contest and three others we're watching this Election Day. (And when polls close, find results for these key races here.)   California redistricting   Proposition 50 would replace California's current congressional lines with a map favoring Democrats.   The maneuver is Gov. Gavin Newsom's answer to President Trump pushing Texas and other GOP-led states to redraw their congressional maps to give Republicans a better chance of hanging onto the party's slim majority in the U.S. House.   \n   If voters approve Prop 50 — which appears likely — the new districts could help Democrats win up to five more House seats in the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections. The proposition is written to expire after the 2030 election, returning line-drawing power to the state's existing independent citizens' redistricting commission.   — KQED's Guy Marzorati      New York City mayor   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                New York City mayoral candidates former New York Gov.

Andrew Cuomo and nine other Democrats in the primary by running a grassroots campaign that inspired younger voters through a relentless focus on making New York City more affordable.   His primary win energized portions of the party's base, while making him a foil for Republicans across the country.   \n   Cuomo opted to stay in the mayor's race by running as an independent. He's criticized Mamdani as too inexperienced to deal with Trump. Cuomo has also argued that the state legislator's campaign platform, which includes free buses and universal childcare, can't be delivered.   If elected, Mamdani would be the city's first Muslim mayor and, at 34, its youngest in more than a century.   — WNYC's Brigid Bergin      New Jersey governor    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Rep.

Polls also show issues like housing affordability and high electric bills are top of voters' minds, but the contest has been dominated in recent weeks by personal attacks on both sides.   If Sherrill wins, it would be the first time since the 1960s that New Jersey voters elect a governor from the same party three terms in a row.   — WNYC's Mike Hayes      Virginia governor    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Lt.

In a court filing, officials said depleting that fund means \"no funds will remain for new SNAP applicants certified in November, disaster assistance, or as a cushion against the potential catastrophic consequences of shutting down SNAP entirely.\"   Starting Nov. 1, SNAP benefits did not hit accounts as expected after the USDA, which administers SNAP, froze funding, citing the federal government shutdown. The shutdown is now in its 35th day.   \n   It is unclear when low-income families who depend on SNAP will receive these partial funds. The Trump administration said it anticipates long delays — \"anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months\" — before benefits arrive in the hands of registered SNAP recipients.   Last week, two federal judges ordered the Trump administration to use emergency funding to provide SNAP benefits for the 42 million people who rely on the program to feed their families. U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston ruled the Trump administration has until Monday to decide whether to pay at least partial SNAP food benefits but did not issue a temporary restraining order. In Rhode Island, U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. granted a temporary restraining order and said the Trump administration must submit a plan on how it would comply with his order, or \"at least an update,\" by noon on Monday, Ocean State Media reported. Both judges were appointed by former President Barack Obama.      Are you worried about your SNAP benefits? NPR wants to hear your story      SNAP, the country's largest anti-hunger program, dates back to the Great Depression and has never been disrupted this way. Most recipients are seniors, families with kids and people with disabilities.   \n   Food banks are stretched thin   In the few days since SNAP funding elapsed, food banks across the country have experienced a surge of people in need of their services, leading to long lines and widespread worries about how they will meet the escalating demand in the coming weeks. Some food bank administrators warn that it may soon amount to a public health crisis.   Small grocery stores, local farmers, and other retailers authorized to accept SNAP benefits are also bracing for changes as many of their usual customers are without the means to pay for food this month.   Some local communities have set up informal systems to support their neighbors in need of food assistance. In several cities, food banks have collaborated with government officials to connect residents with food resources. Others put out calls for volunteers to support their work.   While many food banks have previously dealt with difficult situations like natural disasters that strained their operations, the scale of this nationwide shutdown represents an unprecedented national food crisis. Senior citizens may be disproportionately impacted.   — Anusha Mathur, NPR   Read more: 'The helpers need help'. Food banks brace for impact as SNAP cliff looms   Reporters from the NPR Network are covering the uncertainty and lapse in benefits in states across the country.   Here's what we know so far.      State-specific impacts:   Alabama   Roughly 749,000 people are enrolled in SNAP in Alabama, according to the USDA. In 2024, SNAP assistance reached 15% of the state population (1 in 7 people). Alabama's Department of Human Resources (DHR), the agency responsible for SNAP in the state, says on its website that individuals can still apply for SNAP benefits during the suspension and DHR will continue to process applications and determine eligibility. Benefits will not be issued until the suspension is lifted.Current SNAP recipients, however, \"must continue to recertify their benefits, report as they normally would, and submit all documentation that would normally be required for them to continue in the program,\" DHR says. This is necessary so that each SNAP recipient can more quickly use their November funds in the grocery stores.   \n      Alaska   Roughly 66,000 people are enrolled in SNAP in Alaska, according to the USDA. The Alaska Department of Health said on Oct. 31 that it had not received funding for November's SNAP benefits [Alaska Public Media]Officials say the division will continue adding SNAP beneficiaries during the shutdown and Alaskans who lost food because of Typhoon Halong in western Alaska can apply to get October SNAP benefits re-issued.

[Alaska Public Media]Sen. Lisa Murkowski told NPR's Scott Detrow that she hopes that contingency funding can be used to help pay out SNAP benefits, particularly for those impacted by Typhoon Halong. \"I have seen different statements indicating that these contingency funds need to be reserved for disasters,\" she said on Friday. \"For those SNAP recipients in Alaska who have suffered this disaster, yeah, we want to make sure that they have some level of assistance or relief there.\"      Arizona   More than 887,000 people are enrolled in SNAP in Arizona, according to the USDA. Indigenous communities, including the Navajo and Cherokee Nations have been hit particularly hard.

As the benefits run dry, some community members have established informal systems to foot their neighbors' grocery bills.

Richard Blumenthal sharply critiqued the Trump administration for the shutdown and resulting impact on SNAP: \"Millions of Americans are struggling to put food on the table — a harsh reality that President Trump has abjectly failed to recognize, and Republicans have made worse by refusing to work with Democrats on reopening the government and providing access to health care.\" [CT Public]Meanwhile State Sen. Stephen Harding, Connecticut's Senate Minority Leader blamed Democrats: \"Bottom line: Democrats need to join Republicans in voting to reopen the government and resolve this crisis.\"[CT Public]Shortly after the latest shutdown began, some Connecticut legislators asked if the state — which has enjoyed unprecedented budget surpluses averaging more than $1.8 billion since 2017 — could again pump some of its own resources into SNAP benefits. But if EBT cards are shut off that could prove ineffective. Officials say  they are exploring options to expand emergency aid to food pantries and food banks and other nonprofit nutrition assistance services.

The cause was complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, the statement said. Cheney had dealt with a history of heart problems.   \"Dick Cheney was a great and good man who taught his children and grandchildren to love our country, and to live lives of courage, honor, love, kindness, and fly fishing,\" the statement said. \"We are grateful beyond measure for all Dick Cheney did for our country. And we are blessed beyond measure to have loved and been loved by this noble giant of a man.\"   In a statement, former President George W. Bush, who picked Cheney as his vice president, said the death \"is a loss to the nation and a sorrow to his friends. Laura and I will remember Dick Cheney for the decent, honorable man that he was.\"   Bush added that Cheney \"was a calm and steady presence in the White House amid great national challenges. I counted on him for his honest, forthright counsel, and he never failed to give his best.\"   \n   An inauspicious beginning   There was little in Cheney's early life to foreshadow the immensely influential role he would one day play at the highest levels of American politics. Born the son of a government conservation worker in Lincoln, Neb., in 1941, he would flunk out of Yale University and work as a lineman for a power company in his new home state of Wyoming. Toss in a pair of drunken-driving convictions, and it's an inauspicious young adulthood.   But turn it around Cheney did: marriage to his high school sweetheart, Lynn; two children; a college degree at the University of Wyoming; graduate school at the University of Wisconsin.   While Cheney was turning his life around, the U.S. was caught in the throes of the Vietnam War. Cheney supported that war but never fought in it. He received five military deferments. Critics would seize upon this decades later, as Cheney helped lead the U.S. into another controversial war — this one in Iraq.   Ordinary to extraordinary   The future vice president began his political career as a congressional intern in 1969. That same year he went to work for a future partner in the Bush administration — Donald Rumsfeld, who ran an economics office in the Nixon White House.   \n   Cheney left the White House before Nixon's resignation, but in 1974 he was back working for the new president, Gerald Ford. Cheney moved up quickly, becoming Ford's chief of staff at the age of 34.   It was then that he began to develop a philosophy that would come to full flower in the White House of George W. Bush. His belief was that the power of the presidency must be not only protected, but also restored. In the 1970s, he watched as Congress enacted reforms in response to Watergate and to Vietnam.   \"We've seen the War Powers Act, an anti-impoundment control act, and time after time after time, administrations have traded away the authority of the president to do his job,\" he said in a 2002 interview on Fox News. \"We're not going to do that in this administration. The president is bound and determined to defend those principles and to pass on this office, his and mine, to future generations in better shape than we found it.\"   \n   War, a recurring theme   In 1978, Cheney ran for Congress in Wyoming and won. That was also the year he suffered the first of a series of heart attacks. He served in Congress for a decade and finally gave up his seat to become secretary of defense for President George H.W. Bush.    This job brought Cheney's first confrontation with Saddam Hussein, when he directed Operation Desert Storm in the Middle East. The war ended quickly after Iraqi troops were evicted from Kuwait. At the time, there were some who felt the U.S. should continue all the way to Baghdad and topple Saddam's regime. President Bush declined; in 1994, Cheney defended that decision.   \"The notion that we ought to now go to Baghdad and somehow take control of the country strikes me as an extremely serious one in terms of what we'd have to do once we got there,\" he said. \"You'd probably have to put some new government in place. It's not clear what kind of government that would be, how long you'd have to stay. For the U.S. to get involved militarily in determining the outcome of the struggle over who's going to govern in Iraq strikes me as a classic definition of a quagmire.\"   \n   Cheney left the Pentagon when the first President Bush lost to Bill Clinton. Two years later, he flirted with a presidential run of his own but instead headed to the private sector, joining the giant energy services company Halliburton.   \n   Changing the vice presidency — and foreign policy   The job made Cheney a wealthy man, but he stayed involved in conservative politics. In 2000, he was asked by Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush to lead the search for a running mate. Bush later made a surprise announcement that he had chosen none other than Cheney.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Dick Cheney and George W. Bush wave to the crowd during Bush's second inauguration on Jan. 20, 2005.\n                \n                    Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   In office, Cheney became a lightning rod for critics of the administration. Cheney also redefined the office of the vice president. He became President Bush's closest adviser and a dominant player in shaping policy. Critics alleged that Cheney was really the man in charge at the White House.    The events of Sept. 11, 2001, only reinforced this notion. While Bush was in Florida that day, Cheney was at the White House. He was literally carried by Secret Service agents to an underground bunker. In an interview years later on NBC's Meet the Press, Cheney said it was he who told Bush not to return to the White House.   \"I said, 'Delay your return. We don't know what's going on here but it looks like, you know, we've been targeted,'\" Cheney said, adding that \"things that we did later on that day tied directly to guaranteeing presidential succession.\"   \n   After the Sept. 11 attacks, Cheney advocated an aggressive new foreign policy in which potential threats would be met with swift, preemptive action. No longer would the U.S. wait for an enemy to strike first. He helped sell the Iraq War by issuing dire warnings to the American people. At the same time, he famously predicted that the mission itself would be relatively easy.   On Meet the Press, Tim Russert, who then hosted the show, asked Cheney if the American people were ready for a long, bloody battle.   \n   \"I don't think it's likely to unfold that way, Tim, because I really do believe we will be greeted as liberators,\" Cheney said.   As the war dragged on, Democrats seized that statement as evidence of how Cheney's determination to go to war had clouded his judgment. There was talk that his views had changed from his earlier days in politics.   Controversy follows Cheney   While Cheney's disposition was never particularly sunny, critics assailed the vice president as a relentlessly grim figure. Late-night comics called him Darth Vader. Even President Bush had fun with his vice president's image on Halloween one year.   \"This morning I was with the vice president,\" Bush told reporters. \"I was asking him what costume he was planning. He said, 'Well, I'm already wearing it,' and then he mumbled something about the dark side of the force.\"   There were other controversies that dogged Cheney as the Bush administration's popularity plummeted in its second term. In 2007, his chief of staff and top adviser, Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, was convicted of perjury in an investigation into the leaking of the name of covert CIA operative Valerie Plame. Cheney was not implicated in the case legally, but he was tainted by the scandal nonetheless.   \n   Then, in what was one of the more bizarre incidents involving someone as high-ranking an official as Cheney, he accidentally shot and wounded a friend, attorney Harry Whittington, in the face and chest with birdshot pellets during a 2006 weekend quail-hunting trip at a Texas ranch.   Even in a strange story like this, some of the classic Cheney traits, such as secrecy, were on display. The story didn't come out for two days, and when it finally did, Cheney himself took days longer to speak about it, finally doing an interview with Fox News.   On Cheney's final day in office, he sat in a wheelchair, the result of an accident, bundled up against the frigid cold, and watched as President Barack Obama was sworn in.   \n   Out of office, he emerged as a frequent and outspoken critic of the Obama administration, even accusing the president of not understanding that the U.S. was at war.   In February 2010 he made a surprise appearance at CPAC, the conservative political action conference in Washington. The crowd erupted.   It was one of the last moments of big public adulation for Cheney. With the rise of Donald Trump, Cheney's brand of politics and his interventionist foreign policy fell out of favor in the party. Trump would often lambaste Cheney for launching what he called \"forever wars.\"   It carried into the next generation as Trump attacked Cheney's daughter, former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), when she voted for Trump's impeachment after a riot at the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.   Now Cheney has died, leaving a legacy in government service, foreign policy and the balance of power between the branches of government, and leaving a personal stamp on a presidency greater than any vice president before him.\n",

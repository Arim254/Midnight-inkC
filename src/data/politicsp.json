Johnson says the government shutdown is to blame, but he's facing accusations from both sides of the aisle that he's trying to avoid a vote to release the Jeffrey Epstein files. NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales has more.CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Arizona Congresswoman-elect Adelita Grijalva has keys to her office but not much else.ADELITA GRIJALVA: I have no staff. The phones don't work. There's no computer. We don't have a government email.GRISALES: Grijalva won her seat to represent the Tucson, Arizona, border district on September 23 but is still waiting to take the oath of office. Once she's seated, she plans to sign onto a bipartisan petition to release government files on the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Her signature is the last one needed to force a House vote.GRIJALVA: I remember on election night, someone came up to me and said, I don't think they're going to swear you in because of those Epstein files. And I thought, oh, my gosh, that's very much a conspiracy theory. Like, that's not going to happen. And here we are 22 days later.GRISALES: House Speaker Mike Johnson calls claims by Grijalva and others a partisan manufactured effort. He says Republicans are already working on releasing records through the GOP-led Oversight Committee.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE JOHNSON: The bulldogs in Congress are on that committee. And they're all joined together in a bipartisan fashion, digging through and releasing documents.GRISALES: Johnson says he will not swear in Grijalva until the government shutdown is over.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHNSON: This is the process of the House. You do it as soon as you're able to do it.GRISALES: But many in Arizona and beyond disagree, and the state's attorney general threatened legal action for the delays. Democrats have also taken to the House floor and Johnson's office, ramping up their demands this week.(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Swear her in, swear her in.GRISALES: Grijalva is the daughter of her predecessor. The late Raul Grijalva held the seat for more than 20 years until his death in March. She tears up when she considers what her dad would make of the fight over her swearing in.GRIJALVA: I think he would just be kind of laughing (laughter) and scratching his head at, like, my kid is doing, you know, making a splash. Yeah.GRISALES: Grijalva says her dad set a high bar in office with his constituents, one she hopes to follow when she's finally seated.Claudia Grisales, NPR News, the Capitol.(SOUNDBITE OF FAZER'S \"WHITE SEDAN\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

The president announced plans for another summit in Budapest in a social media post following a two-hour call where the two leaders discussed the war, trade and the Middle East.   \"At the conclusion of the call, we agreed that there will be a meeting of our High Level Advisors, next week,\" Trump wrote, noting that the meetings will be led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. He said a location will be determined.   \n   \"President Putin and I will then meet in an agreed upon location, Budapest, Hungary, to see if we can bring this 'inglorious' War, between Russia and Ukraine, to an end,\" he added.   \n   Trump boasted that \"great progress\" was made on the call and that he will be discussing it at his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday at the White House.   Trump and Zelensky are expected to discuss the possibility of the U.S. providing Ukraine with long-range missiles.   Trump was widely criticized following his last meeting with Putin over the summer. That summit, in Alaska, did not result in any significant steps toward ending the war. Trump traveled to Alaska calling for a ceasefire before backing down.    Trump also said after the summit that his team would be scheduling a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, which also never took place. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday that Trump still believes a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy is possible.    Asked whether conditions had changed to make a second meeting with Putin more successful, Leavitt said, \"I think the President is always willing to take a chance at a diplomacy.\"\n",

A watercolor rendition of the proposed arch posted online last month by architect Nicolas Leo Charbonneau of Harrison Design, and reposted by the president on his Truth Social account, shows a monument that bears strong aesthetic similarities to Paris' Arc de Triomphe and the Soldiers and Sailors' Memorial Arch in Brooklyn. (Wags have already dubbed the proposed monument from the former real estate developer the \"Arc de Trump.\") The renderings also evoke the neoclassical architectural style favored by George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.   \n   Journalists leaving an Oval Office event Wednesday asked the president who the proposed arch would be built for. He replied: \"Me.\"   On Wednesday evening, at a fundraising dinner in the East Room to benefit his planned $250 million ballroom addition to the White House, the president displayed three differently scaled models of the possible arch – the largest of which would appear to dwarf nearby iconic, existing structures, including the Lincoln Memorial.   \"Whichever one would look good. I happen to think the large one,\" he said.   The proposed arch, which is being discussed as a commemoration of the nation's 250th anniversary next year, would be located in a traffic circle between Arlington National Cemetery and the Lincoln Memorial.   The design of any new federal building or memorial is supposed to be approved by the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, which is currently closed due to the government shutdown.   NPR reached out for comment to the White House, including regarding the CFA's potential involvement and a timeline for construction. The White House referred NPR back to the president's comments at the Oval Office and the fundraising dinner on Wednesday.   Additional reporting by Elizabeth Blair.\n",

In the last few weeks alone, prosecutors secured indictments against former FBI Director Jim Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. The White House has signaled more cases may be on the way.   \n   For those defendants, the costs of fighting criminal charges in a high-profile case are enormous, and they can reverberate for years, according to veteran attorneys who represent people in the headlines.   Lisa Wayne has tried 150 cases before juries in the course of her decades-long career. Wayne, now executive director of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said there's \"no golden rule\" when it comes to how expensive the legal bills might be.   The cost depends on what charges a person faces, where they live, how experienced their lawyer is and whether that person needs to hire experts in advance of trial, she said.   \n   \"Most people have to figure out, out of pocket,\" Wayne said. \"And figure out, do they have the savings? Do they have friends and family that can help them? Do they take mortgages on their homes? It can be a very stressful situation for most individuals.\"   Three other longtime criminal lawyers put the estimate at between $1 million and $5 million at a small law firm, to $25 million or more at a large one.   Trump himself spoke about some $100 million in legal fees that he faced after his first term in office, for indictments in two federal cases and state charges in New York and Georgia.   \n   Help from former trial partner or a defense fund   Comey, a former deputy U.S. attorney general and longtime federal prosecutor, turned to his former trial partner for help. Patrick Fitzgerald, who famously led the U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago and went on to a lucrative partnership at the Skadden law firm, came out of retirement to help defend Comey.   In private practice, Fitzgerald likely commanded more than $2,000 an hour for his legal work. Now, he's able to set his own rates and may be working not quite for free, but nowhere near full price.   \n   Then there's Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California. Schiff is a longtime critic who helped investigate Trump during the president's first term in office. Now, Schiff is under investigation for alleged mortgage fraud.   \n   Trump took note in recent remarks from the Oval Office. \"Looks like Adam Schiff really did a bad thing. They have him. Now let's see what happens.\"   The key issue is that Schiff owns homes in both California and Maryland, closer to the U.S. Congress. Schiff's allies have said he accurately filled out mortgage paperwork and consulted with lawyers during that process.   His attorney, Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney in Manhattan, called the allegations of wrongdoing \"transparently false, stale and long debunked.\"   Even so, Schiff created a legal defense fund in August to help cover the legal bills.   The White House said the Justice Department is on the right track with its prosecutions. \"The Trump administration will continue to deliver the truth to the American people while restoring integrity and accountability to our justice system,\" said spokeswoman Abigail Jackson.   \"They should be people that are shamed\"   A driving force behind all these investigations is Ed Martin, a lawyer from Missouri with more experience in politics than in the courtroom. Martin could not win Senate confirmation to serve as U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., after lawmakers expressed concern about his support for people who rioted at the U.S. Capitol nearly five years ago.   \n   Instead, Martin moved to lead a Weaponization Working Group focused on people who have run afoul of Trump.   \"There are some really bad actors, some people that did some really bad things to the American people,\" Martin told reporters as he started his new post. \"And if they can be charged, we'll charge them. But if they can't be charged, we will name them. And in a culture that respects shame, they should be people that are shamed.\"   That's not the way Justice Department policy has worked in the past. Prosecutors are not supposed to speak ill of people they lack enough evidence to charge with crimes — or about those who haven't been charged yet.   \n   \"I can't imagine anything more stressful than being accused by the government and carrying the weight of that as an individual in this country,\" said Wayne, of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.   Where to go \"to get my reputation back?\"   Even if a defendant wins an acquittal, they've been through the wringer, facing emotional pressure on themselves and their entire family.   Consider D.C. lawyer Michael Sussmann. He was investigated by a special counsel in connection with his work for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. A jury in D.C. found him not guilty of making a false statement to the FBI after a two-week trial in 2022.   \n   Outside the courthouse following his victory, Sussman sounded exhausted.   \"Despite being falsely accused, I'm relieved that justice ultimately prevailed in my case,\" he said. \"As you can imagine, this has been a difficult year for my family and me.\"   Back in the 1980s, the former labor secretary under President Ronald Reagan faced fraud charges — only to be found not guilty by a jury.   Raymond Donovan responded: \"Which office do I go to to get my reputation back?\"\n",

The races are often seen as a test of voter sentiment, but just weeks out from the election, two late-emerging issues in Virginia may be reshaping that state's contest.   Abigail Spanberger, a former member of Congress, is the Democratic candidate, and Winsome Earle-Sears, the Republican candidate, is the commonwealth's current lieutenant governor.   Democrats are hopeful that history may be on their side. The party in power in the White House typically loses the race for governor in Virginia. That trend, plus frustrations over the government shutdown and the Trump administration's effect on the state's large federal workforce, could propel them over the finish line.   \n   Meanwhile, Republicans may have received a boost from reporting on violent text messages sent in 2022 by the Democratic candidate for attorney general, first published in the National Review.   The stakes of the election are high. Governors have become key figures in either supporting the Trump administration's policies or opposing them. The parties' successes or failures at the top of the ticket are likely to impact down-ballot races.   Democrats focus on the economy and the federal workforce    \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Democratic candidate for governor, former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, addresses a small get-out-the-vote rally on the first day of early voting outside the Eastern Government Center on Sept. 19, 2025, in Henrico, Va.\n                \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   In the one-and-only candidate debate in the race, Spanberger highlighted the rising cost of living in Virginia and voter anxiety over the Trump administration's cuts to the federal workforce, themes her campaign has hammered for months.   That's for good reason: federal cuts are having a significant impact in Virginia, home to about 320,000 federal workers, and many others who work on federal contracts. During the government shutdown, many workers are feeling the squeeze through furloughs or working without pay.   And since July, about 11,000 Virginia-based federal jobs have been lost, according data from the University of Virginia's Weldon Cooper Center for Public Policy. That doesn't include laid-off federal workers who live in Virginia but work in D.C.   The Trump administration's decision to lay off thousands more federal workers during the shutdown, a move now paused in court, has put many Virginia Democrats in a mood to fight. At a town hall earlier this month in Northern Virginia, dozens of federal workers and contractors told Congressman Suhas Subramanyam, a Democrat, they wanted him to continue the shutdown and stand up to Republicans in Washington. After the event, several voters told NPR they were feeling motivated to participate in the Virginia election.   \n   \"There's not much I can do on a federal level, but on a state level, I do have some influence,\" said Marsha Peltz. She said her son lost his job in the federal government in the spring. \"So I'm encouraging my neighbors, please go out and vote, please volunteer.\"   The upheavals in government employment and contracting have created a \"very, very damaging environment for Republicans\" in the Virginia November election, said Stephen Farnsworth, a professor of political science at the University of Mary Washington. Spanberger, he noted, has led in most public polling by close to 10 points throughout the race.   \"A year ago, the economy was a great benefit to Republicans when they could talk about the Biden economy,\" Farnsworth said. \"But a year later, with a Republican governor and a Republican president, the Democrats are the ones who have the advantage in the economic conversation.\"   Spanberger is doing all she can to capitalize on the moment, calling out Earle-Sears for continuing to seek Trump's endorsement.   \"My opponent refused to call on President Trump to stop this chaos. Virginians saw with their own eyes that Winsome Earle-Sears' loyalty to Donald Trump will always come first, no matter the cost to Virginians and their families,\" the Spanberger campaign said in a statement after news of a fresh wave of federal layoffs broke. \"That's not leadership — that's betraying the people of Virginia who she was elected to serve.\"   Earle-Sears has been broadly supportive of Trump's cuts to the federal workforce. She says the commonwealth should be able to weather the job losses because of the Youngkin administration's focus on job creation in the private sector. She has criticized Spanberger for not calling on Virginia Democrats in Congress to end the shutdown.   \"So my opponent, all summer long, has been playing political football with federal workers by trying to say that she loves them more than anyone else,\" Earle-Sears said on the debate stage. \"Let me tell you what love looks like. It looks like Abigail calling Senators Kaine and Warner and telling them, 'Go back, do your job, and vote against a government shutdown.' \"   \n   Republicans decry violent text messages   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Virginia Republican candidate for governor, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, arrives on stage before addressing supporters during a primary night rally at the Hippodrome Theater on June 17, in Richmond, Va.\n                \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Win McNamee/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   The Earle-Sears campaign is seeking to capitalize on news of a series of violent text messages from Democratic candidate for Attorney General Jay Jones. In the messages, which were sent to a Republican member of the House of Delegates in 2022, Jones describes the then-Republican speaker of the House of Delegates hypothetically being shot in the head with two bullets. The National Review reported Jones also said he wanted the Republican's children to die in order to compel him to move on policy. Jones has apologized for what he said in the messages, expressed remorse and said the messages were unacceptable   Virginia Republicans say the scandal is an indicator of what they believe is Democrats' tolerance for political violence, a potent argument to energize conservative voters still reeling from the assassination of right-wing political activist Charlie Kirk.   \"It's going to fire up a whole lot of infrequent, probably right-of-center to conservative voters that are not Republican consistent voters,\" said Zack Roday, a partner at Republican-leaning strategic communications firm Ascent Media.   Virginia Republicans, President Trump, and multiple law enforcement associations have called for Jones to drop out. Spanberger and other prominent Democrats have condemned the messages, but have not said he should leave the race.   Early voting is well underway, with more than 400,000 votes cast.   Roday said the issue also calls into question Spanberger's leadership and principles.   \"This is a crisis for Democrats to handle, and they have no answer for it,\" he said.   At the gubernatorial debate, Spanberger repeated her condemnation of the messages but refused to retract her endorsement of Jones, saying Jones is running his own race and voters should decide what to do with the information.   It's not clear yet how significantly the news could impact the top-of-the-ticket contest, though Republicans are doing all they can to ensure that it will. The Earle-Sears campaign is now running ads tying Spanberger to Jones, featuring a clip of Spanberger telling a group of supporters to \"let your rage fuel you\" — a quote she has used on the stump as part of a larger call to supporters to volunteer for her campaign. The Republican ad concludes, \"Reject insanity. Vote Republican.\"   \n   Debate over transgender students in public schools   Roday also pointed to \"a narrative shift\" in the race as Earle-Sears has ramped up calls to ban transgender students from girls' sports, bathrooms, and locker rooms in public schools. She's criticized Spanberger for supporting \"boys and men in girls' spaces\" and showed up at school board meetings in blue school districts in Northern Virginia to protest gender-expansive policies.   \"We, as women, want our private spaces. There's nothing hard about that,\" Earle-Sears told reporters following an appearance at a Moms for Liberty event in Fairfax County.   That message is appealing to voters like Ursula Baukol, a self-described \"moderate conservative\" and federal contractor who attended the gathering.   \"It just seems that now there's more of a push … of the schools to over-insert themselves in the whole sort of sexuality issues,\" she told NPR. She said she believes Virginia schools are sharing content about sexuality and gender too early.   Spanberger has called for the state government to stay out of decisions about who uses what bathrooms and locker rooms, arguing that's best left up to parents, teachers, students, and their school districts. While she's generally avoided transgender issues on the campaign trail, she's also sought to portray Earle-Sears' record on same-sex marriage as out of step with Virginians' support for marriage equality. At the debate, Spanberger brought up written comments from Earle-Sears expressing that she was \"morally opposed\" to same-sex marriage.   \"That's not discrimination!\" Earle-Sears responded. Her campaign said afterward that she believes marriage equality to be \"settled law.\"   Focusing on transgender students may help with Republican turnout, but it's not clear how important it is to voters overall. Virginia voters tend to agree with Earle-Sears about girls' spaces, but they put the debate far down on the list of top issues in the race, according to polling from The Washington Post and George Mason University. The economy claimed the top spot.\n",

    "body": "\n      The rising cost of housing has driven some New York City residents to leave the Big Apple. For those who remain, affordable housing has become a top issue in the race for mayor.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  New York City has always been expensive, and affordability has become the dominant issue in the city's mayoral race. Rents and home prices are now so high, more low and middle-income residents are leaving the city. David Brand from member station WNYC reports.DAVID BRAND, BYLINE: Juleah Jorge (ph) has spent her whole life in the northern reaches of the Bronx.(SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS CRUNCHING)JULEAH JORGE: Hi.BRAND: Hey, how are you?JORGE: I'm OK. How are you?BRAND: I'm good, thanks.A few years ago, she and her 7-year-old daughter moved into a new apartment on a tree-lined block near where she grew up. She loves it.JORGE: We came out of the house yesterday morning to go to school and it was raining leaves. It was like something out of a movie. It was so pretty.BRAND: But Jorge worries she won't be able to stay. She uses a federal housing voucher to help cover rent, but the program is about to expire. She says she can't afford another place.JORGE: It's very, very expensive. Like, one bedrooms are, like, $3,000 now.BRAND: She says her friends and family are already leaving the city.JORGE: I know people who are going to North Carolina. I know people who are going to Connecticut. I know people who are going to Jersey.BRAND: Most New Yorkers can relate. Rents are reaching absurd heights. In Manhattan, median rent for a two-bedroom is now $5,600 a month, according to listing site StreetEasy. Nathan Gusdorf is executive director of the Fiscal Policy Institute and says it's hurting the city's future.NATHAN GUSDORF: Increasing the affordability is really essential to the long-term population growth and economic growth of the city as a whole.BRAND: Four years ago, a spike in crime and public safety concerns defined the mayor's race and helped carry former cop Eric Adams to victory. But Adams dropped his reelection campaign last month. This time around, it's all about affordability.(SOUNDBITE OF PROTESTERS)UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: Freeze the rent. Freeze the rent. Freeze the rent.BRAND: Zohran Mamdani rallied in the Bronx to tout his affordability plans earlier this month. Mamdani was a little-known state assembly member when he announced his candidacy last year, but he rocketed to victory in the Democratic primary by pledging to freeze rents for tenants in a million regulated apartments. He says rising costs are driving people away.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ZOHRAN MAMDANI: It's the number one reason that New Yorkers are becoming residents of Jersey City, of Pennsylvania, of Connecticut, 'cause they cannot afford this city.BRAND: Mamdani is also pledging to make child care free for families and he wants the government to fund or finance 200,000 new apartments priced for low and middle-income renters. Some of his policy plans require state approval and won't come cheap for taxpayers, but he says they're worth it.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MAMDANI: There is an anxiety that many live with, not knowing if the struggle that they're in that - right now is going to get even worse.BRAND: Winning the Democratic nomination usually guarantees victory in the general election in deep blue New York City. But this year is different. Former Democratic governor Andrew Cuomo is running as a centrist independent with a focus on streamlining new construction by coordinating with developers, labor unions and city agencies. He wants to build new homes much faster.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ANDREW CUOMO: Affordable housing is a crisis because it will stop the young people from coming.BRAND: Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa says the solution is lifting costly regulations for landlords and lowering property taxes.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CURTIS SLIWA: I'm the only candidate who says, we've got to across the board cut the taxes or the flight will continue.BRAND: Last year, the city changed zoning rules to allow for more new housing. But those early efforts will take years to put a dent in the affordability crisis. Back at her Bronx apartment, Juleah Jorge says her true goal is to buy her own multi-family home so she can lease an apartment to a low-income family.JORGE: I want to be the change that I want to see. So I'm hoping that one day I get to that point where I can do that.BRAND: She hopes the next mayor's policies help make that dream a reality.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Steve Inskeep speaks with Sen. Chris Coons, D- Del., about the ongoing government shutdown and what he's hearing from federal workers in his state.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  We've been reaching out to members of both parties about what it will take to get a funding bill passed. And this morning, we speak with Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee. Senator, welcome back.CHRIS COONS: Thanks, Steve. Great to be on with you.INSKEEP: What are you hearing from federal workers in your state now that we're this far in?COONS: I'm hearing alarm that they're not getting paid, and they don't know when or if they'll be laid off in a politically motivated reduction in force. As Andrea just reported, a federal judge in California has already ruled in a temporary injunction that these politically motivated layoffs led by President Trump and his OMB director should not go forward because they're illegal. You can't use politics to decide who ought to be fired from the federal workforce.INSKEEP: Now, Senator, early in the shutdown, we got a sense that at least some, maybe many federal workers were fatalistic about this. They felt the government was being overrun anyway, that many of them were getting fired anyway, and so the shutdown might as well come. That was one of the opinions that we heard reflected. I'm sure there are many opinions among federal workers. But now that we're more than two weeks in and people are missing paychecks, do you think federal workers still feel that way?COONS: Well, we're in Week 3 of this Republican shutdown because Trump and Thune and Johnson won't come to the table and stop health care costs from skyrocketing next month for millions of Americans. Most of the federal workers I've talked to have said, look, folks have been laid off, off and on this year, back to DOGE in the beginning of the year...INSKEEP: Sure.COONS: ...When Trump handed Elon Musk the keys to randomly lay off people and shut down sections of the government. They feel like we should make a stand and insist on a negotiation with Republicans to avoid...INSKEEP: And you think they still think that...COONS: ...Huge increases in health care costs.INSKEEP: And you think they still feel that way now that they're missing paychecks?COONS: Well, the other thing that's going on here is that President Trump is not following the law in terms of making it clear everyone will get paid when we reopen. That's according to a law that Trump himself signed in his first term. I'll remind you, the last shutdown was the last time Trump was president. There is a path forward here and it has to do with working together to get an extension to the Affordable Care Act that would allow it to keep being affordable for millions of Americans.INSKEEP: Well, I'm glad you're talking about an extension because yesterday we had a Republican on the program, Mike Lawler of New York. And he said something about a one-year extension that he wishes more lawmakers would sign on to. Let's listen to some of that.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)MIKE LAWLER: If you want to solve an issue like the Obamacare subsidies that Democrats put in place for four years and were slated to expire at the end of this year - they knew that they were slated to expire. They passed the bill. And so I have already signed onto legislation to extend the subsidies by a year. And that was part of my point to Hakeem Jeffries. If you're serious about this, if this is the issue you claim it is, then why won't you sign onto this bill with me?INSKEEP: OK, one-year extension. Is there room to make some progress there?COONS: Yes, a one-year extension would avoid significant pain next month for millions of Americans, but it won't do that much. The best path forward would be to reform and extend these tax credits for multiple years because the insurance markets, Steve, don't just work on one year. If the insurance companies that provide Affordable Care Act support for millions of Americans only know they've got a temporary reprieve, they're still going to price in that uncertainty.INSKEEP: Senator...COONS: Here's the bigger point.INSKEEP: Go on.COONS: President Trump ran on lowering costs and making America healthy again. He's not engaging in this. And we need to work together to make Americans healthier and reduce their costs. Right now, Trump is spending more time trying to bail out Argentina than he is trying to reduce health care costs for Americans.INSKEEP: He is talking of bailing out Argentina. I want to ask one follow-up, though, about these tax credits. Republicans have made an interesting point. They've said the tax credits are necessary for people to be able to afford health insurance because health insurance costs keep going up and up because, they say, Obamacare is a failure. It failed to hold down costs, which is one of the goals. In about 30 seconds, is that a failure?COONS: I don't think it is a failure. I do think there's bipartisan things we could do to reduce health care costs, for example, PBR reform. But we need to work together, and we can't do that only after Democrats agree to keep moving forward. Republicans are raising health care costs, and we need them to come to the table with a concrete path forward for avoiding that.INSKEEP: And just to be clear, as a yes or no answer, are there any negotiations going on right now that you know of?COONS: There's conversations but not with the leadership, not with President Trump or Leader Thune or Speaker Johnson.INSKEEP: Got it. Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, thanks very much, as always.COONS: Thank you, Steve.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

U.S. forces have destroyed at least five boats since early September, killing 27 people, and four of those vessels originated from Venezuela.   Asked during an event in the Oval Office on Wednesday why he had authorized the CIA to take action in Venezuela, Trump affirmed he had made the move.   \n   \"I authorized for two reasons, really,\" Trump replied. \"No. 1, they have emptied their prisons into the United States of America,\" he said. \"And the other thing, the drugs, we have a lot of drugs coming in from Venezuela, and a lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in through the sea.\"   Trump added the administration \"is looking at land\" as it considers further strikes in the region. He declined to say whether the CIA has authority to take action against President Nicolás Maduro.   Trump made the unusual acknowledgement of a CIA operation shortly after The New York Times published that the CIA had been authorized to carry out covert action in Venezuela.   Maduro pushes back   On Wednesday, Maduro lashed out at the record of the U.S. spy agency in various conflicts around the world without directly addressing Trump's comments about authorizing the CIA to carry out covert operations in Venezuela.   \"No to regime change that reminds us so much of the (overthrows) in the failed eternal wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and so on,\" Maduro said at a televised event of the National Council for Sovereignty and Peace, which is made up of representatives from various political, economic, academic and cultural sectors in Venezuela.   \n   \"No to the coups carried out by the CIA, which remind us so much of the 30,000 disappeared,\" a figure estimated by human rights organizations such as the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo during the military dictatorship in Argentina (1976-1983). He also referred to the 1973 coup in Chile.   \"How long will the CIA continue to carry on with its coups? Latin America doesn't want them, doesn't need them and repudiates them,\" Maduro added.   The objective is \"to say no to war in the Caribbean, no to war in South America, yes to peace,\" he said.   \n   Speaking in English, Maduro said: \"Not war, yes peace, not war. Is that how you would say it? Who speaks English? Not war, yes peace, the people of the United States, please. Please, please, please.\"   In a statement, Venezuela's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday rejected \"the bellicose and extravagant statements by the President of the United States, in which he publicly admits to having authorized operations to act against the peace and stability of Venezuela.\"   \"This unprecedented statement constitutes a very serious violation of international law and the United Nations' Charter and obliges the community of countries to denounce these clearly immoderate and inconceivable statements,\" said the statement, which Foreign Minister Yván Gil posted on his Telegram channel.   Resistance from Congress   Early this month, the Trump administration declared drug cartels to be unlawful combatants and pronounced the United States is now in an \"armed conflict\" with them, justifying the military action as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States.   The move has spurred anger in Congress from members of both major political parties that Trump was effectively committing an act of war without seeking congressional authorization.   On Wednesday, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said while she supports cracking down on trafficking, the administration has gone too far.   \n   \"The Trump administration's authorization of covert C.I.A. action, conducting lethal strikes on boats and hinting at land operations in Venezuela slides the United States closer to outright conflict with no transparency, oversight or apparent guardrails,\" Shaheen said. \"The American people deserve to know if the administration is leading the U.S. into another conflict, putting servicemembers at risk or pursuing a regime-change operation.\"   The Trump administration has yet to provide underlying evidence to lawmakers proving that the boats targeted by the U.S. military were in fact carrying narcotics, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the matter.   The officials, who were not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the administration has only pointed to unclassified video clips of the strikes posted on social media by Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and has yet to produce \"hard evidence\" that the vessels were carrying drugs.   \n   Lawmakers have expressed frustration that the administration is offering little detail about how it came to decide the U.S. is in armed conflict with cartels or which criminal organizations it claims are \"unlawful combatants.\"   Even as the U.S. military has carried out strikes on some vessels, the U.S. Coast Guard has continued with its typical practice of stopping boats and seizing drugs.   Trump on Wednesday explained away the action, saying the traditional approach hasn't worked.   \"Because we've been doing that for 30 years, and it has been totally ineffective. They have faster boats,\" he said. \"They're world-class speedboats, but they're not faster than missiles.\"   Human rights groups have raised concerns that the strikes flout international law and are extrajudicial killings.\n",

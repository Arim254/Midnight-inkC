On Tuesday, 18 Democratic governors also announced they would boycott a traditional dinner at the White House.   \"If the reports are true that not all governors are invited to these events, which have historically been productive and bipartisan opportunities for collaboration, we will not be attending the White House dinner this year,\" the Democrats wrote. \"Democratic governors remain united and will never stop fighting to protect and make life better for people in our states.\"   \n   Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican who chairs the NGA, told fellow governors in a letter on Monday that the White House intended to limit invitations to the association's annual business meeting, scheduled for Feb. 20, to Republican governors only.   \"Because NGA's mission is to represent all 55 governors, the Association is no longer serving as the facilitator for that event, and it is no longer included in our official program,\" Stitt wrote in the letter, which was obtained by The Associated Press.   The governors' group, which is scheduled to meet from Feb. 19-21, is one of the few remaining venues where political leaders from both major parties gather to discuss the top issues facing their communities. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday that Trump has \"discretion to invite anyone he wants to the White House.\"   \"It's the people's house,\" she said. \"It's also the president's home, so he can invite whomever he wants to dinners and events here at the White House.\"   Representatives for Sitt and the NGA didn't comment on the letter. Brandon Tatum, the NGA's CEO, said in a statement last week that the White House meeting is an \"important tradition\" and said the organization was \"disappointed in the administration's decision to make it a partisan occasion this year.\"   \n   In his letter to other governors, Stitt encouraged the group to unite around common goals.   \"We cannot allow one divisive action to achieve its goal of dividing us,\" he wrote. \"The solution is not to respond in kind, but to rise above and to remain focused on our shared duty to the people we serve. America's governors have always been models of pragmatic leadership, and that example is most important when Washington grows distracted by politics.\"   Signs of partisan tensions emerged at the White House meeting last year, when Trump and Maine's Gov. Janet Mills traded barbs.   \n   Trump singled out the Democratic governor over his push to bar transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women's sports, threatening to withhold federal funding from the state if she did not comply. Mills responded, \"We'll see you in court.\"   Trump then predicted that Mills' political career would be over for opposing the order. She is now running for U.S. Senate.   The back-and-forth had a lasting impact on last year's conference and some Democratic governors did not renew their dues last year to the bipartisan group.\n",

Mikie Sherrill.   \"I congratulate Analilia Mejia on her hard won victory in the NJ-11 special primary. I look forward to supporting her in the April general election,\" Malinowski said in a statement.   The Associated Press has not yet made a call in the race. Last Thursday, Mejia led by a narrow margin as polls closed in the district. Some mail-in ballots remain to be counted.    \n   The Democratic nominee will face Randolph Township Mayor Joe Hathaway, the only Republican to run, in the special general election to replace Sherrill. Sherrill resigned from her seat shortly after winning the gubernatorial race last November.   The special primary contest is one of the first elections in the 2026 midterm cycle where Democrats hope to capitalize on voter dissatisfaction with President Trump's second-term agenda. After losing the White House and the Senate in 2024, the party earned numerous victories in special elections and saw a surge of support in the 2025 November general election, including Sherrill's landslide victory.   Malinowski's comeback bid was supported by New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim, who touted the two-term congressman's experience.   \n   \"Tom Malinowski knows the House of Representatives. He knows Congress. He knows New Jersey,\" Kim said in a video. \"He knows how to be able to stand up to Donald Trump, and that's what I need right now is someone there as a partner with me in the Capitol.\"   Malinowski represented a neighboring congressional seat from 2018-2022, but lost to Republican Rep. Thomas Kean Jr. after redistricting added more Republicans into his district.   Malinowski's prior experience in Congress was an important factor in the lead-up to this race, says Micah Rasmussen, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University.   \"With a short runway of a special election  — name recognition, money, experience — all can matter,\" he said.   \n   But Mejia, director of the New Jersey Working Families Alliance, was endorsed by several progressive groups and politicians including independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Locally, she received the endorsement of Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark, New Jersey's largest city.   \"In a moment of rising authoritarianism, of economic insecurity, of state-sanctioned violence, any old blue just won't do,\" Mejia said at the event with Sanders. \"If you send weak sauce to Congress, we will get weak sauce back.\"   \n   Mejia has also called for the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.   \"You can't reform that. It's not fixable,\" she said at a January event at William Paterson University. \"Get it out. Kick it over. It is done. Forget it.\"   Immigration enforcement became a dominant theme of discussion among candidates in the primary, heightened by the fatal shootings of Nicole Macklin Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minnesota.   The latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll finds 65% of Americans feel that ICE has \"gone too far\" in enforcing immigration laws, with a growing number of independents and Democrats sharing that sentiment.   For his part, Malinowski faced attacks from a super PAC aligned with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) over a 2019 vote for a bipartisan Department of Homeland Security funding bill. But he has been outspoken about the Trump administration's recent immigration tactics and a desire to \"defund ICE's brutality.\"   Earlier this month, Patrick Dorton, a spokesperson for the super PAC, United Democracy Project told The New York Times, \"Tom Malinowski is talking about conditioning aid to Israel,\" adding, \"That's not a pro-Israel position.\"   In the statement congratulating Mejia Tuesday, Malinowski decried the \"massive flood of dark money that AIPAC spent on dishonest ads during the last three weeks,\" adding that he supports Israel as a \"democratic and Jewish state.\"   In response to Malinowski's statement, AIPAC spokesperson Deryn Sousa said Tuesday that the organization \"will be very active this election cycle supporting Democrats and Republicans who strengthen the U.S.-Israel partnership and opposing those—of either party—who may seek to undermine it.\"\n",

The affidavit, written by FBI Special Agent Hugh Raymond Evans, led to a judge signing off on a search warrant of Fulton County's elections hub, just outside Atlanta. The FBI executed that search warrant on Jan. 28, seizing more than 650 boxes of ballots and other 2020 election materials.   The affidavit relies on misleading and already-disproven claims about the 2020 election. Fulton County's 2020 ballots were counted three separate times, with the results affirmed.   \n   \"This warrant application is part of an FBI criminal investigation into whether any of the improprieties were intentional acts that violated federal criminal laws,\" the affidavit reads. \"The FBI criminal investigation originated from a referral sent by Kurt Olsen, Presidentially appointed Director of Election Security and Integrity.\"   \n   Olsen played an integral role in Trump's failed efforts to overturn his narrow 2020 election defeat by challenging the results in Georgia and other swing states.   The White House did not respond to NPR's questions Tuesday about Olsen's role in the administration.   The FBI investigation, according to the affidavit, is focused on five \"deficiencies or defects\" with the election and the subsequent tabulation.   But those claims include allegations that have been investigated and unsubstantiated by state officials, including claims about missing scanned images of ballots, though state law at the time did not require counties to maintain them as records.   Republican Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state who resisted Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state, was critical of the probe. Raffensperger is now running for governor.    \"As Secretary of State, I've made Georgia the safest and most secure place to vote,\" he said in a statement. \"Instead of wasting time and tax dollars trying to change the past with baseless and repackaged claims, let's focus our efforts on building a safer, more affordable future for all hardworking Georgians.\"   \n   In a statement, David Becker, a former Justice Department official who's now executive director of the Center for Election Information & Research, called the affidavit \"much weaker than I suspected.\"   \"After more than five years, dozens of court cases, and over a year in total control of the federal government, this is all they've got?\" he said. \"If taken at its word, this entire affidavit at most alleges human error after a late night during a global pandemic, all of which had no impact on the outcome of the race.\"   The affidavit also does not mention any evidence or suspicion of foreign election interference, raising more questions about the presence of Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard at the site of the raid.   In a letter to Democratic lawmakers last week, after the search, Gabbard defended her role in investigating election security. She also confirmed that she \"facilitated a brief phone call for the President to thank the [Atlanta-area FBI] agents personally for their work.\" The call was first reported by The New York Times. Gabbard said Trump \"did not ask any questions, nor did he or I issue any directives.\"   Trump and his allies have continued to focus on the 2020 election and falsely claim he was victorious while also taking extraordinary steps to exert federal control over future voting, including suing states to try to obtain unredacted voter rolls and suggesting that Republicans \"nationalize\" elections.\n",

Bondi's appearance before the House Judiciary Committee comes one year into her tenure atop the Justice Department, a tumultuous period marked by a striking departure from the traditions and norms that have guided the department for decades.      Watch the hearing, set for 10 a.m. ET Wednesday, live:   \n      Since taking the helm, Bondi has overseen the firing of career prosecutors and FBI officials who worked on Capitol riot cases or Trump investigations, investigated and prosecuted prominent opponents of the president, and dropped prosecutions of his allies.   The changes also extend to the department's workforce. The section that prosecutes public corruption has been gutted; the Civil Rights Division, which protects the constitutional rights of all Americans, has seen a mass exodus of career attorneys; and some U.S. attorney's offices — including most recently the one in Minnesota — have been hit by resignations.   In her public appearances, Bondi, who is a former Florida attorney general, has defended the department's actions and sought to tout what she says are major accomplishments — going after cartels and violent crime and helping in the administration's immigration enforcement.   She also says she's made \"tremendous progress\" toward ending what she says was the department's weaponization in recent years against Trump and conservatives. Biden-era DOJ officials deny they politicized the department, and they point to the prosecutions of prominent Democratic lawmakers and even President Joe Biden's son Hunter as evidence.   \n   Accusations of politicization at DOJ   For decades, the Justice Department has enjoyed a degree of independence from the White House, particularly in investigations and prosecutions, to insulate them from partisan politics.   Critics say that under Bondi, that independence has disappeared and the Justice Department has helped enact Trump's promised campaign of retribution against his perceived enemies.   Last year, for example, the president openly directed Bondi to go after former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James — two high-profile political adversaries of the president.   \"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" Trump said in a social media post addressed to Bondi. \"They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\"   Days after that, a new acting U.S. attorney hand-picked by Trump secured an indictment against Comey, overruling career prosecutors who had doubts about the strength of the evidence.   A few weeks later, that same prosecutor secured an indictment against James.   Both cases have since been tossed by a federal judge, who found that the prosecutor was unlawfully appointed. The Justice Department is appealing that decision.   Other perceived opponents of the president or individuals standing in the way of his agenda have also found themselves under DOJ investigation, including Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff and former Obama-era intelligence officials James Clapper and John Brennan.   \n   Despite the uproar from DOJ veterans and many legal experts, Bondi still enjoys Trump's support — publicly, at least — as well as the backing of Republican lawmakers.   She has faced criticism from some Republicans, however, over her handling of the files of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The criticism has been focused on the department's failure to meet the deadline to release all of the Epstein files, as required by law, as well as the heavy redactions to many of the documents.\n",

Democrats, and some Republicans, on the House Homeland Security Committee on Tuesday took the opportunity to criticize the tactics used by officers on the ground and the strategy of top Trump administration officials to curb illegal migration.   The criticism came as congressional funding is set to expire on Friday for the Homeland Security Department — the department that houses Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection and Citizenship and Immigration Services.   \n   The hearing underscored how deeply divided Republicans and Democrats remain on top-level changes to immigration enforcement in the wake of the shootings. It suggested Congress is inching closer to another stopgap bill to fund the department in the absence of deeper agreement.   \n   Here are some other takeaways from the hearing:   1. Deaths of two U.S. citizens stay top of mind   Both Republicans and Democrats discussed the deaths of Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti, the 37-year-olds killed by DHS officers in two separate incidents.   Rep. Andrew Garbarino, N.Y., the Republican chairman of the committee, called the deaths, as well as increased violent rhetoric generally, \"unacceptable and preventable.\"   \"The safety of law enforcement and the communities they serve and protect must always come first. When officials or elected leaders rush to conclusions about law enforcement, or their fellow Americans, public trust suffers,\" Garbarino said in his opening remarks, calling for a \"complete\" investigation.   \"I cannot put myself in the shoes of law enforcement, nor can I imagine what the families of Ms. Good and Mr. Pretti are enduring today,\" he said.   \n   But ICE acting Director Todd Lyons — who hasn't been confirmed by the Senate yet — deflected questions regarding the deaths. He said he would \"not comment on any ongoing investigations.\"   He also sought to deflect criticism of President Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for labeling Pretti as a \"domestic terrorist,\" saying as elected or appointed officials, \"that's their right to their comments.\"   But Lyons, in response to Democrats' questions, did emphasize that U.S. citizens shouldn't be caught up in immigration enforcement.   \n   \"ICE officers and special agents are trained in the Immigration and Nationality Act, so anyone that is here legally or lawfully or a US citizen should not be concerned about being deported or detained,\" Lyons said. He later drew a distinction between someone being \"arrested\" – which he acknowledged could happen to a U.S. citizen — and being \"detained\" on a longer basis.   NPR witnessed multiple instances in Minnesota where immigration agents drove around Minneapolis and questioned people about their immigration status, with the state's attorney general saying U.S. citizens were detained.   The detention of U.S. citizens has also happened under prior administrations. A 2021 Government Accountability Office report found that over a five-year period, U.S. citizens had encounters with immigration officers that could lead to their arrest and even deportation.   2. Bipartisan questions about training and internal oversight   ICE and CBP officials broke down training and resources available to officers, in response to repeated questions about how officers are treating U.S. citizens and others.   Lyons said that officers undergo three months of training, which includes 47 days at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Academy in Georgia. Law enforcement officers and special agents who were certified in the past got to have a shorter training module, focused on just topics like the Immigration and Nationality Act.   \"They would have to go through the rigorous immigration training, which, unfortunately ... immigration law is just as confusing and long as [the] tax code,\" Lyons said.   \n   Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., asked Lyons how many ICE officers have been fired for their conduct. Lyons declined to comment on personnel matters.   But Lyons did denounce some of the language immigration officers were caught using on video. For example, in a video shared on social media after Pretti's death, an officer can be heard telling a woman: \"if you raise your voice, I will erase your voice.\"   When asked about the footage, Lyons said he hadn't seen it but said ICE \"does respect and adhere to the First Amendment\" and that the statement heard in the video \"doesn't represent the values of the men and women of ICE.\"   \n   3. Republicans share some concerns with Democrats   Republicans voiced concern about two issues that Democrats have frequently raised: roving patrols and the use of body cameras.   Under the second Trump administration, CBP, which houses the Border Patrol agency, has taken a leading role in enforcing federal immigration laws in the interior of the country, rather than strictly near the borders.   \n   In response to widespread criticism of the events in Minneapolis, Trump removed Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino from serving as the public face of the immigration presence there, replacing him with White House border czar Tom Homan. Trump later said in an interview that \"maybe we can use a little bit of a softer touch\" when it comes to immigration enforcement.   GOP Rep. Michael McCaul, Texas, said he believed \"roving patrols should be done at the border rather than in the major cities of the United States.\" He also applauded the leadership changes in Minneapolis as \"returning to the original mission of ICE.\"   Lawmakers from both parties have also pushed for greater use of body cameras to aid in oversight of agents' actions on the ground.   Lyons said that ICE had 3,000 cameras for 13,000 officers and Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Rodney Scott noted that only half of 20,000 CBP officers have body cameras.   \n   Lyons pledged to Rep. Tony Gonzalez, R-Texas, that body camera footage of enforcement in Minneapolis would be released to the public and that he welcomes all officers getting such cameras.   Scott, from Customs and Border Protection, also pleaded for Congress to fully fund the body camera program for his agency, too, noting that while there has been money for the physical devices, there have not been the personnel to fully implement the body camera program.   \"So fund the entire program so that we can be transparent and that we can make sure America knows what we're doing, because that trust is critically important,\" Scott urged lawmakers.   \n   Noem, the homeland security secretary, has said the department is sending body cameras to every field officer in Minneapolis and that the body camera program would be expanded nationwide as funding allows.   Democrats want this codified into law.   \n   4. Most requests were still partisan   The rhetoric and questions still seemed largely split along partisan lines. Republicans described the work done by ICE as \"remarkable,\" while Democrats called for the \"abolishment\" and \"dismanteling\" of the agency.   Other Democratic proposals continue to face an uphill battle for GOP support, including calls for officers to display identifying information such as their last names on their uniforms, and to prohibit them from wearing face coverings.   Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., asked Lyons whether he would commit to unmasking his officers. Lyons said no. And Republicans argued that banning face masks would make it easier for people to dox federal agents — a common refrain from the administration.   \n   5. ICE was in the spotlight, while CBP, USCIS — and the looming shutdown — took a backseat   Both Republicans and Democrats peppered Lyons with questions about his agency's operations. But lawmakers generally did not drill down into the changes at CBP and USCIS, despite those agencies' growing roles in immigration enforcement over the last year.   Questions for CBP's Scott still centered around border enforcement. That comes even as the Border Patrol has gone beyond its traditional jurisdiction of 100 miles from U.S. borders to conduct enforcement in cities like Minneapolis, and lead operations in Illinois, North Carolina and Louisiana.   \n   All three agencies hedged  in response to questions about whether their operations would be affected if DHS shuts down on Friday.  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow reminded lawmakers that his agency is funded primarily by the fees people pay when they submit various forms and applications, so his employees would still get paid.   And ICE and CBP both got a huge infusion of cash from Congress in Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill Act last summer — making ICE the highest-funded U.S. law enforcement agency.   \n   Lyons said the shutdown could affect the Department of Homeland Security's work related to transnational crime, but he did not note any impact to immigration operations. And Scott also didn't detail how the shutdown would affect personnel, just saying: \"I agree America becomes less safe.\"   Their responses suggest any lapse in funding could most affect non-immigration agencies inside the Department of Homeland Security, like the Transportation Security Administration and Federal Emergency Management Agency — potentially spelling trouble for U.S. air travel and disaster response.   —NPR's Barbara Sprunt contributed to this report.\n",

Today's top stories   The Department of Homeland Security's funding will run out on Friday after Democrats refused to approve the money without significant changes to immigration enforcement. As lawmakers search for a solution, a House committee will hear from top immigration officials about their enforcement practices across the U.S.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) is surrounded by reporters as he walks from his office to the Senate Chamber at the U.S. Capitol on Feb. 9 in Washington, D.C. Congress is facing a Friday deadline to fund the Department of Homeland Security.\n                \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 If a deal is not reached, Congress will need to pass another stopgap bill to fund DHS, NPR's Barbara Sprunt tells Up First. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he will start prepping a short-term funding bill as a backup option. Democrats face an uphill battle with their demands for officers to display identifying information like their last name and a ban on face masks. Many Republicans view these requests as nonstarters. Sprunt says she is watching how GOP lawmakers question top immigration officials today. While they largely back President Trump's enforcement actions, Republicans have to navigate new polling that shows a majority of Americans believe those same tactics have gone too far.   The latest release of Epstein files threatens Britain's ruling government. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces calls for his resignation. He is not implicated in the Epstein files, but he appointed someone who is.    \n   🎧 The calls for Starmer's resignation are due to his decision to make Peter Mandelson the ambassador to Washington, NPR's Lauren Frayer says. Mandelson faces police investigation for allegedly passing sensitive U.K. government details to Jeffrey Epstein. Mandelson denies any wrongdoing. He resigned from his role last year after revelations that he maintained his friendship with Epstein following Epstein's sex crimes conviction. Police are also investigating former Prince Andrew, who also appears in the files, over whether he leaked sensitive information to Epstein when he was the U.K. trade envoy.   Today show host Savannah Guthrie released another video on Instagram yesterday pleading for the public's help in the search for her mom. She posted the video around the time a deadline outlined in a ransom message passed. Nancy Guthrie, 84, was last seen near her Arizona home on Jan. 31.    🎧 NPR's Bill Chappell says there is no sense that authorities are any closer to finding Nancy, even though multiple local and federal agencies are working on the case. Several media outlets have received ransom messages since Nancy was reported missing. At least one included details about the scene at her home. The FBI says it is taking the messages seriously, but it is not clear that they came from people who took Nancy.   \n   Immigration courts abruptly moved up hearings for dozens of asylum cases filed by Somali migrants over the weekend, according to four lawyers NPR interviewed. Lawyers in Minnesota, Illinois and Nebraska received notices that hearings set for 2028 and others that were not scheduled yet are now happening this month or next. The attorneys fear that the rapid scheduling may stifle due process for their clients. While more than 100 cases have been affected, the attorneys expect that number to climb much higher.

Republicans keep losing special elections and are retiring at a faster rate than Democrats. Voters say they prefer Democrats to control Congress. Democrats' hopes of taking over the House are growing by the day, while the Senate remains a longer shot. Republicans face an uphill battle, particularly to retain control of the House.    ➡️ An NPR poll showed 36% of respondents approved of Trump's handling of the economy, but a majority said tariffs hurt it. Americans name the economy as their top concern.➡️ So far, 51 members of the House have announced they are leaving their seats going into the 2026 election cycle: 30 Republicans and 21 Democrats.➡️ The president's popularity is an important indicator of electoral success in midterms. Trump's job approval rating is 39%, according to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll, which came out last week.

They share a particular love for one song: The Beatles' \"Blackbird.\" Author Melanie Florence describes the book as an intergenerational love story. As an adult, the boy returns home and plays guitar for his grandfather. Though his grandfather now forgets some things, he never loses his adoration for music. Matt James said his family connection made the story resonate, and he knew he had to illustrate it. James' parents are musicians who perform at retirement homes. Take a look at the artistic decisions he made to illustrate the story.   \n   3 things to know before you go   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Lindsey Vonn of Team United States crashes during the Women's Downhill Saturday at the Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.\n                \n                    Screengrab by IOC via Getty Images/Getty Images Europe\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Screengrab by IOC via Getty Images/Getty Images Europe\n    \n\n   \n   Team USA star Lindsey Vonn announced on Instagram that she suffered a \"complex tibia fracture\" when she crashed in the Olympic downhill race on Sunday.New research from Mass General Brigham suggests that drinking two to three cups of regular coffee or one to two cups of caffeinated tea daily may lower the risk of dementia.

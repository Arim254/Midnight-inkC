NPR's A Martinez speaks to Rebecca Pincus of the Foreign Policy Research Institute about why Greenland is so important.   \n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  President Trump keeps saying that he wants the U.S. to take over Greenland, which is a semi-autonomous territory that's part of the kingdom of Denmark. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet with Danish officials this week. So what's the Trump administration's strategy behind all of this? Rebecca Pincus is a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. She studies Arctic security and geopolitics. Pincus told me that Greenland's main appeal for Trump is its location.REBECCA PINCUS: It's a forward location for the United States to monitor for intercontinental missiles coming across the Arctic from Europe and Eurasia. And it's been important in that regard for decades since the Cold War. And the U.S. base in northwestern Greenland has been a place where the U.S. has maintained advanced radar systems and other sensors to serve that early-warning homeland-defense domain-awareness type of mission.MARTÍNEZ: What more would the United States be able to do in Greenland if it actually acquired it?PINCUS: The U.S. has been shedding bases and decreasing its position in Greenland for the last few decades. So you could imagine an outcome here where the U.S. is granted additional defense areas in Greenland, but I haven't seen specific asks. And that's what's a little bit confusing about this situation, because right now, there is no obstacle to the U.S. enhancing its military presence in Greenland.MARTÍNEZ: I'm wondering how might Russia or China respond to a takeover of Greenland? Would they see it possibly as a threatening or hostile act to them?PINCUS: It wouldn't be a direct threat because they don't have significant interests there. You know, Russia has never particularly expressed interest in Greenland, aside from fishing. China is certainly interested in Greenland's resources, but it's not sort of on the shortlist of top Chinese priorities. So I don't think it would be in substance, particularly threatening to either of those countries, but I do think the process could be seen as setting an example for potentially more sensitive areas closer to home.MARTÍNEZ: Now, Greenland does have a lot of natural resources, mostly untouched - copper, nickel, zinc, rare earth minerals. How long would it take for the U.S., actually, to start exploiting those and mining those things if they wanted to?PINCUS: Many years. There are numerous obstacles to bringing those minerals to market that have forestalled development up until now. The first among those is the physical environment. It's an incredibly harsh operating environment, and there is virtually no infrastructure. So the costs of extraction are enormously high. In addition, Greenland has a very protective regime with regards to mineral leases because protection of the natural environment is a high priority for Greenlanders, so it's unlikely that environmental regulations are going to be sort of tossed out wholesale. It would probably take 10 or 20 years just to get a mine open. And mining companies, again, because they're sort of making these investments that are going to pay out over the course of decades, they're making long-term bets about the future, and they want certainty and stability. And what's happening now is very uncertain.MARTÍNEZ: Now, with the north part of Alaska, the United States already has a presence in the Arctic. What would it mean to have a larger one with Greenland as part of the United States territories?PINCUS: It would be expensive (laughter) is what it means. You know, Alaska is a state that gets a lot of federal spending and has, you know, a fair amount of need. You know, if you look at sort of social indicators in Alaska, it's a high need state, and there's a lot of federal spending going in there for a variety of things, including military. Greenland is a big territory that would require a lot of U.S. spending, not just the sort of annual support that the Danish government currently provides to the Greenlandic government, which is about a little over half a billion dollars of direct support. Certainly, Greenlanders wouldn't, I think, accept compromised standards of living. So there's an enormous amount of money that would need to be spent there, and it would just - it would be a long-term sustained cost. If the U.S. military took an enhanced presence in Greenland, that would be really expensive itself.MARTÍNEZ: That's Rebecca Pincus. She's a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Institute. Rebecca, thanks.PINCUS: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Rob Schmitz speaks to former National Security Adviser John Bolton about the protests in Iran.   \n\n    ROB SCHMITZ, HOST:  The protests began about two weeks ago in the markets of Tehran. They've since spread to other cities and towns, a nationwide uprising against the authoritarian government of Iran. That authoritarian government has responded how it has in the past, with violent crackdowns. Human rights groups now say thousands of protesters have been killed. The protest prompted President Trump, who last year directed the bombing of nuclear sites in Iran, to threaten military force. And today, President Trump announced on social media, I have canceled all meetings with Iranian officials until the senseless killing of protesters stops. Help is on its way.To understand this moment, earlier today, I spoke with Ambassador John Bolton, who helped shape the pressure campaign on Iran during Trump's first term as national security advisor. I asked him if he thought this was the beginning of the end for the Iranian regime.JOHN BOLTON: I think the regime is at its weakest, most unpopular point, really since coming to power in 1979. What you're seeing now is largely driven by the economic situation in the country, which is really in very, very bad shape and has been for quite some period of time. But there are many other factors here. The young people are dissatisfied. They know they could have a different kind of life. The female half of the population has been unhappy for over two years since the murder of Mahsa Amini. And there are ethnic tensions, as well. This regime is a lot weaker than it looks, but it does control a monopoly of force. So I think the opposition needs the regime to fragment at the top. They could certainly help it, but I think help from outside, as well, would be critical at this point.SCHMITZ: And I want to go into that. You know, what happens if this regime falls? Theoretically, it could lead to a more democratic Iran, but I don't need to tell you that there are plenty of examples in the Middle East where a power vacuum has led to civil war and general chaos. What do you think would happen?BOLTON: Well, let's define regime, which is not just the ayatollahs, but it includes the revolutionary guards. This is, at this point, as much a military dictatorship as it is a theocracy. So we've got to get rid of the revolutionary guards or at least the commanders who are really the ones who follow the Islamic Revolution. Iran is a sophisticated, well-educated population. I think that probably there would be some interim government maybe led by people in the military temporarily. But I don't think it would last very long. I think they would want to give a chance for the people to try and express their views very quickly. It's hard to see you're going to get a regime worse than this one, which is the principal sponsor of international terrorism and pursuing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles that threaten Israel, threaten our Arab neighbors, threaten us, ultimately. I think we know where the population is going here, and I think it's the right direction.SCHMITZ: So you do see a scenario where the Iranian military, the Revolutionary Guard - it could turn and maybe side with protesters?BOLTON: Well, I think it would fragment. I think the regular military is a possibility, too. I think the rank and file in both the military and the Revolutionary Guard know how terrible economic conditions are in the country. Their family members, their friends - they see it every day. So I'm not thinking necessarily the highest-ranking generals will turn...SCHMITZ: OK.BOLTON: ...But colonels, maybe one-star generals, yeah. I think they could split. And then I think the troops will not fire on the demonstrators.SCHMITZ: Now, President Trump said Sunday we are looking at some very strong options. He was referring to military force. What's your read on this? Is this part of President Trump's negotiating strategy with Tehran, or do you think the president is referring to U.S. missile strikes on Iran?BOLTON: Well, I think that possibility is certainly there. You know, for years, people said, oh, you can't attack the Iranian nuclear weapons program. The Iranian people will rally to the side of the regime. Well, we did attack the Iranian nuclear weapons program, and now the Iranian people are in the streets saying death to the ayatollahs. So I think use of military force against targets like headquarters of the Revolutionary Guard, against the nuclear program, clearly targets that show to the opposition we're with them. And Trump has been tweeting today saying, you know, Iranian patriots, keep protesting. Take over your institutions. That's exactly what we ought to be doing.SCHMITZ: Now, you're making a parallel of Iranian nuclear sites, but, you know, this is a regime that has tentacles throughout the country. Can the U.S. really bomb this regime out of power?BOLTON: I don't think that's the objective, although we could certainly do a lot of damage beyond what we and the Israelis did during the 12-day war. And it's the encouragement it would give to the opposition that we will be dismantling, at least partly, the regime's ability to repress them. Now, he is saying in Venezuela to the opposition, don't take over the institutions. We'll let Delcy Rodríguez control them - just completely contradictory. The Venezuelan opposition should be taking over the institutions in Venezuela, if Trump could get his head screwed on straight. He's telling the Iranians, go out into the streets and risk getting killed, but he's not willing to do that in Venezuela.SCHMITZ: If the first step is indeed diplomacy and not bombing or cyberattacks, if the U.S. and Iran conduct negotiations, what would they be negotiating?BOLTON: I don't have any idea what we would negotiate with this regime. I think it would be a waste of oxygen. And, you know, Trump always talks about meetings. Everybody wants to meet with Donald Trump. We know that. I think it's the regime playing for time. I think it's a reflection of their conclusion that their situation is very serious, and they're desperate to avoid American kinetic action.SCHMITZ: Now, I need to ask you while we have you, you've been a major Trump critic since you left his first administration. You've recently been indicted on federal charges related to mishandling classified information. You've pleaded not guilty. What is next in this situation for you?BOLTON: Well, I can't really get into the specifics of that. I'd love to be able to discuss it, but this is, unfortunately, just not the time.SCHMITZ: Ambassador John Bolton, former national security advisor, thank you so much.BOLTON: Thanks for having me.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

The committee subpoenaed the Clintons for testimony related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, but the pair say they will not testify.   House Oversight chairman James Comer, R-Ky., announced the move after President Clinton declined to appear for a scheduled Tuesday deposition. The committee was seeking testimony from Hillary Clinton on Wednesday.    \"No one's accusing the Clintons of any wrongdoing,\" Comer told reporters. \"I just find it odd not only that they didn't show up, but that the Democrats on the committee so concerned about getting to the bottom of the Epstein investigation didn't even bother to show.\"   \n   Among the files released by the Justice Department are photographs of Epstein traveling with President Clinton, who has said he knew nothing of the financier's crimes and cut ties with him years ago.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., speaks to reporters after former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, refused to appear for a deposition as part of the panel's investigation into Jeffrey Epstein at the Capitol on Tuesday.\n                \n                    J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n    \n\n   \n   In a Tuesday letter to the committee, the Clintons called the subpoenas legally invalid and said they have already provided in writing what little they know.   They said the push is designed to embarrass political rivals, writing, \"Every person has to decide when they have seen or had enough and are ready to fight for this country, its principles and its people.\"   Democrats on the oversight committee, who signed off on the subpoenas as part of a larger list, have noted that most of the other people have not been forced to testify.   University of Kentucky Law professor Jonathan Shaub says the congressional subpoena is a key oversight tool, but, \"In recent decades, it's become more and more about scoring political points or exposing embarrassing material for the other side and less about getting information that Congress actually needs to legislate.\"   Shaub, an expert on the Constitution's separation of powers, says if a contempt resolution passes the full House and the Justice Department prosecutes the Clintons, it could spark a legal battle with larger implications because there is relatively limited case law when it comes to congressional contempt resolutions.   \n   \"When you have cases like this, where there's very little, if any, veneer of a legislative interest, it could end up undermining oversight power at a time where Congress has ceded so much authority to the executive branch,\" Shaub said.   Meanwhile the Justice Department has yet to release millions of pages of files pertaining to Epstein, weeks after the December deadline set by Congress.   \"WHERE ARE THE EPSTEIN FILES,\" Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., the Oversight committee's ranking member wrote Tuesday on social media.   Contempt of Congress charges can be a powerful, albeit rarely used tool. After failing to cooperate with Democrats for their investigation into the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, two close allies of President Trump, Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro, were sentenced to prison. Each served four months in prison. \n",

U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington, D.C., awarded the preliminary injunction late Sunday, siding with AAP in saying evidence showed the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services likely had a \"retaliatory motive\" when it terminated grants to the pediatric group in December.   \"This is not a case about whether AAP or HHS is right or even has the better position on vaccinations and gender-affirming care for children, or any other public health policy,\" Howell wrote in her decision. \"This is a case about whether the federal government has exercised power in a manner designed to chill public health policy debate by retaliating against a leading and generally trusted pediatrician member professional organization focused on improving the health of children.\"   \n   The seven grants terminated in December supported numerous public health programs, including efforts to prevent sudden unexpected infant death, strengthen pediatric care in rural communities and support teens facing substance use and mental health challenges.   AAP alleged the cuts were made in retaliation for the group speaking out against the Trump administration's positions and actions. HHS said in letters to AAP that the grants were cut because they no longer aligned with the department's priorities. The department has denied AAP's allegations of retaliation.   AAP has been vocal about its support for pediatric vaccines and has publicly opposed HHS positions. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — who helped lead the anti-vaccine movement for years — has made sweeping changes to childhood vaccine recommendations. Last year, the pediatrics group released its own recommendations on COVID-19 vaccines, which substantially diverged from the government's guidance.   The group also supports access to gender-affirming care and has publicly criticized HHS positions on the topic, saying it opposes what it calls the government's infringements on the doctor-patient relationship.   \n   Explaining her decision, Howell said that AAP had shown it would likely suffer irreparable harm from the cuts. She also said the group had shown the public interest was in its favor in allowing the programs to continue as the lawsuit plays out.   Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which is representing AAP in the lawsuit, said the ruling shows that \"no administration gets to silence doctors, undermine public health, or put kids at risk, and we will not stop fighting until this unlawful retaliation is fully ended.\"   \n   A spokesperson for HHS and attorneys representing the department declined comment.\n",

    "body": "\n      President Trump is ushering in yet another iteration of GOP foreign policy with his latest moves.   \n\n    ROB SCHMITZ, HOST:  Donald Trump first won the presidency championing America First and railing against the Bush-era neoconservatism that mired the U.S. in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But with Nicolás Maduro's forceful removal in Venezuela and now threats against Iran and Colombia, Trump has pushed the U.S. into a new interventionist style of foreign policy. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben reports on how the GOP went from Bush-era regime changes to Trump's current philosophy - what he's calling the Donroe Doctrine.DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: On a Republican debate stage in 2016, Donald Trump took aim at opponent Jeb Bush by slamming the war in Iraq, a war started by Jeb's brother, George.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Obviously, it was a mistake.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: So...TRUMP: George Bush made a mistake. We can make mistakes, but that one was a beauty. We should have never been in Iraq. We have destabilized...UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: I...TRUMP: ...The Middle East.KURTZLEBEN: By then, Americans' beliefs that the war in Iraq was positive had fallen off, including among Republicans. Trump represented not just a gradual move away from past Republican foreign policy, but a full break.SAMUEL MOYN: Donald Trump's candidacy within the Republican Party represented, above all, in foreign policy a rejection of neoconservatism.KURTZLEBEN: Samuel Moyn is a professor of law and history at Yale University. Here's how he sums up a central neoconservative tenet.MOYN: The neocons spoke and speak in terms of high idealism, and they think America's an exceptional nation that has universal values and brings democracy where it goes.KURTZLEBEN: The idea was that exporting those values justified interventions, including regime change. Vice President Dick Cheney foregrounded democracy in making the case for invading Iraq in 2003, speaking to CBS' \"Face The Nation.\"(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FACE THE NATION\")DICK CHENEY: I think our goal and objective, and I think the objective of many of the Iraqi people and the opposition as well, too, is to establish a broadly representative government in Iraq that has due regard for the various groups and for the human rights.KURTZLEBEN: Post-Bush, neoconservatism remained prominent within the party, but the door was open to something new. Max Boot advised John McCain's candidacy in 2008 and once considered himself a neocon.MAX BOOT: There was frustration with interventionism and with nation-building. And then, you know, Donald Trump came along with this very idiosyncratic view where, you know, he's revived the America First motto of the pre-World War II isolationists.KURTZLEBEN: There's broad disagreement as to how isolationist Trump ever was. In his first term, for example, he continued some aspects of the war on terror, like assassinating Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, but he certainly didn't attempt any regime changes. James Lindsay, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, sees a shift during Trump 2.0.JAMES LINDSAY: Rather than picking people who saw their job as being guardrails to his actions, he picked people who see their job as enabling Trump to be Trump.KURTZLEBEN: In his estimation, Trump's abilities to enact his policies have changed, but his world view hasn't.LINDSAY: President Trump is a nationalist. He's a unilateralist. He's sounding more and more like an imperialist. But at his core, President Trump is what we might call an ultrarealist.KURTZLEBEN: The interventions that have come from that hard-power-focused realism have sometimes pleased the neocons he once rejected. Indeed, there have been echoes of early 2000s nation-building. Last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke of rebuilding civil society in Venezuela. But Trump has now articulated what you might call that ultrarealist world view in a recent interview with The New York Times.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KATIE ROGERS: Do you see any checks on your power on the world stage? Is there anything that could stop you if you wanted to...TRUMP: Yeah, there's one thing - my own morality, my own mind.KURTZLEBEN: Trump has suggested the U.S. may oversee Venezuela for years and isn't ruling out boots on the ground. And Trump has now threatened Greenland and Colombia. It might feel surprising, but as Lindsay adds, the U.S. appetite for interventionism is cyclical.LINDSAY: I'm old enough to remember Vietnam had left everyone thinking that the United States wouldn't become involved in military interventions overseas, and then we got Iraq.KURTZLEBEN: Over the weekend, Trump said he is also considering military action against Iran after hundreds of protesters there have been killed and that he may meet with Iranian officials.

The speech, which comes amid polling showing his handling of the economy at a historic low, lasted just more than an hour. He touted plans to crack down on fraud, freeze federal payments to states with sanctuary cities and cap credit card fees at 10% for a year. He also teased further proposals to come on health care and housing.   \n   \"It's unfair,\" Trump said in Detroit on credit card interest rates. \"The rates are too high to provide further relief to hardworking Americans.\"   But Trump spent much of his time blaming Biden for inflation rates and criticized the fed chair, Powell, whom the Justice Department is targeting in a new investigation. Trump told NBC News on Sunday he had nothing to do with the probe, but he has been criticizing Powell for months for not lowering interest rates and has been threatening to fire him.   In his remarks, Trump referred to Powell as \"that jerk\" and said he would \"be gone soon.\"   Michigan was Trump's first domestic trip since a slew of international news – capturing Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro; threatening military action against Iran after rising protests; seizing Greenland; trying to move forward in the Gaza peace deal; ongoing negotiations to end the Russia-Ukraine war – has been the president's main focus for weeks.   But in the U.S., even a majority of the president's own supporters remain increasingly concerned about high costs and affordability. It's an issue that was critical for Democrats' successes in the 2025 elections in Virginia and New Jersey and expected to remain top of mind for midterm elections later this year.   \n   Last month, Trump's approval rating on the economy hit a new low of 36%, according to a NPR/PBS/Marist poll. The poll showed voters feel like they are struggling to make ends meet and are most concerned about high costs.   The president previously addressed his economic agenda in an Oval Office speech and said his administration was \"making progress\" on lowering costs but \"it's not done yet.\"   In recent weeks, the White House has been touting lower gas prices and a dip in mortgage rates as economic wins. The president also shared that he'll address a plan for more affordable housing during a trip to Davos, Switzerland, next week.   Trump said tariffs were \"one of the biggest reasons\" for what he said is his successful economy.   \"The Trump tariffs have delivered us trillions of dollars of new investment, unprecedented new partnerships on new minerals, rare earths, defense and artificial intelligence and historical levels of foreign military sales,\" Trump said.   The president specifically said his 25% tariff on foreign automobiles is helping Michigan.   \"I am standing up for the American autoworker like no president has stood up before,\" he said.   Before his remarks, Trump visited a Ford facility that manufactures the F150 pickup truck.\n",

    "body": "\n      Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell usually tries to avoid getting dragged into a fight with the Trump administration. But now that the DOJ has launched a probe of the central bank, he's on offense.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  For years, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has studiously avoided getting dragged into fights with President Trump. But after serving as the president's punching bag, Powell's own gloves are now coming off. The shift comes after Powell says the Justice Department threatened a criminal indictment over the central bank's building renovation and Powell's own testimony on the subject. In a video statement late Sunday, Powell accused the administration of trying to bully the Fed into lowering interest rates.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEROME POWELL: This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions, or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.SUMMERS: Powell's tough talk signals a new era in relations between the White House and the Fed. NPR's Scott Horsley reports.SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Jerome Powell is the epitome of the diplomatic central banker. Unlike many of his predecessors at the Fed, Powell never trained as an economist. As he told graduates at his alma mater, Princeton, last spring, his parents wanted him to study economics, but he thought it was boring.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)POWELL: Rather than studying, I had spent my freshman year with fellow campus musicians playing my Martin D-35 acoustic guitar. It was a high school graduation present and one that my parents surely regretted.HORSLEY: Powell still plays guitar and is a devoted music fan. He made a splash a few years ago when he was photographed at a Dead & Company concert just outside Washington.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)POWELL: Oh, it was terrific. What can I say? I've been a Grateful Dead fan for 50 years.HORSLEY: Powell grew up in the nation's capital and knew he wanted a career that combined public service with work in the private sector. He served in the Treasury Department during the first Bush administration, then made a lot of money in investment banking and private equity. His net worth is estimated between $20 and $55 million. During the Obama administration, Powell served as an informal ambassador to Republicans on Capitol Hill and helped persuade them not to bust the federal debt ceiling. Obama rewarded Powell with an appointment to the Fed's governing board. He was later promoted to chairman by President Trump.While Powell's a Republican, he carefully courts support from lawmakers in both parties. He told a gathering of business reporters last year that's one reason he usually wears neckties in a neutral shade of purple.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)POWELL: We are strictly nonpolitical. I can't stress that enough. It's not that we're bipartisan. We are nonpolitical. We don't do that, and so purple was a good color for that. That's all. Plus, I like purple ties.HORSLEY: Powell's nearly eight years as Fed chair share have seen both soaring unemployment during the pandemic and later the highest inflation in four decades. Nevertheless, Powell's won praise for his handling of those challenges from other central bankers, like Christine Lagarde of the European Central Bank.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHRISTINE LAGARDE: I think I speak for myself, but I speak for all colleagues on the panel. I think we would do exactly the same thing as our colleague Jay Powell does - the same thing, right?UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Yes.(LAUGHTER)HORSLEY: Of course, Lagarde and most other central bankers from developed countries have never faced the kind of relentless pressure campaign that Powell has endured from Trump, who wants much lower interest rates. During his first term, Trump suggested Powell was a bigger threat to the U.S. than Chinese President Xi Jinping. Until now, the Fed chairman has generally refused to take the bait. But as longtime Fed watcher David Wessel of the Brookings Institution told Morning Edition, the Justice Department's criminal probe was the last straw.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)DAVID WESSEL: It looks like they just pushed Jay Powell too far, and he came out with all guns blazing. It's very unusual, and it's particularly unusual for him. He's been very careful not to antagonize directly the president, and that era is over.HORSLEY: Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats, Powell said yesterday, channeling the advice he gave those Princeton graduates last spring.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)POWELL: Fifty years from now, you'll want to be able to look in the mirror and know that you did what you thought was right in every part of your life. At the end of the day, our integrity is all we have. Guard it carefully.HORSLEY: Powell's term as Fed chairman runs through May. He has the option to stay on the Fed's governing board for another two years.Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The Environmental Protection Agency under President Trump is taking a new approach to regulating air pollution. In a reversal from previous policy, the EPA will not put a dollar value on potential health benefits from regulations. Critics say that could make it easier to roll back regulations.\n                \n                    J. David Ake/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        J. David Ake/AP\n    \n\n   \n   For years, the Environmental Protection Agency has assigned a dollar value to the lives saved and the health problems avoided through many of its environmental regulations.   \n   Now, that has changed. The EPA will no longer consider the economic cost of harm to human health from fine particles and ozone, two air pollutants that are known to affect human health. The change was written into a new rule recently published by the agency. It weakened air pollution rules on power plant turbines that burn fossil fuels, which are sources of air pollution of many types, including from fine particles, sometimes called soot.   The EPA writes in its regulatory impact analysis for the new rule that, for now, the agency will not consider the dollar value of health benefits from its regulations on fine particles and ozone because there is too much uncertainty in estimates of those economic impacts.   \n   EPA press secretary Brigit Hirsch clarified that the agency is still considering health benefits. But it will not assign a dollar amount to those benefits until further notice, as it reconsiders the way it assesses those numbers.   Health experts worry that the move could lead to rollbacks of air pollution rules, which could result in rising pollution levels, leading to more health risks for millions of Americans.   \"I'm worried about what this could mean for health,\" says Mary Rice, a pulmonologist and air pollution expert at Harvard University and the director of Harvard's Center for Climate Health and the Global Environment. \"Especially for people with chronic respiratory illnesses like asthma and COPD, for kids whose lungs are still developing, and for older people, who are especially susceptible to the harmful effects of air pollution on the heart, lungs and the brain.\"   Fine particles, known as PM2.5, come from a variety of sources, including power plants that burn fossil fuels like coal and gas. Long-term exposure to fine particle pollution is known to cause significant health risks, from higher rates of asthma to more heart attacks to dementia, and even premature death. Cleaning up pollution from fine particles has, by the agency's previous estimates, saved more than 230,000 lives and billions of dollars per year in recent years.   \n   The policy shift could facilitate further rollback of air pollution regulations, says NYU environmental law expert Richard Revesz. The economic costs to industry of implementing air regulations are still quantified, at least in the new rule. But if the benefits aren't assigned a similarly concrete dollar amount, he says, it is easier to ignore them. \"It looks good only because you ignore the main consequence of the rollback, which is the additional negative impact on public health,\" he says. \"By just saying we are assuming no harm doesn't mean there is no harm.\"   The health costs of air pollution    Decades of research have shown that exposure to pollution, such as fine particles, damages people's health. The landmark Harvard University Six Cities study, which ran from the 1970s until the 1990s, showed unambiguously that living in more polluted areas shortened people's lives. Since then, hundreds of research analyses — including many produced by EPA scientists — have linked risks to people's lungs, hearts, and brains with fine particle pollution. And reducing that pollution can have near-instantaneous health benefits: After the closure of a polluting coke plant in Pennsylvania, for example, cardiovascular and respiratory problems dropped dramatically in the surrounding population.   \n   A 1981 executive order from President Ronald Reagan required agencies like the EPA to consider the costs and benefits of major regulations such as the Clean Air Act. So alongside evolving evidence about the health risks of exposure to air pollution, the EPA began to figure out how to assess both.   The cost estimates were relatively straightforward: What would it cost industry to upgrade their equipment and processes to comply with a rule? The benefits were slightly trickier. The agency developed sophisticated ways to estimate how many lives would be saved and health problems avoided from lower pollution, driven by tighter regulations. The EPA also developed economic models that could estimate how much money such changes would save the American people.   \n   Most estimates routinely came up with high economic benefit-to-cost ratios, says Rice, the Harvard pulmonologist. \"The Clean Air Act is often cited as having benefit-cost ratios of upward of 30 to 1,\" she says. \"The economic return is so great that even small reductions in pollution, across millions of people, translate into very large savings.\"   A 2014 U.S. Supreme Court case clarified that agencies like the EPA had to take both benefits and costs into account in their regulatory processes. But the courts have \"not waded into the question of how exactly [EPA] should do that,\" says Jeffrey Holmstead, an EPA expert and lawyer at Bracewell, LLC and former leader of the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation during the George W. Bush administration. \"So, yes, they do have to consider both, but there is no legally enforceable requirement for them to do it in any particular way,\" he says. That leaves it up to the agency's discretion, Holmstead says, whether to forgo an economic benefits calculation, as long as the EPA still assesses the health benefits in some way.   \n   Other EPA regulations, he says, assess the health benefits without assigning a specific dollar value, like some of the rules concerning hazardous air pollutants, which are associated with significant but more uncertain health risks.   However, \"you can't do a sophisticated cost-benefit analysis without trying to monetize both the costs and the benefits,\" Holmstead says. \"This will be the first time in a long time that EPA hasn't tried to provide a monetary benefit to reducing at least PM 2.5 and ozone.\"   The move to not consider economic benefits marks a major policy change, says NYU legal expert Revesz. \"It's extraordinarily unusual,\" he says.   Not just air pollution    Revesz points out that under the Trump administration, the EPA has made moves to reconsider the economic benefits of regulations in other areas, as well.   \n   In its proposal to roll back vehicle emissions standards, for example, the EPA did not assess the potential economic benefits to consumers who switched to electric vehicles instead of choosing gas-powered cars. It also explicitly declined to calculate societal economic benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and significantly lowered the estimates of the health savings from tighter rules. The EPA did the same in its efforts to roll back the endangerment finding, which has been in place since 2009. That finding concludes that the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere poses serious risks to public health and well-being.   Revesz says that makes three ways the EPA used to consider economic benefits to Americans from regulations. And now the \"EPA has said that it's going to ignore all three of them,\" he says.   EPA administrator Lee Zeldin wrote in a 2025 statement that his priorities at the agency were to \"lower the cost of buying a car, heating a home and running a business.\"\n",

Some Americans are making big leaps to manage the cost of health care.\n                \n                    Anton Pentegov/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anton Pentegov/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   When he stops to think about it, Mathew says, his situation feels kind of ridiculous.   \"I find myself in the middle of some sort of rom-com plot,\" he says. \"For me to be able to see my doctor to tend to my autoimmune disease, I had to marry my best friend — it's like some weird twisted plot of Will and Grace.\"   Mathew asked NPR not to use his full name because he fears repercussions from his health insurance company if it finds out he got married to obtain coverage.   He is not the first American to marry for affordable health insurance, and he won't be the last. Especially before the Affordable Care Act, marriages, delayed divorces and job decisions were often tied to private health insurance, since it usually required you or a spouse to have a job with benefits.   \n   But his decision was forced by the cost crisis facing many of the roughly 24 million people who get their health care via Affordable Care Act marketplaces. Enhanced subsidies that made plans affordable for many people expired at the end of 2025 and Congress failed to extend them before the 2026 plan year. Millions of people face untenable monthly premium prices — as much as the cost of a mortgage for some families.   Congressional lawmakers are back at the table working toward a deal that could revive the enhanced subsidies. In the meantime, some have decided to forgo insurance or make drastic changes to their lives to stay insured, like Mathew.   \"I couldn't afford to wait for Congress to make up their minds and come to an agreement,\" he says.   \n   \"That's so weird\"   Mathew is 40 years old and lives in a small town in Michigan. He loves his job, but the company is too small to offer health coverage, and he has an auto-immune condition that requires medication transfusions. For several years, he's relied on the Affordable Care Act for coverage. He liked his plan, and his $181 monthly premium for 2025 was manageable for him.   Then, in the summer, Mathew started to get nervous.   \"I started seeing things about — what's going to happen when these subsidies lapse for the ACA in the marketplace?\"   \n   When the enhanced subsidies expired at the end of the year, his premium would go up to over $427 a month, \"which was just not an expense I could manage.\"   Enter Christina, Mathew's roommate and best friend of 25 years. \"We met when we were in eighth grade and when we both moved out of our family homes, we moved in together and we've lived together ever since,\" he says.   They're basically platonic life partners, he says. So as he was weighing what to do about his insurance, one night, she turned to him.   \"She's like, I have great insurance — why don't we get married?\" he says. \"And I said, 'Well, that's so weird because I'm gay.'\"   He remembers her responding: \"It wouldn't change anything between us other than a piece of paper and we're making sure that you have what you need.\"   He said he really wasn't sure at first. \"I've always been kind of like a romantic, and I've always envisioned myself getting married to a man,\" Mathew says.   They had a lot of discussions, a lot of talking things through with therapists. \"We both came to the realization — there's nothing really phony about our marriage other than the fact that we're not romantic and we were not physical with each other,\" he says. \"We share the burdens of day-to-day life, and we have for over 15 years of living together and 25 years of friendship.\"   So they did it. In late September, they had a small ceremony at a local church, with both sets of parents and two friends. \"Ultimately, I have no regrets,\" he says.   Many reasons for marriage   Marrying for benefits used to be more common, says Erin Fuse Brown, health law professor at the Brown University School of Public Health, although she notes there are no hard numbers of how many people do it.   \n   \"With the advent of the Affordable Care Act, this question faded to some degree because there were better options for someone who didn't have access to employer-sponsored coverage to get covered in an affordable way,\" she says. \"With the expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits, we're now starting to slowly walk back toward a pre-ACA world.\"   Marriage for benefits is not against the law, Fuse Brown notes.   \"If you say this person is your partner, it's not the job of the HR department — or the law — to question: how sincere is this person's marriage?\" she says. \"People get married for a whole bunch of reasons that are non-romantic — they could be economic, they could be practical, they could be childrearing, there could be any number of reasons.\"   Mathew's new health plan through Christina's job started in January, and it costs $121 per month, not too different than his subsidized ACA premium.   Now, he's scrambling to get his care up and running under the new insurance. \"I have been in a mad dash of securing referrals and prior authorizations to be able to get my medication in two weeks' time,\" he says.   It frustrates Mathew to find himself in this situation. He liked his Affordable Care Act plan and believes in it. He's still hoping Congress makes a deal. Not everyone, he says, has a best friend they can marry to get affordable health insurance.\n",

Court employees and judges at the San Francisco Immigration Court received a short email last week letting them know that their court at 100 Montgomery Street will be shutting its doors by the end of the year. All personnel will be transferred to the Concord Immigration Court, about 30 miles away, according to the email sent by Teresa Riley, the chief immigration judge, and obtained by NPR.   Courtrooms at the Department of Homeland Security's San Francisco detention facility located a 630 Sansome St. will remain. But the closure of the main courthouse is expected to add to the workload on immigration judges as they already face pressure to move through their caseloads faster and to streamline deportations.   \n   \"At first it was a message that you better fall in line or you're going to get fired,\" said Jeremiah Johnson, a former immigration judge who worked in San Francisco's court until his termination last year. Now, \"it's a message that your court is going to be closed.\"   \n   San Francisco's immigration court has been among those particularly hit by the Trump administration's push to fire judges. According to a count kept by NPR, 12 judges and a court supervisor received termination notices last year. Several others retired or left, leaving the court with just four immigration judges and one supervisor to hear cases as of the beginning of this year — down from 21 at the start of 2025.   The closure of the court came as a surprise to many current and former employees at the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), which is part of the Department of Justice. The employees spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. EOIR spokesperson Kathryn Mattingly says the move to Concord \"would be more cost-effective.\"   The judges who remain in the court this year now face some 120,935 immigration cases, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse data as of September. Those cases will be transferred to the court in Concord over the course of the next year, or be heard remotely, Mattingly said.   \n   The Concord court opened in early 2024 specifically to help ease the pressure on the San Francisco court, which was one of the busiest immigration courts in the country, hearing cases from migrants in Portland through California's Central Valley.   Concord's court itself has also shed judges and other employees, and already has a growing backlog of immigration cases.   \n   Firing push nationwide   The situation in California isn't unique. In total, the Trump administration fired nearly 100 judges in 2025, including both newer judges and those with more experience, according to NPR's count cross-referenced with the judges' union and those in several of the individual courts. That number includes assistant chief immigration judges, or courthouse supervisors who also have their own dockets.   The year-end string of layoffs included at least 19 experienced judges who had been with the agency for years, NPR has identified.   The result is that courts across the country are starting 2026 with fewer than half the judges from a year ago as judges were fired, resigned or were reassigned. At least two courts — in Aurora, Colo., and in Oakdale, La., — have no judges left, just the court supervisor.   Those courts haven't closed yet, but observers expect similar moves to shrink the number of immigration courts and adjudication centers in the country, which currently number 76.   \n   With fewer judges and courts to hear them, immigrants are seeing their cases pushed back as far as 2030. Many of these immigrants have already waited years for their chance to make their case before a judge. Lawyers say the delays make their clients more vulnerable to arrests and deportations, as part of the administration's push to broaden the scope of arrests.   Jordan Weiner is an immigration lawyer in San Francisco and the interim executive director of La Raza Centro Legal, a legal and advocacy group. She saw court backlogs grow during the COVID-19 pandemic, and she sees the shutting of San Francisco's court as another \"mass delay event.\"   \n   Weiner has 10 cases in the San Francisco Immigration Court; all have been pushed back due to the termination of judges. One of her clients has been in the U.S. for nearly a decade. That case has already been pushed to 2027 and she anticipates it will be postponed again once it goes to the judges in Concord.   \"Of course people are scared to go to immigration court because of the arrests — and closing down San Francisco Immigration Court isn't going to help,\" Weiner said. \"That doesn't give a lot of confidence in the system.\"   \n   Hiring more judges   EOIR is planning to bring on new classes of immigration judges at least every quarter to make up for those who were fired or left. But it's unclear whether they would fully make up for the shortfalls.   The agency launched a new hiring campaign in November that seeks to recruit \"deportation judges\" — rather than \"immigration judges.\" The agency did not respond to questions over how many applications it has received in the first few months of the hiring campaign.   Fired judges also worry that the administration's rounds of terminations favors those who had immigration defense experience. This, they said, gives the perception that immigration courts are favoring outcomes in line with President Trump's goal of mass deportations.   \"You're weakening the rule of law by not having immigration judges; you're having deportation judges,\" Johnson, the former immigration judge in San Francisco, said.   \n   Immigration judges typically come from a variety of backgrounds, including immigration enforcement and immigration defense. But of the judges fired between February and October last year, most had experience in immigration defense, an NPR investigation found.   The DOJ also promoted 10 judges to be courthouse supervisors. An NPR analysis of those judge's background and records show eight have prior experience working for the Homeland Security Department.   \n   Temporary military judges brought in   The Trump administration has also moved forward with temporary judge positions. The Pentagon in September authorized up to 600 military lawyers from the Judge Advocate General's Corps, or JAGs, to serve as temporary immigration judges. One class of 25 was already onboarded and a second was expected to begin their training as soon as this week, NPR has learned from two sources not permitted to speak publicly.   These judges are also not exempt from the pressures from this administration to more quickly adjudicate cases and to streamline deportations.   \n   JAG judges currently on the bench issued removal orders at a higher rate than other judges did, according to an analysis of court data by the legal nonprofit Mobile Pathways.   \n   Those who don't comply may already be facing consequences. One JAG judge, Christopher Day, a U.S. Army Reserve lawyer, had granted asylum and relief from immediate deportation at a higher rate than his other JAG counterparts, according to EOIR data compiled by Mobile Pathways.   Day has been removed from his post, per EOIR's website.   EOIR declined to comment on personnel matters.\n",

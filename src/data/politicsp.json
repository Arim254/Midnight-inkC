    "body": "\n      Talking about politics over the holidays can be difficult for many families, even for politicians themselves. One politically divided family in Colorado makes sure get along, especially during the holidays.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Politics can make the holidays tough for a lot of families, and that includes politicians. Colorado Public Radio's Bente Birkeland brings us this story about how one politically-divided family keeps the peace.BENTE BIRKELAND, BYLINE: Monica Duran is one of the top Democratic leaders in Colorado. She serves as the House majority leader and manages the floor and the hundreds of bills that come through the House each legislative session.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Members, we are moving into business. Madam Majority Leader.MONICA DURAN: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I move the following bills be made special orders...BIRKELAND: But in her actual House, the Democrat has long been outnumbered by Republicans. Her two sons are conservative. So was her late husband. They all voted for President Trump.DURAN: We're very vocal. Nothing is really held back. So they can be very passionate. And I think when it gets to that point where we're kind of heated, you know, I will say, just timeout. You know, family comes before politics. It just has to.BIRKELAND: Her oldest son, Patrick Ellis, says he's learned a lot from his mom, but when it comes to the issues, she's never managed to change his mind and he's never changed hers.PATRICK ELLIS: I've tried. I think it worked the same way as when you tried to convince me, is...DURAN: (Laughter) Yeah.ELLIS: ...I think you'll hear what I'm saying, you'll understand my perspective, but it will run into a core belief that you have where there is no changing that.BIRKELAND: Patrick studied political science in college and still follows politics closely. Duran says he was the driving force behind her first run for office.DURAN: I was working, and he said, Mom, why don't you do that for yourself? You've always wanted to. And, you know, you always think, well, what do I have to offer? What do I know about any of this?BIRKELAND: Duran is in her eighth year at the State House, serving her final session because of term limits. She lives in a suburb of Denver. Patrick is her constituent, and he says his mom is the only Democrat he's ever voted for.ELLIS: I found instead of really focusing in on the handful of issues we don't agree on is the ones that I do agree with my mom. So, like, what she does for victims, for women, what she's done for animals, things like that, like, we're 100% in agreement with.BIRKELAND: But some policy disagreements are impossible to ignore and have had a big impact on her family. Duran's been a champion of Colorado's stricter gun laws, like waiting periods and age limits for purchases. Those laws led her son David Duran to move out of the state.DURAN: My younger son is extremely passionate and very vocal. He's moved his family to Wyoming because of the direction Colorado is going.BIRKELAND: Her son David didn't want to be interviewed for this story. Duran says it can be hard to hear his stance on gun laws.DURAN: I acknowledge the fact that, yeah, you're right. I have ran those policies, and I realize they've impacted what you feel are your freedoms and your choices that you want to be able to make and how you want to raise your daughter, my granddaughter.BIRKELAND: For Patrick, he says the key to their strong family bond is respect. He says people are so much more than their party affiliation.ELLIS: It's not the biggest focal point of our relationships. My mom is my mother. You know, she's my best friend. She's somebody I can confide in. I don't look at her as somebody who votes entirely different than me.BIRKELAND: Over the holidays, Duran says she and her sons plan to get together. David loves to cook for the family.DURAN: He takes after his dad, so he will make many different dishes - Mexican dishes. I know. Patrick loves it. I love it.BIRKELAND: And when it comes to politics, Duran says she still holds out the tiniest bit of hope that someday her sons will say, turns out Mom was right all along.For NPR News, I'm Bente Birkeland.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THERE IS NO CHRISTMAS LIKE A HOME CHRISTMAS\")PERRY COMO: (Singing) There is no Chrismas like a home...\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

Redd pulled out after President Trump's name appeared on the building.\n                \n                    ‎/Robert Severi\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        ‎/Robert Severi\n    \n\n   \n   The Kennedy Center says it plans to file a $1 million lawsuit against jazz artist Chuck Redd, after the musician canceled his annual Christmas Eve performance. The Associated Press first reported that Redd pulled out of the show days after President Trump's name was added to the exterior of the performing arts center in Washington, D.C.   In an email to NPR on Saturday, Kennedy Center spokesperson Roma Daravi said Redd's decision is a disservice to the arts.   \n   \"Any artist cancelling their show at the Trump Kennedy Center over political differences isn't courageous or principled—they are selfish, intolerant, and have failed to meet the basic duty of a public artist: to perform for all people,\" she said.   Redd, an international performer on drums and vibraphone, hosted the center's Christmas Jazz Jam for many years. NPR's messages to Redd were not returned Saturday morning.   \"When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,\" he told the AP.   Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell sent a scathing letter to Redd on Friday, criticizing him and calling the cancellation a political stunt. The center shared the letter with NPR.   \n   \"Regrettably, your action surrenders to the sad bullying tactics employed by certain elements on the left, who have sought to intimidate artists into boycotting performances at our national cultural center,\" it reads.   In a post on X on Friday, Grenell wrote: \"The left is boycotting the Arts because Trump is supporting the Arts. But we will not let them cancel shows without consequences. The Arts are for everyone - and the Left is mad about it.\"   Several artists have pulled out of performances and cut ties with the Kennedy Center since Trump replaced the board and was elected chairman. In March, Hamilton canceled its 2026 run at the Kennedy Center. Actor and producer Issa Rae also called off her appearance. Folk musician Rhiannon Giddens moved her concert to a different venue in the city.   \n   Trump's name was added to the Kennedy Center building last week, after the Board of Trustees voted to rename it. The exterior's iconic lettering now reads \"The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.\"   \n   The name change has prompted outcry from Democratic lawmakers. Ohio Rep. Joyce Beatty, an ex-officio member of the Kennedy Center Board, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Monday. Beatty argues changing the name of the memorial that is in honor of President John F. Kennedy requires an act of Congress. She's asking the court to declare the board's vote null and void.   According to a Kennedy Center online biography, Redd has been involved with The Smithsonian for more than two decades, serving as artist-in residence at The Smithsonian Jazz Café from 2004-2008. The Kennedy Center is part of the Smithsonian Institution.   \n   \"Art is a shared cultural experience meant to unite, not exclude,\" said the statement from Daravi. \"The Trump Kennedy Center is a true bipartisan institution that welcomes artists and patrons from all backgrounds—great art transcends politics, and America's cultural center remains committed to presenting popular programming that inspires and resonates with all audiences.\"   The Kennedy Center says it will file the lawsuit against Redd after the holidays.\n",

Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee.   Abrego Garcia has denied the allegations, and argued that prosecutors are vindictively and selectively targeting him. Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw, Jr. wrote in Tuesday's order that Abrego Garcia had enough evidence to hold a hearing on the topic, which Crenshaw scheduled for Jan. 28.   \n   At that hearing, prosecutors will have to explain their reasoning for charging Abrego Garcia, Crenshaw wrote, and if they fail in that, the charges could be dismissed.   When Abrego Garcia was pulled over in 2022, there were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was eventually allowed to continue driving with only a warning.   A Department of Homeland Security agent previously testified that he did not begin investigating the traffic stop until after the U.S. Supreme Court said in April that the Trump administration had to work to bring Abrego Garcia from El Salvador, where he was deported.   \n   Years earlier, Abrego Garcia had been granted protection from deportation to his home country after a judge found he faced danger there from a gang that targeted his family. That order allowed Abrego Garcia, who has an American wife and child, to live and work in the U.S. under Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervision.   Members of President Donald Trump's administration have accused Abrego Garcia of being a member of the MS-13 gang, but he has vehemently denied the accusations and has no criminal record.   Abrego Garcia's defense attorney and the U.S. attorney's office in Nashville did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",

    "body": "\n      Morning Edition host Leila Fadel asks GOP strategist Alex Conant about the future of the Republican party in 2026 and beyond.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  So what's ahead for the Republican Party in 2026? To get into that, we're joined by Republican strategist Alex Conant. Good morning, and a belated Merry Christmas.ALEX CONANT: Good morning. Merry Christmas.FADEL: So some pretty grim records there - longest government shutdown, least bills passed, most House members leaving. This is a Republican-controlled Congress. Given this record, how is the party thinking about messaging and appealing to Americans going into 2026 and the midterms?CONANT: Well, right now, the big focus is going to be on selling the tax cuts that the president and Congress passed last summer, which, Republicans argue, have already had a measurable, positive impact on the economy. You look at the GDP numbers that were released earlier this week that showed really high third-quarter growth. The White House feels confident that is just the beginning of what's going to be a banner year in 2026. And if the economy is strong and people start perceiving that it is strong, Republicans should be fine in the midterms.FADEL: And that's - but that's the challenge, right? I mean, Americans aren't perceiving that right now. They don't feel good about the economy, and a lot of them put that blame on the party in power.CONANT: Of course. I mean, I think the president always owns the economy. And look, Americans still remember when - what prices were like before the inflation that we've had over the last three or four years. But inflation is basically over. The White House and the Fed, I think, have done a good job of getting a handle on it. We've seen very low inflation to the point where the Fed is now cutting interest rates. That, coupled with strong GDP growth, continued low unemployment - the hope is that by next November, Americans are feeling much better about the economy, and Republicans will benefit from that at the polls.FADEL: Interesting. So this now-weakness may turn into a strength in the new year. You know, we're going into 2026, and that means another deadline that could lead to a government shutdown. If that were to happen - you know, last time we saw the Republican approach, which was to wait it out and blame the Democrats for the situation, which kind of worked. If Congress faces another government shutdown at the end of January, how do you expect House Speaker Mike Johnson to approach messaging for his party and for the public?CONANT: Well, as you said, the last time the government shut down for 40-plus days, Democrats suffered the most, and they ended up caving completely to reopen it. I'm not sure Democrats want to repeat that and shut down the government again, and I know Congress is working very hard to pass bipartisan...FADEL: Right. But I think both parties suffered - right? - when it came to perception with the American public. People were angry at Washington. So would simply blaming the Democrats again be as effective?CONANT: Well, it takes two parties to shut down the government, right? And so I don't think Republicans are interested in shutting it down. I don't know that Democrats are interested in shutting it down, but I think you're right, there is going to be a big funding deadline at the end of January. I think right now, both parties see value in not shutting down the government. But if it does shut down, of course, parties are going to - people are going to blame both parties. It's also, I think, why you're seeing so many - both Republicans and Democrats - I think there's 40-plus, 50-plus members of Congress who are not returning next year. You might see more retirements if we shut down the government, simply because it's not a fun place to be.FADEL: I want to talk about the fissures we've been seeing in the party. I mean, we saw that Mike Johnson really didn't have full control of his caucus in the last few months. I mean, do you expect him to remain speaker in the year ahead?CONANT: I do expect him to remain speaker simply because nobody else wants the job. It's got to be one of the worst jobs in America, especially with a majority as slim as his. But you're right. You're seeing, you know, just a lot of unhappiness, I think, within Congress, and especially within the Republican conference. And you're also starting to see some of the battles over the future of the Republican Party that have been under the surface for the last few years. They're starting to come up as we get closer to President Trump being a truly lame duck president.FADEL: What happens to the party when President Trump's no longer at the top of the ballot? Is there a clear leader of the future of this party?CONANT: There's not. I mean, I think a lot of people would look to JD Vance, but President Trump's political support has never been transferable. It's why we've lost every election that he hasn't been at the top of the ballot in the last decade. So I think it's an open question as to who will be our next leader, and what does that coalition look like? It could be JD Vance, but I think there's a lot of others that are considering running as well.FADEL: Republican strategist Alex Conant. Thank you so much for your time.CONANT: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

So congressional Republicans started the year with these ambitious plans to pass bills, to strengthen the economy, address the border crisis, boost the military. Did any of that happen?GRISALES: Not exactly, unless you look at their marquee tax and spending plan they called the One Big Beautiful Bill, which became law. They would argue that is the key legislation that passed, but the jury's still out if this is going to have the advertised impact on the economy. And it was the exception to the rule. Congress ceded a lot of its power to the president this year. That included dismantling large sections of the federal government, taking over the power of the purse during the government shutdown by directing spending that was prohibited at that time and triggering the clawback of billions of spending that had been approved by Congress. And as you mentioned, we heard from public affairs network C-SPAN. They reported the number of laws enacted this year are at that all-time low.FADEL: Now, Republicans are the majority in both the House and Senate, but that is very narrow. How did leaders fare in 2025?GRISALES: Yeah. It definitely made it more difficult for them. In the House, we saw Speaker Mike Johnson lose more control of his conference. By year-end, he faced a rare series of successful discharge petitions. These are bipartisan efforts by rank-and-file members to bypass the speaker and pass law. And none was more noteworthy than the one securing the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. He also saw Republican pushback when he virtually closed the house down during the 43-day government shutdown. He's facing a record number of House retirements. That includes nearly 30 Republicans.FADEL: OK, so some division within his own party. What about the Senate? How did Majority Leader John Thune fare in comparison?GRISALES: Well, he didn't end the year with the same level of animosity, but he saw challenges, too. I asked him about lessons learned. Here's what he told me.JOHN THUNE: You know, I mean, sometimes you get frustrated that you don't get the things done you want to get done. But you got to keep trying there.GRISALES: Ultimately, the Senate approved a majority of Trump's nominees for the administration and federal courts. But not until recently did we see more Senate Republicans push back publicly on the president with some issues, such as the strikes on alleged drug traffickers at sea. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told me these challenges and the chaos we've seen with the federal government, the economy, Trump's tariff policies have all created an opening for Democrats.FADEL: Now, Congress will face even greater challenges next year with the midterms on tap. What do you expect to see?GRISALES: Well, lawmakers have their eye on exactly those midterms in November. Even with Republicans redistricting to add seats in the House, it's still not clear they're going to keep their majority. They face the prospect of another government shutdown threat in January, and that's in addition to calls for Washington to address an affordability crisis that we expect will dominate on the campaign trail. And there's also those spiking premiums for health insurance after Congress failed to extend subsidies for Obamacare plans. This is going to likely add fuel to the fire that Congress is not addressing a lot of urgent issues for American families come November.FADEL: That's NPR's Claudia Grisales.

    "body": "\n      Wendy Sherman, a former ambassador who has served under three presidential administrations, analyzes President Trump's approach to foreign policy this year.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Throughout the year, the Trump administration has argued that it was bringing a dealmaker's mindset to foreign policy, that everything is a transaction. So does that approach to foreign policy work? We're going to discuss this with someone who has a long career of negotiating for the U.S. Ambassador Wendy Sherman is the former U.S. deputy secretary of state and has served three presidents throughout her career. Thank you for joining us.WENDY SHERMAN: I'm delighted to be with you all.FADEL: So, Ambassador, this president's approach to foreign policy, as we said, has been repeatedly called transactional - to fulfill his America First agenda. As you look at this past year, is what you saw illustrative of a transactional foreign policy? And is that the right approach?SHERMAN: I think it is probably a good description of what we have seen. Transactional is not always a bad thing.FADEL: Yeah.SHERMAN: Of course, in any negotiation, you're trying to understand everybody's interests and what they need, what you can give and what you can get. But what is different in this administration is a very go-it-alone, bilateral approach - not one that uses all of the elements of American power, all of the alliances and points of leverage that we have, but rather approaching this as if one's trying to build a building and get an agreement from the zoning authority. And that doesn't work so well in diplomacy.FADEL: You know, we've watched this president sometimes treat allies like enemies, publicly threatening, publicly bullying if he doesn't get what he wants. But he's gotten some things done - a Gaza deal that hasn't exactly brought peace, but has ended the worst of the violence. He touts a slew of other peace deals between feuding countries - Armenia and Azerbaijan, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Is this approach of transactional deal-making working?SHERMAN: Well, I think the issue is whether any deal is sustainable. We've already seen the Rwanda and Democratic Republic of Congo break down. Yes, I'm very glad that there is, in essence, a ceasefire in terms of Gaza. But we are seeing the building of more settlements in the West Bank. We're seeing...FADEL: And people are still being killed pretty much every day in Gaza.SHERMAN: Yes, indeed. So, yes, there have been some at least short-term successes, and we all want peace. But is it sustainable? And if we get in trouble, will we have burnt all of our relationships with our allies so that they won't come to our defense?FADEL: Ambassador, I mean, you've negotiated some of the most consequential U.S. deals, including the Iran nuclear deal under President Obama, which the Trump administration actually described as being transactional and then, during his first administration, pulled out of it. But I'm wondering, as somebody who has been involved in these delicate negotiations with foes, what is the line between maximizing leverage and eroding trust?SHERMAN: Well, look. The Iran nuclear deal was not about, actually, a negotiation among equals in the sense that we and our European colleagues and Russia and China were all working to make sure that Iran never got a nuclear weapon. So it really had to take into account what everyone was trying to get done and ensure that Iran would never get a nuclear weapon. Well, so this is why it is a complex process.And so far, we've seen - let's take the Ukraine example. Ukraine was illegally and horrifically invaded by Russia, and the president sent a friend and a dealmaker to meet with the Russians and to meet with the Ukrainians. But in fact, we know from a recent Wall Street Journal article that Putin, who is a well-versed KGB prior agent, really focused on Witkoff because he thought that he could manage him and manipulate him. And it appears that has been the case. Witkoff and Kushner, the president's son-in-law, are saying that they've had constructive meetings with Russia. But Russia is singing a different tune, and our intelligence community is affirming that, in fact, Putin still wants all of Ukraine. So we're not at that deal that the president said he could get...FADEL: Yeah.SHERMAN: ...Done in Day 1 because he needs a team to do it and not just a couple of guys who think they know best.FADEL: So if you were advising the president on this issue, what would you say to him?SHERMAN: I would say to Witkoff and Kushner, take that intelligence briefing so you really know what you're up against. Use the team that's been put together for you to support you. Listen to them. Talk to your partners. I'm glad to hear that the president spoke with the prime minister of the U.K. recently, that he's been on the phone with the president of France, because, in fact, we all are going to have to deal with the consequences and are dealing with the consequences of what is happening or won't happen here. And for the administration to always remember this is not about a negotiation among equals. Yes, Putin has a lot of power. But this is about someone who illegally invaded a sovereign country.FADEL: Ambassador Wendy Sherman is the former U.S. deputy secretary of state. Thank you so much for your time.SHERMAN: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Leila Fadel asks Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna of California about lawmakers' demands that the Justice Department release more files related to Jeffrey Epstein.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  OK. Now we turn to one of the members of Congress who co-sponsored the legislation that's forcing the release of these documents from the Department of Justice related to Jeffrey Epstein. Ro Khanna is a Democrat from California. Congressman, thank you for being back on the program, and good morning.RO KHANNA: Good morning.FADEL: So you've called this most recent release a bombshell, and you cite in particular one reference to 10 co-conspirators. What are you looking at in the files that you see as a bombshell?KHANNA: The fact that there is an email saying there are 10 co-conspirators means that there are other rich and powerful men who were involved. A lot of the skeptics have said that this is a hoax - that only Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell were involved in the abuse. I know from talking to the survivors that's not true. They have named other men who either went to the rape island, abused them or covered up for that abuse. This is in the statements to the FBI, the 302 statements, and that is what we're pushing to have released. But we got an email at least saying there were 10 other co-conspirators.FADEL: Now, you said - to expand on what you're wanting to be released, you've said you want to see the FBI witness interviews, which names other men, the Epstein emails seized from his computers, the 60-count draft indictment and the 82-page prosecution memo. You know, just tell me what you're looking for in these particular documents that you want, that is leading for you to want them to be public. Like, what are you looking for in these documents?KHANNA: The most important are the FBI witness interviews. I know from survivors and survivors' lawyers that when they had these conversations with FBI agents, they specifically named other men who they were trafficked to...FADEL: Yeah.KHANNA: ...Or who showed up at the island or who covered up for this abuse. And there were lawyers of the survivors present there. There are dozens of these interview memorandums. The DOJ has not released a single one. In fact, in one case, the DOJ released a survivor's name illegally, but they had not released the file that the survivor wanted. The 60-count draft indictment shows how much the prosecution of Epstein was botched. They only prosecuted him for two counts. So we need that. And the emails on the computer that Jeffrey Epstein had that are - those are his emails to other men, arranging for trafficking, arranging for flights to the island. None of that has come out.FADEL: We are now long past last Friday's deadline for releasing all the files that was set by your legislation. What do you make of the DOJ's argument that it takes time because they need to examine each document to avoid inadvertently identifying victims?KHANNA: Well, frankly, they haven't done a good job. I mean, they've inadvertently released too many survivors. But both Thomas Massie and I have said we are less hung up on the time issue. We are more concerned about them complying with the spirit of the law in good faith, and they haven't done that. If they released some 302 FBI witness interview memorandum, that would be fine. If they released the 60-count draft indictment, that would be fine. That doesn't take a lot of time, and the law explicitly calls for them to release internal communication about charging or not. So they are protecting people, and the president's made it clear who they're trying to protect. He's concerned that people will be harmed with their reputation - that they're bankers and powerful politicians who are in these files. And that is true, and that's the purpose of the law, to have public accountability for them. But the DOJ seems intent on protecting them, frankly, more than the survivors.FADEL: Now, both you and Republican Thomas Massie, the co-sponsor of this legislation, have talked about bringing, quote, \"inherent contempt\" proceedings against Attorney General Pam Bondi. What would that look like? What is inherent contempt?KHANNA: Well, we have Republican support - some Republican support for it as well. We would give the attorney general a 30-day grace period to continue to release documents to be in compliance. And after those 30 days, there would start to be a $5,000 fine on her personally for the documents that she is not releasing. We also plan to go to the Southern District of New York, asking the judge who ordered these releases to have a special master see what should be redacted or not or to create a congressional committee, a bipartisan committee, to see what should be redacted or not.FADEL: Is it realistic, though, that something like this would pass the House? I mean, inherent contempt charges haven't passed in the House against anyone since the 1930s, and this House in particular seems unable to agree on much.KHANNA: Well, people thought it was very unrealistic for us to get the discharge petition passed. That also has not passed for decades. We do know we have some Republican support. And the point is that, given we have Republican support, the Justice Department started to backtrack. An hour after Massie and I announced that they started to release redacted documents in an unredacted form, they did a second release of documents that had that email about the 10 co-conspirators. They are...FADEL: We'll have to leave it there. Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna, thank you. He is the co-sponsor of the Epstein Files Transparency Act.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "\n      President Trump began the year with huge plans and a GOP in lockstep, but heading into 2026 there are cracks in his support that could affect how much his administration gets done.   \n\n    SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  Of course, 2026 is just days away - a time to look backward at the year that was and forward to the year to come. NPR senior contributor Ron Elving has been thinking about the state of U.S. politics since President Donald Trump returned to power. And, of course, Ron is completely up to the task of looking both backward and forward. Ron, thanks so much for being with us.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.SIMON: I asked you last year what you were watching for in 2025, and you advised, buckle up. You some kind of psychic?ELVING: If I were Scott, maybe I could find my cellphone more easily. But you didn't need paranormal powers to see Trump's second term would be anything but normal, even by the standards of his first term when he got impeached twice and indicted on both state and federal charges. Yet he came back, and despite all that. And there's little chance he's going to be cowed by threats of consequences this time around.The balance between Trump's impulses and the restraints on his power was more conventional the first time around. He was finding his way for a while, relying more on people who knew the Washington way or were well established on their own in government or in the Republican Party. This time around, we have a Cabinet and White House staff dominated by dedicated enablers, willing to carry out orders the way Trump has always thought all his employees should.SIMON: But there are cracks in what have been the president's support in his own party - over Ukraine, the economy, the Epstein files. Do you see those divisions widening?ELVING: The conventional wisdom says the closer we get to the midterms, the more we will see vulnerable Republicans distance themselves from Trump on health care, on food prices or various other issues. That happens to any president who is down in the polls halfway through a term. Of course, there could be events, as there were in other midterm years, such as 2002 or 1998. Those reversed the usual dynamic.But the elections coming in '26 are not the only source of stress in Trump's movement. There are tremendous divisions among some of his reporters who are not officeholders, especially among the cultural activists and people in the media - the podcasters and online influencers, the ones who have provided so much of the heat around Trump. They're at odds with each other over Israel, over Epstein, over Venezuela, and they're battling over who gets the MAGA megaphone when Trump begins to fade.SIMON: One of the defining features of the second Trump administration is how it regards or disregards the rule of law. What are your thoughts?ELVING: This term has featured serious policy shifts, like the Trump tariffs and the deportation drive and the military strikes, without congressional approval. We also see a lot of personal retribution against Trump's political enemies and provocative displays of will, such as the partial demolition of the White House and the Trump rebranding of the Kennedy Cultural Arts Center and the Institute of Peace.In all of this, we see a willingness to test the boundaries, try the locks on the doors, see what's open, see what happens and ultimately to see who will step up to enforce the law. In the year to come, we can expect these confrontations to continue and quite possibly escalate.SIMON: What will you be looking at especially closely next year?ELVING: Once again, this year, the focus will be on Trump, not just what he does and what he says and what he spreads online. The focus will also be on how he looks and acts and behaves in highly personal ways. We've already seen a lot of this attention, especially in the visual and social media. The president turns 80 on June 14. He's planning a lot of high-profile events around his birthday, but he would not need those events to bring attention to his age. Are people going to be asking, is this the same Trump? Does he still have his famous mojo? And when the midterms have passed, the spotlight must inevitably shift to the question of succession.SIMON: NPR senior contributor, Ron Elving. Thanks so much, my friend. Happy New Year.ELVING: Thank you, Scott. Happy New Year to you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The group, 11 Democrats and a Republican, told Acting Inspector General Don Berthiaume in a letter that victims \"deserve full disclosure\" and the \"peace of mind\" of an independent audit.   The Justice Department said in a social media post that federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the FBI \"have uncovered over a million more documents\" that could be related to the Epstein case — a stunning 11th hour development after department officials suggested months ago that they had undertaken a comprehensive review that accounted for the vast universe of Epstein-related materials.   \n   In March, Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News that a \"truckload of evidence\" had been produced after she ordered the FBI to \"deliver the full and complete Epstein files to my office.\" She issued the directive after saying she learned from an unidentified source that the FBI in New York was \"in possession of thousands of pages of documents.\"   In July, the FBI and Justice Department indicated in an unsigned memo that they had undertaken an \"exhaustive review\" and had determined that no additional evidence should be released — an extraordinary about face from the Trump administration, which for months had pledged maximum transparency. The memo did not raise the possibility that additional evidence existed that officials were unaware of or had not reviewed.   Wednesday's post did not say when the Justice Department was informed of the newly uncovered files.   \n   In a letter last week, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Manhattan federal prosecutors already had more than 3.6 million records from sex trafficking investigations into Epstein and his longtime confidant Ghislaine Maxwell, though many were copies of material already turned over by the FBI.   The Justice Department said its lawyers are \"working around the clock\" to review the documents and remove victims names and other identifying information as required by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the law enacted last month that requires the government to open its files on Epstein and Maxwell.   \n   \"We will release the documents as soon as possible,\" the department said. \"Due to the mass volume of material, this process may take a few more weeks.\"   The announcement came amid increasing scrutiny on the Justice Department's staggered release of Epstein-related records, including from Epstein victims and members of Congress.   Republican Rep. Thomas Massie, of Kentucky, one of the chief authors of the law mandating the document release, posted Wednesday on X: \"DOJ did break the law by making illegal redactions and by missing the deadline.\" Another architect of the law, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said he and Massie will \"continue to keep the pressure on\" and noted that the Justice Department was releasing more documents after lawmakers threatened contempt.   \"A Christmas Eve news dump of 'a million more files' only proves what we already know: Trump is engaged in a massive coverup,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said after the DOJ's announcement. \"The question Americans deserve answered is simple: WHAT are they hiding — and WHY?\"   \n   The White House on Wednesday defended the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein records.   \"President Trump has assembled the greatest cabinet in American history, which includes Attorney General Bondi and her team — like Deputy Attorney General Blanche — who are doing a great job implementing the President's agenda,\" spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement.   After releasing an initial wave of records on Friday, the Justice Department posted more batches to its website over the weekend and on Tuesday. The Justice Department has not given any notice when more records might arrive.   Records that have been released, including photographs, interview transcripts, call logs, court records and other documents, were either already public or heavily blacked out, and many lacked necessary context. Records that hadn't been seen before include transcripts of grand jury testimony from FBI agents who described interviews they had with several girls and young women who described being paid to perform sex acts for Epstein.   \n   Other records made public in recent days include a note from a federal prosecutor from January 2020 that said Trump had flown on the financier's private plane more often than had been previously known and emails between Maxwell and someone who signs off with the initial \"A.\" They contain other references that suggest the writer was Britain's former Prince Andrew. In one, \"A\" writes: \"How's LA? Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?\"   The senators' call Wednesday for an inspector general audit comes days after Schumer introduced a resolution that, if passed, would direct the Senate to file or join lawsuits aimed at forcing the Justice Department to comply with the disclosure and deadline requirements. In a statement, he called the staggered, heavily redacted release \"a blatant cover-up.\"   \n   Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., in leading the call for an inspector general audit. Others signing the letter were Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota., Adam Schiff of California, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Cory Booker and Andy Kim, both of New Jersey, Gary Peters of Michigan, Chris Van Hollen, of Maryland, Mazie Hirono, of Hawaii, and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island.   \"Given the (Trump) Administration's historic hostility to releasing the files, politicization of the Epstein case more broadly, and failure to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a neutral assessment of its compliance with the statutory disclosure requirements is essential,\" the senators wrote. Full transparency, they said, \"is essential in identifying members of our society who enabled and participated in Epstein's crimes.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      In his first year back in office, President Trump has made clear that America First is far from isolationist, instead it means aggressive use of the country's unilateral power around the world.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  In a few minutes, we'll hear what a career diplomat thinks about President Trump's approach to foreign policy in his first year. Before we do that, though, we look at the facts. The president recently ordered a blockade on all oil tankers into and out of Venezuela that are on U.S. sanctions lists - a dramatic escalation of his pressure campaign against the government of President Nicolas Maduro. It's just one of the latest examples of Trump's aggressive use of power in the region and around the world as he seeks to reshape the global order to U.S. preferences, or at least his own preferences.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I've restored American strength, settled eight wars in 10 months, destroyed the Iran nuclear threat and ended the war in Gaza, bringing, for the first time in 3,000 years, peace to the Middle East.FADEL: Now, that's a lot of exaggeration, but it has been a busy year on the foreign policy front, and here to talk about this is NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez. Hi, Franco.FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: Hey, Leila.FADEL: Trump campaigned in this idea of ending forever wars, America First, and he's seen as more transactional, having a limited view of when the U.S. needs to engage globally. But in his second term, there's been a lot of focus overseas, right?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, since taking office, he's used tariffs as a weapon against allies, declared war on drug cartels, secured the release of hostages in Gaza, and also cozied up to Russian president Vladimir Putin. He's painted European partners as weak and disdains alliances. Stewart Patrick, who served in the George W. Bush State Department and is now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, he told me that Trump has taken aim at the post-Cold War order of economic institutions and alliances and basically redefined it through an America First lens.STEWART PATRICK: The way I have sometimes described is on the eve of America's 250th anniversary, Trump has launched a second American Revolution. He's declared independence from the world that the United States created.ORDOÑEZ: Now, the White House told me that Trump's acting on his promises to advance American interests, delivering fair-trade deals, pushing allies to increase their defense spending, killing narco terrorists - that's their words - while ending global conflicts around the world to make the world safer.FADEL: At the same time, you see in his moves and his statements how Trump really seems to be wanting to divide the world between major powers.ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, he really does see the world through spheres of influence. I mean, Trump's even cited the Monroe Doctrine in saying that he wants to reassert U.S. dominance in the Western Hemisphere. And that's a big break from past administrations that's prioritized other regions while also confronting the big powers like Russia and China. Trump's instead sought to curry favor with Russia, as we've reported, in a bid to try to end the war in Ukraine.FADEL: Is this where his actions in Venezuela play a role - not only the oil tankers, but these deadly and very controversial drug boat strikes?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, and also on immigration and the military buildup in the Caribbean, also the controversial $20 billion bailout of Argentina, Trump's made very clear that he wants the U.S. to be the most influential power in the hemisphere and not China or Russia.FADEL: But isn't China already playing a big role in the hemisphere?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, very much so. Benjamin Gedan, who handled the South America portfolio in the Obama White House, told me that Beijing has been eating America's lunch for decades, and they do this through trade and investment, trying to be an appealing partner.BENJAMIN GEDAN: Latin America has a lot of problems right now, and the United States really could help. But the policy prescription right now is just bad medicine. It's bringing a military-first approach to a region that needs investment, it needs trade and it needs help for its law enforcement agencies to be able to fight organized crime. None of those are tasks for an aircraft carrier.ORDOÑEZ: Now, Gedan says the U.S. could instead be building bridges, working to be a partner of choice and not the partner who is feared, which it is now.FADEL: That's White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez. Thank you, Franco.ORDOÑEZ: Thank you, Leila.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n    DAVE DAVIES, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies. If you watched the televised hearings of the select congressional committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, you probably remember the dramatic testimony of former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson. Officials of the U.S. Department of Justice who were investigating Donald Trump's alleged interference in the 2020 election were watching, too. But at the time, they had no idea who Cassidy Hutchinson was.That's one of many striking revelations you'll find in the new book by our guests, veteran investigative reporters Carol Leonnig and Aaron Davis. Leonnig and Davis write about Donald Trump's powerful impact on the Justice Department, including his efforts to protect friends and punish those he considers enemies. But much of the book focuses on the Biden years, when Trump wasn't in charge and the Justice Department pursued investigations into the violence on January 6 and, eventually, into Trump's alleged interference in the 2020 election and his retention of thousands of government documents.Their account is a bracingly clear explanation of why those efforts failed to get either case against Trump in front of a jury before his reelection rendered them moot. It's largely a story of officials acting in good faith, trying to adhere to standards of fairness and nonpartisanship - perhaps too rigorously at times. The authors say Trump's targeting of prosecutors and FBI agents in his first term in office likely played a role in the department's caution.Carol Leonnig worked for 25 years at The Washington Post. She's won or shared in five Pulitzer Prizes and has written two books about Donald Trump and another about the U.S. Secret Service. Leonnig left The Post earlier this year and is now a senior investigative correspondent for MSNBC. Aaron Davis is an investigative reporter for The Washington Post. He's won two Pulitzer Prizes and reported from 14 countries. He was lead reporter and writer for an investigative series on the January 6 attack, which won the George Polk Award and, with other Post coverage, the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. Leonnig and Davis' new book is \"Injustice: How Politics And Fear Vanquished America's Justice Department.\" We recorded our conversation last Thursday.Well, Carol Leonnig, Aaron Davis, welcome to FRESH AIR. You know, Trump was charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States and related charges, you know, related to his alleged interference in the 2020 election. We will never know what a jury would have made of the charges and the evidence because it never went to trial. But part of that is because the Department of Justice didn't get moving on that investigation quickly - not really until well into 2023. But it's interesting. I learned in your book that very early after the election, before the January 6 attack, a woman in government, Waleska McLellan, flagged what looked like a coordinated campaign to subvert the election results. Tell us who she was, what she did.CAROL LEONNIG: I'm impressed, Dave. That is a good find in the book and a scoop that Aaron and I were both really struck by when we came across it in reporting for this book. Waleska McLellan was a top investigator in a little-known inspector general's office for the National Archives. And in December of 2020, after Donald Trump has lost the election to Joe Biden, she is presented with a series of certificates from people that are not the secretary of state in various states - swing states - in which unusual signatures are given that suggest there are alternate electors who are going to challenge whether Biden actually won the election in their swing state.And she begins to review these with her fellow investigators and then decides the best thing to do is to go to the Justice Department, a prosecutor team that she knows in D.C., and ask them, doesn't this look funny to you? Doesn't this look coordinated? Because all of the certificates kind of have a boilerplate, ticky-tacky similarity, and they are not official. And she's wondering, is this a conspiracy? Is this a crime?DAVIES: Right. And she's from the National Archives, right? So these are obviously very important official government documents. She sees they look fishy, and she talks to the prosecutors. Looks like maybe this is not one or two people. There was a coordinated effort here. What does she hear from the prosecutors?LEONNIG: She goes to a prosecutor that she knows from a previous briefing named J.P. Cooney. And he says, sorry, sorry, I've been busy. I'll connect you with one of my team. And the prosecutor underneath J.P. Cooney tells Waleska McLellan, you know, this just doesn't seem like something that we would pursue. Of course, that office of prosecutors in D.C. are completely slammed with what? Investigating the violent attack on the Capitol and pursuing hundreds of people who were engaged in either breaching the Capitol and also violence, violent acts against police officers that day. They are swamped, and they basically turn her down and tell her maybe she should pursue this with some state investigators.AARON DAVIS: Just to add to what Carol said, these fake elector documents were really important in that moment, in January 6, because Donald Trump uses this as a pretense to say that Vice President Pence can actually do something different and not certify Joe Biden that day. And it's part of the thing that some of the rioters are talking about in the crowd - you know, Pence should do this. And so these were - this was a real, live issue, and, you know, here it was that Waleska had seen this and spotted it beforehand.DAVIES: There was another point not that much later when departments who were looking into the January 6 attacks began to see evidence which suggested coordination between some extremist groups and close allies of Donald Trump, like Roger Stone, for example. And they wanted to look further into this, subpoena records. What were they hoping to do?DAVIS: Well, this is a really interesting point, right? So right after Biden is successfully inaugurated - and it's hard to go back and think about this, but there was even some concern inside the Department of Justice as to whether that could happen peacefully. They wanted to arrest as many of these rioters as they could beforehand, worrying that there would be violence on that day.But once they get through that inauguration, there's a group of prosecutors inside the U.S. attorney's office in D.C. who say, we should really form a task force to broaden this beyond the rioters, to look at what is the connective tissue between the people who went in the building that day and the people around Trump who were talking about needing, you know, to go tell the members of Congress to have some backbone and do what they needed to do that day. And so they put together a PowerPoint presentation. And again, this is - Cooney is one of the prosecutors in the room.DAVIES: That's J.P. Cooney, who is an aggressive prosecutor. Yeah.DAVIS: Yeah. J.P. Cooney presents to FBI agents a plan to, you know, look at people like Roger Stone, who is in the and outside the Willard Hotel the night before the January 6 attack with members of the Oath Keepers and begin to question, what are they doing there? What are they doing? Were they talking? Who else were they talking to?And this is immediately met with some pushback by the interim team that Joe Biden has put in charge of the Department of Justice. And they say, way, whoa. We're not going to investigate people. We're investigating this crime of the riot that just happened outside the Capitol. And that is a moment that really sets the tone and sets the direction of this investigation for a long time to come, after Garland is seated a couple months later. But they really are opposed to looking at people and want to look at what happened at - in the crowd in the riot and work their way back up from there.DAVIES: Right. And these prosecutors wanted to do things like who was booked at the Willard Hotel during what days. And, you know, there are kind of issues of, well, privacy. If somebody wasn't engaged in a crime, you know, where they stay overnight isn't necessarily anybody's business. And then maybe First Amendment concerns. I mean, you know, it's legal to advocate even strongly against the government.DAVIS: Yeah, this comes up at one point in time with then the head of the Washington Field Office in the FBI, who says exactly that. You know, what if we catch somebody having a tryst at this hotel? I'm not going to subpoena. He literally says, I'm not going to subpoena the frigging Willard Hotel. I don't want to collect all this information and be accused of looking too broadly.DAVIES: We need to take a break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Carol Leonnig and Aaron Davis. They are both veteran investigative reporters. Their new book is titled \"Injustice: How Politics And Fear Vanquished America's Justice Department.\" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF THE INTERNET SONG, \"STAY THE NIGHT\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with veteran investigative reporters Carol Leonnig and Aaron Davis. They have a new book which looks at Donald Trump's impact on the U.S. Department of Justice, and in particular, why the case against Trump charging interference in the 2020 election never went to trial.This is a pattern that we see for the coming months where at various times, investigators and prosecutors see connections that might suggest a wider conspiracy, even the president being involved, in trying to deliberately subvert the results of the elections. And there's resistance. And, you know, one element of this might be the new Attorney General Merrick Garland, who, you know, he had strong feelings about the independence and fairness of the Justice Department. Tell us about his approach and how it affected all this.LEONNIG: Merrick Garland was an extremely respected jurist for his many years - I believe 24 years - on the federal bench, had a wealth of experience in the law, was fastidious and methodical. But as attorney general, even the people who really admired him and worked for him, some of them told us they were concerned about how allergic he seemed to even the whiff of looking like anything he did was political. And he said this publicly. I'm paraphrasing him a little, but he said, you know, it's not enough to be apolitical. We also have to be sure people believe and that we appear to be above politics. That guided everything in that first year. Garland believed that looking directly at Trump or Trump allies would create that improper whiff.He wanted to go back to a playbook created in the wake of Watergate in which the Department of Justice siloed itself from the White House, siloed itself from politics and tried to have this incredibly pristine, almost priestly independence. The problem was that not looking at this evidence delayed things for a long time. He kept saying he wanted to find out if there was some connection between Trump and the riot. And ultimately, when the Department of Justice finally agrees to launch this investigation, it's not based on evidence that they gained in the riot probe. It's based on evidence that had been public, at least that's what they formally cite in their documents. Evidence that had been public since December of 2020, January of 2021, February of 2021.DAVIES: Yeah, so what changed in the year?LEONNIG: The critical change was the House select committee. News was leaking out of that unusual team of very, very aggressive prosecutors like a sieve. And in January, there were a host of stories about the committee figuring out that these fake elector certificates were critical and that they were coordinated, or appeared to be coordinated, by Rudy Giuliani and members of Trump's campaign. And that discovery was extremely embarrassing to the Department of Justice, Aaron and I learned in our interviews. And we uncovered an email exchange in which a federal prosecutor, who had been belatedly assigned alone to look into this potential linkage to Donald Trump's allies, reaches out to that Waleska McLellan days after these barrage of stories are raising questions. Where is the Department of Justice on this investigation? That happened in January of 2022, a year after Waleska McLellan had been turned down.DAVIES: This was Thomas Windom, who was transferred in from Maryland and suddenly said, we've got to look into a potential conspiracy here, right?LEONNIG: That's right.DAVIES: Yeah. You know, it's interesting that, you know, I've covered a lot of federal criminal cases. And I've always found defense attorneys can be chatty. They can be good sources. I never could get anything out of federal prosecutors that wasn't in the public record. You talked to a lot of agents and a lot of former prosecutors. Was it easy to get them to open up? Were they angry about what had happened?DAVIS: You're right, Dave. It's never easy to get federal prosecutors...LEONNIG: (Laughter).DAVIS: ...To talk about just about anything. I will say, just on the broad picture for a second, it's the fact that we were able to tell some of these stories, that people wanted to talk about this kind of speaks to this moment and how important folks in law enforcement feel this is and what's going on inside the department. They're largely, I'd say, on the FBI side especially, a group that leans more conservative. And here, they're the ones telling us what is going on inside the department, what's been going on these many years we really need to, as a country, stand up and take a look and pay attention to. You know, we did not, still, even in that, have an easy time with prosecutors talking to us and telling us things. You know, we are very careful to protect sources in this book because, you know, in this current environment, anyone is a target.That said, there are some scenes that are pretty wild. And we found that you do end up with Thomas Windom on a park bench meeting with the head of the investigation for the House select committee. And they're comparing notes at one point in time with, you know, the head of the House select committee saying, you know, I'd like to start a relationship here so that we can share with you what we've found. You know, Thomas does not offer anything in that moment. But it goes to this point of, there was this period where, unbelievably almost, a year after January 6, Thomas Windom is the only prosecutor with the mandate to investigate if Donald Trump had done anything wrong in relation to January 6, and nobody knows it. He's like secretly, like, the most interesting man in Washington for a time. And, you know, we follow him in the book as he goes around and begins that investigation.DAVIES: Right. And the interesting thing is that once he, you know, takes on that task, he does impanel a grand jury, but he doesn't have an army of investigators, right? No agents assigned. And in order to get agents' permission - right? - to subpoena witnesses and records, there's a whole nother battle - right? - to get the FBI to go along.LEONNIG: Yeah, that's right. There is a incredible - I apologize for my language here - sphincter-tightening in the FBI, just such anxiety about launching on this probe. You know, when Thomas Windom goes to the Washington field office and meets with Steve D'Antuono, the head of that office, he says, look, this is the investigation now I'd like you to potentially join me in. And D'Antuono knows that, hey, this is actually a crime I can investigate, which is fascinating, since nobody saw that when Waleska McLellan proposed it.But he's thinking, OK. This is basic potential wire fraud, mail fraud. People sent in things. They actually signed them from various states and claimed to be the electors for their states when they were not, clearly. So he's seeing, like, OK. There's a potential crime. But at headquarters at FBI, Chris Wray, the director, his general counsel, their deputies are all poring over the documents of, how are we going to later justify in writing that we are investigating Donald Trump?And here's the killer on that one. What we learned and nobody had reported at the time was that the anxiety was so high, they ultimately concluded they wouldn't name Donald Trump as a subject. But they would name Donald Trump's campaign as a subject, along with Rudy Giuliani and some other advisers that they knew were involved in this coordination.DAVIES: And I wonder how much of this, you know, arguably excessive caution on the part of senior FBI officials and some senior justice officials is attributed to the experience during Trump's first term when he - you know, he intervened directly. I mean, he wanted them to indict, you know, the former deputy director of the FBI, and he wanted them to give Roger Stone a lower sentence, and there were real battles over that. People felt bruised, I guess.DAVIS: It's really true. You know, it's - we're so far from it, but this is a big reason of why we started to report and work on the book, which is that we had written a couple stories, Carol and I, back in 2023 about some of the slow start. And we didn't have the whole picture then, but we had some pieces of it. And, you know, we got some blowback from people inside the Department of Justice who said, hey, you don't know what it's been like in here during the first Trump term. And so as we set about writing a book, we said, well, let's try to capture that.And we went back over those years of the first Trump term. And as bad as it was and we saw in the headlines then, it was actually worse. I mean, there was more arm-twisting. There was more, you know, cajoling and trying to get, you know, prosecutors to sign things and go against what they thought was the right reading of the law. And the same on the FBI side as well. We got to a place where we wanted to be able to have everyone who reads the book understand, what is the Department of Justice - the condition that it's in - as the sun comes up on the morning of January 6? And if you can grasp that, then you can understand why they're so reticent and careful and slow in the years afterward.And when it comes to this particular point of really digging into the fake elector scheme and all the politicians around the country that become, you know, involved in that, you know, there is a - suddenly a recognition inside the department when they look at this and say, this is actually the heart of the scheme. And if we're going to go forward with this, there's going to have to be a lot of hands on the knife, is one of the quotes from inside a meeting inside DOJ - that, you know, everybody has to have buy-in. If we're going to go back and open an investigation into the president and the people around him, we have to have full buy-in here.DAVIES: We need to take a break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Carol Leonnig and Aaron Davis. They're veteran investigative reporters. Their new book is \"Injustice: How Politics And Fear Vanquished America's Justice Department.\" I spoke to them last Thursday. We'll hear more of our conversation after this short break. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF JESSICA WILLIAMS' \"BIRKS WORKS\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies. We're listening to the interview I recorded last Thursday with veteran investigative reporters Carol Leonnig and Aaron Davis. Their new book is a detailed look at Donald Trump's impact on the U.S. Department of Justice. Much of the book focuses on Justice Department investigations during the Biden administration into Trump's alleged interference in the 2020 election and his allegedly illegal retention of government documents when he left the White House after his first term. The authors explore the reasons neither case made it to trial before Trump's reelection rendered them moot. Leonnig and Davis' book is \"Injustice: How Politics And Fear Vanquished America's Justice Department.\".You know, while the Justice Department was gearing up an investigation into the possibility of a conspiracy by Donald Trump and allies to undermine the results of the 2020 election, the congressional Select Committee on January 6 was moving full steam ahead, headed by, you know, Liz Cheney and Bennie Thompson of Mississippi. The Justice Department's prosecutors were way behind. At some point, when they realized they really wanted to investigate this, they approached the committee's staff and said, how about sharing with us all of your interviews with people so far? What was the response?LEONNIG: The clients, so to speak, meaning the lawmakers, the House members who were on the committee, did not want to share. And they made that very clear to their chief counsel, Tim Heaphy. They felt like, look, we're about to have televised hearings where we're going to report our findings after interviewing hundreds of people, being way ahead of the Justice Department. And we don't want to give up our scoop, so to speak, to the Department of Justice, which has been lagging.You know, the investigators on this team - Aaron and I found it so fascinating when we really pulled back the curtain on this team. There is this incredible group of investigators on the congressional team - mostly former prosecutors, a few lawyers - who Heaphy hires to help him figure out what happened. And the pace at which they are moving is devastatingly fast, especially compared to the Department of Justice. It's like the little U.S. attorney's office that could.Tim Heaphy, who is the chief counsel, is a former U.S. attorney with the Department of Justice. So his goal all along was, let's treat this like a real investigation. Let's get to the facts. And he actually has a conversation with Bennie Thompson, where - before he takes the job, where he goes, I'm not going to be comfortable if politics is going to influence the end results. I want our facts to drive the day. But in the end, those clients, the lawmakers - they do not want to turn over the goods. And they stiff-arm the Department of Justice, which now is trying to play catch-up.DAVIES: I remember moments in those televised hearings of the select congressional committee, like when we heard about these dramatic meetings in the Oval Office in December of 2020, when Donald Trump was trying to reverse the results of the election. And he wanted to appoint Jeffrey Clark, this conservative attorney who didn't really have the experience to lead the Justice Department. He wanted to make him attorney general, and a whole bevy of career lawyers threatened to resign en masse and shut that down. This was some amazing stuff. When the Justice Department investigators were watching all this on television, had they talked to those folks? Was this news to them?DAVIS: On that particular one, they'd talked to a couple of those folks for various reasons. But you are right that they were behind and, in some ways, learning a lot of what had happened in and around Donald Trump in the weeks before January 6 as they were watching television, much like the rest of America was. It was a very odd situation where you had a Department of Justice that had not yet really engaged with this investigation, and certainly not at the level and the intensity that the House select committee had done.So, you know, prosecutors are usually the ones who want to have the first interview with anyone involved in investigation. Here, you had a very complicated situation because House select committee investigators had been the first ones to go in and interview. And so it was a bit of a black hole - that the Justice Department didn't know what they were going to find and what was going to be said in some of these hearings when they became public.DAVIES: You know, normally, when federal prosecutors and their colleagues in the FBI investigate a - you know, a big white-collar case, they take their time. They build the facts. You know, they work from the inside to the out of a conspiracy, and they don't worry about time. In this particular case, the time that it would take mattered a lot. And, I mean, I just know from covering these things that major white-collar criminal cases take a long, long time to get to trial. These were experienced prosecutors. They knew that. Were they concerned that they were going to get to the point where Donald Trump's, you know, burgeoning presidential campaign, you know, for a second term was going to run into this trial schedule?LEONNIG: You know, Dave, Merrick Garland, the attorney general, really set the tone on this, which was, we're not doing anything because there's an election coming up. And we're not motivated or girded or pressed by an election calendar and the fact that Donald Trump is readying himself and making a lot of noise about running for reelection.Now, inside, Aaron and I learned that there were prosecutors worried about how much time was left on the clock. And this is a great moment to sort of compare Garland and the special counsel he would end up picking later, when Trump really did announce that he was going to run for reelection in November of 2022, because Jack Smith, that special counsel, said literally within the first week of meeting his new team, we got to set a calendar. How about in three months, we decide whether or not we can indict? That was on the classified documents case. In the others, he said, we have to triage to this. We have to get moving.His motivation was, as he articulated it to many people we interviewed - was, we can't let the American public sit out there with these incredible allegations of a potential coup, of a president potentially stoking violence to overturn a free and fair election. We can't let that wither out there in the countryside without resolving it in a fair court. And he also felt that it was really important for Donald Trump to not have those allegations laying out there. And so he was moving at a pace I have actually never seen in any DOJ prosecution of a complex case, much less one involving a former president.DAVIES: Right. And of course, Jack Smith was appointed after Donald Trump formally announced his candidacy for a second term.We need to take another break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Carol Leonnig and Aaron Davis, two investigative reporters. Their new book is \"Injustice: How Politics And Fear Vanquished America's Justice Department.\" We'll continue our conversation after this break. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF MARCO BENEVENTO'S \"GREENPOINT\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with investigative reporters Carol Leonnig and Aaron Davis. Their new book is a detailed look at Donald Trump's impact on the U.S. Department of Justice, and in particular, why the case against Trump charging interference in the 2020 election never went to trial.You know, the other moment here that's interesting is in September of '22, when the investigation is finally underway, Merrick Garland, the attorney general, freezes both investigations. Well, you explain why.DAVIS: Well, this was one. You know, there are delays that were known about how slow and cautious and careful things had been under Merrick Garland. But this is a new one. And that is, heading into the midterm elections - this is before Donald Trump announces that he's going to run for reelection. This is, you know, with members of Congress on the ballot. Merrick Garland decides that in effect, Donald Trump is now the de facto head of the Republican Party.And so for that reason, we should not continue with these investigations in an active way where any steps that we take could become known publicly or people could be seen coming into a grand jury room. And so we're going to take a pause. And this is a very common pause. It's actually a regulation, kind of, you know, best practice within the Department of Justice that for 60 days before an election to kind of have a quiet period and then not do anything that could impact voters as they go to the polls.LEONNIG: But not typically for a person who's not an actually named candidate.DAVIS: Exactly.DAVIES: Right. But what that meant was that, you know, dozens and dozens of agents, the spadework of, you know, filing subpoenas and interviewing witnesses, all that had to stop for a couple of months.DAVIS: There were a couple interviews that, you know, folks who are aware of this situation told us that, you know, they by that point in time did know and had indications that Donald Trump had shown people classified documents that he had retained in Mar-a-Lago, had been talking to people about them. And they wanted to go forward with these investigations and knock out those interviews as quickly as they could. And some of those did not take place then for months during that quiet period.DAVIES: So Garland eventually names Jack Smith as special counsel because once Donald Trump is a candidate, we can't have the attorney general of the guy he's running against trying to put him in jail. I mean, that appears to be a conflict. And I got to say, the stuff in the book about Jack Smith is very interesting, how when he's hired, he's in a hospital in - where was it, the Netherlands? He had a terrible leg injury and then manages to just push himself through and get all this done. They filed the election interference case in August of 2023. Now, that's a few months before the presidential election. And the judge, Judge Chutkan, sets a trial date for April of 2024, which is right in the middle of the primary campaign. That's just really not a good look, is it?(LAUGHTER)LEONNIG: No, it turns out to be a weapon that Donald Trump uses very effectively against the Justice Department and against Jack Smith. I mean, I want to underline something, if you don't mind, from what you said earlier, Dave, which is about Jack Smith when he's appointed. His leg is broken in multiple places. He's in so much pain that he's literally waking up other people in the hospital with some of his screams and he has to be moved out of that ward. And during this time, Garland calls him and says - would you take the job if I offer it to you tomorrow? - not realizing how damaged, how devastated, really, physically Jack Smith is.And there's a question about whether or not Jack can take the oath of office under all these painkillers he's taking. And he decides on his own to dismiss himself from the hospital, against medical advice, and stops taking the medication so he can properly take the oath without any question about his faculties. He goes on to push his team with incredible rigor to bring these cases. But back to your other point about this isn't a good look. It ends up being really terrible because even though Jack Smith and his team are sprinting to make decisions and to bring the cases they think are justified, Donald Trump is falsely claiming that the only reason he's being prosecuted now in 2023 with a trial in 2024 is because a left-wing, radical DOJ wants to help Biden block him from winning reelection.DAVIES: You know, on that point, you know, we haven't yet really talked about the documents case that grew from President Trump's taking a lot of documents from the White House, and then when asked for them back by the National Archives, you know, delaying and dissembling and misleading. And eventually, after a lot of painful soul-searching, they execute a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago. Nobody really knows how much effort they went to try and avoid that, but they do that. And, you know, Trump and his allies went crazy about, you know, this gestapo invading Donald Trump's private residence because he's their political target. And even agents of the FBI in many offices are sending angry emails. What are we doing, right? The Justice Department really kind of needed to explain itself.DAVIS: Well, Dave, this is a really interesting part of the book where you see just how different internally the election interference case is from the classified documents case. And the night after they do that search of Donald Trump's residence in Mar-a-Lago, the then Assistant Attorney General for National Security Matthew Olsen convenes this hasty conference call to talk about the documents that they've just gotten. And there's, you know, dozens of these and hundreds of pages.And he turns to this woman who's kind of considered the encyclopedia of the Justice Department when it comes to mishandled and classified documents, Julie Edelstein. And he says, what do we do now? And Julie turns to him and says, if it was anybody else, we would arrest him tomorrow. And it just kind of for me crystalized how the FBI, the agents, you know, these grizzled agents, who did not want to go back and step into an investigation against Donald Trump after everything that happened through a crossfire hurricane, felt compelled and had no choice in their minds to go forward with his investigation, that there was just too many really important documents, secrets of the government that had been left in the wind down there in Florida.DAVIES: The election interference case really went off the rails when the Trump team challenged the whole case by arguing that because Donald Trump was president when the alleged offenses occurred, he is immune from prosecution 'cause he was pursuing his official duties. The trial judge disagrees. An appeal court disagrees. But the Supreme Court kind of agrees, right? They say that if he was executing actions in pursuit of his core functions - this is rough language - that he is immune from prosecution. Now this, of course, could be further litigated, but essentially it means the end, right? Why?LEONNIG: You know, it's such a critical moment, and I think I'd like to take you into a couple of the rooms where it happened here because the Supreme Court, first off, immediately accelerates one case and postpones another. They accelerate a case in this junction in 2024 to hear an argument about whether or not Donald Trump should be disqualified and struck from the Colorado state ballot for reelection because he's been accused of insurrection, of being engaged in an insurrection and that insurrectionists can't run for president. The Supreme Court accelerates on an emergency basis hearing that case, but they decide at the same time not to rush on hearing the immunity case.And this causes consternation inside the Department of Justice, inside Jack Smith, the Special Counsel's office, and inside the chambers of trial Judge Tanya Chutkan, who's supposed to hear this case. She and her chief judge have been planning security for the event. But when they see the Supreme Court is slow walking a decision on immunity, she knows that there's going to have to be an appeal again of whatever decision they have. And they stop worrying about having a trial at that moment. They conclude that it's very unlikely, and they stop having their security meetings.The immunity decision, again, is really interesting by how it reverberates when it comes down in July of 2024 because inside Attorney General Merrick Garland's office, he is just shocked by the opinion and conveys to his aides, because he knows these justices personally, that they have to know that what they've written is wrong.DAVIS: That has - another effect of that decision is that there was by that point in time a document inside Jack Smith's office. There was a 100-page plan for how they were going to try Donald Trump for election interference. And so the folks in his office have to go back through and begin to red line and take out everything that they think could, you know, no longer be brought. And there were a lot of interesting things that they had, some that the public's never really heard about before. We have some details of the things that were taken out of that case that were going to be presented at trial.And that included a meeting way back at the beginning of COVID when Donald Trump was in a room with a bunch of Homeland Security and Election Security folks and they were telling him about all the improvements they'd done in election security. And by the accounts of people in that room, he says, great, we should have a press conference and tell everybody how secure the 2020 election is going to be. And obviously the COVID hits and press conference never happens, but it goes to the point of, you know, his understanding of election security evolved a whole lot over the course of 2020 and how secure it was after he ended up on the wrong side of the ballot numbers.DAVIES: So Donald Trump, you mean, he didn't want to declare that the election was secure.DAVIS: He never did. Yeah. They never had that press conference that was - that they had talked about and encouraged his administration to have.DAVIES: We need to take another break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Carol Leonnig and Aaron Davis, two investigative reporters. Their new book is \"Injustice: How Politics And Fear Vanquished America's Justice Department.\" We'll continue our conversation after this break. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF THE BUDOS BAND'S \"INTO THE FOG\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with investigative reporters Carol Leonnig and Aaron Davis. Their new book is a detailed look at Donald Trump's impact on the U.S. Department of Justice. The book is titled \"Injustice: How Politics And Fear Vanquished America's Justice Department.\"You know, as I looked over the book and looked at kind of the fact that the election interference case against Donald Trump, you know, it ultimately didn't get developed in time to come to trial. The delay was critical. But when you look at how and why it happened, in a lot of times it's just normal human stuff. I mean, like, the Justice Department was overwhelmed trying to prosecute the January 6 attackers and so, you know, it was distracted. And the Michigan attorney general had a problem with pursuing it maybe because she was a Democrat seeking reelection. There are just a lot of factors and considerations that imposed caution and led to the delay. But I'm wondering, you know, as you talk to FBI leaders about this now, do any of them express regret? Do they say, yes, we should have moved with urgency?DAVIS: I think the short answer is yes. There's several folks we've talked to for the book who feel terribly about how things have gone. You know, I think you have to stand back and realize that in so many ways, Donald Trump benefited from a very cautious, very cross your Ts and dot your Is Justice Department, benefit from the very things that are not now part of how the Justice Department operates, and that certainly, you know, he said he has no interest in affording his political enemies, that they're - you know, he calls them criminals and they should be subject to prosecution.There no doubt were a whole lot of human moments in the last many years where, you know, Merrick Garland comes into office thinking that - and telling people close to him that he feels like finally the fever of Trump in the first term has burst, you know, in the wake of January 6 and the country is finally going to turn as it did after Watergate and be ready to move forward together. And that was the moment he came into, and that's really, as best of our reporting shows, what he firmly believed. And so he felt like he had a lot of time, you know, that the country was heading in a different place.And so quickly it shifted. And Trump, his base rallied behind him. And so it was a very moving target that he was - the time that he was living through. But there's no doubt that it's a tragic point in time and, you know, in the calculus here of where things are, it's a point where you have to say that the Department of Justice is really only as good and as stable as the people who are there running it. And, you know, that has whiplashed a lot over the last 10 years of the period we cover.DAVIES: I want to ask a question that might be a little outside your lane, and you can pass if you want to, but I'm curious about it. You know, it strikes me that the American people deserved a chance to hear the evidence that the Justice Department had developed about Donald Trump's alleged interference and make a judgment. I mean, a jury, of course, would also make a judgment, you know, given the constraints of the trial and the legal arguments and all that. But it would have been a useful thing for the American public to really hear their case about what happened and hear Trump's defense. That didn't happen.But on the other hand, I think, realize, you know, anybody who saw the January 6 congressional hearing, you know, I don't know how you could see that and not be appalled by it. And it seemed there was a very persuasive case that Trump sought to overturn the results of a fair election. But it sure doesn't seem that a majority of American voters believe that, right? I mean, and I just wonder, do you think it would have made a difference in terms of his electability, in terms of how the American people feel about him if there had been a trial?LEONNIG: You know, we actually - at the Washington Post, when I was there, there was a decent amount of polling we were doing trying to talk to our readers and also just citizens across America about whether or not an indictment and a trial would impact their view of Trump if they were already Trump supporters. And some of them said it would change things for them to see that evidence. But remember, we're reporters who weren't rooting for a particular president. We weren't trying to push for one thing or another. But we know from our reporting how devastating the failure to get this before the American people was just based on facts being provided to the public.And the person who said that best - we learned about a private meeting of judges where a Republican appointee was meeting with others in the D.C. bench, where the case would have been heard. And he's very, very well respected. Judge John Bates served as the chief of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for many years and has a broad support among Democrats and Republicans, or I should say appointments by Democrat or Republican judges. Very down the middle. And he said, in this group setting, this was a huge failure of the American justice system that these trials never saw a courtroom.DAVIES: Well, Carol Leonnig, Aaron Davis, thank you so much. Congratulations on the book and thanks for speaking about this.LEONNIG: Thank you.DAVIS: Thank you.DAVIES: Carol Leonnig is a senior investigative correspondent for MSNBC. Aaron Davis is an investigative reporter for the Washington Post. Their book is \"Injustice: How Politics And Fear Vanquished America's Justice Department.\" We recorded our conversation last Thursday.On tomorrow's show, we talk with Misty Copeland, the first Black woman to become a principal dancer with American Ballet Theatre. She'll talk about her final performance, the personal and physical pain she endured through her life and artistry, and how Prince changed her perception of herself.

The cause was complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, the statement said. Cheney had dealt with a history of heart problems.   \"Dick Cheney was a great and good man who taught his children and grandchildren to love our country, and to live lives of courage, honor, love, kindness, and fly fishing,\" the statement said. \"We are grateful beyond measure for all Dick Cheney did for our country. And we are blessed beyond measure to have loved and been loved by this noble giant of a man.\"   In a statement, former President George W. Bush, who picked Cheney as his vice president, said the death \"is a loss to the nation and a sorrow to his friends. Laura and I will remember Dick Cheney for the decent, honorable man that he was.\"   Bush added that Cheney \"was a calm and steady presence in the White House amid great national challenges. I counted on him for his honest, forthright counsel, and he never failed to give his best.\"   \n   An inauspicious beginning   There was little in Cheney's early life to foreshadow the immensely influential role he would one day play at the highest levels of American politics. Born the son of a government conservation worker in Lincoln, Neb., in 1941, he would flunk out of Yale University and work as a lineman for a power company in his new home state of Wyoming. Toss in a pair of drunken-driving convictions, and it's an inauspicious young adulthood.   But turn it around Cheney did: marriage to his high school sweetheart, Lynn; two children; a college degree at the University of Wyoming; graduate school at the University of Wisconsin.   While Cheney was turning his life around, the U.S. was caught in the throes of the Vietnam War. Cheney supported that war but never fought in it. He received five military deferments. Critics would seize upon this decades later, as Cheney helped lead the U.S. into another controversial war — this one in Iraq.   Ordinary to extraordinary   The future vice president began his political career as a congressional intern in 1969. That same year he went to work for a future partner in the Bush administration — Donald Rumsfeld, who ran an economics office in the Nixon White House.   \n   Cheney left the White House before Nixon's resignation, but in 1974 he was back working for the new president, Gerald Ford. Cheney moved up quickly, becoming Ford's chief of staff at the age of 34.   It was then that he began to develop a philosophy that would come to full flower in the White House of George W. Bush. His belief was that the power of the presidency must be not only protected, but also restored. In the 1970s, he watched as Congress enacted reforms in response to Watergate and to Vietnam.   \"We've seen the War Powers Act, an anti-impoundment control act, and time after time after time, administrations have traded away the authority of the president to do his job,\" he said in a 2002 interview on Fox News. \"We're not going to do that in this administration. The president is bound and determined to defend those principles and to pass on this office, his and mine, to future generations in better shape than we found it.\"   \n   War, a recurring theme   In 1978, Cheney ran for Congress in Wyoming and won. That was also the year he suffered the first of a series of heart attacks. He served in Congress for a decade and finally gave up his seat to become secretary of defense for President George H.W. Bush.    This job brought Cheney's first confrontation with Saddam Hussein, when he directed Operation Desert Storm in the Middle East. The war ended quickly after Iraqi troops were evicted from Kuwait. At the time, there were some who felt the U.S. should continue all the way to Baghdad and topple Saddam's regime. President Bush declined; in 1994, Cheney defended that decision.   \"The notion that we ought to now go to Baghdad and somehow take control of the country strikes me as an extremely serious one in terms of what we'd have to do once we got there,\" he said. \"You'd probably have to put some new government in place. It's not clear what kind of government that would be, how long you'd have to stay. For the U.S. to get involved militarily in determining the outcome of the struggle over who's going to govern in Iraq strikes me as a classic definition of a quagmire.\"   \n   Cheney left the Pentagon when the first President Bush lost to Bill Clinton. Two years later, he flirted with a presidential run of his own but instead headed to the private sector, joining the giant energy services company Halliburton.   \n   Changing the vice presidency — and foreign policy   The job made Cheney a wealthy man, but he stayed involved in conservative politics. In 2000, he was asked by Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush to lead the search for a running mate. Bush later made a surprise announcement that he had chosen none other than Cheney.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Dick Cheney and George W.

Cheney also redefined the office of the vice president. He became President Bush's closest adviser and a dominant player in shaping policy. Critics alleged that Cheney was really the man in charge at the White House.    The events of Sept. 11, 2001, only reinforced this notion. While Bush was in Florida that day, Cheney was at the White House. He was literally carried by Secret Service agents to an underground bunker. In an interview years later on NBC's Meet the Press, Cheney said it was he who told Bush not to return to the White House.   \"I said, 'Delay your return. We don't know what's going on here but it looks like, you know, we've been targeted,'\" Cheney said, adding that \"things that we did later on that day tied directly to guaranteeing presidential succession.\"   \n   After the Sept. 11 attacks, Cheney advocated an aggressive new foreign policy in which potential threats would be met with swift, preemptive action. No longer would the U.S. wait for an enemy to strike first. He helped sell the Iraq War by issuing dire warnings to the American people. At the same time, he famously predicted that the mission itself would be relatively easy.   On Meet the Press, Tim Russert, who then hosted the show, asked Cheney if the American people were ready for a long, bloody battle.   \n   \"I don't think it's likely to unfold that way, Tim, because I really do believe we will be greeted as liberators,\" Cheney said.   As the war dragged on, Democrats seized that statement as evidence of how Cheney's determination to go to war had clouded his judgment. There was talk that his views had changed from his earlier days in politics.   Controversy follows Cheney   While Cheney's disposition was never particularly sunny, critics assailed the vice president as a relentlessly grim figure. Late-night comics called him Darth Vader. Even President Bush had fun with his vice president's image on Halloween one year.   \"This morning I was with the vice president,\" Bush told reporters. \"I was asking him what costume he was planning. He said, 'Well, I'm already wearing it,' and then he mumbled something about the dark side of the force.\"   There were other controversies that dogged Cheney as the Bush administration's popularity plummeted in its second term. In 2007, his chief of staff and top adviser, Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, was convicted of perjury in an investigation into the leaking of the name of covert CIA operative Valerie Plame. Cheney was not implicated in the case legally, but he was tainted by the scandal nonetheless.   \n   Then, in what was one of the more bizarre incidents involving someone as high-ranking an official as Cheney, he accidentally shot and wounded a friend, attorney Harry Whittington, in the face and chest with birdshot pellets during a 2006 weekend quail-hunting trip at a Texas ranch.   Even in a strange story like this, some of the classic Cheney traits, such as secrecy, were on display. The story didn't come out for two days, and when it finally did, Cheney himself took days longer to speak about it, finally doing an interview with Fox News.   On Cheney's final day in office, he sat in a wheelchair, the result of an accident, bundled up against the frigid cold, and watched as President Barack Obama was sworn in.   \n   Out of office, he emerged as a frequent and outspoken critic of the Obama administration, even accusing the president of not understanding that the U.S. was at war.   In February 2010 he made a surprise appearance at CPAC, the conservative political action conference in Washington. The crowd erupted.   It was one of the last moments of big public adulation for Cheney. With the rise of Donald Trump, Cheney's brand of politics and his interventionist foreign policy fell out of favor in the party. Trump would often lambaste Cheney for launching what he called \"forever wars.\"   It carried into the next generation as Trump attacked Cheney's daughter, former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), when she voted for Trump's impeachment after a riot at the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.   Trumps relentless criticism of her contributed to Liz Cheney's defeat when she ran for reelection in 2022. Along the way, her feather appeared in television spots on her behalf.   \"In our nation's 246-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,\" Dick Cheney said in the ad.   It was his last big public moment in the political arena. Two years later, he would endorse Democrat Kamala Harris over Trump for president.   In the end, the power of the Cheney name was greatly diminished in GOP politics. His legacy became one of contradictions: Trump supporters despised him, while some Democrats embraced him — if reluctantly — and still many others would always condemn him as a war criminal for his role in Iraq.   Now Cheney has died, with a legacy in government service, foreign policy and the balance of power between the branches of government. No matter his contradictory legacy, he leaves behind a personal stamp on a presidency greater than any vice president before him.\n",

Mikie Sherrill speaks during a rally on Nov. 1 in Newark, N.J. The Associated Press has declared Sherrill the winner of Tuesday's race over Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli.\n                \n                    Michael M.

Santiago/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   A former Navy pilot, first elected to Congress in 2018, will be New Jersey's next governor.   Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill defeated former Republican Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, according to a race call by The Associated Press, capping a closely-watched gubernatorial election that some polls predicted would be a coin flip.   Sherrill's victory marks the first time since the 1960s that New Jersey voters have elected a governor from the same party three terms in a row. Her victory is also the second major win for Democrats on Tuesday, following  Abigail Spanberger's win for Virginia governor.   The race was also one of the first statewide votes since President Trump began his second term. Trump endorsed Ciattarelli in May ahead of the Republican primary.   \n    Loading... \n   The tight race has surprised some in the traditionally blue state, which has had a Democratic governor for the past eight years and a legislature controlled by Democrats for even longer.   But the possibility that the governorship could flip to a Republican — along with the statewide contest being seen as an indicator of public opinion on Trump's second term — put the election in the national spotlight and drew nearly $200 million in spending.   Trump endorsed Ciattarelli earlier this year, saying that after Ciattarelli got to \"know and understand MAGA\" he went \"ALL IN, and is now 100% (PLUS!).\" Ciattarelli had previously criticized the president. Meanwhile, former President Obama endorsed Sherrill in an online video message and later joined her on the campaign trail.   Sherrill, also a former federal prosecutor and attorney, entered politics less than a decade ago when she was elected to Congress in 2018. This was the third time Ciattarelli, a former CPA and small business owner, had run for governor.   But even though Democrats hold an advantage over Republicans on the voter rolls, New Jersey residents have chosen governors from both parties.   \"As blue as New Jersey might be in presidential races and U.S. Senate races too, the state is decidedly purple when it comes to gubernatorial elections,\" Ben Dworkin, director of the Rowan Institute for Public Policy & Citizenship at Rowan University, told NPR in October.   \n   Affordability has been perhaps the most prominent issue of the campaign. Both candidates have bemoaned the state's high cost of living and surging energy prices, with Ciattarelli vowing to lower New Jersey's high property taxes and Sherrill promising to freeze electricity bills.   But in the final weeks of the race, both campaigns traded personal attacks. Ciattarelli repeatedly questioned Sherrill's involvement in a cheating scandal at the Naval Academy in 1994. She said she was prohibited from walking at her graduation because she failed to turn in her classmates, and blasted the Trump administration for releasing her mostly unredacted military records to an ally of Ciattarelli's campaign.   For her part, Sherrill accused Ciattarelli's former publishing company of producing materials that downplayed the dangers of opioids, saying in one of the televised debates between the pair that her opponent was responsible for killing tens of thousands of people in New Jersey. Ciattarelli said Sherrill was lying and threatened to sue her for defamation.\n",

Gavin Newsom speaks during a campaign event for Proposition 50 on Saturday in Los Angeles. Newsom has been the driving force behind the ballot measure, as a way for California Democrats to fight back in the redistricting battle initiated by President Trump.\n                \n                    Ethan Swope/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Ethan Swope/AP\n    \n\n   \n   SAN FRANCISCO — California voters have easily approved a ballot measure to redraw the state's congressional map to favor Democrats, according to a race call by The Associated Press, marking the party's biggest victory to date in a national battle over redistricting ahead of the 2026 midterms.   The measure, called Proposition 50, will replace lines drawn by an independent commission with a map that could net Democrats as many as five new seats in next year's U.S. House elections.   The AP called the race just as polls closed in California. The result caps a strong election night for Democrats, who also pocketed notable wins in Virginia and New Jersey.   \n    Loading... \n   In an abbreviated campaign that saturated California's airwaves with ads, Gov. Gavin Newsom convinced voters that the state needed to draw new maps to counteract gerrymandering done at President Trump's behest in Republican-led states such as Texas.   In Texas, Missouri and North Carolina, the new GOP-friendly maps were enacted after approval by the state legislature.   But in California, Newsom and Democratic allies needed to win approval from voters for the new political lines, because voters had given congressional line-drawing power to an independent citizens commission in 2010.   The commission remains popular in California, but Newsom was able to amplify the partisan stakes of the campaign, arguing that California could not stand by and watch Republicans bake in a sizable advantage through redistricting ahead of midterm elections that will decide control of power in a closely divided House of Representatives.   The results, said California political strategist Erica Kwiatkowski Nielsen, \"shows a huge appetite and just the willingness of Californians to stand up to Donald Trump.\"   \"I think the campaign did a fantastic job of saying and acknowledging people's fears that, hey, we've been a leader in California on redistricting but this isn't politics as usual,\" Nielsen said. \"These are unprecedented times.\"   Newsom's \"Yes\" side wins the money battle   Newsom, who has positioned himself as a primary foil to Trump, amassed a war chest to support the measure — bringing in nearly $120 million as of Friday. Top donors included House Majority PAC, a group working to elect Democrats to the House, and George Soros' Fund for Policy Reform.   \n   The Yes campaign blanketed the state with ads featuring top Democrats, from former President Barack Obama to New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.   Polling in the last week of the campaign showed more than 90% of Democrats supporting the measure and more than 90% of Republicans opposed.   That didn't bode well for opponents of Proposition 50, given Democrats' strong registration advantage in the state.   \n   The campaign against Proposition 50 was led by Charles Munger Jr., a Bay Area donor who bankrolled the original campaign to create the citizens redistricting commission in 2008. Munger contributed nearly $33 million to the No on 50 campaign — but his donations accounted for roughly three-quarters of the $44 million raised by opponents.   Other Republican heavyweights stayed away from the campaign and spending against Proposition 50 dried up in the final weeks of the race, as polling showed the measure opening up a wide lead.   Even Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former California Republican governor who worked with Munger to create the citizens commission, played a restrained role in the campaign — voicing his opposition to Proposition 50 in just a handful of interviews and public appearances.   The changes to the state's congressional map are sure to trigger a series of difficult decisions for Republican incumbents in the coming weeks.   U.S. Reps. Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa, Kevin Kiley and Doug LaMalfa will have to weigh running in districts where chances of reelection range from challenging to virtually impossible.   The new lines approved under Proposition 50 will remain in place through the 2030 election, after which the citizens commission would again take over redistricting responsibilities.\n",

    "body": "\n      As the shutdown enters its 35th day, NPR's Steve Inskeep talks with House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark to discuss how she sees the shutdown ending and whether her party has any leverage.   \n\n    STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Representative Katherine Clark has been listening with us. She is the No. 2 Democrat in the House of Representatives, the Democratic whip. Welcome to the program.KATHERINE CLARK: Oh, good to be with you. Thank you for having me.INSKEEP: We are reporting throughout the morning on the death of Vice President Cheney, which we have learned - former Vice President Cheney. I'm sure as a Democrat, you did not agree with Cheney on many, many things. But at the end of his life, he agreed with you on one big thing. So what are your thoughts now?CLARK: Yes. You know, we extend our deepest sympathies and prayers to Dick Cheney's family and especially to our former colleague, Liz Cheney. And I do admire how Dick Cheney stood by her as she took on her own party and at great political cost to herself to expose the truth that Joe Biden won the election in 2020 and that we had a fair and secure election. Not an easy thing to do, and I admire that about both of them.INSKEEP: Is there something to be said about government service here as well? Cheney spent well over 30 years in senior positions in the government, again, often doing things you would disagree with, but doing them by his lights for the country.CLARK: You know, there is something to be said. And I hope that as we are in the very challenging time that we are facing in Congress that all of us remember the responsibility that is placed with us. And I think it is part of the moment that we are in that we have a president that demeans public service, that uses his office for his own enrichment and fosters and creates deep cynicism about government and wanting to serve people. So I hope this is a moment that my colleagues will reflect on why we're here in Congress, and that is to fight for the American people and to make life better for them.INSKEEP: Well, let's talk, if I can, about your work now. We heard Tamara Keith say something about maybe some signs of ice thawing in the shutdown. Any idea what she's talking about?CLARK: Well, I certainly hope that today is the day that House Republicans decide to come back to Washington, break their five-week vacation that they have taken and get to work. We need to end this shutdown. We need to make sure that we are addressing the health care crisis that the Republican Party has created and get some relief for people that are looking at sky-high premiums.INSKEEP: I want to ask about that, but I also want to check because you said you hope that today is the day. Is that just a hope, or do you have some information?CLARK: You know, it is a hope because as of right now, Speaker Johnson has said we are not in session this week. He has not come to the negotiating table once. We have a president who calls himself the great negotiator who not only left the country during a shutdown but has done anything but sit down with Democrats and negotiate.INSKEEP: Well, let's talk about that because President Trump was on \"60 Minutes\" over the weekend and was asked if he would help to end the standoff, as he tried to do during his first term. And here's some of his response. Let's listen.(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"60 MINUTES\")PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm not going to do it by being extorted by the Democrats, who have lost their way. There's something wrong with these people.NORAH O'DONNELL: So then what happens on November...TRUMP: Schumer is...INSKEEP: OK. Being extorted by the Democrats - that's how he describes your demand to restore or extend Obamacare subsidies. I'm recalling that during battles in the Obama administration, President Obama, after trying to negotiate with Republicans, finally said, it's up to you guys. Do your job. What would you say to the president effectively telling you, do your job?CLARK: You know, Donald Trump has said he is both president and speaker. He needs to tell Mike Johnson and Senator Thune to come to the table and negotiate. It is very hard. I'm a lawyer. I've been a lawmaker for some time. You cannot negotiate by yourselves. And the president has had one brief meeting before the shutdown with Democratic leadership, and that's it. That's not how negotiations work. Posts on Truth Social are not a substitute for putting the American people first. And he is so busy building ballrooms, holding \"Great Gatsby\" celebrations, sending $40 billion to Argentina while he's making the choice to withhold food. Talk about holding hostages. It's outrageous behavior that they will not come to the table to work on making life easier and less expensive for American families.INSKEEP: Got about 20 seconds here, but I just want to ask directly. I realize it's not your choice to be out of session for the past month-plus. But I've been thinking about this. I'm a taxpayer, which means I help to pay for Congress. Am I getting any value at all out of Congress at this time?CLARK: You know, it is a really hard case to make when we have federal workers who are showing up for work and not getting paid and we have Mike Johnson saying in the House, we are going to get paid and not show up for work. Isn't that sort of the basic of what they owe the American people? And today would be a good day to come to work and make sure we can get relief.INSKEEP: Representative Clark, Katherine Clark, thanks so much.CLARK: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

The former vice president was politically prominent from the 1970s until his death. We're also following elections on this Tuesday, on this last day of voting across the country today, from New Jersey and Virginia to California. It's just one of several tests President Trump is facing this week. NPR's senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith is with us now to walk us through it. Good morning, Tam.TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning.MARTIN: So let's start with the gubernatorial elections. How much can be read into the results?KEITH: Well, New Jersey and Virginia aren't exactly presidential swing states, but these races for governor are a first chance to see how voters are feeling almost a year into the Trump presidency. And President Trump put out several social media posts overnight last night, urging people to vote Republican and bashing the Democratic candidates, Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey. He has endorsed the Republican candidate in New Jersey, Jack Ciattarelli, but Trump hasn't endorsed the Republican candidate in Virginia, Winsome Earle-Sears, which led to some verbal gymnastics during a tele-rally that the president called into last night.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Vote Republican. You know, just - if I just cover one subject - your energy prices will go way down as opposed to your energy prices going through the roof. Just that one subject alone is so big. But every Virginia patriot should get out and vote and all Republican up and down the line. It's so important.KEITH: The race in New Jersey appears to be closer than the one in Virginia, which may explain why Trump is expending more political capital there.MARTIN: Talk briefly about California. What does Trump have on the line in that election?KEITH: Yeah. So California voters are considering a ballot measure to temporarily redraw the state's congressional district lines to give Democrats a bigger advantage. This was a response to the new maps in Texas that came at President Trump's request and gave Republicans more safe seats there. If the California measure passes - and it has overwhelming support in recent polls - it would at least partially offset Trump's effort to give Republicans a better chance in next year's midterm elections, which Trump says is key to keeping his agenda on track.MARTIN: There's another possible barrier to Trump's agenda this week. The Supreme Court hears arguments tomorrow about Trump's tariff policy.KEITH: Yeah. And we don't know how they will rule, but - right? - President Trump seems pretty concerned about this tool of raising taxes on imports, to extract concessions from other countries being taken away from him. He has said that it could lead to the ruination of our nation. And here's what he said on \"60 Minutes\" over the weekend.(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"60 MINUTES\")TRUMP: I think our country will be immeasurably hurt. I think our economy will go to hell. Look, because of tariffs, we have the highest stock market we've ever had. Because of tariffs, 401(k) is at the highest level that - and this is millions and millions of people - that we've ever had - 401(k)s. I think it's the most important subject discussed by the Supreme Court in a hundred years.KEITH: Of course, mainstream economists and many business leaders say the tariffs are driving up prices and creating uncertainty. So it's not clear that the president's dire predictions will come to fruition.MARTIN: What else are you watching?KEITH: Well, last night, President Trump turned to Truth Social to criticize the media for saying his poll numbers are low. He claimed falsely that he has the best numbers he has ever had. There's also some political risk for the president, as the government shutdown is about to break a record as the longest one in U.S. history. Polls indicate that, despite the president's best efforts, Democrats are not getting all the blame. Trump so far has refused to negotiate, though there is some movement on the Hill suggesting that the ice might be thawing.MARTIN: That's NPR's Tamara Keith. Tam, thank you.KEITH: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The attack Tuesday killed two people aboard the vessel, Hegseth said, bringing the death toll from the Trump administration's campaign in South American waters up to at least 66 people in at least 16 strikes.   \n   President Donald Trump has justified the strikes by saying the United States is in \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels and claiming the boats are operated by foreign terror organizations. The administration has not provided evidence or more details.   \"We will find and terminate EVERY vessel with the intention of trafficking drugs to America to poison our citizens,\" Hegseth posted while on a trip to Asia.   Lawmakers from both parties have pressed the Trump administration for more information on who is being targeted and the legal justification for the strikes given that Congress has not authorized military action. United Nations human rights chief Volker Türk last week called for the U.S. to halt the attacks and \"prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats.\"   \n   The latest strike comes as the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier has left the Mediterranean Sea on its way to the Caribbean after Hegseth ordered it to the region more than a week ago. It will join an already robust buildup of American planes, ships and thousands of troops in Latin America.   A defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ship movements, confirmed that the Ford and the destroyer USS Bainbridge crossed through the Straits of Gibraltar and into the Atlantic on Tuesday.   \n   The Ford originally deployed with five destroyers, but it's not clear if all of them will go to the Caribbean. Two of the other destroyers in the Ford's strike group, the USS Winston Churchill and the USS Mahan, are in the Mediterranean now, with the Mahan in port at Rota, Spain.   The other two destroyers, the USS Forrest Sherman and the USS Mitchener, are in the Red Sea, the official said.   With the strikes and military assets in the region expanding, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who has been charged with narcoterrorism in the United States, has said the U.S. government is \"fabricating\" a war against him.   During a interview that aired Sunday on CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" Trump was asked if the U.S. was going to war with Venezuela. He responded: \"I doubt it. I don't think so. But they've been treating us very badly, not only on drugs.\"   \n   Norah O'Donnell, in the interview conducted Friday, also asked Trump if Maduro's days were numbered.   \"I would say yeah. I think so, yeah,\" the president said. Trump would not say whether or not he would order land strikes in Venezuela.   In the latest strike, a video Hegseth posted to social media has a gray box obscuring a boat that appears in the water before it's blown up. The footage then cuts to the vessel engulfed by flames.\n",

Spanberger, who previously served three terms in the U.S. House, defeated her Republican opponent, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. She'll be Virginia's first woman governor.    Loading... \n   The contest received national attention as one of the first major tests of voter sentiment in response to the Trump administration's policies.   Virginia is home to around 320,000 federal workers and hundreds of thousands of federal contractors. On the campaign trail, Spanberger argued that federal layoffs, cutbacks by President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), tariffs and the federal shutdown were an attack on the Virginia economy — and pitched herself as a way for voters to push back.   \"We need a governor who will recognize the hardship of this moment, advocate for Virginians, and make clear that not only are we watching people be challenged in their livelihoods and in their businesses and in communities, but Virginia's economy is under attack,\" Spanberger said at a stop on a campaign bus tour late last month.   That message resonated with Haley Morgan Wright, a voter whose husband is a federal employee currently working without pay during the federal shutdown. She wants Spanberger to use her platform as governor to uplift the stories of civil servants like him.   \n   \"He cares about his country, he wants to serve his country and has opted to do it in this way,\" she said after casting a ballot in the Northern Virginia exurbs. \"He's not superfluous.\"   Spanberger was backed by national Democrats   National Democrats had looked to Spanberger and Virginia Democrats for a boost heading into the 2026 midterms. Former President Barack Obama had campaigned for her and the party backed her in what was one of just two governor's races this year.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Voters cast their ballots at Huguenot High School on Tuesday in Richmond, Virginia.\n                \n                    Ryan M.

Kelly/VPM News\n    \n\n   \n   \"The DNC has been spending a lot of money and a lot of time in Virginia,\" said DNC Vice Chair Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta at a meeting for party volunteers in Northern Virginia. \"Because we know that what you all do and the momentum that is going to come out of your victories is going lead to us flipping the House of Representatives in 2026.\"   In 2021, Republican Glenn Youngkin defeated Democrat Terry McAuliffe with 50.6% of the vote to 48.7%. Virginia governors are limited to one four-year term.   Spanberger, who served in the CIA before running for Congress in 2018, has cultivated a reputation as a pragmatic centrist. The theme of her run for governor was \"affordability\" — speaking to Virginians' concerns about rising costs of housing, utility bills, pharmaceutical drugs and the economic uncertainty she blamed on Trump's tariffs and federal layoffs.   \n   Earle-Sears, meanwhile, portrayed herself as an example of the American dream — a Jamaican immigrant who became a U.S. Marine and small business owner.   She accused Spanberger of backing policies on transgender rights that she said are a threat to girls' safety in school bathrooms and locker rooms.    \"Love is not having my daughter having to be forced to undress in a locker room with a man. That's not love,\" Earle-Sears said at a rally in late October. \"Love is making sure that our girl children have opportunities in sports and are not forced to play against biological males.\"   Earle-Sears' stance on transgender students in girls' bathrooms sounded good to Elizabeth Drake, a voter who said she works with youth at a church in Loudoun County.   \"I feel like we're actually going back and setting ourselves back a lot by endangering women,\" she said. \"I'm not saying that that doesn't mean we can have alternative spaces for people, but the women's locker rooms, women's bathrooms, women's safe homes are not it.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Winsome Earle-Sears, currently Virginia's lieutenant governor, in the Virginia General Assembly last month.\n                \n                    Shaban Athuman/VPM News\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Shaban Athuman/VPM News\n    \n\n   \n   The race was jolted by late-breaking events   Earle-Sears also attacked Spanberger for supporting Biden administration policies. She vowed to continue business-friendly polices of outgoing Gov. Youngkin. While she backed Trump's policies, Trump did not endorse her.   Several developments impacted the final weeks of the race. The federal shutdown shadowed the final month of early voting, with both campaigns blaming the other party for the stalemate.    Virginia lawmakers began considering a plan to redistrict the state's congressional districts to favor Democratic candidates in the 2026 midterm elections, as Trump pushes Republicans in other states to move to favor their candidates. That could be an issue facing the next Virginia governor.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Former President Barack Obama campaigned for Spanberger over the weekend.\n                \n                    Steve Helber/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Steve Helber/AP\n    \n\n   \n   And Republicans seized on revelations of text messages by Democratic candidate for attorney general, Jay Jones, in which he described the hypothetical shooting of a Republican lawmaker. Spanberger denounced the messages though Earle-Sears faulted her for not calling on Jones to drop out of the race.   \n   Despite the scandal, Jones defeated incumbent Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, according to an Associated Press race call. His victory in the key legal post will enable the commonwealth to participate in the torrent of blue-state lawsuits against the Trump administration.

Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an Independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa in Tuesday's election, according to a race call by the Associated Press.   \n   It's a remarkable ascent for Mamdani, who was a relatively unknown state assemblymember representing a district in Queens when he entered the crowded mayoral race last year. He went on to win June's Democratic primary by 12 percentage points, quickly becoming one of the country's most popular and polarizing politicians along the way.   Taking the stage Tuesday night, Mamdani didn't shy away from his socialist political views, opening his speech with a quote from Eugene Debs, a socialist politician who ran for president five times in the early 1900s.   \"I can see the dawn of a better day for humanity,\" Mamdani said, promising to improve conditions for New York City's workers.   Many of the young Mamdani supporters who gathered in Brooklyn said they had been moved by his optimism and promises that he would improve their lives.  \"I voted with my parents, it's a tradition of ours,\" said Dania Darwish, 32, who described herself as a Syrian-American Brookynite.    \"My mom was crying the entire way to the voting station,\" Darwish added.  \"It was very emotional for all of us to see a candidate on the ballot who represents us.\"    Loading... \n   Some of Mamdani's main campaign promises included making the city's buses fare-free, freezing stabilized rents, providing universal child care, increasing the minimum wage by 2030 and lowering the cost of living by raising taxes on big corporations and the wealthiest 1% of New Yorkers.   Mamdani has also said he would stand up to President Trump, who has frequently criticized — and mischaracterized — Mamdani as a communist and repeatedly threatened to slash New York City's federal funding if he won.   In a concession speech that echoed the ominous themes of his campaign, Andrew Cuomo warned of antisemitism and lawlessness.  \"We need the police to keep society safe.  We will not make the NYPD the enemy,\" Cuomo said, while also condemning Mamdani's embrace of socialism.   \"We are headed down a dangerous, dangerous road,\" Cuomo said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Zohran Mamdani takes a selfie with a young woman after speaking at a press conference on Sept. 26 in New York City.\n                \n                    Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Critics have pointed to Mamdani's relative inexperience and the political challenges he would face in delivering on his ambitious, highly progressive agenda. And, despite his repeated disavowal of antisemitism, his vocal and long-held criticisms of Israel's government and actions in Gaza have alienated some voters in a city that's home to the largest Jewish community outside of Israel.   \n   But Mamdani's vision of a more affordable city, articulated through savvy social media videos and upbeat in-person interactions, has clearly resonated with young and first-time voters (even outside of New York).   He won endorsements from scores of high-profile progressives, mobilized tens of thousands of campaign volunteers and held a double-digit lead in polls going into Election Day. Young voters, who were likely to have supported Mamdani, are credited with driving record early-voter turnout.    Less than an hour after polls closed on Tuesday, it was clear his efforts had paid off.   \n   A recap of the race   New York City's mayoral race unfolded in a series of dramatic twists and turns, clashes and unlikely alliances. It energized voters and, in the end, more than two million votes were cast — the first time since 1969, according to the New York City Board of Elections.   Current Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, initially ran for a second term, despite a scandal-ridden first term and all-time low approval ratings. After the Trump administration formally dismissed the corruption case against him, he announced his reelection bid in June, this time as an independent.   That allowed Adams to bypass the Democratic primary, in which Mamdani triumphed over Cuomo. Mamdani's win was seen as an upset to the establishment, since the 67-year-old Cuomo is the son of a three-time New York governor and held the position himself for a decade beginning in 2011.   In 2021, after numerous women accused him of sexual misconduct and questions swirled about his administration's management of nursing home residents during the COVID-19 pandemic, Cuomo resigned as governor to avoid a likely impeachment trial, but denied all wrongdoing.   \n   Angling for a comeback, Cuomo entered the mayoral race in March, saying the city was \"in crisis\" and in need of \"effective leadership.\" His platform emphasized issues like public safety, affordable housing, healthcare and fighting antisemitism — with a more centrist stance compared to Mamdani.   Cuomo reentered the race as an independent after his primary loss, seeking to appeal to more moderate voters. He also got Adams' endorsement after the mayor dropped out in late September.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Eric Adams (left) poses with Andrew Cuomo during the game between the New York Knicks and the Cleveland Cavaliers at Madison Square Garden on Oct. 22.\n                \n                    Al Bello/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Al Bello/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   At that point, the race narrowed to three main contenders: Mamdani, Cuomo and Sliwa, a 71-year-old radio talk show host and founder of the subway patrol organization the Guardian Angels, who ran unopposed in the Republican primary.   Sliwa, who ran against Adams in 2021, was determined to remain in this year's race despite third-place poll numbers and mounting calls to drop out, from his own party as well as from Cuomo. Their concern was that Sliwa would take votes away from Cuomo, propelling Mamdani to victory.   \n   The three faced off in two contentious debates in October, in which Mamdani and Cuomo sparred over issues of integrity and experience while Sliwa sought to paint them as two sides of the same ideological coin.   Tuesday's election marks a pivotal moment for liberal-leaning New York City and the Democratic establishment. Both have grappled with how to respond to the Trump administration, which has targeted blue cities nationwide (including the Big Apple) with funding cuts and National Guard troops.   The high stakes and voter enthusiasm of this election were evident well before Election Day: The city Board of Elections said 735,317 voters cast ballots during early voting, more than five times the number of early voters in 2021.\n",

Trump's announcement on social media follows a wave of cancellations by leading performers and groups since the president ousted the previous leadership and added his name to the building. Trump made no mention in his post of the recent cancellations.   \n   His proposal, announced days after the premiere of Melania, a documentary of the first lady, was shown at the center, he said was subject to approval by the board of the Kennedy Center, which has been stocked with his hand-picked allies. Trump himself chairs the center's board of trustees.   \"This important decision, based on input from many Highly Respected Experts, will take a tired, broken, and dilapidated Center, one that has been in bad condition, both financially and structurally for many years, and turn it into a World Class Bastion of Arts, Music, and Entertainment,\" Trump wrote in his post.   \n   Neither Trump nor Kennedy Center President Ric Grenell, a Trump ally, have provided evidence to back up their claims about the building being in disrepair.   The sudden decision is certain to spark blowback as Trump upturns the popular venue, which began as a national cultural center but Congress renamed as a \"living memorial\" to President John F. Kennedy in 1964, in the aftermath of the slain president's death. Opened in 1971, it is open year-round as a public showcase for the arts, including the National Symphony Orchestra.   Since Trump returned to the White House, the Kennedy Center is one of many Washington landmarks that he has sought to put his stamp on in his second term. He demolished the East Wing of the White House and launched a massive $400 million ballroom project, is actively pursuing building a triumphal arch on the other side the Arlington Bridge from the the Lincoln Memorial, and has plans for Washington Dulles International Airport.   \n   Leading performing arts groups have pulled out of appearances, most recently, composer Philip Glass, who announced his decision to withdraw his Symphony No. 15 \"Lincoln\" because he said the values of the center today are in \"direct conflict\" with the message of the piece.   Last month, the Washington National Opera announced that it will move performances away from the Kennedy Center in another high-profile departure following Trump's takeover of the U.S. capital's leading performing arts venue.   The head of artistic programming for the center abruptly left his post last week, less than two weeks after being named to the job.   A spokesperson for the Kennedy Center did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.   As Trump announced his plan to rename the building — erecting his name on the building's main front — he drew sharp opposition from members of Congress, and some Kennedy family members.   Kerry Kennedy, a niece of John F. Kennedy, said in a social post on X at the time that she will remove Trump's name herself with a pickax when his term ends.\n",

Scott Applewhite/AP\n    \n\n   \n   At the beginning of the year, it seemed like a bipartisan deal to extend the Affordable Care Act enhanced subsidies was within reach. A three-year extension passed in the House, but talks have sputtered in the Senate.   Many Republicans in Congress assert the reason for those stalled talks goes all the way back to the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010.   \"You gotta remember, Democrats created Obamacare,\" Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, told reporters on Thursday. \"It's been an abject failure in terms of lowering costs.\"   Moreno helped lead bipartisan talks in the Senate to come up with a solution to the sudden absence of enhanced subsidies that caused many people's premiums to double or triple. Most people affected by this live in states that Trump won, and Moreno is among the Republicans who have tried to come up with a deal to cushion the blow of these high premiums.   \n   But even as the parties tried to work together to solve a present-day problem, anger over the original passage of the ACA keeps coming up.   \"Congressional Republicans can't seem to quit the Obamacare repeal fight, even though the politics of the Affordable Care Act have changed a lot over the past 15 years,\" says Jonathan Oberlander, a political scientist focused on health care at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"It is, on balance, now a very popular program. Its main coverage policies, including the enhanced subsidies, have been in place for many years and helped tens of millions of Americans.\"   That makes letting the enhanced subsidies expire politically hazardous, he says.   \"It is a terrible political look for congressional Republicans, and it's a terrible reality for many of their constituents who are going to face these skyrocketing premium payments,\" Oberlander says.   Republicans are \"likely to pay a price\" in the upcoming midterm elections, he adds.   That view is supported by a poll published Thursday by the nonpartisan health research organization KFF, which found two thirds of Americans think that Congress did the \"wrong thing\" by failing to extend the enhanced subsidies.   The survey, which was fielded earlier this month and included 1,400 people, also found that health care costs were Americans' top affordability concern, more than the cost of groceries or utilities.   \n   \"What our poll is showing is that health care costs are something that voters want to see candidates address,\" says Ashley Kirzinger, KFF's director of survey methodology. \"A significant share of them say that health care costs are going to play a major role in their decisions to vote in the midterms and in which candidates they vote for.\"   \n   Even before open enrollment on Healthcare.gov and the state marketplaces began in November, the intense political debate about the future of the enhanced subsidies has hung over the normal sign up process. Some enrollees didn't know if they would end up with a premium that was $400 a month or $2,000 a month. Although the chances for a bipartisan deal seem slim, there is still some negotiating happening in the Senate.   \"All of this uncertainty is leading to a lot of understandable stress among patients who have relied on the marketplace and saw real gains in affordability at a time when we're also seeing downward economic trends,\" says Miranda Yaver, professor of health policy at the University of Pittsburgh.   If Congress did manage to revive the enhanced subsidies, marketplace directors said in a press call last month that they would be ready to move quickly to implement the change and reopen enrollment, but that some consumers may be lost from the market for good. Hilary Schnieder, the director of the Maine marketplace coverME, says her team would try to win people back, but adds: \"When you lose consumers, getting them back is twice as hard as retaining them and it's really costly.\"   So far, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, 23 million people signed up for an ACA plan. That's down more than a million from last year, and health policy experts predict that more people will drop coverage over the coming months if they can't afford the premiums.   \n   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 4 million people could ultimately become uninsured due to the expiration of the enhanced subsidies, and that number could ultimately grow to 15 million because of people losing Medicaid coverage due to cuts in the Big Beautiful Bill, which kick in next year.   \"That is the largest increase in the uninsured population we have ever had in a short period of time, and it would wipe out about two-thirds of the gains of Obamacare,\" says Oberlander.   \"One of the larger frames here is in 2017, President Trump and congressional Republicans tried to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and they failed, and, of course, it cost them politically in the 2018 midterm elections,\" Oberlander says \"This time around, they did not launch a frontal assault on Obamacare. They did not try to repeal and replace the law. But what they are doing, in effect, is rolling back many of its core provisions.\"   Yaver agrees that, this time around, Republicans are \"finding more subtle ways to undermine [the ACA's] effectiveness\" than launching another repeal effort.   Oberlander thinks even if they're more subtle, these moves are still going to prove unpopular with voters.   \"I think they've probably bought some thin political insulation by rolling back instead of repealing, but ultimately, I still think it's going to be very unpopular to do these things,\" he says. \"A lot of Americans are not going to welcome the news that Congress is making their health insurance less affordable.\"\n",

His wife grabbed documents to show they and their four children are lawful refugees from Venezuela.   \"They told me they just needed to verify the fingerprints for our oldest son, but he would not be detained,\" he said. The family asked to use only their initials for fear of retaliation from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.   J.J. and his wife, A., didn't understand why one child's fingerprints would need checking, but they opened the door. And then they watched as their 20-year-old son was, in fact, arrested and driven away in a black SUV.   \n   \"When I saw him being handcuffed, I felt so scared,\" A. said. \"They were treating him like a delinquent. And they had guns with their fingers on the trigger.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A. and her children peek through a window as a police car sits outside their home in Minneapolis on Jan. 26.\n                \n                    Zaydee Sanchez for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Zaydee Sanchez for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                J.J.'s daughter holds a stuffed animal in her room in Minneapolis.

But more than 100 refugees with no criminal background have been unlawfully arrested, with many flown to a detention center in Texas, according to a class-action lawsuit filed by refugees and advocates for them. It's part of a push the Department of Homeland Security announced Jan. 9 to reexamine thousands of refugee cases, starting in Minnesota, to investigate for potential fraud.   The focus is on those who arrived in the past few years and have not yet received a green card for legal permanent residency.   \"The Trump administration will not stand idly by as the U.S. immigration system is weaponized by those seeking to defraud the American people,\" the agency said in its announcement.   President Trump has dramatically cut refugee admissions to a record low, and in the last year admitted mostly white Afrikaners from South Africa. His administration also has stepped up allegations of public benefits fraud after a sweeping scandal in Minnesota that involved Somali Americans who'd been refugees.   \n   On Wednesday, a federal judge ordered the release of the refugees in Minnesota and granted a temporary pause in detentions, which he said had been made \"without warrants or cause,\" while the case plays out.   \"At its best, America serves as a haven of individual liberties in a world too often full of tyranny and cruelty,\" U.S. District Judge John Tunheim wrote in the order. \"We abandon that ideal when we subject our neighbors to fear and chaos.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A. hugs her son, who was detained by federal agents a few weeks earlier, in Minneapolis on Jan. 26.\n                \n                    Zaydee Sanchez for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Zaydee Sanchez for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Refugees are \"probably the most vetted\" immigrants   Jane Graupman, executive director of the International Institute of Minnesota, which resettles refugees, said the way they're being treated is \"un-American.\"    \"Refugees are probably the most vetted population that comes to the United States,\" she said. \"The FBI's already checked them. The immigration services already checked them. They've had biometric screenings.\"   Graupman said many of the refugees detained in Texas have also been released out into the streets there.   \"They have no money, no documents, no way to get home,\" she said, adding that one man's employer drove to Texas to bring him back to Minnesota.   The Department of Homeland Security did not answer NPR's questions about why people have been sent to Texas, and whether agents have found evidence of wrongdoing. \"Minnesota is ground zero for the war on fraud,\" it said in a statement.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A. and her husband hold hands inside their home in Minneapolis.

He represents a single mother sent first to Texas and then detained several more days back in Minnesota.   Srodulski said DHS is relying on an arcane statute that allows it to detain people with pending green card applications, but it's not supposed to be used to search for fraud.   \"I ultimately think the goal is cruelty,\" he said. \"And I think somebody poring through the statutes came across this … and decided to make it a practice.\"   \n   While detained, his client did not have the diabetes medication she takes twice a day. At one point she was grilled for seven hours, essentially relitigating her entire refugee case. Srodulski called that highly unusual and said if there were suspected fraud the questions would have been more narrowly focused. With no wrongdoing, she was approved for a green card and has been released.   \"It's very frustrating,\" said Beth Grosen, whose Lutheran church sponsored Srodulski's client when she arrived in the U.S. After the woman's arrest, Grosen helped find a safe place for her son to live and sent money for phone calls from Texas. The woman works at a day care, and after her sudden disappearance no one knew when she'd be back.   \"The parents of the children are heartbroken,\" Grosen said. \"There's ripples throughout our community when crazy things like this happen.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                J.J.'s son holds his younger sister as she draws on a window.\n                \n                    Zaydee Sanchez for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Zaydee Sanchez for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   A familiar fear   Back at the Venezuelan family's apartment, their son explained how he was detained for three days in Minnesota. The room was crowded and he had to sleep with his ankles shackled, anxious the whole time that he'd be deported.   \"They didn't tell me why I was arrested or why I was being released,\" he said.   He wondered if it happened because he was stopped for driving too fast the day before his arrest. The officer saw his key chain and asked if he was from Venezuela.   \"Minneapolis was beautiful. We expected a peaceful life here,\" J.J. said, sitting next to his son and wife on the couch. But now their traumatic ordeal, and the whole immigration crackdown, reminds them of what they fled.   \"In Venezuela, pro-government paramilitary groups act this way. They cover their faces; you can only see their eyes,\" A. said. They kidnapped young men her son's age and some never returned. Now, in the U.S., she said, \"I relived that same fear.\"\n",

That depends on who's discussing the enigmatic plant that's legal in some forms (for now) but faces new restrictions in other forms this fall.   The confusion comes as no surprise to Nick Johnson, author of the book Grass Roots, which looks at the history of the cannabis plant and its use as both an industrial material and a drug.   \n   \"It's one of the world's oldest domesticated crops,\" Johnson says of cannabis. \"And it's also incredibly cryptic. We still do not understand everything about its biology and why it does the things it does, how it creates the compounds and molecules it does.\"   Cannabis \"has over 480 constituents,\" according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, but U.S. regulators focus on just one: THC, the compound linked to the drug's famous psychoactive effects.   Federal laws define legal hemp differently from illegal marijuana based on their levels of THC. As long as a plant contains less than 0.3% of one form of THC (with a much stricter limit taking effect later this year), it's considered hemp, not marijuana. And while marijuana is in the process of being reclassified as a Schedule III drug instead of a more restricted Schedule I, hemp is not a controlled substance.   \n   Despite the different policies, qualities and uses, the plants are more similar than not.   \"Botanically speaking, both hemp and marijuana belong to a single species: Cannabis sativa,\" says Kelly Vining, an associate professor at Oregon State University who studies hemp genomics. In general, Vining says, taxonomists consider hemp and marijuana subspecies of Cannabis sativa.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A display at a Total Wine & More store in Arlington, Va., offers a guide to customers seeking to try THC beverages. The drinks are legal in many states, thanks to a loophole in the 2018 Farm Bill.\n                \n                    Bill Chappell/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Bill Chappell/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   But legal definitions of hemp are in hot dispute, in Congress and around the United States. A new federal law will sharply limit the amount of THC (and similar compounds) in final products rather than focusing on plants — aiming to close a loophole in the 2018 Farm Bill that spawned a multibillion-dollar industry in intoxicating drinks.   Critics say this new law should be revised, warning of calamitous effects on THC drink makers and businesses that use other cannabinoids — compounds found in cannabis — such as CBD, or cannabidiol.   The shifting definitions are just the latest twists for hemp, a former cash crop that was later banned. Here's a brief guide to its history:   Hemp was once an important U.S. crop   A staple crop in Colonial and early America, hemp was used to produce everything from the ropes and sails used on ships to the clothes enslaved people wore, as well as the twine for baling the cotton and other commodities they produced.   \n   \"Hemp was cultivated in New England as early as 1629,\" according to a history of hemp published by S.S. Boyce in 1900.   \n   Colonies such as Virginia rewarded farmers for growing hemp and penalized farmers who didn't, he noted.   There was one thing hemp was not used for, says Johnson, the author of Grass Roots.   \"Nobody was smoking weed in George Washington's time,\" he says, aiming to clear up a common misconception. \"They grew hemp. They didn't smoke it — they didn't drink it. They didn't use it at all for psychoactive purposes.\"   The origin of \"drug cannabis\"   Indigenous people in North America and South America did not use cannabis as a drug before colonizers such as Britain and Spain introduced those forms of the plant, according to Johnson. Varieties of the plant bred for mind-altering uses started far earlier and on another continent: in the Hindu Kush mountains of Afghanistan.   Compared with the towering hemp plant that was prized for its long and strong fibers, this Asian version of cannabis was short and squat and was prized for other reasons. To protect itself from sunlight's intense radiation at high altitude, Johnson says, the plant evolved a \"sunscreen\" for its flowers: the THC resin that coats the buds.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Decades before marijuana was banned under U.S. law, the drug could be imported and exported legally, if it bore stamps required by the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937.\n                \n                    U.S. Customs and Border Protection\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        U.S. Customs and Border Protection\n    \n\n   \n   The British encountered the plant in India, where locals had cultivated cannabis for psychoactive purposes for thousands of years. The cultivar's spread to the Western Hemisphere got a boost from what might seem like an unlikely event: When Britain abolished slavery in the Caribbean in 1834, it brought indentured Indian laborers to work at Caribbean plantations.   \"You start having the free or formerly enslaved Black populations mixing with the new indentured servant populations,\" Johnson says. \"The Rastafarian tradition has its roots there.\"   The new variety of cannabis spread to the mainland, along with its status as a drug or medicine for pain relief and other uses. By 1851, a cannabis extract was listed in the Pharmacopoeia of the United States, a reference used by physicians and pharmacists.   \n   Despite their distinct evolutions, cannabis plants use one mechanism to create much discussed cannabinoids such as THC and CBD, horticulture professor Vining says.   \"They're both synthesized by the same biosynthetic pathway\" in plants, she says. \"There are different enzymes that convert precursor molecules into the downstream molecules that are cannabinoids, including THC and CBD.\"   But not every cannabis plant can produce high levels of those cannabinoids. Farmers have bred hemp for centuries, Vining notes, selecting plants that offer large size and strong fibers — not THC or other cannabinoids.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Marijuana plants grow at an illegal cannabis farm during a raid by San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies in Newberry Springs, Calif., in 2024.

The El Paso Herald newspaper reported, \"It is put up by the foremost drug manufacturers in the country and is frequently prescribed, as it is a sedative of value.\"   Federal regulation of cannabis started with the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, mirroring a shift in terminology from \"cannabis\" to \"marijuana\" that is widely attributed to authorities' goals of linking cannabis to racial and ethnic groups by depicting marijuana as a scourge among Mexicans and Black people.   \n   Even tighter U.S. restrictions on cannabis came in the early 1970s, when President Richard Nixon approved adding it to the list of Schedule I drugs, such as heroin, that have no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.   Nixon did so \"over the unanimous recommendation of his drug commission that called for decriminalization,\" as NPR's Cokie Roberts reported in 2019. \"Later, his aide, John Ehrlichman, said Nixon wanted to get at pot-smoking, anti-war protesters and to disrupt Black neighborhoods with criminalization.\"   While other Schedule I drugs are known to carry fatal risks due to overdose, the Drug Enforcement Administration says, \"No deaths from overdose of marijuana have been reported.\"   \n   A new U.S. hemp definition is on the way   As President Trump's rescheduling order suggests, public opinion on marijuana has softened across political lines since the 1970s. Many states have legalized recreational or medicinal pot, and cannabinoids such as CBD have gained recognition from the Food and Drug Administration and others for their therapeutic properties. But researchers have said the federal marijuana ban makes it difficult to study the potential health risks and benefits, even as its use spreads.   The 2018 Farm Bill was an emblem of that shifting conversation, as politicians sought to differentiate between hemp and marijuana. Those changes also give lawmakers political cover to discuss easing regulations, says Adam Smith, the executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project, a legalization advocacy group.   \"We're not really in favor of marijuana, but we're not going to stop this other thing that's different,\" Smith says of the political calculus. \"But it's not different, right? It's all cannabinoids.\"   The new, more restrictive rules regulating cannabis — and defining hemp — are scheduled to go into effect in November. At that point, a final product that contains more than 0.4 milligrams of any form of THC or \"any other cannabinoids that have similar effects\" will not be considered hemp — and thus will be illegal.   Hemp beverage companies, which have built an increasingly mainstream market since the 2018 Farm Bill allowed for some hemp-derived THC products, say the change would ban drinks currently on the market that are considered low or moderate strength, from 2 to 10 milligrams of THC per container. And other hemp companies say the new law will also effectively ban some products with nonintoxicating cannabinoids like CBD if they have trace amounts of THC.   Aside from the THC debate, Vining of Oregon State University says that easing rules on hemp has helped clear the way to study more uses for the plant, from its nutritious seeds to its fibers, which can be used in \"hempcrete,\" a building material.   \n   \"There are many uses beyond drug use for Cannabis sativa,\" she says. \"And they've been used throughout human history.\"\n",

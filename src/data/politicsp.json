Kennedy Jr. outside the White House on Sept. 9.  A new poll finds a deep partisan divide with Republicans trusting Kennedy as much as their own doctor, but he is unpopular among Democrats and independents.\n                <b>\n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                </b>\n                <b><b>hide caption</b></b>\n            </p>\n            <p><b><b>toggle caption</b></b>\n    </p></div>\n    <p><span>\n        Win McNamee/Getty Images\n    </span>\n</p></div>\n   </div>\n   <p>What people believe about health increasingly depends on how they feel about politics, according to a new poll.</p>   <p>Consider President Trump's Sept. 22 warning about acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol. KFF, the nonpartisan health policy research organization, polled voters about Trump's statements the day after he made them.</p>   <p>\"What we see is that it's hugely divided among partisans,\" says Ashley Kirzinger, the associate director of polling for KFF. <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-tylenol-autism-link-and-vaccine-policies/\" target=\"_blank\">The poll found</a> 59% of Democrats believed President Trump's statements about Tylenol were \"definitely false.\" On the other hand, an almost equal percentage of Republicans — 56% — believed the claim to be either \"definitely true\" or \"probably true.\"</p>   \n   <p>There is no scientific research showing a causal link between acetaminophen and autism. But during an unusual press conference last month, Trump told pregnant women to \"tough it out\" and avoid taking the popular pain reliever. Physicians groups, meanwhile, continue to reiterate that it is the safest medicine to take in pregnancy, when untreated fever or pain can cause other problems.</p>   \n   <p>The poll, which also asked voters about other topics, offers a window into how dramatically public opinion has changed, along with federal health policies.</p>   <p>The poll found that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has seen a precipitous decline in public trust — most recently among Democrats, as the Trump administration works to dismantle many of its mandates. Kirzinger notes a 24% decline in trust in the CDC's vaccine information among Democrats, just in the past two years. </p>   <p>\"The problem is the mistrust is caused by these very people who are ostensibly leading us,\" former Surgeon General  Richard Carmona tells NPR. Carmona, who served under President George W. Bush, is one of six former surgeons general who recently penned an op-ed in The Washington Post warning that Trump's Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. represents a \"threat\" to the nation's health. \"They've dismantled the agencies that had real scientists who provided information, and instead replaced it with ideology,\" Carmona says. \"We're already seeing diseases that we usually don't see coming back, like measles. People will die, and the ramifications are significant.\"</p>   \n   <p>Kirzinger says polls historically have consistently found that people trust their doctors the most when it comes to getting advice about their own health. But increasingly — and especially after the appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Trump's secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services — she says party lines are more critical in determining what sources of information people rely on as the basis for their health decisions. \"Among Republicans, RFK is as trusted ... as their own health care provider,\" Kirzinger says the data shows.</p>   <p>And yet overall, Kennedy's job approval rating ranks low; the poll also found 59% of people — mainly Democrats and independents — disapproved.</p>   <p>Kirzinger says that as faith in federal health agencies declines, people are turning to very different sources.</p>   <p>Democrats say they're relying on professional medical groups, like the American Medical Association. \"More than 8 in 10 Democrats say that they trust the AMA or the American Academy of Pediatrics, but among Republicans, it's only about half,\" Kirzinger says.</p>   <p>What this means is the landscape of public health is very fragmented, and people are making choices based on very disparate beliefs. \"As people are going to different sources of information to make decisions around their health care, we're going to see partisanship playing a big role in what people decide to do,\" she says.<br /></p>\n</div>",

But right now, that part of her life is on pause.</p>   <p>\"That's kind of who I am. And once I can go back to that, I will. Just at the moment, this thing called democracy – democratic republic is important,\" Addams said with a laugh during an interview.</p>   <p>Addams is the co-executive director of Mormon Women for Ethical Government – known as MWEG. The group is among the plaintiffs in a lawsuit that is now forcing lawmakers to redistrict Utah's four congressional seats.</p>   <p>Addams spoke in her Salt Lake City suburban home. She was joined by one of the individual plaintiffs in the case, MWEG member Vicki Reid, who sees the suit as in keeping with her faith as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>   \n   <p>\"I think the one thing that comes to my mind is a hymn that we have which has, \"'Do what is right, let the consequences follow,'\" she said.</p>   <p>The sheet music for the hymn is on Addams' piano. The consequences are playing out this week in the Utah Legislature and maybe soon across the country.</p>   <h3 id=\"The\">The redistricting comes amid Trump's battle for the U.S. House</h3>   <p>Under a court order prompted by the lawsuit, the legislature on Monday passed a new district map that improves Democrats' chances of winning a House seat in the heavily Republican state next year. The map still has to be reviewed by a judge.</p>   <p>This comes as President Trump has set off a national redistricting race by pushing Republican states to redistrict and help their party maintain its hold on Congress. Trump has decried the court's ruling, saying Utahns should be \"outraged at their activist judiciary.\"</p>   <p>While Utah's Republican lawmakers are abiding by the court, they aren't happy about it. Republican State Rep.

The group says it formed in 2017 amid \"dehumanizing behavior\" in government, and claims some 9,000 members across the country. Most are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Addams said about 40 percent are Republicans – including herself – and 34 percent are Democrats. The rest are independents or in third parties.</p>   <p>Laura Eyi, the group's public relations manager, acknowledges members often don't agree with each other, but their religion keeps them connected.</p>   <p>\"As members of the church step up to get engaged in their communities and in politics in general, they're going to do so in a way that honors the dignity of the person that they disagree with,\" Eyi said. \"That really comes from a place of faith.\"</p>   <p>They tend to focus on the democratic process and that brought them to redistricting.</p>   <p>\"In states like Texas and other places, it's a partisan fight. It's between Democrats and R's,\" Addams explained. \"Here in Utah, it is a cross-partisan, principled effort to try to put forth the best version of representative government we can possibly have.\"</p>   <p>In 2018, Utah voters backed the formation of an independent commission to do the state's redistricting. It was part of an effort to minimize partisan gerrymandering that carves up seats to the benefit of one party or another.</p>   <p>But Utah's Republican supermajority Legislature, instead, took back redistricting power, largely nullifying the ballot initiative. Lawmakers then passed a map that split Salt Lake County - the most Democratic area - into four other Congressional districts.</p>   <p>MWEG, the League of Women Voters and the individual plaintiffs sued in 2022, leading a Utah district court judge to rule the Legislature had overstepped its authority and ordering the redistricting now.</p>   \n   <h3 id=\"The\">The latest district map will go back before a judge</h3>   <p>Reid, a member of MWEG who identifies as a moderate Republican, joined the suit with her Democratic husband.</p>   <p>\"Yes, Utah's a red state. That means that in a red state, more than 50% of the people voted for fair maps,\" Reid said. \"The Legislature has a responsibility to listen to people. And that just wasn't happening.\"</p>   <p>Currently, Republicans hold all four House seats. Republicans dispute that the state constitution allows voters to directly rule on redistricting. \"The Utah Constitution gives the sole responsibility and power to draw maps with the state legislature, period,\" Pierucci told NPR. They vow to take the case to higher courts if needed.</p>   <p>For now, though, the map passed by the Legislature this week will go back before the judge for review. MWEG and the other plaintiffs will be allowed to weigh in. Addams says the lawmakers still didn't meet the non-partisan requirements set out by voters.</p>   <p>\"MWEG joins thousands of Utahns who expressed comments in opposition to the legislature's partisan gerrymandered map that violates those requirements,\" Addams told NPR in a statement.<br /></p>\n</div>",

Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, says he is \"sick and tired\" of the current federal shutdown and placed blame on both Republicans and Democrats for how negotiations play out during federal shutdowns.</p>   <p>In an interview with <em>Morning Edition</em>, Johnson said shutdowns are often a good excuse for the \"uniparty\" — a collection of both Republicans and Democrats \"that are happy to mortgage our children's future\" — to spend more federal money.</p>   <p>\"It's often said 'show me a member of Congress who ever lost because he spent too much money.' That's our problem,\" Johnson continued. \"And the other problem is the American public, by and large, loves free federal money.\"</p>   \n   <p>With the Senate unable to pass either of two dueling continuing resolution spending proposals, most of the federal government remains shut down.</p>   <p>Republicans want a clean spending bill that would fund the government for seven weeks. Democrats insist that any measure <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/02/nx-s1-5559810/shutdown-aca-health-care-premium-subsidies\" target=\"_blank\">should extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies</a> — which are used by over 20 million people to make their health insurance more affordable. Those subsidies will expire at the end of the year. Democrats also want to reverse cuts to health spending made by President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act and limit the president's ability to withhold funds appropriated by Congress.</p>   \n   <p>Johnson blamed the high costs of health care on the \"faulty design of Obamacare\" and said Democrats should be willing to work with Republicans to fix \"their horrible health bill.\" President Trump in his first term — with Republicans in control of both houses — did not repeal and replace Obamacare as he pledged to do during the 2016 campaign.</p>   <p>Negotiations like the one happening now over health care, Johnson said, can be avoided with his proposed <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/2806\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Eliminate Shutdowns Act</u></a> — a piece of legislation that would fund the federal government at the previous year's spending levels in the event Congress fails to approve a spending resolution for a new fiscal year.</p>   \n   <p>Speaking to NPR's Michel Martin, Johnson discussed the nature of shutdowns and efforts by Republicans to address health care costs.</p>   <p><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>      <h3>Interview highlights</h3>   <p><strong>Michel Martin: </strong>We're hearing that there's no movement between the leadership over the past week on ending the shutdown. But how about senator to senator, person to person? Is there anything going on there?</p>   <p><strong>Sen. Ron Johnson: </strong>Well, let me just ask, do you enjoy covering this issue? I'm sick and tired of these shutdown showdowns. Last fiscal year — I don't know how many cliffs we came to — it took us six months to just do a continuing resolution. This is a ridiculous situation we're in. So I proposed the Eliminate Shutdown Act. So all this does is it would establish a 14-day rolling continuing appropriations where you haven't funded the department or all the government. It doesn't shut it down. If you haven't appropriated for a government agency, you just fund it at last year's levels. It would give the appropriators time. You know, you find the areas of agreement. You know, we passed some appropriation bills prior to the end of the fiscal year in the Senate. So, again, this doesn't have to happen at all. This is ridiculous.</p>   <p><strong>Martin: </strong>So you made this proposal. It would continue the current funding levels in two-week increments, as you just said, when there's no actual funding bill in place. It would seem there'd be something for both sides in this. It would keep spending at its current level. It would give people an opportunity to negotiate. Your proposal didn't go forward. Why do you think that is?</p>   <p><strong>Johnson: </strong>Because it doesn't spend enough. Spending at last year's levels just is not enough for the uniparty, certainly not enough for Democrats and our own appropriators. Again, it seems dysfunctional, but understand: this process of shutdown showdowns — this is a well-honed process for mortgaging our children's future.</p>   \n   <p><strong>Martin: </strong>But it would seem that there's something in it for both sides. And because some Republicans did vote with the Democrats, would that suggest that there's something in it for both sides? These shutdowns have some appeal for both sides.</p>   <p><strong>Johnson: </strong>Yeah, absolutely. That's what I'm saying. The uniparty loves the shutdown showdown because it backs us up to these deadlines. The first one is going to be Thanksgiving. We won't come to an agreement by then. So then the next will be Christmas Eve. And then that gives your appropriaters enough time, a few people, to write a couple thousand-page bill, drop it on our desks and say, take it or leave it. And unfortunately enough people take it. And that's why we're $37 trillion in debt, facing another $26 trillion of deficits over the next 10 years. So it's completely unsustainable.</p>   <p><strong>Martin: </strong>So at the center of this current argument is health care. Democrats say they want to extend the subsidies that help people buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. In your state, a little over 313,000 people bought their health insurance through this ACA marketplace in 2025. What are you telling those folks whose costs are set to increase?</p>   <p><strong>Johnson: </strong>Well, I like<em> The Washington Post </em>headline yesterday saying the truth is the Affordable Care Act was never affordable. The reason the insurance rates are skyrocketing is because of the faulty design of Obamacare. I think Republicans would be happy to help Democrats fix their horrible health care bill. It wasn't affordable. It didn't protect patients. You couldn't keep your doctor. You weren't able to keep your insurance. It's been an utter failure. Free government money, free health insurance — that's always going to be popular.</p>   <p><em>Editor's note: </em>The Washington Post<em> editorial board </em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/10/05/government-shutdown-aca-subsidies-debt/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><u>published an opinion piece</u></em></a><em> Oct. 5 in which it claimed \"The real problem is that the Affordable Care Act was never actually affordable.\"</em></p>   <p><strong>Martin: </strong>President Trump in his first term had both the House and the Senate and Republicans as a group did not fix this problem. So why is it fair to blame Democrats for this now?</p>   \n   <p><strong>Johnson: </strong>I was highly critical of our failed effort back then. I always kept saying, rather than talking about \"repeal, replace,\" you got to talk about repairing the damage done by Obamacare and transition to a system that actually works. The main problem with Obamacare is it forced the very small percentage of Americans that buy their policies on individual policy to cover the entire cost of covering people with preexisting conditions. They got rid of high-risk pools that worked, could have been tweaked, you know, that actually covered those people. And again, Democrats' entire focus on this was going to a single-payer system.</p>   <p><strong>Martin: </strong>But President Trump and the Republicans control both branches of Congress now and the White House now. What are your plans to fix this now?</p>   <p><strong>Johnson: </strong>So we're actually working with health care experts and we're looking at the faulty design of Obamacare and looking at how we can fix it now. Will Democrats actually do it? I doubt it. Their idea of fixing anything is to just throw more money at it, which is what they're trying to do with these temporary, pandemic-enhanced subsidies, which again, it's just driving health care costs higher.</p>   <p><strong>Martin: </strong>Well, speaking of money, President Trump is suggesting that at least some furloughed federal workers might not be paid once the government reopens. Do you think that's fair?</p>   <p><strong>Johnson: </strong>Again, I think shutdowns are stupid and we can avoid this whole thing. Wouldn't even be an issue if Democrats just vote for this continuing resolution. Or even better yet, we passed the Eliminate Shutdown Act and we'll never have to have this conversation again, Michel. And I like talking to you. I hate this conversation. This is ridiculous. We're in this situation. We can eliminate this for all time. But the big spenders, the appropriators, the Union Party loves this process because this is how exactly they've mortgaged our children's future. This is why we're $37 trillion in debt. That's the big picture.</p>   \n   <p><strong>Martin: </strong>The president is threatening to lay off the furloughed federal workers. What are your thoughts on that? I know that the federal workforce is not a big part of Wisconsin's workforce, but what are your thoughts about that? Do you think that's fair?</p>   <p><strong>Johnson: </strong>Well, first of all, when you have a bankrupt entity, everybody gets laid off or when you have a company that's in real trouble, you have to start laying off just to get the company to survive. So that's what happens in the private sector. I don't know why the public sector employee should be immune to that exact same process. We need to start trimming the size of government, the size, scope and cost of it, because again, we are mortgageing our future, devaluing our dollar and that's why people can't afford things. But the shutdown showdowns, this is a distraction to the massive problem we have with $37 trillion in debt.<br /></p>   \n   <p><em>This digital article was edited by Treye Green.

    "body": "<div>\n      <p>A pair of Senate Democrats is responding to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/30/g-s1-91091/trump-bombing-drug-boats-terror\" target=\"_blank\"><u>a series of unprecedented U.S. military strikes on alleged drug traffickers at sea</u></a> ordered by President Trump with a plan to force a Senate vote on a war powers resolution blocking the escalated action by the commander in chief.</p>   <p>Sens. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., are pushing for the vote despite tough odds for passage as support among Republicans appears limited so far. They argue the White House has not provided evidence to justify the attacks, which they believe are illegal and unconstitutional. </p>   <p>The two Democrats also say<strong> </strong>it's clear Congress has not authorized the use of such force.</p>   <p>\"The resolution would stop this blowing up of ships,\" Schiff told reporters in the Capitol ahead of the vote. \"It would also address the administrations' threat that they're going to go potentially beyond blowing up ships at sea to attacking targets on land in Venezuela or elsewhere.\"</p>   <p>Last month, Trump ordered three U.S. military strikes on boats after administration officials suspected them as carrying members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang smuggling drug shipments from Venezuela. So far 21 people have been killed, but their identities have yet to be shared.</p>   \n   <p>Venezuelan officials say at least some of those killed were not gang members, creating <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/05/nx-s1-5529382/rubio-warns-cartels-as-u-s-strike-on-venezuelan-boat-raises-regional-unease\" target=\"_blank\"><u>a new unease in the region</u></a>. But the Trump<strong> </strong>administration insists the strikes were entirely legal, arguing narco-traffickers are now military threats and not law enforcement threats.</p>   <p>The move has upended the U.S. drug interdiction program, where the Coast Guard traditionally intercepts vessels at sea, confiscates illegal drugs and takes suspected drug traffickers into custody to face criminal charges.</p>   <p>Kaine said more than two dozen congressional Democrats wrote the Trump administration demanding answers to a series of questions regarding the legal basis for the strike, but have yet to get a response weeks later. Kaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said one closed door briefing has been held for senators so far, but that brought little clarity.</p>   <p>\"A room full of people from the administration,\" Kaine told reporters. Yet \"no information about why attacking rather than interdicting.\"</p>   <p>Kaine and Schiff worry that the military strikes could lead the U.S. unexpectedly and unintentionally into war.</p>   <p>It's unclear many Republicans will join Democrats in the effort, with a vote expected in the coming day. However, Schiff and Kaine said they could bring the resolution up again if it doesn't pass on the first try.</p>   \n   <p>It appears at least <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/14/nx-s1-5535624/congress-worries-u-s-strike-on-venezuelan-boat-signals-trumps-expanded-war-powers\" target=\"_blank\"><u>one Republican, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.</u></a>, who has long pushed war powers limits, is on board. Many others, such as <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/14/nx-s1-5535624/congress-worries-u-s-strike-on-venezuelan-boat-signals-trumps-expanded-war-powers\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have defended the administration's actions</u></a>, arguing the rules of engagement have shifted.</p>   <p>However, Schiff and Kaine say without the identities of those killed, it's possible the U.S. got it wrong or may in the future.</p>   <p>\"I have no idea precisely the identities of who was on these ships, or even whether the administration knows their identities, and that's a real problem,\" Schiff said. \"Are they killing people who were not engaged in trafficking? I just don't know the answer to that question.\"</p>   <p>Kaine says that fuels a new wave of questions.</p>   <p>\"The suspicious mind in me says it's because there aren't good answers,\" he said.<br /></p>\n</div>",

Republicans continue to say they'll talk when the government is back open. Meanwhile, President Trump is saying this about Democrats.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You want to know the truth? This is like a kamikaze attack. They almost - you know, they have nothing to lose.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: NPR's Domenico Montanaro is looking at whether there's any way out of this shutdown. So, Domenico, with President Trump talking like that, how do the two sides even get to talking?</p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Yeah. I mean, Trump shows no signs of budging here. I mean, aside from his language about Democrats, he and his budget office director are threatening permanent layoffs of some federal workers, even floating the possibility that the government might not give back pay to some furloughed workers. That's something that's in pretty hot dispute right now. And they're moving to cut off funding from blue states for various projects. You know, Trump has been trying to give the impression that congressional leaders are talking, but there's really no indication that that's even happening right now. So it looks more like a game of chicken, with the administration feeling like it can weather this politically and lay the blame at - on Democrats squarely.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: All right. So how are congressional leaders responding to that?</p><p>MONTANARO: Well, on the Republican side, you know, they're calling Democrats' demands too much. Here's House Speaker Mike Johnson.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>MIKE JOHNSON: It is a wild wish list, a big government liberal nonsense that we can't do.</p><p>MONTANARO: You know, Republicans keep saying that they want to reopen the government and then negotiate, but calling what Democrats want big government liberal nonsense makes a lot of Democrats skeptical that Republicans really want to negotiate at all. What he seems to be hoping for here - Johnson - is really cracks among Democrats.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: So is there any evidence that that even exists?</p><p>MONTANARO: To an extent. I mean, we've seen a few who caucus with the Democrats who have been voting with Republicans to reopen the government - senators Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Angus King, an independent from Maine. But that hasn't been growing. You know, largely, Democrats are sticking together because they feel like they have an advantage on health care. Unlike a decade ago, you know, the Affordable Care Act is actually really popular now, and Democratic leaders want to drill home the point that they're in favor of extending ACA subsidies, and Republicans are not. Here's Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer yesterday.</p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p>CHUCK SCHUMER: The bottom line is very simple. We want them extended. They don't want them extended.</p><p>MONTANARO: And we saw House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries even go so far this week as to challenge Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson to a televised debate on the House floor. Johnson turned that down, needless to say, calling it, quote, \"pathetic and a publicity stunt.\"</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: Are there any signs to kind of indicate which side appears to have the advantage when it comes to convincing voters that they're right or wrong?</p><p>MONTANARO: Yeah. It's tricky because polling has found Republicans getting more of the blame, but not near a majority, and there are a lot of undecideds. Shutdowns usually don't go well for the side looking to add things that are not in a bill, like Democrats are doing here. 2019 shutdown, for example, Trump made it about funding for the border wall, and eventually, with 50 plus percent blaming him and air traffic controllers calling out sick, he agreed to a short-term reopening of the government.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: So, Domenico, you look at this all the time. Any way out of this shutdown?</p><p>MONTANARO: You know, I - basically, I see three scenarios here. First, enough moderate Democratic senators crossover, which could happen if public pressure becomes too much. Second, Republicans overstep, go too far with these firings and other efforts, get more of the blame for things like airport delays and feel pressured to negotiate now. Or third, both parties reach a temporary deal and commit to negotiate on these subsidies. But it's going to come down to politics and the messaging that wins out.</p><p>MARTÍNEZ: That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Thanks a lot.</p><p>MONTANARO: You got it.</p>\n    <p>Copyright © 2025 NPR.

That's the latest milestone in its massive ongoing rally, with prices rising more than 50% just this year.</p>   <p>The precious metal is usually seen as a \"safe haven\" investment, especially when more mainstream assets seem risky. The soaring demand for its perceived safety coincides with President Trump's dramatic and often erratic economic policies, including <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/transcripts/nx-s1-5559644\" target=\"_blank\">upending global trade</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5546737/federal-reserve-lowers-rates-but-less-than-trump-wants\" target=\"_blank\">threatening the independence</a> of the Federal Reserve.</p>   <p>On the surface, Wall Street seems to have mostly <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/27/nx-s1-5476238/trump-stocks-market-economy-tariffs-businesses\" target=\"_blank\">shrugged off</a> this spring's worries about Trump's policies. In recent weeks, the major U.S. stock market indices have hit record high after record high.</p>   \n   <p>But at the same time, the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/07/nx-s1-5455867/trump-dollar-value-debt-currency\" target=\"_blank\">value of the U.S. dollar</a> has fallen about 10%. That threatens both the stability of the global economy, since the dollar undergirds so much of its financial system, and the United States' long-established dominance as the world's economic superpower.</p>   <p>\"Gold usually rises when the dollar is weak,\" says Jose Rasco, chief investment officer for HSBC Americas.</p>   <p>\"Given all the uncertainty around policy, people said, 'We're not sure about the dollar' … and the dollar has depreciated as a result,\" he added.</p>   \n   <p>Now gold is having its hottest year in <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/gold-price-rising-61bc0b52?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAjkkoi2BpknO3ZOMaUwwi6vmt7lj-z1Tl4_NDR6--08ACeCcWHG1pJkzJZKzo8%3D&gaa_ts=68e6775c&gaa_sig=FKzg7UrdbCjUFUreTRv-s-N_TeN2TfQE836TGp3Yih__yjBdrC5noEUbfhBrpUdwF3gypMAwk-M-XD_QjUkuIQ%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\">nearly half a century</a> — since the global energy and inflation crises of 1979.</p>   <p>And it's showing no signs of stopping: This week, analysts at Goldman Sachs <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-sp-500-nasdaq-10-07-2025/card/goldman-sachs-sees-gold-hitting-4-900-by-late-next-year-5C5R6Hg99KpPEwFAIp9A?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAgYIFR5-kM9iOVkfCkdM9sDgwXTZeP07lbLG1HVcYzDeoqvm6RVAFg2ozqQHNI%3D&gaa_ts=68e68059&gaa_sig=FCbcMigVK9TkvA6mr3zN6qfUDTBHvX80kHaT7dpJD0R8l16yk-7jIrPcnEHWilk1tUGcv9JxIS-O9L8K8GgBqw%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\">predicted</a> that the price of gold would hit $4,900 by the end of 2026.</p>   <p>Daan Struyven, Goldman's co-head of commodities research, co-authored that report. He tells NPR that he wouldn't be surprised if gold beats his high expectations (or has what he calls \"upside risk\").</p>   <p>\"While our price forecast is quite elevated, we actually see some upside risk to that high price target,\" Struyven says</p>   <h3>Gold may be known as a \"safe haven\" — but there are risks, and costs, to buying it</h3>   <p>Gold has long enjoyed a reputation for offering safety in what's known as the \"fear trade.\" As a glittering precious metal that can be held (and hoarded!), gold offers the appearance of safety and solidity next to stocks and other (often less-material) financial instruments.</p>   \n   <p>\"When it seems like the world is going to hell in a handbasket, gold usually appreciates,\" Lee Baker, a certified financial planner who is the founder and CEO of Claris Financial Advisors in Atlanta, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/04/01/nx-s1-5347985/gold-prices-record-highs-tariffs-trump\" target=\"_blank\">told NPR this spring</a>.</p>   <p>But he warns there can be downsides to buying and owning gold — even in times of crisis. For example, unlike stocks or bonds, gold doesn't pay any dividends or interest. So the only way to make money from this investment is to buy some, and then hope to sell it after the price goes up.</p>   \n   <p>There are also physical and logistical challenges to investing in gold — especially for people who want to buy the real thing. For example, buyers need to consider how to store it — and whether to pay for the security and insurance required to keep precious metals in their homes.</p>   <p>For those who are gold-curious but perhaps not ready to adopt a doomsday-prepper lifestyle, Baker notes that it's possible to invest in gold-backed funds that don't require physical ownership of precious metals.</p>   <p>More broadly, he says the current gold frenzy highlights a larger lesson about investing in more than just one asset class, such as stocks.</p>   <p>\"Your mama told you not to put all your eggs in one basket. It applies to investing as well,\" he says. \"Diversification matters.\"<br /></p>\n</div>",

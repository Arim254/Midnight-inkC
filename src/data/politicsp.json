    "body": "\n      NPR's Scott Detrow speaks with former White House ethics lawyer Richard Painter about gifts from foreign governments or corporations that President Trump has accepted.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  The corner of the internet interested in wristwatches was the first to spot the new desktop clock. It appeared in recent photographs of President Trump at work in the Oval Office. The watch-watching websites Watches Of Espionage and Hodinkee were able to confirm this was a gift from the CEO of Rolex. Last week, Trump met with him and several Swiss business executives at the White House, where the Swiss newspaper Blick reported a different CEO gifted Trump an engraved gold bar. And today, the White House announced that tariffs on Swiss imports had been dropped from 39% to a more manageable 15%.Now, it was the governments of Switzerland and the United States that hammered out this deal, not business leaders, but this is not the first time that foreign gifts to the U.S. president have lined up with foreign policy. And this felt like a good time to take stock of the trends that we have seen this year. Richard Painter is a law professor at the University of Minnesota and was former chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush. Welcome to the program.RICHARD PAINTER: Well, thank you for having me.DETROW: What did you make of the president of the United States being given a Rolex and a gold bar by executives who had a lot to gain from lower tariffs?PAINTER: I certainly view this as inappropriate. It appears as if there's a quid pro quo of a gift from foreign interests to the president in return for a concession on tariffs, and once this precedent is set, we'll have other countries and industries offering the same. And this is a matter of grave concern for the United States. It's unconstitutional in the United States to - for the president or anyone else in a position of power to receive anything of value from a foreign government. That is unconstitutional. But if the gift is from a foreign corporation or a private interest, we - it's not technically prohibited under the emoluments clause of the Constitution. But it's still a very, very dangerous precedent to set that foreign interests can give gifts to the president and then get a concession on tariffs or anything else.DETROW: There's also something we've seen with both Trump administrations that other presidents put guardrails around them. They followed norms. They followed accepted practices. And President Trump has just often made it clear he's not interested in following that. Is that an accurate way to frame it?PAINTER: That is a very accurate way to frame it. And the president feels he has the wind at his back because the Supreme Court has ruled that a president can never be prosecuted for a criminal act within his core constitutional powers. And President Trump believes that just about everything is within his core constitutional powers. And we also have a Congress that won't do anything about this - that won't hold the president to account.DETROW: What normally happens under standard procedure when an executive or another world leader gives the president of the United States an official gift? - especially an expensive gift, which I'm sure happens all the time, especially during a meeting talking about a policy change that could benefit that company or that country.PAINTER: In the Bush White House, when I was the chief White House ethics lawyer, when gifts were given to the president, it was brought to my attention, and only in very, very rare circumstances did the president accept the gift. And the president would never accept a gift in his personal capacity from a foreign power in excess of that which has been authorized by Congress, and the maximum there now is $480. Anything else cannot be a gift to the president. Could be potentially a gift to the United States from the foreign country, like the French gave us the Statue of Liberty and so forth, but the president in his personal capacity, the maximum is $480.DETROW: The Rolex clock in question, which I'm quite sure is over that threshold, was technically a gift to the American people. Does that matter to you? Is that a technical difference? Is that an important difference?PAINTER: Well, technically, let's see where it ends up. Is it going to end up like the 747 airplane from Qatar, in the presidential library of Donald Trump, which will be a private organization? That's not a gift to the American people. And, quite frankly, we don't need a clock. That's not what the United States needs.DETROW: What is your pitch to the most skeptical listener out there that these types of regulations and norms matter?PAINTER: The integrity of our government matters. We have a government that spends a trillion dollars on defense alone, on our military. This is a government which we have the right to expect to serve the interests of the United States and its citizens. And it's really to put America first, not to simply repeat the America First slogan and then turn around and have foreign or economic policy influenced by the private financial interests of those who have power.DETROW: That was Richard Painter, law professor at the University of Minnesota and the former chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush. Thank you so much for talking to us.PAINTER: Well, thank you. Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Marjorie Taylor-Greene, R-Ga., presides over a House Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, Feb. 12, 2025, in Washington.\n                \n                    Rod Lamkey/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Rod Lamkey/AP\n    \n\n   \n   President Donald Trump has publicly called it quits with one of his most stalwart MAGA-world supporters, calling Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene \"'Wacky' Marjorie\" and saying he would endorse a challenger against her in next year's midterms \"if the right person runs.\"   \n   The dismissal of Greene — once the epitome of \"Make America Great Again,\" sporting the signature red cap for President Joe Biden's 2024 State of the Union address and acting as a go-between for Trump and other Capitol Hill Republicans — appeared to be the final break in a dispute simmering for months, as Greene has seemingly moderated her political profile. The three-term U.S. House member has increasingly dissented from Republican leaders, attacking them during the just-ended federal government shutdown and saying they need a plan to help people who are losing subsidies to afford health insurance policies.   \n   Accusing the Georgia Republican of going \"Far Left,\" Trump wrote that all he had witnessed from Greene in recent months is \"COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!\" adding, of Greene's purported irritation that he doesn't return her phone calls, \"I can't take a ranting Lunatic's call every day.\"   In a response on X, Greene wrote Friday that Trump had \"attacked me and lied about me.\" She added a screenshot of a text she said she had sent the president earlier in the day about releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files, which she said \"is what sent him over the edge.\"   Greene called it \"astonishing really how hard he's fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level,\" referencing next week's U.S. House vote over releasing the Epstein files.   Writing that she had supported Trump \"with too much of my precious time, too much of my own money, and fought harder for him even when almost all other Republicans turned their back and denounced him,\" Greene added, \"I don't worship or serve Donald Trump.\"   Trump's post seemingly tied a bow of finality to fissures that widened following this month's off-cycle elections, in which voters in the New Jersey and Virginia governor races flocked to Democrats in large part over concerns about the cost of living.   \n   Last week, Greene told NBC News that \"watching the foreign leaders come to the White House through a revolving door is not helping Americans,\" saying that Trump needs to focus on high prices at home rather than his recent emphasis on foreign affairs. Trump responded by saying that Greene had \"lost her way.\"   Asked about Greene's comments earlier Friday as he flew from Washington to Florida, Trump reiterated that he felt \"something happened to her over the last month or two,\" saying that, if he hadn't gone to China to meet leader Xi Jinping, there would have been negative ramifications for jobs in Georgia and elsewhere because China would have kept its curbs on magnet exports.   \n   Saying that people have been calling him, wanting to challenge Greene, Trump added, \"She's lost a wonderful conservative reputation.\"   Greene's discontent dates back at least to May, when she announced she wouldn't run for the Senate against Democratic incumbent Jon Ossoff, while attacking GOP donors and consultants who feared she couldn't win. In June, she publicly sided with Tucker Carlson after Trump called the commentator \"kooky\" in a schism that emerged between MAGA and national security hardliners over possible U.S. efforts at regime change in Iran.   \n   That only intensified in July, when Greene said she wouldn't run for governor. Then, she attacked a political \"good ole boy\" system, alleging it was endangering Republican control of the state. Greene embarked on a charm offensive in recent weeks, with interviews and appearances in media aimed at people who aren't hardcore Trump supporters. Asked on comedian Tim Dillon's podcast if she wanted to run for president in 2028, Greene said in October, \"I hate politics so much\" and just wanted \"to fix problems\" — but didn't give a definitive answer.   That climaxed with an appearance on Bill Maher's HBO show \"Real Time,\" followed days later by a Nov. 4 appearance on ABC's \"The View.\" Some observers began pronouncing Greene as reasonable as she trashed Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana for not calling Republicans back to Washington and coming up with a health care plan.   \"I feel like I'm sitting next to a completely different Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" said \"The View\" co-host Sunny Hostin.   \"Maybe you should become a Democrat, Marjorie,\" said co-host Joy Behar.   \"I'm not a Democrat,\" Greene replied. \"I think both parties have failed.\"\n",

Instead, it will shift money toward transitional housing that requires work and addiction treatment.   In a statement, the Department of Housing and Urban Development said the new policies will \"restore accountability\" and promote \"self-sufficiency\" by addressing the \"root causes of homelessness, including illicit drugs and mental illness.\" It also noted that overall homelessness funding is going up, from $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion.   170,000 people could be at risk of losing their housing    Critics warn the major overhaul could put 170,000 people at risk of losing their housing again. And they say the timing is terrible. Normally, funding notices go out months earlier, but now programs around the country will have little time to start applying for new funding. And in many places, it will leave a months-long gap after current funding runs out and before new money flows.   \n   \"We'll move very, very fast,\" said HUD policy expert Robert Marbut, in response to such concerns. He also noted the federal shutdown delayed the funding notice, though homelessness advocates say it was already behind schedule before that.   In another change, HUD will no longer automatically renew existing programs – creating the possibility that formerly homeless people who've lived in subsidized housing for years will be forced out. In fact, Marbut said the agency expects some programs to no longer receive funding because it will go to others instead. The agency also says it's opening up more funding for faith-based groups.   The National Alliance to End Homelessness says the new policies could upend life for people who've found stability in permanent housing programs, many of them seniors or disabled.   \"HUD's new funding priorities slam the door on them, their providers, and their communities. Make no mistake: homelessness will only increase because of this reckless and irresponsible decision,\" CEO Ann Oliva said in a statement.   The new policies could also shift more funding to places that enforce bans on homeless encampments.   \"Donald Trump's approach to homelessness does nothing to address the sky-high cost of rent, which remains the main cause of homelessness,\" Jesse Rabinowitz of the National Homelessness Law Center said in a statement.   \n   The funding shift reflects a conservative backlash to longstanding policies   For two decades, federal funding has prioritized getting people into permanent housing and then offering them treatment. That policy is called Housing First and has long had bipartisan support. Backers say the approach has a proven track record of keeping people off the streets.   But critics counter that it has failed to stem the steady rise of homelessness to what are now historic levels.   Those critics include President Trump, who has long pushed cities to clear homeless encampments from streets and parks. The new funding shift reflects an executive order he signed in July, which also sought to make it easier to confine unhoused people in mental institutions against their will.   \n   Marbut, the HUD policy expert, also said Housing First policies have failed to address rising death rates among unhoused people from meth and fentanyl addiction.   \"The influence of Housing First just became too powerful,\" says Stephen Eide, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think-tank. He calls it a top-down approach, and says for years it was hard to get funding unless a program followed that policy. Eide says that left out a large group of people who may not need permanent housing or who may want the enforced sobriety it does not offer.   \"I think what we're going to be looking for is a reinvestment in transitional housing,\" he says. That means places people can stay for 18 months or so to get sober, or recover in other ways, and then — ideally — move out and succeed on their own.   There's broad agreement that the U.S. needs more of every kind of support for homeless people: permanent housing, rehab and mental illness treatment. But critics of HUD's shift fear this may make it harder for some to get help.   \n   \"It is moving away from trauma-informed care, and that's problematic,\" says Stephanie Klasky-Gamer, president and CEO of LA Family Housing in Los Angeles.   For example, she thinks this will lead more shelters to bar people unless they're already sober or enrolled in recovery or mental health care. But that's a high bar for many people, she says, and it could backfire.\n",

The notice Norton received from human resources stated that the leave \"is not being done for any disciplinary purpose.\"   She is among a number of federal employees who have been openly critical of the Trump administration, both before and during the 43-day shutdown.   \n   Norton first spoke out in June, when she helped organize a call to action by hundreds of NIH scientists, pushing back against cuts and changes at the agency. They warned the Trump administration was politicizing research and canceling studies, putting the health of participants at risk.   In an interview with NPR in early October, Norton said she believed the Trump administration's deep funding and staffing cuts have created a situation inside NIH that is far worse than the public realizes.   \"I feel like I have this front row seat to the destruction of our democracy,\" she said. \"We are seeing it in real time with a president who is asking us to do things that are illegal and harmful to the American public.\"   The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIH, did not respond to NPR's questions about why Norton was placed on leave and instead issued a statement calling her a \"radical leftist\" who \"chooses to constantly criticize this administration, even when she is supposed to be working.\"   Norton responded on TikTok, saying \"If it is radically leftist to believe that NIH policies should not be actively harming research participants, then I will wear the radical left label proudly.\"   \n   Agriculture Department employee also on leave   On Thursday, the Federal Unionists Network, a coalition of former and current federal workers and union members, announced that an Agriculture Department employee who worked on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) had also been put on leave.   Ellen Mei, who also serves as president of National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) Chapter 255, received a notice of proposed termination on Oct. 3, a day after she raised concerns about food assistance programs in an interview on MSNBC, according to the Federal Unionists Network.    \"I didn't leak secrets or share anything confidential,\" said Mei in a statement released by the group. \"I told the truth about what's happening to hungry families and the people who serve them. I took an oath to serve the public — not to stay quiet while our government turns its back on the American people.\"   \n   In a statement, a spokesperson for USDA told NPR that the department does not comment on individual personnel matters, adding: \"During a lapse in appropriations, furloughed USDA employees are not authorized to perform any official duties, including speaking on behalf of the Department.\"   MSNBC prefaced Mei's interview by stating that she was not representing the government, but speaking in her own capacity.   A right to speak on matters of public concern   Norton says she believes federal workers not only have a right but an obligation to speak publicly on matters of the public interest.   She points to a 1968 Supreme Court decision that found public employees can speak on matters of public concern as long as the speech doesn't disrupt government operations. She knows federal employees also have whistleblower rights.   \"Allowing civil servants to put up a red flag when we're seeing a problem is critical to maintaining our democracy,\" she told NPR in October. \"These civil service protections aren't really about protecting me as a federal worker. They're about protecting our country.\"   \n   Still, on Friday, Norton told NPR she knew she was putting her job at risk by speaking out.   \"I was never under the impression that my rights would be respected,\" she said. \"I also recognized… that if you don't assert your rights because you're afraid or because you're demoralized or for whatever reason, then you've already given them up. You've let them be taken away. And I was determined not to do that.\"   NPR's Rob Stein contributed to this story.\n",

    "body": "\n      Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen voted to end the shutdown without healthcare stipulations. Her daughter, congressional candidate Stefany Shaheen, shares why she disagrees with her mother's decision.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire was a lead negotiator between several members of her party and Republicans to end the shutdown. Stefany Shaheen is her daughter and one of seven Democrats running for a House seat in New Hampshire, and she also publicly disagreed with her mother's consequential vote to reopen the government. We called her this morning to ask why. Good morning, Stefany, and thank you for being on the program.STEFANY SHAHEEN: Good morning, Leila. Thank you so much for having me today.FADEL: I want to start with why you don't support the deal that your mother ultimately negotiated.SHAHEEN: Sure. Well, you know, the fact is that improving health care has been the cause of my life. It became that when my eldest daughter, Elle, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when she was just 8 years old. It's the reason I got into this race, to improve and fight for better health care that's more affordable. And so when Speaker Johnson stated that he couldn't guarantee a vote to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits, I knew it was a deal I could not support in the House.FADEL: At any point during the actual conversations over the deal, when your mom was negotiating it, did you ever tell her, don't go through with it and here's why?SHAHEEN: Well, you know, I knew where she stood. She knew where I stood. She ultimately did what she thinks is right, and I'm doing what I think is right. And ultimately, what's right is to ensure that we turn this anger into action, and we demand that Speaker Johnson bring a vote to the floor to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits.FADEL: So when you say turn this anger into action, I mean, for anyone using the federal health care exchanges, out-of-pocket premium payments are expected to more than double without subsidies. In New Hampshire's first congressional district where you are running for office, there are more than 36,000 people who get their health insurance through the ACA marketplace. What are they telling you about what they want from Congress? And what are you telling them you will do if you get elected on this matter?SHAHEEN: Sure. Well, the first thing we have to do is extend these tax credits. You know, the fact is Republicans have made it pretty easy for them to extend their tax breaks to the billionaire friends they represent. And they're struggling very hard to figure out how to extend tax credits for the millions of Americans who need health care. The rising cost of health care in New Hampshire, a family of four can expect to see their premiums increase almost $7,000 next year if these tax credits don't get extended.It's simply unattainable. It's not affordable. And these costs on top of all the other expenses people are trying to navigate right now - with inflation, the rising cost of food, the rising cost of housing - it just can't keep going this way. We have to ensure we get these tax credits extended. And then beyond that, that's just the start of the fight. Then beyond that, we've got to do everything in our power to improve health care.We've got lots of ways of doing that. I think the first, most important step is that in the next six weeks, we have to get these tax credits extended. And so I invite all your listeners to check out our website and join us in this fight, stefanyshaheen.com, for the advocacy work we're going to need to do between now and the end of December. And let's be clear, we have to get these tax credits extended before January because that's when the premiums go up.FADEL: Now, the deal that passed that reopened the government didn't include any long-term commitment, as you mentioned, from Republicans to extend health care subsidies. But your mother noted about her vote that she thought the things that it did include were important - making sure federal workers got rehired and paid, food benefits got restored - that these were more important things and it's what the Democrats could get. I mean, do you agree?SHAHEEN: Well, I think ultimately the Senate is going to get a vote on the extension of the tax credits. And we need Speaker Johnson to guarantee the same thing. You know, being in a position where we're having...FADEL: But I guess, why wasn't that part of the deal originally? Like, it doesn't matter if the Senate does it if the House doesn't.SHAHEEN: Well, and that's why I had to speak out against it, because we have to have a vote in the House. You know, ultimately, being in a position where we're having to choose between sick kids and hungry kids is not a good place to be. And we have to make sure we still have time to channel this anger into action and get a vote in the House. The fight continues. And I think the fight has to be focused right now on doing everything in our power to make sure there's a bill that comes out of the Senate to extend the ACA tax credits and that we get the House to do the same before the end of December.FADEL: Is there a place for common ground between Democrats and Republicans on rising health care costs? Because it is something that is acknowledged on both sides of the aisle.SHAHEEN: There has to be. And, you know, part of that is my motivation in getting into this race. We collectively have to stand up and fight for what's right. And we know the health and well-being of the American people has to come first. So I am certain there's common ground here, and it can start with everyone agreeing to extend these tax credits before the end of December.FADEL: Stefany Shaheen is running to become a member of the U.S. House. She's the daughter of Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen and disagrees with her vote on this deal. Thank you so much.SHAHEEN: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Mark Schreiber, seen here in 2023, was one of 10 Republican holdouts in the chamber for a special session on redistricting.\n                \n                    John Hanna/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        John Hanna/AP\n    \n\n   \n   In September, Kansas Republican leaders said they wanted to join the national redistricting battle, initiated by President Trump, for control of the U.S. House.   But even in a state that went for Trump by 16 percentage points in 2024, Republicans could not rally enough support this fall for a special session on redistricting.   \"I haven't heard a good reason yet to vote for it,\" said Mark Schreiber, one of 10 Republican holdouts in the Kansas state House. \"To me that's not the purpose of redistricting. It's not used as a political tool to increase your majority, it's to adjust for population changes.\"   \n   Other Republican-led states — like Missouri, North Carolina and Texas — have heeded Trump's call for new congressional maps boosting the GOP. Last week, California voters approved new districts favoring Democrats.   \n   But Kansas' false start was just one example of lawmakers pushing back against a new round of partisan gerrymanders.   On Friday afternoon, Indiana's state Senate president announced there wasn't enough support for redistricting among the chamber's Republicans. Democrats in Maryland have faced scorn from party leaders for speaking out against proposed redraws. And in Ohio, where many expected Republicans to enact a severe gerrymander, a bipartisan deal resulted in a map that moderately advantaged the GOP.   Why do some lawmakers oppose redistricting that would help their party?   Lawmakers' reasons for bucking their party leaders appear to vary widely, including those who object to gerrymandering on philosophical grounds — and some who simply fear the maneuvers could backfire.   \"The particulars might be a little idiosyncratic to every state,\" said Patrick Miller, a political science professor at Kent State University in Ohio.   \n   Miller said some states, like New York and Colorado, have filing deadlines for congressional candidates that place an impossibly short timeline on potential redistricting efforts, given the steps needed in the states to craft a new map.   Meanwhile, lawmakers in Kansas and Indiana raised eyebrows at the six-figure sums required to pay legislators outside of a regular session.   Republican leaders in Kansas also faced a unique challenge. The state GOP would need to marshal nearly the full strength of its supermajorities in the state House and Senate to override a veto from the Democratic governor.   \n   Overall, Miller said, opposition to redistricting has not necessarily come from a place of righteous objection to gerrymandering.   \"I'm sure that there are some Republican legislators out there who are opposed to Trump, who are principled about … redistricting,\" Miller said. \"But I don't see this as a pushback on Trump at all.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Kansas Statehouse is seen in Topeka.\n                \n                    Zane Irwin/Kansas News Service\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Zane Irwin/Kansas News Service\n    \n\n   \n   Kansas state Rep. Clark Sanders said gerrymandering is a \"fact of life\" in politics. But he opposed hastily redrawing Kansas' 3rd District — held by the state's lone Democrat in Congress, Sharice Davids — because he thought it could backfire on Republicans.   \"If we weren't careful, we might end up redistricting and making it difficult to also win in the 2nd District,\" he said.   Sanders said he expressed the same concern when he received a call from the White House several weeks ago, to talk about redistricting.   Last week, Republican House Speaker Dan Hawkins stripped Sanders of a leadership position for refusing to sign off on a special session. He was one of seven committee chairs and vice chairs who were demoted for failing to toe the party line on redistricting.   \"It's unfortunate that we lost our positions,\" Sanders said. \"We just … felt like we needed to do what we needed to do.\"   Similar objections have sparked infighting in other states. Maryland's state Senate president, Democrat Bill Ferguson, has stood in opposition to his governor by publicly opposing redistricting.   Ferguson has argued a legal challenge could place redistricting in the hands of the conservative-leaning state Supreme Court — resulting in new maps that hurt Democrats, rather than giving them a leg up.   \"Ready to ride\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Republican, demoted seven lawmakers for failing to toe the party line on redistricting.\n                \n                    Zane Irwin/Kansas News Service\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Zane Irwin/Kansas News Service\n    \n\n   \n   Despite those setbacks, redistricting proponents in several states are still trying to convince holdouts — under the watchful eyes of the national parties.   Democratic Maryland Gov. Wes Moore recently formed a redistricting advisory commission, despite state Sen. Ferguson's pushback.    \n   And Kansas Republican leaders have vowed to put maps before lawmakers when their regular session begins in January.   \"I learned a long time ago that when you get thrown by the bull, you dust yourself off and you climb back on,\" House Speaker Hawkins wrote in a newsletter after his chamber rejected a special session.   When lawmakers return to Topeka early next year, he said, \"House Republicans will be ready to ride.\"   Even some holdouts in Kansas, like Republican state Rep. Adam Smith, said they had not ruled out the possibility of voting to redistrict in the future.   \"If there's another map that's drawn that looks a little bit more representative for my folks, I'd probably seriously consider voting for that,\" he said.\n",

And now, after dropping it from his lexicon for more than eight months, he's saying it again as polls show voters rank the economy and cost of living as their top concern and blame Trump's policies for making things worse.   A senior administration official tells NPR Trump will soon travel around the country with a message that while some things have improved, there is more work to do to help people feeling economic strain. The official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, added that when it comes to affordability, \"there's no finish line.\"   \n   Thus far, Trump has spent far more time boasting about how great the economy and stock market are doing than acknowledging any economic anxiety.   \"Record high, record high, record high,\" Trump said of the stock market last week at a business event in Florida.   \"Costs are way down,\" Trump said at a late night signing ceremony in the Oval Office Wednesday. \"My administration and our partners in Congress will continue our work to lower the cost of living, restore public safety, grow our economy and make America affordable again for all Americans.\"   \n   Trump's affordability challenge marks a dramatic reversal of fortune for a president who returned to office on a promise to bring costs down and whose greatest political strength was on the economy. Now his approval rating on the economy is severely underwater.   After sweeping wins by Democrats in last week's elections where the cost-of-living was a key issue, Trump suddenly had a lot to say about \"affordability.\" But he has frequently come across as dismissive and defensive.   \"The affordability is much better with the Republicans,\" Trump said last week. \"The only problem is the Republicans don't talk about it, and Republicans should start talking about it and use their heads.\"   \n   But earlier this week when Fox News' Laura Ingraham pressed Trump on rising costs of things like coffee and ground beef, he called it a \"con job by the Democrats.\"   Asked why people are anxious about the economy, Trump responded by questioning whether people really are saying that.   \"I think polls are fake,\" Trump said. \"We have the greatest economy we've ever had.\"   \n   To support his positive outlook, Trump points to the booming stock market, his tariff policy and pledges by companies and countries to invest in the U.S.   Inflation this year has been persistent but not dramatic, at about 3%. Eggs have gotten cheaper since Trump took office, but other staples like ground beef and coffee are up. According to Gas Buddy, the average price of gasoline in the U.S. is $3.09 per gallon, slightly higher than this time last year.   \"Consumer confidence is the lowest it's ever been,\" said Jason Furman, a professor of economics at Harvard. \"People are really negative about inflation.\"   It's a political truth — and a pitfall for presidents — that people don't want to hear that everything is awesome if they are struggling.   \n   Furman, who served in the Obama administration, says the messaging team in that White House was very cautious not to brag about the economy, as the nation emerged from the Great Recession.   \"Because they thought anything we said positive about the economy risked people thinking President Obama was out of touch,\" said Furman. \"I didn't see that type of reserve when Biden was president. He bragged about it quite a lot, and I think that [rang] hollow with a lot of people. And President Trump is even less reserved about his bragging.\"   Trump's insistence that the economy is great earned him a rebuke from Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. Appearing on the Sean Spicer Show on YouTube, Greene said she gives Trump credit for holding inflation steady.   \n   \"But that doesn't bring prices down,\" said Greene. \"And so gaslighting the people and trying to tell them that prices have come down is not helping. It's actually infuriating people because people know what they are paying at the grocery store, they know what they're paying for their kid's clothes and school supplies. They know what they're paying for their electricity bills.\"   She called for compassion rather than lecturing.   \n   Former Trump economic adviser Stephen Moore says there are three major cost issues that have to be addressed: grocery prices, home prices and health care costs.   \"It is true factually that the average family has more purchasing power today than they did when Biden left office,\" said Moore. \"And yet people don't feel it. You know, they're not feeling the love. And I can't explain why that is except that people tend to focus on things where their prices are rising.\"   In fact, purchasing power also grew during the Biden administration, because wages rose faster than costs. But voters didn't want to hear it then, and they are in no mood to hear it now.   \"People are kind of in a crabby mood right now when it comes to the economy,\" said Moore.\n",

    "body": "\n      The government reopened, more files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were released, and the White House is shifting some attention to affordability.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  The government is back open after a 43-day shutdown, the longest in U.S. history. But that wasn't the only story in politics this week. House Democrats released more files related to Jeffrey Epstein, and consumers still seem concerned about high prices. It's been a busy week, so we have invited senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro as well as White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben on. Nice to talk to both of you again. How's it going?DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Great. Good to talk to you.DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Great to be with you, Scott.DETROW: Domenico, let me start with you. Last week, we were talking about all the ways Democrats were winning. People in the party seemed excited. This week, Democrats are mad about the vote to end the shutdown. Is that as dramatic as a reversal as it seems?MONTANARO: Well, it's certainly a lot of whiplash for Democrats. I mean, progressives feel let down by the party again. It's yet another time when they feel steamrolled by leadership. But it's not all doom and gloom for the party coming out of the shutdown with really nothing to show for it. They elevated the issue of health care as a major issue, and that's forcing Republicans on the defensive here. And coming off Democrats' sweeping victories earlier this month in the off-year elections, affordability was the big issue there. So Democrats clearly now have these two issues to run on, especially if Republicans in Congress block the extension of health care subsidies in this promised vote that could take place next month.KURTZLEBEN: And if those subsidies are blocked, there would be real consequences beyond partisan politics. Insurance premiums could go super high for people in those ACA marketplaces if they lose their subsidies. According to KFF, a nonprofit health policy think tank, premiums could go up by 114% on average, so that's more than double. That is hundreds of dollars a month for some people, and that is money they could be spending on rent or groceries or gas money.DETROW: I mean, that is notable. It's only been a few days since that vote, but it kind of seems like the White House is trying to move on from the shutdown already. Is that fair?KURTZLEBEN: Yeah, and trying is the operative word there. But really, all of Washington is moving on from the shutdown, but for different reasons. Now, the White House, for its part, they seem totally fine to keep talking about the shutdown. Vice President JD Vance talked quite a bit about it on Fox News last night, and he was delivering the message we've been hearing from the White House for weeks, which is the Democrats caused this, and now they've caved, so this all happened for nothing.But now you have two things happening that are nudging the White House past all of this. One is that Trump's approval, especially on the economy, has been falling and is still falling. And two, House Democrats released those Jeffrey Epstein emails that just look really bad for the president. One of them, for example, says that Trump, quote, \"knew about the girls.\" Now, this raises the perennial question about the relationship between Trump and Epstein. What exactly was the nature of their relationship, and what did Trump know?DETROW: Domenico, walk us through a little more about what were in these files and how all of this affects Trump politically.MONTANARO: Well, I mean, look, we've always said that Trump has a high floor and a low ceiling when it comes to his approval ratings. You know, this is unlikely to be the thing that has Trump's base abandon him. You know, that hasn't happened with any number of controversies over the decade that Trump has been on the political scene, but this does keep the pressure on Trump, something Democrats are happy to do. It's irritating for Trump. He doesn't want to talk about it. Any day Trump is having to talk about Epstein really is a bad day for him and the White House.Trump is reverting to a typical playbook here, calling it a Democratic hoax. But let's remember, he promised to release these files during the 2024 presidential campaign, and when a big part of his base believes this conspiracy that there's a cabal of high-powered people who are pedophiles in the government, then this is not something Trump wants to have to be talking about or explaining away. He wants it to go away, but the drip drip drip makes it hard to do that.DETROW: But it's a lot of drip drip drip, and it is incredibly hard to keep track of.KURTZLEBEN: Yeah. So to be super clear on all of this, what was released this week by Congress was not the Epstein files we keep talking about. The DOJ has those, and the House still has to vote on releasing those. But even if they do, the Senate might not even take it up. And if they do, it's almost certain they'll vote it down. And even if they didn't, the president could veto it. Now, given all of that, you might ask why there's so much attention on this vote. Well, part of it is that attention has just been snowballing during the long wait for the House to even vote on this, not to mention given how hard the White House is fighting it. But on a basic human level, there were very real victims of Jeffrey Epstein, and they're fighting for this, and sympathizing with them isn't partisan.DETROW: All of this is happening at a time the White House is trying to talk about affordability. We noted earlier that Trump's approval on this issue is not great. Danielle, have they made any headway with that message?KURTZLEBEN: Well, that's going to remain to be seen. For now they are talking once again about trade and tariffs. They announced on Thursday, for example, some frameworks of trade deals that they're going to work out with some Latin American countries. Now, a framework means nothing is implemented yet, but it's in the White House's interest to show they're doing things, so they're sure talking about it.Now, tariffs have raised the price on some groceries, and Americans are feeling it. So what the White House is saying they're doing is they're removing tariffs on some goods that can't be grown in the U.S., like coffee and bananas. So the White House would, by removing those tariffs, be lowering prices that they themselves helped to increase. And also the White House will likely be trying to announce more trade moves before the Supreme Court rules on whether a bunch of their tariffs are even lawful.MONTANARO: Look, affordability is probably going to be the big issue for next year, and if it continues to be the main issue, that's good for Democrats since Republicans are in charge. And that's an ironic twist considering it's exactly the issue that hurt former President Biden and Democrats in the last years of his presidency and in the 2024 election.DETROW: That is NPR's Domenico Montanaro and Danielle Kurtzleben. Thanks to both of you.MONTANARO: Thank you.KURTZLEBEN: Thanks, Scott.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Today's top stories   The White House says newly released Jeffrey Epstein documents don't prove any wrongdoing by President Trump. Within the more than 1,000 mentions of Trump in the documents, an email says Trump spent hours at the convicted sex offender's home with a victim. Republican strategist Alex Conant says the documents may not necessarily change people's minds for the next election, but it makes for a not-so-good week for the president.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump arrives for the signing ceremony for the \"Fostering the Future\" executive order in the East Room of the White House on Nov. 13, 2025.\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Conant says that the White House should have handled the Epstein story differently by releasing all the information they had. The White House claims it has been transparent about the situation, but at the same time, Trump doesn't want to answer questions about Epstein, NPR's Deepa Shivaram tells Up First. Conant points out that Trump's strategy is to deflect, attack and then change the story, but due to the slow drip of the Epstein story, it has been harder for the president to overcome this scandal.   The Trump administration has selected Charlotte, N.C., as the next city for its immigration crackdown, according to Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden. The sheriff said yesterday that federal officials contacted him and could arrive as early as tomorrow. The development comes as some Border Patrol agents are leaving Chicago, after weeks of aggressive raids there.    \n   🎧 Charlotte drew national attention this fall following the fatal stabbing of a Ukrainian woman on public transit, says Nick de la Canal with NPR network station WFAE. The suspect was not an immigrant, but Republicans and the White House criticized the city's Democratic mayor for the crime. Violent crime is down 20% over the last year, according to de la Canal, but there have still been calls for the National Guard to deploy to the area. It is currently unknown how many agents are expected to arrive in the city, and the community has been reacting with fear to the news, despite advocacy groups urging calm.   Trump will soon travel across the U.S. to address the economic hardship Americans are feeling, a senior administration official told NPR. Trump's message will be that, while some things have improved, there is still more work to be done. This comes as the president revives the talking point of making America affordable again — a pledge that helped him win the White House again but that has not been much of a focus the past eight months. Currently, voters rank the economy and cost of living as their top concerns in polls, and many blame Trump's policies for exacerbating these issues.   \n   Today's listen   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Why exercise is on the rise.\n                \n                    J_art/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        J_art/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Exercise appears to be more popular than ever in the U.S., from fitness influencers sharing gym tips on social media to fitness being a focus in our politics.

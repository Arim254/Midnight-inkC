    "body": "\n      President Trump ran as the Peace President, but since taking office has been on a military spree with strikes on Iran, Yemen, Nigeria, Syria and Venezuela — and threats against others.   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  It has been a remarkable start to the new year for President Trump, from authorizing an attack on Venezuela in the wee hours last Saturday to threatening a takeover of Greenland. This from a president who openly covets the Nobel Peace Prize and who ran on a campaign promising no U.S. involvement in foreign wars. NPR international affairs correspondent Jackie Northam has this report.JACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: By any measure, President Trump's second term has been far more muscular than his first - launching military strikes and issuing threats from Africa to the Middle East and now Latin America. Here he is on Air Force One just hours after the U.S. raid on Venezuela and the arrest of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, contemplating what could be next for Mexico and its drug cartels...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Mexico has to get their act together because they're pouring through Mexico and we're going to have to do something.NORTHAM: ...For Iran...(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they're going to get hit very hard by the United States.NORTHAM: ...And Greenland.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: We need Greenland from a national security situation. It's so strategic.NORTHAM: Trump also made similar suggestions about Cuba and Colombia. There have been strikes on Yemen, Syria and Nigeria. He's threatened Canada, Panama and others.STEWART PATRICK: There's no question that in his second term, Donald Trump is entirely unbound and he's eager to throw America's weight around in the world.NORTHAM: That's Stewart Patrick, a specialist on world order and international cooperation at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He says Trump is waving aside rules-based international order in his effort to ensure U.S. dominance.PATRICK: Donald Trump feels zero restraints and is experiencing a great sense of hubris in terms of his interactions with the world. You know, he's in a sense on a sugar high after having (laughter) gotten rid of President Maduro.NORTHAM: Laurel Rapp, who heads up the U.S. and North America Programme at Chatham House, a London-based think tank, agrees Trump is demonstrating more muscular foreign policy ambitions in his second term. She sees several major differences from his first term in office.LAUREL RAPP: The first is geography. Trump is willing to use U.S. military force across the world, from Latin America to Africa to the Middle East, and now potentially in Greenland, in Europe.NORTHAM: Rapp says the second difference is the level of risk involved. The Venezuela operation is a case in point.RAPP: And the third big difference is that he is willing to not just go after adversaries but also allies - treaty allies.NORTHAM: Stephen Miller, one of Trump's top aides, lays bare the administration's view on raw power during an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STEPHEN MILLER: We live in a world - in the real world, Jake - that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world that have existed...JAKE TAPPER: But are you saying that...MILLER: ...Since the beginning of time.NORTHAM: But Rapp, who spent 14 years at the State Department, says just because the military can invade a country doesn't mean it'll bring sustained change.RAPP: When you have insufficient planning, when you have unclear and conflicting objectives, a lack of diplomatic capacity in the country, limited or shifting U.S. attention and unrealistic timelines, these are all recipes for failure.NORTHAM: Carnegie's Patrick says the administration's embrace of force to advance national interests is enabling great powers in other parts of the world.PATRICK: Not least China and Russia to actually legitimate their own claims to a sphere of influence in their immediate backyards. So he's providing cover to a number of U.S. adversaries around the world to do the same thing where they are.NORTHAM: There's always the notion that threats against Greenland, Colombia and other nations are just overheated rhetoric or a negotiating tactic. But Venezuela proves nothing is off the table.Jackie Northam, NPR News.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      In a rare rebuke to President Trump, five Republicans joined with Democrats on Thursday to advance a measure that would require congressional authorization for future military action in Venezuela.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  Five Senate Republicans joined with Democrats to advance a resolution to stop President Trump from ordering new unilateral military action against Venezuela. Here is Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer following that vote.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHUCK SCHUMER: It's a clear rejection of the idea that one person can unilaterally send American sons and daughters into harm's way without Congress, without debate.SUMMERS: It marks the largest Republican rebuke of Trump's policy on Venezuela after last weekend's military raid that ousted president Nicolás Maduro. Joining us now is NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales. Hi.CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Hi, Juana.SUMMERS: So, Claudia, the same bipartisan group - which was largely led by Democrats - it's forced several votes to limit Trump's war powers, but there have been mixed results. So tell us what's different.GRISALES: Well, quite a bit. As we know, President Trump demands fierce loyalty from this Republican-led Congress, and his party has largely stayed in line. But seeing five Senate Republicans break ranks today signals Congress may not have the same appetite as the White House for expansion of military action against Venezuela. Tim Kaine, the Virginia Senate Democrat who co-led this effort, said members learned through Trump-led classified briefings this week that a lot of information about this operation has been withheld from the public.TIM KAINE: We know a lot that we can't describe. Once folks start to get deeper and deeper into this, I think they're not going to like it.GRISALES: And he says that's partly a reason why more Republicans are shifting to support this. And Democrats and even some Republicans argue there's still a lot of questions about the next steps, such as the potential for the U.S.-Venezuela conflict to continue for the next year or more, the cost to the American public, expansion of this conflict to other countries and more.SUMMERS: The success of this vote apparently came as quite a surprise to other Republicans who voted against the measure. Have we heard from the Republicans who broke ranks?GRISALES: Yeah. Many have pointed to the same concerns about whether this could lead to another endless war. Kentucky GOP Senator Rand Paul has co-led several of these efforts with Kaine. I asked him, what is his biggest concern at this stage?RAND PAUL: I want to make sure that the war doesn't spread throughout South America or throughout the Caribbean and that there's diplomatic alternatives.GRISALES: Republican Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Todd Young of Indiana joined Paul and Democrats to vote yes, some for the first time - and that includes Young. He was a no on three war powers-related votes last year, but a yes today. And he said, while he applauded bringing Maduro to justice, he believes the vast majority of his state is not prepared to commit troops to Venezuela.SUMMERS: Claudia, have we heard any of the response from President Trump at this point?GRISALES: Yeah. Quickly after the vote, he lashed out at those five Senate Republicans on his social media site. He said the parties should, quote, \"be ashamed\" of these GOP members, and they should never be elected to office again. And he argued, despite their, quote, \"stupidity,\" that the War Powers Act is unconstitutional. But of course, we know that's not clear in this case. It's also worth noting here that some of these lawmakers, like Senator Collins, are in a tight election race come this November.SUMMERS: That's right. Claudia, last thing - what's next?GRISALES: Well, this sets up a series of votes next week in the Senate. The first is a procedural vote, and if that passes, it would lead to hours of debate, potentially more votes before a bid for final passage. But as we saw in that post by the president, he seemed to warn Republicans who sided with Democrats to reconsider their position. So they're going to have a lot of weight on their shoulders if they break ranks again.SUMMERS: NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales, thank you.GRISALES: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

Appearing together, Mamdani and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced a plan to increase spending on child care starting this year with the goal of eventually providing universal child care throughout the state for kids under 5.   In an interview with All Things Considered, Mamdani said the announcement means the state will commit $1.21 billion for New York City \"to take the first steps towards universal child care.\"   The city will be able to fund fixes to make universal care for 3-year-olds \"a reality\" and work toward enrolling about 2,000 kids aged 2 this fall, Mamdani added. He also praised Hochul for her partnership and for her commitment to fund the plan over the next two years.   \n   Unfulfilled promises have turned New Yorkers away from politics, Mamdani said, adding that \"if we want people to believe in our democracy, we have to show them that our democracy can actually deliver for them.\"   Speaking to NPR's Juana Summers, Mamdani discussed how the city and state will pay for and manage the expanded childcare program, the challenges posed by the Trump administration's freeze on national childcare assistance funding and immigration enforcement.

Tim Walz disagreed on the details of Wednesday's fatal shooting in Minneapolis and how to investigate it.   Walz on Thursday told the federal government to \"leave Minnesota alone\" and allow state officials to conduct the investigation into the shooting by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent that left one woman dead and Minneapolis residents on edge.   Walz repeatedly expressed concerns about the federal government leading the investigation without Minnesota officials.   \"It feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome, and I say that only because people in positions of power have already passed judgment, from the president, to the vice president, to [Secretary of Homeland Security] Kristi Noem,\" Walz said.   \n   Officials within the Trump administration quickly defended the ICE agent's actions as justifiable use of force, after civilian footage taken at the scene seemed to show Renee Good's SUV attempting to drive away from masked ICE agents, one of whom subsequently fired three shots into the driver's window, killing the 37-year-old wife and mother.   During Thursday's White House press conference, Vice President Vance said, \"I don't care what Tim Walz says\" and added that the ICE agent's life was in danger during the incident.   \"You have a woman who was trying to obstruct a legitimate law enforcement operation. … You have a woman who aimed her car at a law enforcement officer and pressed on the accelerator,\" Vance said.   At the core of each press conference was a different understanding of the facts.   Walz called the federal law enforcement presence in Minnesota \"a reckless ICE mobilization\" that \"is not keeping us safe\" and encouraged Minnesotans to support Good's family.   At the White House, Vance said, \"This is absolutely a tragedy, but it's a tragedy of the making of the far left. They have radicalized a very small segment of the population, taught them that ICE agents are engaging in wide-scale violation of people's rights.\"   \n   To get a better understanding of what happened, both men said an investigation would be necessary.   Walz said that Minnesota has the experience required to handle high-profile investigations such as this, pointing to the 2020 murder of George Floyd at the hands of former police officer Derek Chauvin.   \"The only way we find the answers is a thorough investigation by nonpartisan professionals,\" Walz said. \"We've delivered that. We've been able to do it.\"   The state's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which was initially tapped to conduct a joint investigation with the FBI, released a statement on Thursday stating that the agency had been kicked off the search in favor of allowing the federal government to conduct the operation on its own.   Vance said the federal government is better suited to handle the investigation. \"The Department of Justice is already investigating this. The Department of Homeland Security is already investigating this,\" Vance said.   He added, \"But the simple fact is, what you see is what you get in this case.\"\n",

In the interview on Fox News on Thursday night, Trump praised the government of acting President Delcy Rodríguez, saying: \"they've been great. ... Everything we've wanted, they've given us.\"   Jorge Rodríguez, brother of the acting president and head of Venezuela's National Assembly, said a \"significant number\" of people would be freed, but as of late Thursday night it was still not clear who or how many people would be released. The U.S. government and Venezuela's opposition have long demanded the widespread release of imprisoned politicians, critics and members of civil society. The Venezuelan government insists it does not hold prisoners for political reasons.   \n   \"Consider this a gesture by the Bolivarian (Venezuelan) government, which is broadly intended to seek peace,\" he announced.   High profile releases   Among those released was Biagio Pilieri, an opposition leader who was part of Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado's 2024 presidential campaign, according to Foro Penal, an advocacy group for prisoners based in Venezuela's capital, Caracas. Also released was Enrique Márquez, a former electoral authority and candidate in the 2024 presidential election, the organization said.   Videos posted by journalists on social media show Márquez and Pilieri embracing loved ones on the streets outside the prison. One video showed Márquez beaming and video-calling family members, saying, \"Soon I will be with you all.\"   Five Spanish citizens — including the prominent Venezuelan-Spanish lawyer and human rights activist Rocío San Miguel — were also released in the afternoon and, as the night wore on, reports trickled out of more detainees walking free. Relatives who waited for hours outside a prison in Guatire, about an hour east of Caracas, briefly chanted, \"Libertad! Libertad!\" meaning \"Freedom! Freedom!\"   Venezuela's government has a history of releasing people imprisoned for political reasons — including real and perceived opponents — during moments of high tension to signal openness to dialogue. The releases on Thursday were the first since Maduro was deposed.   \n   Human rights groups and members of the opposition were encouraged by the move, though it wasn't clear yet what it represented — whether the growing pains of a government in transition or a symbolic overture to placate the Trump administration, which has allowed Maduro's loyalists to stay in power as it exerts pressure through crippling sanctions.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Relatives of detainee Yosnars Baduel embrace outside the Rodeo I prison in Guatire, Venezuela, Thursday, Jan. 8, 2026, after National Assembly President Jorge Rodriguez said the government would release Venezuelan and foreign prisoners.\n                \n                    Matias Delacroix/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Matias Delacroix/AP\n    \n\n   \n   'Nothing brings back the stolen years   For opposition leader Machado – whom Trump has snubbed by endorsing Rodríguez to lead the transition — the gesture was \"an act of moral restitution.\"   \n   \"Nothing brings back the stolen years,\" she said in an audio message from exile addressed to families of released detainees, urging them to take comfort in the knowledge that \"injustice will not be eternal and that the truth, though badly wounded, eventually prevails.\"   Alfredo Romero, president of Foro Penal, expressed cautious hope \"that this is indeed the beginning of the dismantling of a repressive system in Venezuela ... and not a mere gesture, a charade of releasing some prisoners and incarcerating others.\"   Despite a widespread crackdown in the aftermath of the tumultuous 2024 election — in which authorities said they detained more than 2,000 people — Venezuela's government denies that there are prisoners unjustly detained, accusing them of plotting to destabilize Maduro's government.   Romero's organization said that as of Dec. 29, 2025, there were 863 people detained in Venezuela \"for political reasons.\"   The Spanish government said Thursday that five of its citizens, including dual national San Miguel, had been released from custody in Venezuela and would soon return to Spain.   Speaking to Spanish broadcaster RNE, Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares identified the other Spanish nationals released as Andrés Martínez, José María Basoa, Ernesto Gorbe and Miguel Moreno.   Two of them, Martínez and Basoa, were arrested in Venezuela in September 2024 and accused of plotting to destabilize Maduro's government as Spanish spies — allegations vehemently denied by Spain.   \n   Spain's El País newspaper reported Thursday that another freed detainee, Gorbe, was arrested in 2024 on allegations of overstaying his visa.   Families wait outside prisons   As the news of the release broke Thursday, families of detainees rushed to prisons across the country, seeking information on their loved ones.   Pedro Durán, 60, was among those hoping to reunite with his brother Franklin Durán as he waited outside the prison in Guatire. Durán said his brother was detained in 2021 on charges of trying to overthrow Maduro's government — an accusation his family denies.   Durán, who has been living in Spain, heard rumors on Wednesday that the government could release a number of detainees and immediately bought a plane ticket from Madrid to Caracas to find his brother.   \"I don't have words to express the emotion I'm feeling,\" Durán said. \"We're feeling a lot of hope ... We're just waiting now.\"   Despite the anticipation, fear persists.   \"Of course everyone here is very scared, but what more could (the government) do to us that they haven't done already,\" he added.   'A bargaining chip'   Ronal Rodríguez, a researcher at the Venezuelan Observatory at the University of Rosario in Bogotá, Colombia, said the government releases prisoners at politically strategic moments.   In July last year, Venezuela released 10 jailed U.S. citizens and permanent residents in exchange for the repatriation of over 200 Venezuelans deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador, where they had been held in a prison built to house criminal gangs.   \"The regime uses them like a bargaining chip,\" he said of prisoners in Venezuela. It will be telling to see not only how many people the government releases, he said, but also under what conditions and whether the releases include anyone high-profile.   On Wednesday, the Trump administration sought to assert its control over Venezuelan oil, seizing a pair of sanctioned tankers transporting petroleum and announcing plans to relax some sanctions so the U.S. can oversee the sale of Venezuela's petroleum worldwide.   \n   Both moves reflect the administration's determination to make good on its effort to control the next steps in Venezuela through its vast oil resources. Trump pledged after the capture of Maduro that the U.S. will \"run\" the country.   Trump on Thursday night said that Machado may be visiting Washington next week and that he may be meeting with her.   \"I understand she's coming in next week some time and I look forward to saying hello to her,\" Trump said in the Fox News interview with Sean Hannity. \"And I've heard that she wants to do that.\"\n",

Reactions to the shooting reflect outrage over Good's death and a deep divide in how it's portrayed — as either a tragic abuse of power or an officer acting in self-defense.   NPR identified the ICE agent who fired the gun as Jonathan Ross by cross-referencing court records with details about the officer released by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem at a Wednesday news conference. Noem — without naming the officer — said he had been in a previous confrontation with a protester.   \n   \"The very same officer who was attacked today had previously been dragged by an anti-ICE rioter who had rammed him with a car and [dragged] him back in June. He sustained injuries at that time, as well,\" she said.   \n   The description of the incident matches a court case against a Mexican national, Roberto Carlos Munoz-Guatemala, who was found guilty in December of assaulting a federal officer in Bloomington, Minn. DHS confirmed to NPR that is the court case that Noem referenced. Ross' name is mentioned in the court documents for the case. According to court records, federal officers attempting to arrest Munoz-Guatemala, who had been convicted of sexual abuse, pulled him over in his car. Munoz-Guatemala sped away after Ross had reached inside the vehicle, trapping the agent's arm and causing him to sustain injuries to his arm and hand.   Noem said that Wednesday's shooting occurred after protesters in Minneapolis harassed and impeded ICE agents and that the officer acted to protect himself and fellow officers. She alleged that Good's actions amounted to \"an act of domestic terrorism.\"   Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison told NPR's Morning Edition that he disagrees with Noem's characterization of Good as a domestic terrorist.   \"She was a compassionate neighbor trying to be a legal observer on behalf of her immigrant neighbors,\" Ellison said. \"That's what she was doing at the moment of her death. And she was a poet. She was a mom. She was a daughter. And I am deeply saddened by what happened to her and her family.\"   \n   2 people wounded in a shooting involving Border Patrol agents in Portland, Ore.   As Minneapolis continued to grapple with the fatal shooting, police in Portland, Ore., said two people were injured in a shooting by federal agents.   Around 2:15 p.m. local time on Thursday, a man and a woman were shot by federal agents in East Portland, according to the Portland Police Bureau. FBI Portland told member station OPB that U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents were involved. The two people wounded were taken to a local hospital. Their conditions were unknown.   \"We are still in the early stages of this incident,\" said Portland Police Chief Bob Day in a press release. \"We understand the heightened emotion and tension many are feeling in the wake of the shooting in Minneapolis, but I am asking the community to remain calm as we work to learn more.\"   Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said the shooting occurred while Border Patrol agents were conducting a \"targeted vehicle stop.\" McLaughlin asserted that the driver \"weaponized his vehicle and attempted to run over the law enforcement agents\" after agents identified themselves. McLaughlin said the driver and passenger were affiliated with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua but did not offer evidence of their gang association.   \"Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired a defensive shot. The driver drove off with the passenger, fleeing the scene,\" she said in a statement. \"This situation is evolving, and more information is forthcoming.\"   Competing narratives quickly emerge   Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and other local officials have dismissed Noem's version of events as political spin. At a news conference on Wednesday, Frey said of the self-defense explanation, \"Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody that is bull****. \"   \"This was a federal agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying,\" Frey said, adding that he wants ICE units to leave Minneapolis.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A woman and other demonstrators confront federal officers outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis on Thursday, one day after a federal agent fatally shot a woman in her car in south Minneapolis.\n                \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Scott Olson/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he was angered by the killing, which he linked to President Trump's policy of sending ICE and other federal agents surging into cities such as Minneapolis.   \n   \"What we're seeing is the consequences of governance designed to generate fear, headlines and conflict,\" Walz said on Wednesday. \"It's governing by reality TV and today that recklessness cost someone their life.\"   Noem said on Wednesday that she had spoken with Walz about the killing, but added that they don't agree on whether it was justified: \"We have two very different viewpoints on what happened.\"   Hours after the shooting, Noem defended the ICE officer who shot Good, saying the woman had blocked federal officers with her SUV and disobeyed orders to get out of her vehicle.   \"It's clearly established law that a vehicle driven by a person and used to harm someone is a deadly weapon,\" she said, as NPR reported. \"Deadly force is perfectly lawful when a threat is faced by a weapon, so I do believe that this officer used his training in this situation.\"   When Noem was asked on Thursday whether the officer remains on field duty, Noem said he had gone to a hospital for treatment, but was then released \"and is spending time with his family now.\"   Noem also said the federal surge in Minneapolis will continue, and could even grow.   \"We've got thousands of officers there,\" she said, \"and I'm not opposed to sending more if necessary to keep people safe.\"   Key details of a controversial shooting   Here is a brief overview of what we know so far about the events leading to Good's death:   When: Police officers responded to reports of shots fired just after 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, according to a timeline published by the city of Minneapolis.   \"Minneapolis firefighters then removed the 37-year-old victim from the vehicle and immediately began lifesaving measures until paramedics could respond,\" the city's account states. \"She was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center, where she later died.\"   \n   Where: Good was shot in her car on Portland Avenue, near East 34th Street, in a residential area a few blocks north of where police killed George Floyd in May 2020.   ICE agents at the scene were trying to deal with a vehicle that had gotten stuck in the snow, Noem said on Wednesday. As other ICE vehicles arrived, so did protesters, a witness named Caitlin Callenson told member station MPR.   How: Callenson, who recorded a video of the incident, told MPR that agents gave Good conflicting orders: One agent told her to drive away while another told her to get out of her SUV, Callenson said.   (Warning: The video at the following link includes violent actions and profanity.)   Video footage from the scene shows Good's Honda Pilot SUV sitting sideways on a snowy street, with her driver's side window down. Two uniformed officers approach the vehicle from the left. As one officer grabs at her door handle, a third officer who had circled to the front of the SUV from the opposite side draws his gun. As Good begins to drive away, the officer fires into her car.   \"The preliminary information that we have indicates that this woman was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway,\" Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said at a news conference Wednesday. \"At some point, a federal law enforcement officer approached her on foot and the vehicle began to drive off. At least two shots were fired. The vehicle then crashed on the side of the roadway.\"   What's next: On Wednesday, O'Hara said the FBI and Minnesota's state agency, the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, would jointly investigate the fatal shooting.   But in a statement Thursday, the BCA said that the U.S. Attorney's Office reversed course at the federal level, and the FBI alone would lead the investigation, as MPR reports. The BCA said it \"has reluctantly withdrawn\" from the process, because it would no longer have access to case materials and evidence.   \n   Ellison, Minnesota's attorney general, said that he believes the FBI should not be involved in the inquiry.   \"I know that ICE and FBI are different agencies,\" Ellison said, \"but I think in order for public confidence to be at its best, there is some legitimate question as to what the role the FBI should be playing.\"   NPR's Ximena Bustillo contributed reporting. \n",

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dismissed Trump as having hands \"stained with the blood of Iranians\" as supporters shouted \"Death to America!\" in footage aired by Iranian state television.   Protesters are \"ruining their own streets to make the president of another country happy,\" Khamenei said, referring to Trump. There was no immediate response from Washington, though Trump reiterated his pledge to strike Iran if protesters are killed.   \n   Despite Iran's theocracy cutting off the nation from the internet and international telephone calls, short online videos shared by activists purported to show protesters chanting against Iran's government around bonfires as debris littered the streets in the capital, Tehran, and other areas into Friday morning. Iranian state media alleged \"terrorist agents\" of the U.S. and Israel set fires and sparked violence. It also said there were \"casualties,\" without elaborating.   The full scope of the demonstrations couldn't be immediately determined due to the communications blackout, though it represented yet another escalation in protests that began over Iran's ailing economy and that has morphed into the most significant challenge to the government in several years. The protests have intensified steadily since beginning Dec. 28.   The protests also represented the first test of whether the Iranian public could be swayed by Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, whose fatally ill father fled Iran just before the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution. Pahlavi, who called for the protests Thursday night, similarly has called for demonstrations at 8 p.m. Friday.   Demonstrations have included cries in support of the shah, something that could bring a death sentence in the past but now underlines the anger fueling the protests that began over Iran's ailing economy.   \n   So far, violence around the demonstrations has killed at least 42 people while more than 2,270 others have been detained, said the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.   \"What turned the tide of the protests was former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi's calls for Iranians to take to the streets at 8 p.m. on Thursday and Friday,\" said Holly Dagres, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \"Per social media posts, it became clear that Iranians had delivered and were taking the call seriously to protest in order to oust the Islamic Republic.\"   \"This is exactly why the internet was shut down: to prevent the world from seeing the protests. Unfortunately, it also likely provided cover for security forces to kill protesters.\"   Thursday night protests preceded internet shutdown   When the clock struck 8 p.m. Thursday, neighborhoods across Tehran erupted in chanting, witnesses said. The chants included \"Death to the dictator!\" and \"Death to the Islamic Republic!\" Others praised the shah, shouting: \"This is the last battle! Pahlavi will return!\" Thousands could be seen on the streets before all communication to Iran cut out.   \"Iranians demanded their freedom tonight. In response, the regime in Iran has cut all lines of communication,\" Pahlavi said. \"It has shut down the Internet. It has cut landlines. It may even attempt to jam satellite signals.\"   He went on to call for European leaders to join U.S. President Donald Trump in promising to \"hold the regime to account.\"   \"I call on them to use all technical, financial, and diplomatic resources available to restore communication to the Iranian people so that their voice and their will can be heard and seen,\" he added. \"Do not let the voices of my courageous compatriots be silenced.\"   Pahlavi had said he would offer further plans depending on the response to his call. His support of and from Israel has drawn criticism in the past — particularly after the 12-day war Israel waged on Iran in June. Demonstrators have shouted in support of the shah in some demonstrations, but it isn't clear whether that's support for Pahlavi himself or a desire to return to a time before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.   \n   The internet cut also appears to have taken Iran's state-run and semiofficial news agencies offline as well. The state TV acknowledgment at 8 a.m. Friday represented the first official word about the demonstrations.   State TV claimed the protests saw violence that caused casualties but did not elaborate. It also said the protests saw \"people's private cars, motorcycles, public places such as the metro, fire trucks and buses set on fire.\"   Trump renews threat over protester deaths   Iran has faced rounds of nationwide protests in recent years. As sanctions tightened and Iran struggled after the 12-day war, its rial currency collapsed in December, reaching 1.4 million to $1. Protests began soon after, with demonstrators chanting against Iran's theocracy.   It remains unclear why Iranian officials have yet to crack down harder on the demonstrators. Trump warned last week that if Tehran \"violently kills peaceful protesters,\" America \"will come to their rescue.\"   In an interview with talk show host Hugh Hewitt aired Thursday, Trump reiterated his pledge.   Iran has \"been told very strongly, even more strongly than I'm speaking to you right now, that if they do that, they're going to have to pay hell,\" Trump said.   Trump demurred when asked if he'd meet with Pahlavi.   \"I'm not sure that it would be appropriate at this point to do that as president,\" Trump said. \"I think that we should let everybody go out there, and we see who emerges.\"   Speaking in an interview with Sean Hannity aired Thursday night on Fox News, Trump went as far as to suggest 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei may be looking to leave Iran.   \"He's looking to go someplace,\" Trump said. \"It's getting very bad.\"\n",

The action happened swiftly, with brief debate, in floor action Thursday. Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina had announced during this week's fifth anniversary of the Capitol siege that he would seek to ensure the plaque is installed, partnering with Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who was also working on the situation, and Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California. No senators objected.   \n   \"A lot of people said it was a dark day for democracy,\" Tillis said about Jan. 6, 2021, describing his memory of hearing the thousands of people — \"thugs,\" he said — lay siege to the Capitol as Congress was tallying the 2020 election results.   \n   He said that because of the work of the law enforcement officers, it instead became a great day for democracy. \"We came back and completed our constitutional duty to certify the election,\" he said. \"We owe them eternal gratitude and this nation is stronger because of them.\"   This week, senators stepped up after learning the plaque, which had been approved by Congress more than three years ago, was nowhere to be found at the Capitol. Instead, many House lawmakers have been hanging up replicas outside their office doors.   The Senate also appeared to be motivated by the shifting narrative from President Donald Trump 's White House about what happened Jan. 6, 2021, when his supporters stormed the building after he urged them go to Capitol Hill to confront Congress over Democrat Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.   Trump himself shifted blame for the attack during a speech this week in which he said he only intended for his supporters to march peacefully to the Capitol. Moreover, the White House produced a glossy new report also shifting blame for the deadly riot — on Democrats, for Biden's victory over Trump, and on the police for their response to the mob.   \n   \"It's so important we be honest with the American people about what happened,\" Merkley said, as he called the resolution up for passage.   \"It's so important we recognize those who defended our democratic republic on that day,\" he said, and that \"people know we came back, as senators and House members, and finished our work that day, for the peaceful transfer of power.\"   Padilla said part of the context is the White House's new website that he said is an \"attempt to rewrite history.\" He said that \"dishonors\" the officers.   \"The Senate bipartisan commitment to real history is strong,\" he said.   \n   The plaque, according to the law, was intended to be placed at the West front of the Capitol where some of the fiercest fighting took place. It was required to be installed in 2023, a year after the legislation had passed.   The new resolution directs the Architect of the Capitol to \"prominently display\" the plaque in a \"publicly accessible\" location in the Senate wing of the Capitol until it can be placed in its permanent location.   To display the plaque in its intended location would require agreement with the House.   The office of Johnson, a Republican who before becoming the House speaker led efforts to object to the 2020 election results, said this week that the plaque, as constructed, does not comply with the law.   Police have sued to have the plaque put on display, as required, but Trump's Justice Department is trying to dismiss the lawsuit.   Tillis said part of the \"technical implementation problem\" was a concern that the law specified the plaque would honor all the officers involved, but the plaque only lists the various law enforcement agencies that responded to help the Capitol Police that day.   He said there will be a digital component, presumably a website, that will list all the names. The number of officers runs into the thousands.   \n   \"You'll see how many people came here,\" he said.\n",

The administration has unveiled a three-pronged plan for the country. It starts with a U.S. quarantine that includes Washington's control of Venezuelan oil sales. The details emerge from a closed-door briefing that Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave lawmakers after the weekend military operation that led to the capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro. Congress was not told about it in advance. NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt reports on what lawmakers learned yesterday.BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: These were the first comprehensive briefings for rank-and-file members who've been waiting for days to hear directly from the administration about the operation that led to Maduro's capture.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE JOHNSON: We had, I believe, a full house. I think almost every member of the House, Republican and Democrat, were present today.SPRUNT: That's House Speaker Mike Johnson, one of the many top Republicans who support President Trump's actions. Rubio told lawmakers that main next goals are stabilization of Venezuela, economic recovery for the country and transition. He did not elaborate on what that transition would look like. As for U.S. involvement going forward, Johnson added the White House's goal is not to have U.S. boots on the ground.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHNSON: That is not the administration's objective, that is not their expectation.SPRUNT: As lawmakers emerge from the classified meeting, the partisan divide was on full display. Republicans praised the operation. Oklahoma Senator Markwayne Mullin even said it was one of the best briefings he's ever received in Congress.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARKWAYNE MULLIN: What we want to do is give the best opportunity for the Venezuelan people to take back their country and put it back in the democracy that they lost 25 years ago, and there was a full plan, full effort.SPRUNT: But Democrats said the exact opposite - that they didn't hear a full plan.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SETH MOULTON: There are a lot of questions from both Democrats and Republicans about what comes next, what the timeline is. And they basically refused to answer any of those questions.SPRUNT: That's Massachusetts Congressman Seth Moulton.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MOULTON: I think the military clearly had a plan, but I think this administration is completely winging it.SPRUNT: Here's how Secretary of State Marco Rubio responded to that exact critique.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARCO RUBIO: I used to be a senator, too. That's what you always say when it's the other party. The bottom line is, we've gone into great detail with him about the planning. We've described it to him.SPRUNT: But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he wants more. And not in classified briefings, he wants public hearings.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHUCK SCHUMER: We need answers to these questions, and we need them made publicly.SPRUNT: Schumer's repeatedly cited concern about the administration taking similar actions in other countries and said he's dissatisfied with the answers given to him by administration officials.

The House is set to vote Thursday on a bill to renew enhanced health insurance subsidies.\n                \n                    Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   A group of 17 House Republicans joined with Democrats on Thursday, against the wishes of House Speaker Mike Johnson, to pass a measure to restore health insurance subsidies that lapsed at the end of last year.    That three-year extension passed by a vote of 230 to 196, but it is not likely to go far in the Senate, where a similar measure failed in December. A bipartisan group of senators, however, say they are getting close to a deal on a compromise bill.    While the debate over health care costs absorbed much of the oxygen in Congress in the final weeks of 2025, the rush to take action on the lapsed subsidies is now happening as members find themselves grappling with questions about the direction of U.S. foreign policy following President Trump's actions in Venezuela.    \n   On Thursday, the Senate took a procedural vote to begin debate on a resolution that would require the administration to seek authorization from Congress before taking further military action in the country. The measure advanced by a vote of 52 to 47, with five Republicans joining Democrats in support.    The vote was part of a whirlwind start to the new year for lawmakers. Adding to their to-do list is a fast-approaching Jan. 30 deadline to fund the government or risk a partial shutdown. House lawmakers made progress on that front Thursday, passing a trio of spending bills to fund the departments of Energy, Commerce, Interior and Justice. The bills also provide funding for the Environmental Protection Agency and federal water and science initiatives.    An end-run around the speaker on subsidies    Republican leadership for weeks refused to allow a vote on extending the subsidies.   Then just before the holiday recess, four swing-district Republicans joined with Democrats to force a vote on extending the subsidies for three years through what's known as a discharge petition. The once rare legislative tool allows 218 or more rank-and-file members to sidestep the speaker and force a vote.   \n   But even many backers acknowledge a clean three-year extension is unlikely to pass the Senate. The hope has been that success in the House would recharge bipartisan negotiations in the upper chamber, and there are signs that may be happening.   A small bipartisan group of senators have been negotiating this week, and several of them have told reporters they are nearing a deal.   \"We're in the red zone,\" said Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, on Wednesday. \"But that does not mean a touchdown. It could mean a 95-yard fumble.\"   \n   Several of those senators met with a bipartisan group of House members on Thursday.    \"The Senators made it abundantly clear, that but for this action in the House, the discharge petition, that was incredibly important for them to breathe life back into this issue,\" Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Penn., told reporters after emerging from the meeting.    The path ahead in the Senate   Moreno says the emerging compromise centers on a two-year extension. In the second year, patients could opt to have the funds deposited in a Health Savings Account, instead of government subsidies going to the insurance company.   President Trump has pushed to give federal funding for health care costs directly to patients and has repeatedly decried the subsidies as government handouts to big insurance companies.   The plan would also include an income cap, among other changes Republicans have called for. Open enrollment would likely be extended so people who dropped their policies due to the premium spikes brought on by the expiration of subsidies can have an opportunity to sign up for coverage.   \n   There are still some sticking points to a bipartisan deal. Some Republicans want more specific language around the prohibition of federal funding being used for abortion.   Trump told House Republicans this week that they may need to be \"flexible on this.\"   And there are also many Republicans deeply opposed to the enhanced subsidies at all, so even if the bipartisan group reaches a compromise, their ultimate fate remains unclear.   \"It would be unfathomable if something came out of the Senate and it was not given a floor vote,\" Fitzpatrick said, not ruling out another House discharge petition. \"It will be given a floor vote one way or another.\"   A busy start to 2026 with Venezuela in focus   As lawmakers look for consensus on the subsidies, questions about the future of the U.S. role in Venezuela have also taken on new urgency.    \n   While most Republicans have voiced support for the military operation that resulted in the capture of Nicolas Maduro, some in the party have signaled unease with what happens next. On Thursday, five Republican Senators joined with Democrats in voting to begin debate on a bill to require congressional approval for any further military action in Venezuela: Susan Collins of Maine, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Indiana's Todd Young.    The vote represented a rebuke for the president, but may ultimately prove symbolic. Even if the measure wins final passage in the Senate, it would face a steep climb in the GOP-controlled House and a likely veto from Trump.    Nonetheless, the GOP defections spurred a blistering critique from President Trump.    \"Republicans should be ashamed of the Senators that just voted with Democrats in attempting to take away our Powers to fight and defend the United States of America,\" Trump wrote in a statement posted to Truth Social.     \n   In addition to votes on health care and Venezuela, lawmakers are also facing pressure on funding the government by a deadline of Jan. 30.    Congress has already signed off on full-year funding for some federal agencies, but the record-long government shutdown last fall ended with a continuing resolution that got funding flowing again for most departments only into the first month of the year.   Several of those appropriations bills are slated to come up for votes in the coming days, but appropriators are still working out the details for bills that cover more contentious areas — like the Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services.\n",

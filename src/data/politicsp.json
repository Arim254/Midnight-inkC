The Supreme Court is weighing the future of President Trump's tariffs on nearly all imports. Justices seemed skeptical about the tariffs' legality during last month's oral arguments. Lower courts had previously found that Trump had improperly used emergency economic powers to set most of the new levies.   \n   Dozens of companies across industries have filed lawsuits to seek refunds in the event that the Supreme Court finds Trump's tariffs illegal. The list includes makeup giant Revlon, canned-foods maker Bumble Bee and Kawasaki, which makes motorcycles and more. Now Costco has joined the queue.   \"This is the first time we're seeing big companies take their heads out of the sand publicly,\" said Marc Busch, a trade law expert at Georgetown University. For the most part, small companies have been leading the legal action against tariffs, he said, adding, \"It's nice to finally see some heavyweights joining in the fray.\"   In its suit filed with the U.S. Court of International Trade, Costco did not specify how much it has already paid in tariffs. But the retail giant worries that even if the Supreme Court eventually unravels Trump's tariff regime, it may not be able to recoup all that money.    Costco executives in May had said that about a third of what it sells in the U.S. comes from abroad, predominantly nonfood items.   NPR's Scott Horsley contributed to this report.\n",

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, in a memo on Tuesday said it would pause reviewing all pending applications for green cards, citizenship, or asylum from immigrants from 19 countries listed in a previous travel ban.   \n   President Trump in June announced the travel ban against 12 countries, and partial restrictions against seven others, after a firebombing attack in Colorado.   The citizenship and immigration agency also plans to re-review and re-interview immigrants from these countries, potentially going as far back as 2021, amid sharper scrutiny of those who have followed the legal steps to seek permanent status in the U.S.   \"The Trump Administration is making every effort to ensure individuals becoming citizens are the best of the best. Citizenship is a privilege, not a right,\" a DHS spokesperson told NPR in a statement. \"We will take no chances when the future of our nation is at stake. The Trump Administration is reviewing all immigration benefits granted by the Biden administration to aliens from Countries of Concern.\"   \n   The travel ban applies to citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen and added restricted access applied to people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. Migrants from all 19 countries are impacted by the pauses of pending applications and review of previously approved ones.   \n   Prior restrictions on refugees   Last month, USCIS, a branch of DHS, had previously announced that it would re-review the status of everyone who had been admitted into the U.S. as a refugee under the Biden administration, essentially reopening those cases.   A separate memo sent on Nov. 21, and reviewed by NPR, said that some people may need to be interviewed again and could end up losing their legal refugee status.   The latest memo marks an escalation of the immigration crackdown after the attack in Washington, D.C. Rahmanullah Lakanwal, Afghan national, was charged with first-degree murder for allegedly shooting two National Guard members near the White House just before Thanksgiving. He had been granted asylum earlier this year under the Trump administration, after first coming to the U.S. on a temporary humanitarian parole program under the Biden administration.   \n   In an interview with NBC's Meet the Press, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the agency would pause processing all asylum applications indefinitely while it works through a million-case backlog.\n",

    "body": "\n      President Trump has been bullish on stopping the flow of drugs from Latin America. What exactly is this administration's strategy for stopping drug trafficking?   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  How to square the following two facts? One, the Trump administration is escalating its campaign against drug cartels. It is blowing up boats in the Caribbean that it says are involved in narcotrafficking. Two, President Trump has just pardoned a former president of Honduras, a man convicted in the United States of drug-trafficking charges. The former Honduran president is Juan Orlando Hernandez. He was serving a 45-year sentence for conspiring to import cocaine to the U.S. Now he's been released from a West Virginia prison.So what is the Trump administration drug strategy and how does pardoning an ex-leader convicted of drug trafficking help to advance it? Questions we're going to put now to Todd Robinson. He was assistant secretary of state for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs in the Biden administration, also a former ambassador to Guatemala. Ambassador, welcome.TODD ROBINSON: Hi. Thank you for having me.KELLY: How are you making sense of this timing? As we noted, in one moment President Trump is authorizing strikes against boats he says are carrying drugs, and then the next minute he's pardoning a former head of state convicted in a U.S. court of drug trafficking.ROBINSON: Frankly, I'm finding it hard to understand what to make of this. It's clear that Juan Orlando Hernandez's party is a party that this administration feels comfortable with. But the idea that you're going to raise the stakes in the Caribbean and play Whac-A-Mole really against boats that are hardly a threat to the United States and then on the - at the same time, free a convicted felon who actually did traffic drugs to the United States, I find it confounding.KELLY: Is it clear to you what the motive here is, what President Trump gets out of pardoning Hernandez?ROBINSON: It's not clear to me, except for the fact that he probably thinks he's helping the party that he supports in Honduras' recent elections. But beyond that, I just don't  - I don't understand it. I don't see it.KELLY: So if we are searching for a coherent strategy to counter illegal drugs, where does the last week or two of these recent events - where does - where are we left?ROBINSON: Well, I think your question has the primary word in it - coherent. I don't see a coherent strategy. A coherent strategy would involve not blowing up boats, but actually boarding them, arresting those involved, collecting evidence and intelligence on the boat and working your way through the networks that are involved in narcotics trafficking. It would seem to me that you would look more closely at the trafficking that's going through Central America, up through Mexico, through our southern border, where we know this is happening. And at the same time, you're going after those networks in the Caribbean. What they're doing now, I - frankly, I don't understand.KELLY: So big picture, what is your understanding of why the U.S. has amassed an armada off the coast of Venezuela and is blowing up boats there that they say are involved in drug smuggling? What's the goal?ROBINSON: They're clearly trying to put more pressure on President Maduro. Well, I should say erstwhile President Maduro because he actually lost the last election.KELLY: Although he remains in power. Yep.ROBINSON: Although he remains in power. Exactly. But I think they're trying to put pressure on him to leave - to leave Venezuela. The problem, of course, is it's not just Maduro. If he leaves and he leaves behind his cronies to continue to rule in Venezuela, then you're just changing one problem for another.KELLY: Ambassador, to those who may be listening and thinking, hey, this guy served in the Biden administration, he's going to be critical of anything that President Trump and his allies do, you say what?ROBINSON: I say I spent almost 40 years working at the State Department on behalf of the American people and the United States. My first president was Ronald Reagan, my first secretary of state was George Shultz, and I've worked proudly for all of those administrations. And I worked proudly for the Trump administration in 2018, when he sent me to Venezuela.KELLY: Todd Robinson, former assistant secretary of state for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. Ambassador Robinson, thank you.ROBINSON: Thank you so much for having me.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

As you can imagine, at the Department of War, we got a lot of things to do. So I didn't stick around for the hour and two hours, whatever, where all the sensitive site exploitation digitally occurs. So I moved on to my next meeting.INSKEEP: Hegseth has a long history of advocating more lethality, as he calls it, with fewer lawyers. In a moment, we'll hear what a former high-ranking military lawyer thinks. We begin with the facts.MARTÍNEZ: NPR congressional correspondent Deirdre Walsh is with us. So we just heard Hegseth say that he had a lot on his schedule the day of that strike. What other details did he talk about Tuesday?DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: He said he gave the initial order to strike the boat and then said he learned the details about the second strike a couple of hours later and said it was a decision made by Admiral Frank Bradley, who leads U.S. Special Operations Command. While Hegseth stressed he personally didn't make the call for a follow-on strike, he said Bradley had the complete authority to do so.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HEGSETH: And by the way, Admiral Bradley made the correct decision to ultimately sink the boat and eliminate the threat.WALSH: You know, it's worth noting that Hegseth's comments yesterday are different from his initial response when The Washington Post first reported on these strikes, and he criticized the reporting. Now he's acknowledging there was the second strike. President Trump, for his part, said he knew the military took out the boat, but he didn't know whether it was one strike or two or three, and he wasn't involved in it.MARTÍNEZ: All right. So what are top Republicans on Capitol Hill saying about the attack?WALSH: Both House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune say they back the move by House and Senate Armed Services committees to review the boat strikes and expect to get answers. The speaker said he wouldn't prejudge anything before they get the facts. Committees are expected to seek video and audio of the operation. Questions on the Hill really center around whether the second strike broke U.S. law or would be considered a war crime if the administration's claim to be at war with narcotraffickers is accepted. And members of both parties want to review evidence and this timeline. Majority Leader Thune said he backed current U.S. policy, saying he agreed the administration had the authority for these attacks in the Caribbean. But when Thune was asked directly about whether he has confidence in Hegseth, he sidestepped the question.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN THUNE: Well, I think that the fundamental question is, is the country safer than it was under the Biden administration? I think the answer to that is unequivocally yes.WALSH: Thune said the Trump administration's peace through strength policies are working, and Hegseth is part of the team that put those in place. But he also added that Hegseth serves at the pleasure of the president. Not exactly an endorsement of the secretary.MARTÍNEZ: All right. So it seems like both GOP leaders of the House and Senate want at least some answers. Any word on how they'll try to get them?WALSH: You know, we haven't seen a lot of oversight from Republican committee chairmen in the first year of the Trump administration. But I will say, on this issue, both chairs in the House and Senate came out really quickly and vowed vigorous oversight of these boat strikes. It's unclear if they're going to have public hearings or classified sessions. Admiral Bradley's in town and is expected to brief lawmakers later this week. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wants Hegseth to release the video of the attack, and he's demanding that he testify publicly.MARTÍNEZ: All right. That's NPR congressional correspondent Deirdre Walsh. Thanks a lot.WALSH: Thanks, A.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Smith/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Democrats in Washington want to impose legal requirements on whom the Trump administration can bring in as temporary immigration judges, after the White House terminated at least a dozen tenured judges.   A bill introduced on Wednesday by California's Sen. Adam Schiff and Rep. Juan Vargas would authorize the attorney general to appoint temporary immigration judges that have served on appellate panels, are administrative judges in other agencies, or have 10 years of immigration law experience.   Such limits would preclude much of the administration's effort to authorize up to 600 military lawyers to be temporary immigration judges; as part of that move, the White House scrapped the requirement that temporary immigration judges should have immigration law experience.   \n   The legislation was introduced after the administration fired at least 14 immigration judges in the last two weeks, according to the union that represents them, with many of those having been terminated after years of experience on the bench. Those layoffs add to more than 90 other terminations so far this year, according to a count kept by NPR and the union that represents immigration judges.   The firings come as the administration seeks to reshape who serves on courts and makes decisions about which immigrants are allowed to stay in the U.S.   There are no Republican cosponsors on the measure, meaning it's unlikely to pass in a GOP-controlled Congress. But the legislation adds to the scrutiny that Democrats have brought to the administration's approach to immigration courts and their personnel.   Former immigration judges and lawyers say that bringing on people without experience is a potential benefit for permanent judges seeking a long career as an immigration judge. But it can present a steep learning curve and potential violations of due process if a judge's stint is only months-long, as would be the case with military lawyers, or JAGs, they say.   \n   \"The Trump administration's willingness to fire experienced judges and hire inexperienced or temporary 'deportation judges,' especially in places like California, has fundamentally impacted the landscape of our justice system,\" Schiff told NPR in a statement.   \"Given the administration's unlawful terminations of qualified judges, and their plan to leverage the power of temporary positions to speed up their mass deportation agenda, the risks of grave injury to families, fairness, and due process have expanded,\" he said.   The Trump administration authorized the use of military lawyers as temporary judges in an effort to streamline the millions-long backlog of immigration cases in the courts.   \n   That backlog has only gotten worse as immigration courts, which are housed within the Justice Department, have seen efforts to restructure their workforce.   NPR has tracked at least 140 immigration judges who have been fired, quit or took an early retirement offer from the administration. At least 90 of them, including those who were supervisors, have received termination notices from the administration. Of the judges fired between February and October this year, most had experience in immigration defense, an NPR investigation found.   Latest round of layoffs   The latest round of firings hit courts in San Francisco, New York and Boston, with at least seven judges fired in just one of New York's courts earlier this week. Many of the firings, like for other civil servants in the federal workforce, focused on employees still inside their two-year probationary period.   But this recent string of layoffs included at least 13 experienced judges who had been with the agency for years, NPR has identified.   Jeremiah Johnson was among those recently terminated. He had been a judge in San Francisco since 2017 but received a short email just before Thanksgiving, notifying him his time with the agency was over.   \n   He said he got no indication his performance was amiss. In the weeks leading up to his termination, new lawyers with Immigration and Customs Enforcement had been shadowing hearings in his courtroom, a sign he believed showed his courtroom conduct was a good learning space. He had also just received an additional set of cases for people held at the Eloy Detention Center in Arizona, adding to his responsibilities.   \"I was doing my job. I was there hearing cases, moving things along. I was also trying to uplift the morale of my colleagues and coworkers and team,\" Johnson said. Despite working at the agency for seven years, he got the same email as dozens of others. A few sentences explaining that the attorney general has decided his time was over, with no other explanation.   \n   \"I was fired for doing my job. And frankly, I think this administration doesn't want judges following the law,\" Johnson said.   The Executive Office for Immigration Review, the agency that houses immigration courts, has disputed that it seeks to prioritize judges who would be more likely to decide immigrants should be deported; it says judges have legal, ethical and professional obligations to be impartial to either side.   \n   The agency has said it evaluates all immigration judges regardless of background on factors including conduct, impartiality, adherence to the law, productivity and performance, and professionalism.   Some judges have sued the administration over their terminations, arguing that they may have been terminated on various protected grounds such as nationality or gender.   \"Most recently, yesterday, I was sued by an immigration judge who we fired,\" said Attorney General Pam Bondi during a Tuesday cabinet meeting. \"One of the reasons she said she was a woman. Last I checked, I was a woman as well.\"   Push for \"deportation\" judges   Meanwhile, the administration has recently added 36 judges, including 25 temporary ones, and launched a campaign to hire \"deportation\" judges. The agency did not respond to questions over how many applications it has received in the first few weeks of the hiring campaign. The campaign was launched prior to the recent firings of 15 judges.   The hiring campaign offers a pay recruitment incentive for those who work in one of eight courts across New York, California and Massachusetts, where firings and resignations have depleted the workforce.   \"Define America for generations\" and \"restore integrity and honor to our Nation's Immigration Court system\" are among the selling points for the position, in addition to remote and full-time teleworking benefits. Most immigrants are required to appear in person at their immigration hearings, and most courts, administrative and judicial, have returned to in-person work since the pandemic.   \n   Each judge who is terminated or resigns leaves behind thousands of cases, with those scheduled for this year now rescheduled to as far out as 2030. Immigration advocates have warned the layoffs contribute to the backlog.   \"Reducing the immigration court backlog is one of the highest priorities for the Executive Office for Immigration Review,\" said Kathryn Mattingly, a spokeswoman for the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which houses immigration courts. \"EOIR is committed to making further advancements to its operational efficiency, thereby helping to ensure timely justice for both parties involved and the public it serves.\"   \n   —NPR's Anusha Mathur contributed to this report.\n",

A White House official not authorized to speak on the record confirmed the pardon was granted and the Federal Bureau of Prisons confirmed his release on Monday.   Hernández, who served two terms as the leader of the Central American nation, had been sentenced to 45 years for conspiring to import cocaine to the United States.   The pardon of such a high-profile convicted drug trafficker, however, has led to accusations of deceit and hypocrisy by the Trump administration as it comes while the president and his team continue to escalate his military campaign against drug trafficking out of Venezuela.   \n   Critics argue the pardon of Hernández undermines the administration's claims that they are focused on ending drug trafficking. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, called the decision \"shocking.\"   \"He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in U.S. courts, and less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narcotrafficking,\" Kaine said Sunday on CBS' 'Face the Nation.'   Hernández's time in office briefly overlapped with Trump's first term. In that time, Hernández fostered support from the Trump administration after joining a small group of nations and moved the Honduran embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.   Trump criticized Hernández's prosecution, telling reporters last week that people he respects told him Hernández was \"treated very harshly and unfairly.\"   One of those people is likely Roger Stone, his long time political adviser, who lobbied for Hernández release. Stone shared on his radio show that he delivered a four-page letter from Hernández claiming he was the victim of wrongful conviction and \"lawfare by the Biden-Harris administration.\"    \n   Trump teased the pardon in a social media post on last week: \"CONGRATULATIONS TO JUAN ORLANDO HERNANDEZ ON YOUR UPCOMING PARDON,\" he wrote…. \"MAKE HONDURAS GREAT AGAIN!\"   According to court documents, Hernández abused his position to facilitate importation of tons of cocaine into the United States. In exchange, he received millions of dollars in drug money from some of the largest and most violent drug-trafficking organizations in the hemisphere.   Judge P. Kevin Castel, who presided over the case, described Hernández as a \"two-faced politician hungry for power.\" Former Attorney General Merrick Garland stated that Hernández \"abused his presidency to operate the country as a narco-state where violent traffickers operated with near-total impunity.\"   Hernández has long maintained that he was innocent of the charges. He had been appealing his conviction while serving his sentence at the U.S. Penitentiary Hazelton in West Virginia.   It is far from the first time one of Trump's pardons has drawn scrutiny. He has pardoned a number of political and business allies since returning to office, prompting some accusations that Trump's operating a pay to play scheme.   They include MAGA loyalists, a cryptocurrency executive with ties to his family's crypto firm and dozens of allies who tried to overturn his 2020 election loss to former President Joe Biden.\n",

That means the Republican edge in the House of Representatives doesn't get any narrower. But Democrats are also claiming victory after Tuesday night's results.A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  That's because last year, President Trump won Tennessee's 7th congressional district by about 22 percentage points. Yesterday, Van Epps won by nine. Both parties spent millions of dollars in the final weeks of this race to try and test their campaign message ahead of the 2026 midterms.INSKEEP: NPR's Stephen Fowler has been following the campaign. Stephen, good morning.STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Good morning.INSKEEP: Why did this race receive so much attention?FOWLER: Well, it's math. Republicans have a narrow House majority and fractious coalitions. This gives them one more vote until Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene resigns in a few weeks. Here's more math. In 60 state legislative and congressional special elections this year, Democrats have improved from their 2024 margins by an average of 13%. Those elections were typically low-turnout, low-profile contests where Democrats were more likely to vote. So given Trump's margins in this Tennessee district, super PACs from both parties poured more than $6.5 million in recent weeks into making this a high-turnout, high-profile contest where Democrats still ended up improving their margins by 13%.INSKEEP: Oh, really interesting result then. And it seems that Democrats turned out a lot of voters. Who's right in declaring victory then?FOWLER: Well, the final margin of the race means both parties can, with a straight face, declare a victory moving forward. That's because Republicans motivated their base without Trump being on the ballot. Van Epps said in victory remarks that, quote, \"running from Trump is how you lose. Running with Trump is how you win.\" But he actually didn't campaign much using the president's name or accomplishments. And Democrats are putting 2024's losses behind them and have also motivated their base, who've been pretty sour on the party as a whole. And they seem to also have persuaded independents that Republican governance won't solve key issues.INSKEEP: So in last month's elections, we heard a lot about affordability. I'm thinking about that as a political slogan. Six syllables, lots of syllables. But anyway, the economy is what that was about. How did it factor in?FOWLER: Well, Steve, one candidate decried career politicians and promised to bring down prices, create good-paying jobs and lower health care costs for working families. The other candidate promised to shake up Washington by making health care more affordable, bringing down the cost of living and protect workers and small businesses. If you're wondering which one was a Republican and which was the Democrat, you're not alone. It was pretty hard to tell them apart on this issue, which was also notable for the candidates' lack of talking about Trump.INSKEEP: Oh, this is really interesting. The Democrat maybe didn't talk about Trump so much 'cause she wanted the votes of former Trump voters, and the Republican didn't talk about Trump so much because he's not so popular at this moment. But with all of this said, I mean, we're reading all of this to look at 2026 and trying to find how we can forecast the future. Is there anything about Tuesday's result that truly matters when thinking about the midterms, where things will be different?FOWLER: Well, clearly, the economy is top of mind. Republicans are figuring out how to address those concerns about costs without explicitly crossing Trump, and Democrats are also workshopping ways to win back key parts of their coalition. Looking at the election results, the drop-off and turnout in deep blue areas that we saw last year is nowhere to be found, and the rightward leap of young voters and nonwhite voters has snapped back towards Democrats. In a midterm year, the dynamics typically see the party out of power do well, so this is another data point in favor of that trend continuing.INSKEEP: NPR's Stephen Fowler.

The details matter, as some in Congress suggest the orders are illegal and could leave service members facing eventual prosecution.   In response to reports that the first of these strikes included a second round that killed two survivors on a burning boat, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Tuesday that he authorized and watched the initial attacks but did not watch the second round.   \n   \"I watched that first strike live,\" Hegseth said at a Cabinet meeting at the White House. \"As you can imagine, the Department of War, we got a lot of things to do. So I moved on to my next meeting.\"   Hegseth said he did not see survivors of that Sept. 2 attack on the video and that the following strikes to sink the boat, which killed the survivors, were ordered by Adm. Frank M. Bradley.   \n   \"A couple of hours later, I learned that that commander had made the [decision], which he had the complete authority to do,\" Hegseth said. \"And by the way, Adm. Bradley made the correct decision to ultimately sink the boat and eliminate the threat.\"   Hegseth's parsing of responsibility for that order has drawn fire, including from Rep. Adam Smith, ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee.   \"Yeah. It was a CYA moment for Hegseth,\" Smith said, speaking on NPR's Morning Edition. \"He's the secretary of defense. You know, he's putting them in a terrible spot by giving them these highly questionable orders. And then after that, to come out and say, hey, it was that guy, not me. That's not leadership, and it's also not honest. It seems to me Secretary Hegseth is the one who's responsible for what happened here.\"   \n   Ever since the first strike by the U.S. military on a small boat in the Caribbean three months ago, a debate has stirred within the military, because deadly force used on civilian crew and passengers appeared illegal. The Trump Justice Department provided Congress with a memo stating that the U.S. is in a non-international armed conflict with drug cartels, and the strikes are within the laws of war. But Smith said even that memo was ambiguous.   \"This memo that's out there explaining the legal justification for this is fascinating, because half of it says, this is why this is an armed conflict, why these narcoterrorist groups are such a threat. They're doing all these awful things. And the other half says, no, it's not a war, so therefore we don't have to get permission from Congress,\" said Smith. \"They say it's legal, and yet they went to great pains to make sure that Hegseth wasn't the one who gave the order. So obviously, they're a little nervous about that point.\"   Now the questions are getting sharper, after The Washington Post reported that the Sept. 2 incident included two sets of strikes on a boat, and that survivors of the initial attack were visible when they were struck again and killed. Hegseth initially denied the story and called it fake news, but on Tuesday he confirmed the basic facts.   If the United States is at war, then killing enemies who are surrendering or helpless would constitute a war crime according to military experts, including a group of former JAG officers who have been critical of the Trump administration. Questions along those lines are expected when Adm. Bradley appears before Congress on Thursday.   But talk of war crimes accepts the notion that the U.S. can even be at war with the entire criminal world of narcotrafficking in any legal sense, said Sarah Yager, Washington director of Human Rights Watch. \"It's not a question of a war crime because there's no war, there's no armed conflict, so it can't be a war crime. It is literally murder,\" she said.   \n   \"It sets a dangerous template for a United States that believes it can strike anywhere on the planet without rules, limits, or consequences.\"    \n   She also noted that when a country acts as if it's at war when it's not, \"that collapses the rules that keep civilians safe and gives governments license to kill without the safeguards international law requires.\"   President Trump and Hegseth both sought to justify the strikes again on Tuesday. Hegseth said evidence was solid that each of the strikes was on what he called a \"narcoterrorist\" but declined to show proof. Trump claimed his efforts had saved hundreds of thousands of lives — more than double the estimated yearly death toll for all drug overdoses in the U.S., most of which are actually caused by fentanyl, which does not come into the country by boat.   Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Rand Paul posted a letter he received after an information request showing that 21% of Coast Guard interdictions turn up no drugs, suggesting that at least 1 in 5 of the deadly strikes could be in error.   At the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Trump suggested, without showing evidence, that drug trafficking has dropped since the boat strikes began, but he also claimed to know nothing about the details.   \"As far as the attack is concerned, I did, you know, I still haven't gotten a lot of information, because I rely on Pete, but to me, it was an attack. It wasn't one strike, two strikes, three strikes,\" Trump said. \"Somebody asked me a question about the second strike. I didn't know about the second strike. I didn't know anything about people, I wasn't involved in it.\"   But speaking at the Pentagon earlier on Tuesday, press secretary Kingsley Wilson said, \"At the end of the day, the secretary and the president are the ones directing these strikes.\"\n",

It's no secret that my interest in Missouri redistricting borders on obsession. Some of my love for the subject stems from its importance. The lines and where they are drawn can determine which party has a better shot at winning any given district. But I also have a lifelong interest in cartography, including nearly winning my middle school geography bee and getting to talk to a National Geographic mapmaker while tagging along on a work trip with my dad.   \n   Still, at the time I sent that text, I thought there was no way that Missouri Republicans would plunge back into congressional mapmaking in 2025 — especially after redistricting in 2022 sparked a bitter schism within the Missouri legislature.   I was wrong.   Very wrong.   Missouri ended up becoming the second GOP-led state behind Texas to redraw congressional lines at the behest of President Trump. And Missouri Republicans were upfront about their rationale: They wanted to oust Democratic Congressman Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City to help prevent Republicans from losing control of the U.S. House in 2026.   And Missouri Republicans didn't just pass a new map: They broke all sorts of legislative norms and precedents to push it to Gov. Mike Kehoe's desk.   But in the rush to obtain a short-term victory for Republicans in Washington, D.C., Missouri Republicans may have ushered in the new map's doom from at least two different directions.   EnterAir Bud    Redistricting detractors have filed a slew of lawsuits — including a particularly important one around whether it's even allowed for Missouri lawmakers to redraw congressional boundaries in the middle of a decade. That case is still in its early stages, but the Missouri Supreme Court is expected to decide sometime next year.   \n   On the surface, redistricting foes seem to have a solid case — a constitutional amendment that they say only allows for congressional redistricting after a census. But Missouri Republicans appear to have a secret weapon to counter that contention: The Air Bud Rule.   In the 1997 Walt Disney film, a referee allows Buddy the Dog to play basketball because, after searching frantically through a rule book, \"there ain't no rule that says a dog can't play basketball.\"   Flash forward to 2025: Defenders of the Missouri redistricting plan have rallied behind a similarly constructed argument: \"There's nothing in the Missouri Constitution that says lawmakers can't redistrict mid-decade.\"   Air Bud analogy is a slam dunk   When I first heard this argument, I started to ask Missouri lawmakers if they'd seen Air Bud.    Some, like Republican Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, had seen it — and acknowledged that the GOP defense of the map was basically the Air Bud Rule. (When he was a state senator, Hoskins successfully sponsored a bill designating two legendary canines, Old Drum and Jim the Wonder Dog, as Missouri's official Historical Dog and the state's official wonder dog.)   \"Other states have different processes as far as when they can redistrict for congressional seats. But in Missouri, there's nothing, in my opinion, that says that we cannot do this,\" said GOP Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, who then joked that the new map should be named the \"Air Bud Clause\" if judges uphold it.   The analogy gained popularity among those entangled in redistricting.   Democratic state Rep. Mark Boyko mocked Republicans by citing the Air Bud Rule on the House floor. And during arguments earlier this month in Jefferson City, Chuck Hatfield, an attorney representing plaintiffs trying to strike down the new congressional lines, said in court this month, \"we don't do Air Bud rules in Missouri for very good reason, but that's essentially what the argument is from the state.\"   \n   \"It's like if my children ask me: 'Can we have ice cream tonight?' And I say, we're going for ice cream tomorrow,'\" Boyko said. \"And they say: 'Well, you haven't said we're not having ice cream tonight, so we're having ice cream tonight, too.' No.\"   Although Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway had never seen the film, in an interview with me, she said the \"ain't no rule that says a dog can't play basketball\" principle is \"not a bad analogy\" in describing the state's main argument.   \"The Constitution says that redistricting shall happen after the decennial census. It doesn't say that it shall happen immediately after; that it should happen only once per decade; that it can't be revisited,\" Hanaway said. \"I don't know what happened to Bud. I'm guessing he probably didn't get to play basketball since you're using that analogy. But I think our chances of prevailing are pretty good.\"   When I informed her that Buddy not only got to play basketball, but he also played football in the classic film Air Bud: Golden Receiver, Hanaway said: \"Man, I have missed a whole genre. I really got to catch up on that.\"   A surprise referendum   But the biggest threat to the Missouri redistricting plan may not be the lawsuits.   One day, after the draining first week of the redistricting special session in September, I took a walk near my house in St. Louis. That's when a question popped into my head: If lawmakers managed to pass the map, were there enough members in the Missouri House to make the map go into effect right away? If not, Republicans wouldn't be able to avoid Missouri's very robust referendum process.   While getting my kids ready for bed, I realized the answer was … no. The new map that Trump and Missouri Republicans wanted so badly could be subject to a statewide vote. If signature gatherers just got enough names collected before Dec. 11, the map couldn't go into effect for the 2026 election cycle, defeating the entire purpose of the redistricting special session.   \n   My story for St. Louis Public Radio was published before members of the House ended up giving first-round approval to the redistricting bill. Lawmakers ended up passing the map anyway, without much trouble — even though voters could end up wiping out their work.   After the special session ended, though, it was clear that a lot of lawmakers had no idea that the map could potentially be nullified through a statewide vote.   Opponents of the map have been scouring the state to collect signatures to put the plan up for a statewide vote. State Rep. Bryant Wolfin said he was unaware the map could go up for a statewide vote — adding \"I guarantee the majority of the caucus did not as well.\"   Whether the Trump White House realized that Missouri's new map could be put up for a vote is unclear. Officials did not reply to a request for comment. But there's no debate that the referendum generated a lot of excitement among despondent Missouri Democrats who suffered through yet another bad election cycle in 2024.   \"I don't even like politics, OK? I just know we need transparency,\" Jefferson City resident Frida Tucker told me in September. \"We need to stop the power grab. We don't need to do it every three years, OK? Like, something's not right here.\"   So what did I learn from following along on this wild Missouri redistricting saga?   For one thing, it's important to pay attention to seemingly insignificant details, like the vote count of a bill that was always expected to pass.   And other takeaway? Maybe revisit 1990s Disney films before a redistricting cycle, because you never know when a throwaway scene could inspire a legal theory that sinks or saves a nationally-watched proposal.

Right: Maggie Heilman and her daughter, Brooklynn, 14, at their home in a Kansas City suburb. Brooklynn has Down syndrome and her own special education plan thanks to IDEA.\n                \n                    Thomas Simonetti and Katie Currid for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Thomas Simonetti and Katie Currid for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Fifty years ago, just after Thanksgiving of 1975, President Gerald Ford signed the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, the landmark law that created special education as it exists today, and guaranteed all children with disabilities the right to a \"free appropriate public education.\"   Yet, \"rather than celebrating progress, we face a crisis,\" warned a recent letter to Congress, signed by hundreds of disability, civil rights and education groups.   That crisis, according to the letter, is \"the dismantling of the very infrastructure Congress created to ensure children with disabilities could reach their full potential.\"   \n   The Trump administration has fired, or tried to fire, many of the federal staff at the U.S. Department of Education who manage and enforce federal disability law, though Education Secretary Linda McMahon has said federal funding for special education is not at risk.   In a November op-ed in USA Today, McMahon wrote that \"returning education to the states does not mean the end of federal support for education. It simply means the end of a centralized bureaucracy micromanaging what should be a state-led responsibility.\"   But, in interviews with 40 parents, educators, disability-rights advocates, subject matter experts and Education Department staffers, NPR heard a growing fear: that the Trump administration's efforts to cut federal staff and oversight of special education could return the U.S. to a time, before 1975, when some schools denied access or services to children with disabilities.   What special education means to one mom and her daughter   Maggie Heilman's 14-year-old daughter, Brooklynn, has never known a world without the 50-year-old law later renamed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Maggie Heilman and her daughter Brooklynn play checkers. Brooklynn loves games, painting her nails and listening to Taylor Swift.\n                \n                    Katie Currid for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Katie Currid for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   The family lives in a Kansas City suburb. Brooklynn, who has Down syndrome, loves hanging out with her sisters, playing basketball and listening to music \"all day, and on the bus,\" Brooklyn says.   \n   \"And she dances all day,\" her mom adds.   \"In circles,\" Brooklyn says. \"Over and over.\"   The teen is now in eighth grade, has her own special education plan, thanks to IDEA, and loves her middle school. But sixth grade was difficult.   \"I was having a hard time,\" Brooklynn says.   In October 2023, Heilman says, she got a call from Brooklynn's school that her daughter had become agitated after refusing a request to come to the classroom's reading table. Eventually, Heilman says, Brooklynn was secluded for 20 minutes in a padded room the size of a closet.   \n   \"That 20 minutes changed the trajectory of our lives,\" Heilman recalls. \"I had a child who loved to sing and dance and communicate and hug, and, after that moment, she stopped talking.\"   Seclusion in school, as a practice, is allowed in many states — if students pose an immediate danger to themselves or others. However, the practice can also be traumatic.   Heilman says she told school staff she thought Brooklynn's seclusion was extreme. Through the winter, she said, the school turned to informal seclusion, separating Brooklynn in other physical spaces or school offices.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Brooklynn, center, loves playing Uno with her mom and sisters.\n                \n                    Katie Currid for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Katie Currid for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   As a result, Heilman says, Brooklynn repeatedly missed some of her traditional classes. \"And we just saw our daughter's health — physically, mentally, emotionally — deteriorate.\"   Finally, Heilman asked that Brooklynn be transferred to a different middle school, where staff assured her they don't seclude students. Brooklynn's situation improved dramatically, but, worried for the students who came after Brooklynn, Heilman still requested a state-level investigation into her daughter's previous seclusion. The state did not find the district at fault.        Heilman also filed a complaint with the U.S. Education Department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR), arguing that Brooklynn had been secluded unnecessarily and that, as a result, she was denied her right to a free, appropriate public education.   \n   That complaint kickstarted a new ordeal for Heilman and her family.   Counting on a federal system as it's being dismantled   OCR is the fail-safe for families who believe their child's civil rights are being violated at school because of their disability. A family can submit a discrimination complaint, and one of OCR's attorneys will review it and, if justified, open an investigation — no need to hire an expensive lawyer or advocate.   OCR has investigated a Texas district for restraining students; a Maryland district for how it handled the bullying of a disabled student; and an Arizona district for forcing students with disabilities to end their school day earlier than general education students.   \n   Department records show OCR began investigating Heilman's complaint in October 2024.   \n   But Heilman says her assigned attorney was removed around the same time the Trump administration began a broad reduction-in-force. According to emails Heilman shared with NPR, her case was then assigned to a different attorney.   Heilman says she has heard nothing about the investigation since June, when this second OCR attorney assured her, in an email, that Brooklynn's case is \"currently still in investigation.\"   Several OCR attorneys spoke with NPR on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by the Trump administration. Two of them said Heilman's second attorney worked in an OCR office that was gutted in October, in a second round of layoffs. Those fired workers have since been reinstated, but Heilman says she has heard nothing about her complaint.   Of the administration's decision to cut many attorneys who protect students' civil rights, Heilman says, \"it's telling families with children like Brooklynn that their hurt doesn't matter.\"   Before special education, children with disabilities were \"invisible\"   Before 1975, children with disabilities were commonly denied access to public school classrooms.   \"They were invisible,\" says Ed Martin, who helped write the landmark 1975 law. \"They had been kept at home. Our goal was to end that.\"     \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Ed Martin began his career as a young professor of speech therapy at the University of Alabama. He was invited to Washington, D.C., in the 1960s to work on disability issues.\n                \n                    Thomas Simonetti for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Thomas Simonetti for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   In 1970, U.S. public schools educated just 1 in 5 children with a disability, according to the Department of Education, and excluded nearly 1.8 million children.   Martin, now 94, says he organized hearings for parents to share their stories with lawmakers.   \"There was one mother who told us a story about the school bus stopping at the foot of her driveway,\" Martin recalls, \"and her daughter standing in the window crying, saying, 'Why can't I go with the other kids?'\"   When Ford signed the new law, it cemented a bold idea: that students with disabilities have a right to an individualized, public education and that the U.S. government would help pay for it.   \n   Margaret Spellings ran the Education Department under Republican President George W. Bush, and says special education isn't just about doing what the law requires — it's a public good.   \"We're talking about a lot of kids who have abilities and disabilities that can be remediated, that can make them productive citizens,\" Spellings says, \"and that is in our interest as a nation to have these students meet their full potential.\"   In fiscal year 2024, the law provided nearly $15 billion to help school districts pay for specialized classroom instruction and speech and physical therapy, among other services.     Including its early intervention programs for infants and toddlers, IDEA helps more than 8 million children with disabilities in the U.S.   To manage and enforce not just IDEA but a cluster of federal disability laws, Congress placed a pair of offices inside the Department of Education. The Office for Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS), which includes the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), oversees special education under IDEA, providing guidance to states and directly to families. The other key office is OCR, the Office for Civil Rights. It does not enforce IDEA but investigates allegations of disability discrimination, which often overlap with family complaints that allege IDEA violations.   Since these offices were created, support for their mission — to help families, districts and states in their efforts to protect and educate children with disabilities — has transcended politics. Spellings says, \"We have long had, for the last 50 years — until this year — huge bipartisan support and fealty to the law.\"   Until this year.   Devastating special education cuts    According to court records, the Trump administration fired 121 of 135 employees at OSERS during the recent government shutdown.   \"We can't, in our wildest imagination, understand how the secretary can fulfill her obligation under the law with so few staff,\" said Denise Marshall, head of the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates (COPAA).   \n   Since those cuts, the 121 staffers have been reinstated as part of the deal to end the shutdown, though the administration could lay them off again after Jan. 30.   When NPR asked the Education Department if it planned to retain these staff beyond that date, the press office replied with a statement: \"The Department has brought back staff that were impacted by the Schumer Shutdown. The Department will follow all applicable laws.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon during a television interview outside the White House. In an op-ed published in USA Today, McMahon wrote, \"protecting students' civil rights is work that will never go away.\"\n                \n                    Samuel Corum/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Samuel Corum/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"This is a part of the process of making a smaller federal footprint and turning responsibilities over to states,\" says Jonathan Butcher, acting director for the Center for Education Policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation.   Heritage's Project 2025, created as a policy blueprint for a second Trump administration, calls for IDEA funding to be \"converted into a no-strings formula block grant\" to be sent directly to districts — that section's author, Lindsey Burke, now works at the Education Department.   In her op-ed, and previously, McMahon has reassured families that funding for students with disabilities \"will continue indefinitely.\" It's the federal oversight she's cutting or moving.   But an OSERS staffer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, worries that, without federal support staff, \"states don't have the systems or the staffing to do this.\"   Ed Martin, who helped write IDEA 50 years ago, says that, without enough staff, there's also no guarantee the money will be spent on the children who need it most: \"The administration has decided that nobody needs to watch [the money].\"   \"The secretary's words are hollow\"   The Trump administration has also made deep cuts to the Office for Civil Rights. In March, it moved to close seven of OCR's 12 regional offices and to fire 299 workers, leaving roughly half the staff the office had in January. This is when Maggie Heilman lost her first attorney.   In October, the administration attempted to fire another 137 staffers, including gutting the office investigating Heilman's complaint. This left 62 employees at OCR who had not received a termination notice — about 10% of the office's January headcount.   \n   \"I'm just shocked that they can destroy an entire unit of an organization that's created by statute,\" said R. Shep Melnick before some cuts were reversed. Melnick is a professor of American politics at Boston College who has been writing about OCR for decades.   As at OSERS, the employees who were fired in October have since been reinstated, but, again, there is no guarantee they will be allowed to stay beyond Jan. 30.   In a statement, the department's press secretary for legal affairs, Julie Hartman, told NPR: \"We are rebuilding and refocusing OCR to enable the office to protect students and enforce the law.\"   Thousands of languishing civil rights complaints   Even as the administration has tried to cut OCR's enforcement attorneys, it has aggressively used the office to enforce new priorities, going after districts and colleges that support transgender students or embrace diversity, equity and inclusion.   \n   In a statement, Hartman told NPR that OCR had \"strayed\" under Biden and that Trump \"is reorienting OCR to what it's meant to be: a law enforcement agency, not a social-justice advocacy arm of the federal government.\"   Public data suggests a shift away from disability-related investigations.   Since Trump took office, OCR has reached resolution agreements in 73 cases involving alleged disability discrimination. Compare that to 2024, when OCR resolved 390, or 2017, the year Trump took office during his first term, when OCR reached agreements in more than 1,000 such cases.   In these agreements, school districts often commit to a host of fixes — such as launching a program to monitor the use of restraint and seclusion — that help not just the student at the center of the complaint but other students as well. Still, they require labor-intensive investigations into complaints like Maggie Heilman's, with attorneys conducting interviews and collecting documents.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                After Brooklynn's first day at her new middle school, her mother, Maggie Heilman, remembers, \"She was smiling.

The secretary's words are hollow.\"   It is possible some of OCR's responsibilities could be shifted to other federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, says Kenneth Marcus, who ran OCR during the first Trump administration and founded the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law.   That doesn't appear to have happened yet, Marcus says. But if it does, he says, \"it is entirely possible that this shift will leave us stronger when it comes to civil rights, but we will need to see the details.\"   Spellings, the former Republican education secretary, says that if the administration continues to focus its diminished resources on high-profile political fights, it will run the risk of failing the parents of disabled children even as it says it champions parents' rights in general: \"I believe it when they say, 'Let's put parents in charge.' … OK, so what about the parents who want their options as described in [federal disability law]?\"   What's next?   The endgame for the Trump administration, as the president and his education secretary have said repeatedly, is to close the U.S. Department of Education and move the federal jobs and funding streams it considers essential to other agencies.   On social media, McMahon and her staff have openly mocked the department, which she has said is \"mostly a pass-through for funds that are best managed by the states.\"   The problem with that view, says Jacqueline Rodriguez of the National Center for Learning Disabilities, is that states need and often want support when it comes to special education. And that support comes from the hundreds of federal staff the administration has been trying to fire.   Without them, Rodriguez says, \"we are concerned special education will cease to exist.\"   \"I'm fearful,\" says one state director of special education, who spoke with NPR on the condition of anonymity out of concern the government would retaliate against that state. \"I think it's good for states to know there's federal oversight and that they'll be held accountable. The concept of leaving special education up to states sounds great, but it's scary. What happens if one state decides to interpret the law one way, but another state disagrees and interprets it differently?\"   \n   Fifty years ago, Ed Martin helped write the law that made clear to all states and all public schools: Children with disabilities deserve better. The law, he says, was \"an affirmation of the values of the country.\"   He hopes that's still true.   Edited by: Nicole CohenVisual design and development by: LA Johnson\n",

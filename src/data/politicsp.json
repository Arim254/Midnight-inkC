Trump's announcement on social media follows a wave of cancellations by leading performers and groups since the president ousted the previous leadership and added his name to the building. Trump made no mention in his post of the recent cancellations.   \n   His proposal, announced days after the premiere of Melania, a documentary of the first lady, was shown at the center, he said was subject to approval by the board of the Kennedy Center, which has been stocked with his hand-picked allies. Trump himself chairs the center's board of trustees.   \"This important decision, based on input from many Highly Respected Experts, will take a tired, broken, and dilapidated Center, one that has been in bad condition, both financially and structurally for many years, and turn it into a World Class Bastion of Arts, Music, and Entertainment,\" Trump wrote in his post.   \n   Neither Trump nor Kennedy Center President Ric Grenell, a Trump ally, have provided evidence to back up their claims about the building being in disrepair.   The sudden decision is certain to spark blowback as Trump upturns the popular venue, which began as a national cultural center but Congress renamed as a \"living memorial\" to President John F. Kennedy in 1964, in the aftermath of the slain president's death. Opened in 1971, it is open year-round as a public showcase for the arts, including the National Symphony Orchestra.   Since Trump returned to the White House, the Kennedy Center is one of many Washington landmarks that he has sought to put his stamp on in his second term. He demolished the East Wing of the White House and launched a massive $400 million ballroom project, is actively pursuing building a triumphal arch on the other side the Arlington Bridge from the the Lincoln Memorial, and has plans for Washington Dulles International Airport.   \n   Leading performing arts groups have pulled out of appearances, most recently, composer Philip Glass, who announced his decision to withdraw his Symphony No. 15 \"Lincoln\" because he said the values of the center today are in \"direct conflict\" with the message of the piece.   Last month, the Washington National Opera announced that it will move performances away from the Kennedy Center in another high-profile departure following Trump's takeover of the U.S. capital's leading performing arts venue.   The head of artistic programming for the center abruptly left his post last week, less than two weeks after being named to the job.   A spokesperson for the Kennedy Center did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.   As Trump announced his plan to rename the building — erecting his name on the building's main front — he drew sharp opposition from members of Congress, and some Kennedy family members.   Kerry Kennedy, a niece of John F. Kennedy, said in a social post on X at the time that she will remove Trump's name herself with a pickax when his term ends.\n",

Rehmet, a labor union leader and veteran, easily defeated Republican Leigh Wambsganss, a conservative activist, in the Fort Worth-area district. With almost all votes counted, Rehmet had a comfortable lead of more than 14 percentage points.   \"This win goes to everyday working people,\" Rehmet told supporters.   His victory added to Democrats' record of overperforming in special elections so far this cycle. Democrats said it was further evidence that voters under the second Trump administration are motivated to reject GOP candidates and their policies.   \n   Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin called it \"a warning sign to Republicans across the country.\"   The seat was open because the four-term GOP incumbent, Kelly Hancock, resigned to take a statewide office. Hancock easily won election each time he ran for the office, and Republicans have held the seat for decades.   The district is redder than its home, Tarrant County. Trump won the county by 5 points in 2024, but Democratic President Joe Biden carried it in 2020 by about 1,800 votes out of more than 834,000 cast.   Trump posted about the race on his social media platform earlier Saturday, urging voters to get out to support Wambsganss. He called her a successful entrepreneur and \"an incredible supporter\" of his Make America Great Again movement.   But Rehmet had support from national organizations, including the DNC and VoteVets, a veterans group that said it spent $500,000 on ads. Rehmet, who served in the Air Force and works as a machinist, focused on lowering costs, supporting public education and protecting jobs.   Democrats have been encouraged by their performance in elections since Trump took office. In November, the party dominated the first major Election Day since his return to the White House, notably winning governor races in Virginia and New Jersey.   \n   Democratic candidates also have won special elections in Kentucky and Iowa. And while Republican Matt Van Epps won a Tennessee special election for a U.S. House seat, the relatively slim margin of victory gave Democrats hope for this fall's midterms.   Rehmet's victory allows him to serve only until early January, and he must win the November general election to keep the seat for a full four-year term. The Texas Legislature is not set to reconvene until 2027, and the GOP still will have a comfortable majority.\n",

Because if we go in, all they do is complain,\" Trump said.   He predicted that those cities would need help, but said if the leaders of those cities seek it from the federal government, \"They have to say, 'Please.'\"   The Trump administration has already deployed the National Guard, or federal law enforcement officials, in a number of Democratic areas, including Washington, Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland, Oregon. But Saturday's order comes as opposition to such tactics has grown, particularly in Minnesota's Twin Cities region.   Trump said Saturday night that protesters who \"do anything bad\" to immigration officers and other federal law enforcement, \"will have to suffer\" and \"will get taken care of in at least an equal way.\"   \"You see it, the way they treat our people. And I said, you're allowed, if somebody does that, you can do something back. You're not going to stand there and take it if somebody spits in your face,\" Trump said.   \n   Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul have challenged a federal immigration enforcement surge in those cities, arguing that DHS is violating constitutional protections.   A federal judge says she won't halt enforcement operations as the lawsuit proceeds. State and local officials had sought a quick order to halt the enforcement action or limit its scope. Justice Department lawyers have called the lawsuit \"legally frivolous.\"   The state, particularly Minneapolis, has been on edge after federal officers fatally shot two people in the city: Renee Good on Jan. 7 and Alex Pretti on Jan. 24. Thousands of people have taken to the streets to protest the federal action in Minnesota and across the country.   Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, has suggested the administration could reduce the number of immigration enforcement officers in Minnesota — but only if state and local officials cooperate. Trump sent Homan to Minneapolis following the killings of Good and Pretti, seeming to signal a willingness to ease tensions in Minnesota.   The president on Saturday night said he intended to speak to Homan and Noem on Sunday and he seemed to endorse the idea of immigration agents wearing body cameras or having their interactions filmed.   Trump was asked by a reporter if he thought it was a good thing having lots of cameras capturing incidents with law enforcement.   \"I think it would help law enforcement but I'd have to talk to them,\" Trump said.   He went on and added: \"That works both ways. But overall, I think it's 80% in favor of law enforcement.\"\n",

Lemon, a former CNN anchor, and Fort, a Minnesota reporter, were released from federal custody on Friday, following criticism from human rights advocates and journalism organizations over their arrests.   A federal grand jury in Minnesota indicted Fort and Lemon on charges related to the interruption of a religious service at the Cities Church in St. Paul, where a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official is a pastor. Both Fort and Lemon have maintained that they were not participating in the protest at the church but were reporting on the incident as journalists.   \n   Speaking during his YouTube show on Friday, Lemon said that this is a moment for journalists around the world \"to stand up for each other.\"   \"It may have started with people having their due process rights violated on the streets, violently violated on the streets. But now they're trying to silence journalists. And I will not be silenced,\" Lemon said on his show.   Fort, a Minnesota native who filmed her arrest as federal agents showed up to her home early Friday, told CNN's Anderson Cooper shortly after her release that she will \"continue to tell the stories of my community.\" She also said the arrests have sent \"a chilling message\" to the media industry.   \"As journalists, we never want to be the story. But unfortunately, I did find myself in a predicament where I felt that I needed to be able to tell my own story, that I needed the world to see that journalism is on trial,\" Fort said on Anderson Cooper 360°.   She added: \"If they can criminalize a journalist here in Minnesota, whether you're independent or not, I think that we've seen a track record where this is just going to continue to escalate.\"   \n   A federal magistrate judge previously declined to approve Lemon's arrest, citing a lack of evidence. A few days later, the chief federal appeals court judge in Minnesota rejected a prosecutor's appeal of the decision, writing that there was \"no evidence\" of any criminal behavior in Lemon's work.   Abbe Lowell, an attorney representing Lemon, called the arrest \"an unprecedented attack on the First Amendment\" in a social media post on Friday. Lowell also said Lemon will \"fight these charges vigorously and thoroughly in court.\" Leita Walker, an attorney for Fort, told the Columbia Journalism Review that her client \"will be vigorously defending herself against these charges.\"   \n   Disclosure: This reporter and Don Lemon were colleagues at CNN from August 2019 to April 2023.\n",

The comments from the 86-year-old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei are the most-direct threat he's made so far as the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and associated American warships are in the Arabian Sea, sent by Trump there after Tehran's bloody crackdown on nationwide protests.   \n   It remains unclear whether Trump will use force. He's repeatedly said Iran wants to negotiate and has brought up Tehran's nuclear program as another issue he wants to see resolved.   But Khamenei also referred to the nationwide protests as \"a coup,\" hardening the government's position as tens of thousands of people reportedly have been detained since the start of the demonstrations. Seditious charges in Iran can carry the death penalty, which again renews concerns about Tehran carrying out mass executions for those arrested — a red line for Trump.   \n   Iran had also planned a live-fire military drill for Sunday and Monday in the strategic Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which a fifth of all oil traded passes. The U.S. military's Central Command had warned against threatening American warships or aircraft during the drill or disrupting commercial traffic.   Khamenei warns US   Iranian state television reported Khamenei's comments online before airing any footage of his remarks.   \"The Americans should know that if they start a war, this time it will be a regional war,\" Khamenei was quoted as saying.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A woman walks through the Shiite Saints Abdulazim and Taher shrine in Shahr-e-Ray, south of Tehran, Iran, Thursday, Jan. 29, 2026.\n                \n                    Vahid Salemi/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Vahid Salemi/AP\n    \n\n   \n   It added that Khamenei said: \"We are not the instigators and we do not seek to attack any country. But the Iranian nation will deliver a firm blow to anyone who attacks or harasses it.\"   \n   Khamenei also hardened his position on the demonstrations after earlier acknowledging some people had legitimate economic grievances that sparked their protests. The demonstrations began Dec. 28, initially over the collapse of Iran's rial currency. It soon grew into a direct challenge to Khamenei's rule.   \"The recent sedition was similar to a coup. Of course, the coup was suppressed,\" he said. \"Their goal was to destroy sensitive and effective centers involved in running the country, and for this reason they attacked the police, government centers, (Revolutionary Guard) facilities, banks and mosques — and burned copies of the Quran. They targeted centers that run the country.\"   Parliament speaker says EU militaries considered terrorist groups.   The speaker of Iran's parliament, meanwhile, said that the Islamic Republic now considers all European Union militaries to be terrorist groups, lashing out after the bloc declared the country's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard a terror group over its bloody crackdown on nationwide protests.   Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, a former Guard commander, announced the terror designation, which will likely be mostly symbolic. Iran has used a 2019 law to reciprocally declare other nations' militaries terror groups following the United States declaration of the Guard a terror group that year.   Qalibaf made the announcement as he and others in parliament wore Guard uniforms in support of the force. The Guard, which also controls Iran's ballistic missile arsenal and has vast economic interests in Iran, answers only to Iran's 86-year-old Khamenei.   \"By seeking to strike at the (Guard), which itself has been the greatest barrier to the spread of terrorism to Europe, Europeans have in fact shot themselves in the foot and, once again, through blind obedience to the Americans, decided against the interests of their own people,\" Qalibaf said.   Lawmakers at the session later chanted: \"Death to America!\" and \"Death to Israel!\" at the session.   \n   Trump says Iran is 'seriously talking' to US   Trump has laid out two red lines for military action: the killing of peaceful protesters or the possible mass execution of those detained in a major crackdown over the demonstrations. He's increasingly begun discussing Iran's nuclear program as well, which the U.S. negotiated over with Tehran in multiple sessions before Israel launched a 12-day war with Iran back in June.   The U.S. bombed three Iranian nuclear sites during the war. Activity at two of the sites suggests Iran may be trying to obscure the view of satellites as it tries to salvage what remains there.   Trump on Saturday night declined to say whether he'd made a decision on what he wanted to do regarding Iran.   Speaking to reporters as he flew to Florida, Trump sidestepped a question about whether Tehran would be emboldened if the U.S. backed away from launching strikes on Iran, saying, \"Some people think that. Some people don't.\"   Trump said Iran should negotiate a \"satisfactory\" deal to prevent the Middle Eastern country from getting any nuclear weapons, but said, \"I don't know that they will. But they are talking to us. Seriously talking to us.\"   Ali Larijani, a top security official in Iran, wrote on X late Saturday that \"structural arrangements for negotiations are progressing.\" However, there is no public sign of any direct talks with the United States, something Khamenei has repeatedly ruled out.\n",

Reopening the border crossing is a key step as the Israel-Hamas ceasefire moves ahead.    \n   Israel announced Sunday that the crossing has opened in a test. COGAT, the Israeli military agency that controls aid to Gaza, said in a statement that the crossing was actively being prepared for fuller operation, adding that residents of Gaza would begin to pass through the crossing once preparations were complete.   Palestinian security officers passed through the crossing's Egyptian gate and headed toward the Palestinian gate to join an EU mission that will be supervising exit and entry, said an Egyptian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to talk to the media. Ambulances also crossed through the Egyptian gate, the official added.   \n   The head of the new Palestinian administrative committee governing Gaza's daily affairs has said travel in both directions would start Monday.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Trucks carrying humanitarian aids line up to enter the Egyptian gate of the Rafah crossing, heading for inspection by Israeli authorities before entering the Gaza Strip, in Rafah, Egypt, Sunday, Feb. 1, 2026.\n                \n                    Mohammed Arafat/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mohammed Arafat/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Rafah, which Palestinians see as their gateway to the world, has been largely shut since it was seized by Israel in May 2024.   Few people will be allowed at first, and no goods allowed to cross. About 20,000 Palestinian children and adults needing medical care are hoping to leave war-devastated Gaza via the crossing, and thousands of other Palestinians outside the territory hope to return home.   \n   Zaher al-Wahidi, head of the Health Ministry's documentation department in Gaza, told The Associated Press that the ministry hasn't yet been notified about the start of medical evacuations.   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will allow 50 patients a day to leave. An official involved in the discussions, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the diplomatic talks, said each patient would be allowed to travel with two relatives, while some 50 people who left Gaza during the war would be allowed to return each day.   Israel has said it and Egypt will vet people for exit and entry through the crossing, which will be supervised by European Union border patrol agents. The number of travelers is expected to increase over time if the system is successful.   \n   Israeli troops seized and closed the Rafah crossing in May 2024, calling it part of efforts to combat Hamas arms smuggling. The crossing was briefly opened for the evacuation of medical patients during a ceasefire in early 2025. Israel had resisted reopening the Rafah crossing, but the recovery of the remains of the last hostage in Gaza last week cleared the way to move forward.   The reopening is a key step as last year's U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement, which took effect on Oct. 10, moves into its second phase.   Before the war, Rafah was the main crossing for people moving in and out of Gaza. Although Gaza has four other border crossings, they are shared with Israel. Under the ceasefire terms, Israel's military controls the area between the Rafah crossing and the zone where most Palestinians live.   Fearing that Israeli could use the crossing to push Palestinians out of the enclave, Egypt has repeatedly said it must be open for both entry to and exit from Gaza. Historically, Israel and Egypt have vetted Palestinians applying to cross.   The current ceasefire halted more than two years of war between Israel and Hamas that began with a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The truce's first phase called for the exchange of all hostages held in Gaza for hundreds of Palestinians held by Israel, an increase in badly needed humanitarian aid and a partial pullback of Israeli troops.   The second phase is more complicated. It calls for installing a new Palestinian committee to govern Gaza, deploying an international security force, disarming Hamas, and taking steps to begin rebuilding.\n",

Many of the Italians who chanted and blew whistles near the grand stone arch in the Piazza XXV Aprile said they had been horrified and angered by images and videos on social media showing ICE agents operating violently in Minneapolis.   \"All the videos are public and everyone can see what's happening,\" said Bruna Scanziani, age 18, who held up a sign with photographs of Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti, two American citizens  killed by ICE agents.  \"The perception of America has changed.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Bruna Scanziani, age 18, who lives outside Milan, told NPR that she's been frightened and angered by images of ICE operating in Minneapolis.

In the past, that kind of activity by U.S. agents has been a normal part of major international events like the Olympics.    But many Italian politicians, including Milan's mayor, have said that in the wake of violence in Minneapolis, ICE officers are no longer welcome in the city.   \n   \"This is a militia that kills, a militia that enters into the homes of people, signing their own permission slips,\" Milan Mayor Giuseppe Sala told local media last week. \"It is clear they are not welcome in Milan, without a doubt.\"   That view was shared by Francesco Tattoni, who said he attended Saturday's protest in Milan, in part to show solidarity with people in Minneapolis.   \"I don't like what's happening with ICE. I don't want that to come here to Italy,\" Tattoni said. \"We believe they are doing the same thing the fascists were doing in the 1930s and 1940s.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                ICE agents in Milan?

According to White House officials, Vice President Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are both scheduled to attend the Milan Cortina opening ceremony on February 6.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Ayesha Rascoe talks with Alex Plechash, chair of the Minnesota GOP, about the federal presence in his state.   \n\n    AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:  The state of Minnesota has sought to stop President Trump's ongoing immigration crackdown there. But yesterday, a federal judge ruled that it may continue for now. Operation Metro Surge has sparked outrage and protest in Minnesota and across the country, especially after federal agents killed two U.S. citizens last month - Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti. Minnesota is a largely blue state with a Democratic governor and two Democratic senators. They've been vocal in their opposition to the immigration operation. But Republicans in Minnesota are hoping to make gains in November's elections. Alex Plechash is chair of Minnesota's Republican Party and has been active in the state's politics for more than two decades. He joins me now. Good morning.ALEX PLECHASH: Good morning, Ayesha. Thank you for having me.RASCOE: So let's begin with your assessment of Operation Metro Surge. How do you see it?PLECHASH: Well, it's certainly something different for the state, and I think that's why a lot of people were pushing back on it. It is quite unusual from anything we've done before. But the state has really fallen down on its own immigration policies, and so it's not surprising that the feds will come in and do what they needed to do. They may have gone too far. There's a lot of pushback on that. But they're actually doing what they need to do.RASCOE: Well, do you feel like they've gone too far? Do you have concerns - any concerns about the operation?PLECHASH: Oh, I think I do. I mean, I've gotten a lot of feedback from people - my own constituents, basically - that go everything from, it's about time that the feds came in to do what the state wouldn't do, to some people feeling like the feds have gone a little too far in certain cases. And that's what we're seeing. A lot of the focus has been on the cases where maybe they've gone too far, but I tell people, let's wait for all the facts to roll out. Right now what you're seeing, I think, is years of inaction under President Biden and our previous, you know, leaders here, combined with sanctuary-style policies in cities. We're seeing the real consequences of that.RASCOE: Well, I mean, at this point, you had - U.S. Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino was overseeing the operation, which involves about 3,000 federal agents in Minnesota. President Trump recently sidelined Bovino, brought in Tom Homan, the White House's border czar, to take over. Are you confident in Homan's ability to maybe de-escalate some of those tensions and concerns here?PLECHASH: Oh, I do have great confidence in Tom Homan. He held a press conference here in Minneapolis just a few days ago, and he highlighted the hard work of the administration to remove the worst of the worst criminals from our communities. We're already beginning to see some vestige of cooperation from our local officials, and some of the rhetoric is toning down a bit. So I have very good confidence in him.RASCOE: But you talked about how you have heard concerns from some of your constituents because - I mean, I know that your hope is to turn Minnesota into a red state. But are you confident that you'll be able to make those gains in November with the backlash to Operation Metro Surge?PLECHASH: Well, certainly, I have concerns. It would be naive of me to not consider that. But I think that what's happening here with ICE is a reaction to certain things. And it will dissipate, whether it's a week or a month, but it's certainly going to dissipate between now and the election. Then we can refocus our dialogue on the things that Minnesotans really care about, and that's the cost of living. It's the fraud - the, you know, unbelievable amount of fraud that has been uncovered here in Minnesota. We were pounding that drum before the feds came in for enforcement of immigration. We will continue to pound that drum when that topic goes away. And it's - that's the kind of thing that Minnesotans really care about.RASCOE: So you feel like the immigration issue will go away - that people will not be thinking about this in November?PLECHASH: Oh, I wouldn't be so naive as to say it'll go away. They'll certainly be thinking about it, but it'll become somewhat past history. And, you know, the feds are really doing what they need to do, and the enforcement actions they're doing are legal. And the thing is, a lot of the chaos that we've been seeing is brought on by all the protests. I mean, they're getting in the face of the feds in every possible way, and yet they're just doing their jobs. So I think that's actually going to dissipate a bit, but fraud is going to stay with us.RASCOE: Just very quickly - I mean, but do you have any concerns about American citizens who are being pulled over who say that they are being profiled? Do you feel like that's appropriately doing the job?PLECHASH: No, I don't, frankly. If that's what's occurring, then I think the - that needs to be investigated and needs to be brought to light. That's not what our country's all about. I don't think that's what the feds' aim is. They may have made some mistakes along the way. I don't know. Let's wait and see when the facts come out. But if that, in fact, is happening, sure, I have a concern about it.RASCOE: That's Alex Plechash. He's the chair of the Republican Party in Minnesota. Thank you so much.PLECHASH: You're welcome.

    "body": "\n      Democrats want changes to how federal immigration agents operate before agreeing to DHS funding. President Trump says his MAGA base hasn't softened on his immigration crackdown.   \n\n    AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:  Last night on Air Force One.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If they want help, they have to ask for it.RASCOE: President Trump said he told Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem not to intervene in protests in Democratic-led cities unless it's at the request of local authorities.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: If they want help, they'll ask. But they have to say please.RASCOE: He also bemoaned that Democratic cities are, quote, \"always complaining.\" This is the latest response to the strong public pushback over his administration's immigration crackdown in Minneapolis and the killing of ICU nurse Alex Pretti by federal agents last weekend. Funding for DHS has become a sticking point. Joining me now to talk about this is NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith. Good morning, Tam.TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning, Ayesha.RASCOE: So let's start with Trump's comments last night. What more can you tell us?KEITH: Well, reporters were asking him to clarify something that he had posted earlier in the day on social media. But I will be perfectly honest here. He didn't really clarify what this means in practical terms. He wrote that he had instructed Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to protect federal property, but not to help local governments with protests and/or riots, he said. But because - but here's the thing, the only thing that city leaders in Minneapolis and elsewhere have been asking for is for ICE and CPB to leave because they don't consider the intense federal presence to be helpful at all. And in Trump's post, he went on to add a warning, quote, \"beware - ICE, Border Patrol\" and \"if necessary, our military will be extremely powerful and tough in the protection of our federal property.\" So is there a de-escalation embedded in that bluster? Maybe. But when it comes to immigration enforcement, it is important to watch what the administration does and not just what the president says.RASCOE: OK. Well, the House comes back tomorrow and is expected to take up a compromise spending package that the Senate passed on Friday. We are in a partial government shutdown, even though it doesn't really feel like that yet. This package would only fund DHS for two weeks because Democrats want more time to negotiate new restrictions on how federal immigration agents can operate. Like, what changes do they want?KEITH: They want immigration enforcement reined in. No more roving patrols of ICE agents grabbing people off the streets or using administrative warrants, which don't require a judge to sign off. They want agents to remove their masks and identify themselves. And they also want to change the rules for use of force to more closely match local and other federal law enforcement.RASCOE: So how receptive are Republican lawmakers to this?KEITH: You know, President Trump didn't dismiss these ideas out of hand but said that it would be the subject of talks in coming days. Some Republicans in Congress are already a hard no, saying these changes would just take the country back to Biden-era immigration policies. And then there are others who have serious concerns with what they've been seeing on America's streets and are open to some changes in policy. This two-week period for negotiations is going to overlap with hearings where top immigration officials are going to have to answer tough questions, which could keep all of this top of mind.RASCOE: So, Tam, a federal judge has ordered the government release 5-year-old Liam Ramos and his father from a Texas detention center. Both live in Minneapolis, and their case has sparked outrage nationwide. You've read the judge's order. Do you think pointed is a good description of his wording?KEITH: I think that may be an understatement. Let me just read some of this order from U.S. District Judge Fred Biery, a Clinton appointee. Of Ramos and his father, he writes, they seek nothing more than some modicum of due process and the rule of law, adding that federal agency use of administrative warrants violates the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, and, quote, \"the case has its genesis in the ill-conceived and incompetently-implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatizing children,\" unquote. In a statement, DHS spokesperson Patricia McLaughlin again defended the administration's actions in this case and suggested if families want to avoid situations like this, they should self-deport.RASCOE: Finally, I understand that you, like many political reporters, decided to go see \"Melania.\" This is the film about the first lady. What did you think?KEITH: There were a lot of shots of her feet, which were always in five-inch stiletto heels. My main takeaway is that this wasn't a documentary. It was another piece of carefully curated image-making from Melania Trump, who was also an executive producer of the film. There really were no unguarded moments. Not a single shot without her hair and makeup absolutely perfect. No reflections or even acknowledgment of the divisions roiling the nation. And you can't talk about this film without mentioning that Amazon paid $40 million to acquire it and another 35 million to promote it, which is essentially unheard of for a film of this type. There were about 10 other people in the theater with me last night, and when it ended, the woman behind me clapped excitedly and said that she should win an Oscar.RASCOE: That's NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith.

The woman in the video is Aliya Rahman, a Bangladeshi-American and a U.S. citizen. The day she was arrested, Rahman was on her way to the doctor, when she came across an ICE operation and a group of people protesting. She said the ICE officers told her to move her car, but the scene was chaotic and she received multiple instructions at once.   \n   The Department of Homeland Security said in an earlier statement they arrested Rahman because she \"ignored multiple commands.\" But Rahman, who is autistic and also recovering from a traumatic brain injury, says it sometimes takes her a moment to understand auditory commands. Before she knew it, the officers were carrying her away by her limbs.    \n   \"I thought I might well die,\" Rahman said. She was placed in an SUV with three ICE officers.   \"I heard the laughing driver radio in, 'we're bringing in a body,'\" she recalled. It took her a second to realize they meant her.   In recent days, federal officials have signaled a willingness to reduce the large number of immigration agents in Minnesota, though they say any decrease will depend on state and local cooperation. Even if a draw-down occurs, they'll leave behind a changed community, including many citizens questioned and detained by immigration officers in recent weeks.   Rahman was taken to the Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis, where immigration agents have brought detainees before releasing them or sending them out of state. While at Whipple, Rahman experienced a severe headache, and asked for medical care for more than an hour. Eventually, she passed out. She says she woke up in a downtown hospital, where doctors told her she had suffered a concussion.   \n   Her arrest was more than two weeks ago, but she can't shake the fear.   \"I do not feel safe being in my own home, driving these streets,\" she said. \"And even then, I am in a significantly better place than a lot of the other folks who have been detained.\"   \n   Rahman is far from the only U.S. citizen in Minnesota with such a story.   ChongLy Scott Thao, a Hmong man and U.S. citizen, was pulled from his home wearing only sandals, underwear and a blanket around his shoulders. Thao said the immigration agents drove him \"to the middle of nowhere\" and photographed him. He told reporters he feared they would beat him. They later brought him back to his house.   Mubashir Khalif Hussen, a Somali-American and U.S. citizen, also was detained by ICE.   \"I wasn't even outside for mere seconds before I seen a masked person running at me full speed,\" Hussen said at a news conference last month. \"He tackled me. I told him, 'I'm a U.S. citizen.' He didn't seem to care. He dragged me outside to the snow while I was handcuffed, restrained, helpless and he pushed me to the ground.\"   Hussen is now suing the Trump administration as part of a class action lawsuit, accusing it of racial profiling. According to the lawsuit, ICE eventually released Hussen outside the Whipple building, telling him to walk the seven miles back to where they detained him.   In a statement to NPR, the Department of Homeland Security said \"allegations that ICE engages in 'racial profiling' are disgusting, reckless and categorically FALSE.\"   \n   But Walter Olson, a senior fellow with the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, says many legal experts are coming to a different conclusion.   \"This is no longer just a series of accidents that could have been due to someone being badly trained or being a bad apple. This is a systematic assault on constitutional rights,\" he said.   The Fourth Amendment protects people from being stopped without reasonable suspicion and arresting without probable cause, a higher standard. Courts in the U.S. have decided skin color alone does not meet either bar.   \n   Last fall, however, the Supreme court ruled that \"apparent ethnicity\" could be used to determine reasonable suspicion, as long as there were other factors too. Legal experts say the decision may give ICE more discretion.   Olson says even if the Minnesota immigration crackdown eases, these same concerns could arise elsewhere. He noted that judges ruled against the federal government during its crackdowns in Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland.   \"And they were not led to call off or rethink the campaign. They just regrouped and came back to another state,\" Olson said.   Even citizens who were not arrested but still questioned are rattled after run-ins with immigration officers. Luis Escoto, the owner of El Taquito Taco Shop in West St. Paul, said immigration agents surrounded his wife Irma's car in their restaurant's alley when she went out to get more lettuce before the dinner hour. Escoto ran outside.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Luis Escoto poses for a portrait inside of his restaurant, El Taquito in West St. Paul, Minnesota.\n                \n                    Jaida Grey Eagle for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jaida Grey Eagle for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"I said, 'Hey, hold on. That's just my wife,'\" Escoto said. \"They said, 'We need proof of U.S. citizenship,' and I said, 'She's a U.S. citizen.'\"   Luis and Irma Escoto are both citizens. Escoto showed one of the officers their passport cards, which he still had in his wallet after a recent trip to Mexico.   \"He said, 'Well, next time she should carry that all the time, because if she doesn't have proof of citizenship we're going to arrest her,'\" Escoto recalled.   The immigration agents left. But weeks later, Escoto is still shaken and angry. Some of his customers are now escorting him and his wife home each night when the restaurant closes.   When he became a citizen 35 years ago, Escoto said he was nervous because the government took away his green card. He asked the judge about it.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Irma Escoto poses for a portrait inside of her restaurant, El Taquito in West St. Paul, Minnesota.\n                \n                    Jaida Grey Eagle for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jaida Grey Eagle for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   \"I said, 'Sir, what happens if the immigration officers stop me?' And he said 'Well, today you're proud to be a United States citizen,'\" Escoto said.   \n   The judge told him you don't need documentation when you're a citizen. But now, Escoto said, that doesn't seem so true anymore.\n",

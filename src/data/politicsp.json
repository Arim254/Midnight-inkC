Russia, Belarus, Slovenia, Thailand and the European Union's executive arm also were among the latest to receive invitations.   It's unclear how many leaders have been asked to join the board, and the large number of invitations being sent out, including to countries that don't get along, has raised questions about the board's mandate and decision-making processes. Also unknown is Israel's potential role on a board in charge of implementing the ceasefire agreement that directly involves them.   \n   A Trump reference in the invitation letters saying that the body would \"embark on a bold new approach to resolving global conflict\" suggested it could act as a rival to the U.N. Security Council, the most powerful body of the global organization created in the wake of World War II.   France, though, does not plan to join the Board of Peace \"at this stage\" despite receiving an invitation, a French official close to President Emmanuel Macron said Monday. The issue is raising questions, particularly with regard to respect for the principles and structure of the United Nations, said the official, speaking anonymously in line with the French presidency's customary practices.   Told late Monday that Macron was unlikely to join, Trump said, \"Well, nobody wants him because he's going to be out of office very soon.\"   \"I'll put a 200% tariff on his wines and champagnes and he'll join,\" Trump told reporters in Florida before a flight back to Washington. \"But he doesn't have to join.\"   Morocco's King Mohammed VI accepted a spot Monday, becoming the first Arab leader and at least the fifth world leader to join. Vietnam, Kazakhstan, Hungary and Argentina also have signed on.   Russian President Vladimir Putin received the invitation, and the Kremlin is now \"studying the details\" and will seek clarity of \"all the nuances\" in contacts with the U.S., said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Trump confirmed Monday night that Putin had been invited.   \n   Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko is ready to take part, according to the country's Foreign Ministry. The Thai Foreign Ministry said it was invited and reviewing the details.   European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill said that Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the commission, would be speaking to other EU leaders about Gaza. Gill didn't say whether its invitation had been accepted, but that the commission wants \"to contribute to a comprehensive plan to end the Gaza conflict.\"   Israel's objections to the board   Israeli far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich on Monday dismissed the Board of Peace as a raw deal for Israel and called for its dissolution.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Donald Trump speaks to reporters before boarding Air Force One at Palm Beach International Airport, Monday, Jan. 19, 2026, in West Palm Beach, Fla.\n                \n                    Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n    \n\n   \n   \"It is time to explain to the president that his plan is bad for the State of Israel and to cancel it,\" Smotrich said. \"Gaza is ours, its future will affect our future more than anyone else's. We will take responsibility for what happens there, impose military administration, and complete the mission.\"   Smotrich, a hard-liner who opposed the Gaza ceasefire, even suggested that Israel renew a full-scale offensive on the territory to destroy Hamas if it doesn't abide by a \"short ultimatum for real disarmament and exile.\"   Netanyahu said later on Monday that while there are differences with the U.S. about the composition of the advisory committee accompanying the next phase in Gaza, it would not harm his relationship with Trump.   \"There will not be Turkish soldiers and Qatari soldiers in the (Gaza) Strip,\" he said.   Netanyahu's office earlier said the formation of an executive board that will work to carry out the vision of the Board of Peace wasn't coordinated with the Israeli government and \"is contrary to its policy\" without clarifying its objections. Turkey, a key regional rival, is among those invited to join the committee.   The final list   The U.S. is expected to announce its official list of members in the coming days, likely during the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland.   \n   Board members will oversee an executive committee that will be in charge of implementing the tough second phase of the Gaza peace plan that includes the deployment of an international security force, disarmament of Hamas and reconstruction of the war-devastated territory.   A $1 billion contribution secures permanent membership on the board, with the money going to rebuild Gaza, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity about the charter as he wasn't permitted to speak publicly about details of the board, which hasn't been made public. A three-year appointment has no contribution requirement.   According to the World Bank's Gaza and West Bank Interim Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (IRDNA) report released last year, it'll take $53 billion to rebuild the strip.   British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Monday the United Kingdom is talking to allies about the Board of Peace.   Running Gaza   Egypt's top diplomat on Monday met with the leader of the newly appointed committee of Palestinian technocrats who will be running Gaza's day-to-day affairs during the second phase.   Foreign Minister Bader Abdelatty met with Ali Shaath, a Palestinian engineer and former official with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, who was named last week as chief commissioner of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza.   Abdelatty expressed the Egyptian government's \"complete support\" of the committee and affirmed its role in running Gaza's daily affairs until the Palestinian Authority takes over the territory, said a statement from the Egyptian ministry.   Gaza humanitarian situation still fragile   The U.N. World Food Program on Monday said it has \"significantly expanded\" its operations across Gaza 100 days into the ceasefire, reaching more than a million people each month with hot meals and food parcels. But it warned the situation remains \"extremely fragile.\"   It noted that malnutrition has been prevented for 200,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women, as well as children under 5.   \n   Still, the most recent Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis in December indicated that 77% the population is facing crisis-level food insecurity.   Israeli forces move into Hebron   Israeli military and security forces launched what they called a large-scale counterterrorism operation in the West Bank city of Hebron to dismantle \"terrorist infrastructure, eliminating illegal weapons possession and strengthening security.\"   The Israeli military said Monday the operation is expected to continue for several days. Israeli armored vehicles and soldiers patrolled city streets and put up barriers where operations were being conducted.   Hebron Mayor Khaled Dudin said Israeli forces targeted the area that's home to 80,000 people because it obstructs the construction of additional Israeli settlements.   Three Palestinians killed   Israeli forces on Monday killed three Palestinians, including a teenager, in southern Gaza, hospital authorities said.   Two men crossed into Israeli-controlled areas east of Khan Younis before being shot dead, while 17-year-old Hussein Tawfiq Abu Sabalah was shot and killed in the Muwasi area of Rafah, according to the Nasser hospital. It wasn't immediately clear whether the teen had crossed into or came close to the Israeli-controlled area.   More than 460 people were killed by Israeli fire and their bodies brought to hospitals since the ceasefire went into effect just over three months ago, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.   The ministry, which is part of the Hamas-led government, maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts.\n",

The couple was in a tight spot. They had three kids and were forced to move because their landlord was selling their rental. That pressure made their search all the more frustrating.   \"We would pull up to a house, our agent would get out and be like, 'There's 10 additional offers, sight unseen, all cash.' Typically that means it's an investor,\" Maxwell recalled.    \n   The couple, who eventually found a place, was one of many whose path to homeownership was stymied by a nationwide surge of institutional investors, then driven by record-low mortgage rates, snapping up single-family homes to rent out.   It's an issue that President Trump now aims to take on. In a recent social media post, he said he wants to \"ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes,\" to help bring down housing costs.   It's a popular idea, especially among some Democrats. But passing such laws has proved difficult, and economists say the link of investor-owned homes to high prices is not so simple.   A cap on investor rentals just took effect in this city   In Fishers, Ind., a suburb of Indianapolis, Republican Mayor Scott Fadness was taken aback when he saw new data in a housing report compiled by his team that showed the extent of investor landlords in his city.   \"We have neighborhoods today that are now creeping up to 35, 38% of the homes have been purchased for investment purposes,\" he said.   It got so bad, he recalled, that one of his employees who was house hunting sent letters to homeowners, explaining that they were going to work for the city \"and would they please consider allowing them to buy the home\" instead of an institutional investor.   \n   To address the problem, Fadness last year proposed capping rentals at 10% per neighborhood to protect local homeownership.   \"It's been a source of generational wealth in our country for a very long time, particularly in the middle class,\" he said. \"I hate to see that go away.\"   \n   It's also more difficult, he said, to deal with code enforcement and other issues when the property owner is an out-of-state corporation.   Realtor groups opposed a cap, arguing it infringed on private property rights and could deprive sellers of the highest bid, but the City Council backed the plan unanimously. The new law just took effect Jan. 1.   \"It was the first time I had proposed an ordinance in our community where outside interests, business interests, came into town and spent money trying to kill the legislation,\" Fadness said.   It was a rare win for such a proposal. Cities and states across the U.S. have debated restricting investor homebuyers, yet most measures have failed to pass. One proposal went nowhere in Congress, which Trump has said would need to codify any ban. California Gov. Gavin Newsom joined Trump this month in saying he's determined to do something.   Economists say large investors are not the biggest factor driving home prices   But housing experts say it's too easy to blame corporate landlords entirely for skyrocketing prices.   \"People see the connection, but they don't necessarily separate out the cause and effect,\" said Laurie Goodman, an economist with the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute.   \n   Prices do go up where investors buy, but she said, \"That is part of their strategy,\" because the places they choose are already growing. And often, they buy serious fixer-uppers.   \"Most of us don't have the knowledge to do the repairs,\" Goodman said. \"(Even) if we did, we couldn't get the financing.\"   Nationally, the largest companies own about 3% of the single-family rental market, with larger shares in some places like the Sunbelt. And the institutional buying spree has cooled from its peak in 2022, as higher interest rates have made homes more expensive.   \n   The main driver of rising prices is a housing shortage, Goodman said, and some investors are actually helping to ease that now, by building their own single-family houses to rent.   \"The best way to make housing affordable is to simply build more of it — to increase supply,\" she said.   The debate continues in Las Vegas   In Las Vegas, Democratic state Sen. Dina Neal still worries that the build-to-rent trend is undercutting people's shot at homeownership. She pointed to one corporate investor near her district that built an entire neighborhood of houses to rent.   \"They didn't build the whole entire neighborhood to give it up,\" she said. \"They wanted to make sure they would secure rental income from 200 different families and keep it.\"   What's more, like Fadness in Indiana, Neal worries that investor rentals are priced so high it can become impossible for many people to save up for a down payment. She said her previous next-door neighbor sold to an investor believing she could trade up, but had to rent a place down the street — from a different corporate investor.   Neal has proposed a cap on corporate landlords three times, but Nevada's Republican governor, Joe Lombardo, has blocked it, most recently last month.   Neal is surprised — and cautious — now that Trump is taking up her cause. \"I am trying to figure out how I entered into a universe where I became aligned with a president who is a nemesis to the Democratic Party,\" she laughed.   But if Trump's interest can persuade more Republicans to join the push, she said she'll take it.\n",

One of President Trump's top lieutenants, Gor had been in charge of selecting staff to serve in Trump's second-term White House. Now he was getting a promotion.   Jeanine Pirro, the former Fox News personality-turned-U.S. attorney, offered praise for Gor's loyalty, then turned to Trump.   \"There is in this room, a group of people who love you, who believe in you, and who are so proud to be in this Oval Office,\" she said.   \n   That lovefest reflects a real change from Trump's first term, with its rival power centers and steady flow of staff shakeups and firings by tweet. One year into this second Trump presidency, high level staff and Cabinet turnover is significantly lower than it was during the same period in 2017. That's according to a new analysis from Brookings Institution visiting fellow Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, shared exclusively with NPR.   In 2017, Trump oversaw turnover in two Cabinet positions and 35% of senior staff posts. This time around, there's been no turnover at the Cabinet level, and senior staff turnover is at 29%. To keep consistency across administrations, for the Cabinet Tenpas only counts officials in the presidential line of succession.   \"For the other six presidents before President Trump, the average [high level staff] turnover in that first year is typically around 10%, so he's much higher than the average, but I will say it is less than his first term by a good margin,\" Tenpas said in an interview with NPR.   \n   Tenpas also documents the nature of the departures. In the first term, there were a lot of people unceremoniously shown the door by a president whose TV tagline was \"you're fired.\" This time, it has mostly been promotions, such as Gor becoming an ambassador.   \"There are far fewer resignations under pressure in this first year, 2025, than there were in 2017,\" said Tenpas.   In 2017, high-profile aides including chief of staff Reince Priebus, chief strategist Steve Bannon, White House press secretary Sean Spicer, communications director Michael Dubke and the famously 11-day-serving White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci all exited, often with an announcement by tweet.   The people leaving their jobs this time around aren't household names, says Tenpas, further dialing down the personnel drama.   \"You know, I would call these positions influential, but they just weren't public figures, they weren't press secretaries. They weren't chiefs of staff,\" she said.   People who served in the first Trump administration say this time is different, with Trump learning from his first presidency that he prefers loyalists. He has surrounded himself with aides who more closely align with him personally and with his political agenda.   \n   Gone are the big names he brought on because people suggested he should. Now, loyalty is the coin of the realm.   \"I do think that … if you look at what is the core of the stability, it was the emphasis that they put on loyalty in hiring, and that has then subsequently paved the way for less infighting and less drama and a lower rate than in 2017,\" said Tenpas.   A large share of the departures so far this term were on the National Security Council staff, including national security adviser Mike Waltz, who became U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He had been responsible for what was known as Signal-gate, the first major scandal of the term, when he inadvertently added a journalist to a group chat where secret plans for airstrikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen were discussed. But he wasn't fired. He was promoted to a position requiring Senate confirmation.   When Waltz left as national security adviser, he was replaced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who added another job to an already long list of assignments from Trump. It was supposed to be temporary, but it's been more than eight months.   The high-level NSC staff departures Tenpas tracked reflect a much larger shedding of staff assigned to the National Security Council.   A White House official not authorized to speak on the record tells NPR there has been a significant reduction in NSC staffing over the past year to create a more top-down foreign policy process.   The official called it a rightsizing — a strategic choice rather than White House intrigue.   This Brookings data does not capture firings and upheaval among career officials in other areas of the Trump administration, such as at the State Department, Justice Department or the Defense Department, all of which have seen significant turnover.\n",

    "body": "\n         Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer says her swing state is preparing for Trump administration efforts to disrupt voting in 2026 and 2028.   In an NPR interview, Whitmer did not accuse the administration of specific plans to interfere. But, she said, \"It would be a mistake to assume that they're not going to,\" and said Democrats are preparing through \"table top\" exercises.   The governor sat down with me for the video interview on Thursday during her visit to the Detroit Auto Show, pulling up a chair next to a red Cadillac Escalade. The show is at Huntington Place, the same convention center that was a ballot-counting site in 2020, when pro-Trump protesters banged on windows and tried to stop the count.   \n   Whitmer is beginning her eighth and final year as governor. She is term-limited and not currently a candidate for anything, though she is often mentioned as a presidential or vice-presidential contender. She has made no public moves toward running in 2028, though, as the vice-chair of the Democratic Governors Association, she says she is focused on electing other Democrats.   You can watch the full video interview. Below are highlights:   Democratic governors are preparing for further election disruptions    Asked if she assumed that pro-Trump forces would attempt to interfere with ballot counting, Whitmer said, \"It would be a mistake to assume that they're not going to. So I don't know precisely what it is that they might come up with. But we've got smart, sophisticated, savvy people around the table top that we will continue to get prepared.\"   Asked about fears that Trump's immigration crackdown — deploying thousands of federal personnel into American cities — would become a tool for controlling elections, Whitmer said, \"I don't think it's paranoia to have that concern.\"   She said Democratic governors are discussing how to respond, and performing \"table top\" exercises, though she gave few specifics. \"There are important reasons that I'm not going to go into a whole lot more detail,\" Whitmer said.   \n   She says Trump's tariffs have \"taken a terrible toll\"   Whitmer used that alliterative phrase during a speech at the Detroit Auto Show. She said U.S. auto manufacturing depended on parts and materials sourced from around the world, especially Canada. U.S. automakers have said tariffs cost them billions of dollars in 2025.   The United Auto Workers union has spoken favorably of tariffs, expressing hope that they would return manufacturing jobs to the U.S. Whitmer conceded that \"some of the leadership says they like tariffs,\" but \"we are seeing a contraction of U.S. manufacturing. That's job losses. And ultimately, their rank and file members have got to be able to afford to take care of their families.\" Asked how she might persuade union leaders, she said, \"I'm not working to persuade them to change their mind. I'm doing what I know to be the right thing to do for the Michigan economy, for the United States economy.\"   She is trying to understand Democrats' loss of support among men in 2024   Her state of the state speech in 2025 warned of \"a generation of men falling behind their fathers and their grandfathers.\"   Asked to explain her thinking, she said, \"When we look at the efforts that we undertook to make college or skill sets more affordable, women were signing up to two to one,\" compared with men. She added, \"When we announced opportunities that bring down the cost of a first home payment. Women were signing up 2 to 1 for men. We were not reaching men.\"   Asked about analysts who argue that many men are demoralized or disconnected, she said, \"I'm listening to all, probably a lot, of the same podcasts that you are to understand what can we do. How do we bridge this gap? It is real. And I think that's the first step.\"   \n   She says America is ready to elect a woman president   Last year, former first lady Michelle Obama said to voters at a public event, \"You are not ready\" to elect a woman, judging by the 2024 election results.   \"I love Michelle Obama,\" Whitmer said. \"So the last thing I want to do is disagree with her. But, you know, I think America is ready for a woman president.\" She said Kamala Harris' defeat in 2024 was not \"just gender,\" but a variety of factors. \"We have not had a woman president yet. I think we will at some point in the near future,\" Whitmer said.\n",

Cardinals Blase Cupich, archbishop of Chicago, Robert McElroy, archbishop of Washington, and Joseph Tobin, archbishop of Newark, say America's actions raise moral questions.   \"Our country's moral role in confronting evil around the world, sustaining the right to life and human dignity, and supporting religious liberty are all under examination,\" the statement reads. \"And the building of just and sustainable peace, so crucial to humanity's well-being now and in the future, is being reduced to partisan categories that encourage polarization and destructive policies.\"   \n   They continued, \"We seek a foreign policy that respects and advances the right to human life, religious liberty, and the enhancement of human dignity throughout the world, especially through economic assistance.\"   The senior leaders cited the recent events in Venezuela, Ukraine and Greenland, which they said \"have raised basic questions about the use of military force and the meaning of peace.\"   \n   The White House did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment.   The statement by the American cardinals was inspired by a recent speech Pope Leo XIV gave to ambassadors to the Holy See. In it, he criticized the weakening of multilateralism.   \"A diplomacy that promotes dialogue and seeks consensus among all parties is being replaced by a diplomacy based on force, by either individuals or groups of allies. War is back in vogue and a zeal for war is spreading,\" Leo said in his Jan. 9 address. \"Peace is sought through weapons as a condition for asserting one's own dominion. This gravely threatens the rule of law, which is the foundation of all peaceful civil coexistence.\"   \n   Cupich said in a comment explaining the reasoning behind the archbishops' statement, \"As pastors entrusted with the teaching of our people, we cannot stand by while decisions are made that condemn millions to lives trapped permanently at the edge of existence,\" he said. \"Pope Leo has given us clear direction and we must apply his teachings to the conduct of our nation and its leaders.\"   \n",

He also did not vote for Trump in 2024.GREG HARDY: The thing that stuck out most to me was just his complete refusal to kind of address the affordability crisis, that on top of, you know, his attack on our immigrant population, the teetering towards war it seems that we're doing with Iran, talking around that. Yeah, definitely doesn't inspire hope in the way the country's going, currently.FADEL: John Edwards (ph), a Republican in Maryland, did vote for Trump.JOHN EDWARDS: He addressed many concerns that Americans have about the economy and, you know, cutting taxes for Americans and bringing us together and stopping wars, which is an amazing thing for any president to do.FADEL: He said the president's State of the Union was upbeat.EDWARDS: He's done a remarkable job in his position so far in his second term. And I think there's three more years of fantastic things that will come of his presidency. And I really pray that we all can get behind him. He's a great man.MARTÍNEZ: We heard from Rena Schulte (ph) on this program yesterday. She's a Democrat in Iowa who voted for Kamala Harris in 2024 who also worked with law enforcement for more than 17 years as an attorney. After the speech, she called in to say that the rosy image Trump painted, in her view, is not real.RENA SCHULTE: These are the darkest times I have witnessed in my lifetime. There's a lack of basic due process that never in my lifetime I thought I would ever witness, regardless of political affiliation.MARTÍNEZ: She says she's horrified by images of ICE agents taking people off the streets.SCHULTE: The address was like a bizarre pep rally rather than a serious reflection on the state of our nation. Instead of acknowledging the real pain division and fear that many families are experiencing, Donald Trump's speech focused on exaggerating and distorting visions of our country's past that don't really match the reality or the truth of what has happened or what is currently happening.FADEL: That was Rena Schulte in Iowa, John Edwards in Maryland and Greg Hardy in Florida.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

But for all of his second term, President Trump has voiced an openness to unprecedented involvement by the federal government in those state processes.   \n   He has also continued to push false claims about noncitizen voter fraud — including during Tuesday night's State of the Union address — and those in his orbit have openly discussed the potential of immigration enforcement at voting locations.   \"We're going to have ICE surround the polls come November,\" said former Trump adviser Steve Bannon on his podcast earlier this month. \"We're not going to sit here and allow you to steal the country again.\"   Shortly after, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked about those comments and she responded that she \"can't guarantee\" that an ICE agent wouldn't be around a polling location in November.   All of that has led to deep concern from voting officials from both major political parties, who say they are actively preparing for some sort of federal interference in this year's midterms, though they have been hard-pressed to say what that involvement would look like. Those concerns were heightened after the recent FBI raid of the elections hub in Fulton County, Ga., which appears directly tied to debunked claims about Trump's loss in 2020.   \n   On Wednesday's midterm preparations call — which included representatives from the Justice Department, DHS, the Postal Service and other federal agencies — multiple Democratic secretaries of state asked questions that alluded to that uncertainty.   California's secretary of state, Democrat Shirley Weber, asked Honey, the DHS official, whether states would have advance notice if ICE agents were sent to polling places.   Honey responded by saying such a premise was \"disinformation.\"   The promise is especially notable coming from Honey, who comes from the election denial grassroots that sprouted out of Trump's false election claims in 2020. Before her current post at DHS, she worked closely with Trump's former attorney Cleta Mitchell to spread misinformation about the reliability of the country's voting systems.\n",

In a letter first shared with NPR, ranking member Robert Garcia, D-Calif., is asking Attorney General Pam Bondi to explain why what appear to be dozens of pages of interviews and interview notes related to allegations of sexual abuse against President Trump were not among three million pages released in recent months.   \n   \"We are witnessing a White House cover-up of serious allegations against the president by a survivor,\" Garcia said in a statement to NPR. \"We demand Attorney General Pam Bondi come clean about why these documents are being hidden, comply with our legally binding subpoena by sharing all records, and tell the American people if their president is under investigation for allegations of sexual assault.\"   NPR's previous reporting found internal FBI and Justice Department outline documents related to allegations from a woman who, according to documents within the database, claimed that around 1983, when she was around 13 years old, Jeffrey Epstein introduced her to Trump, \"who subsequently forced her head down to his exposed penis which she subsequently bit. In response, Trump punched her in the head and kicked her out.\"   Records released last month show the FBI interviewed the woman four times, but only one of those interviews has been published in the Justice Department's public Epstein files database.   \"In response to these disturbing revelations, DOJ refused to address the specific reasons for the withholding of these materials, noting only that it is suppressing documents that are 'duplicates, privileged, or part of an ongoing federal investigation,'\" Garcia wrote in the letter.   \n   Garcia wrote that Bondi and the Justice Department have to explain why those documents have been withheld, and more specifically if there is an active investigation into the sexual abuse allegations against the president.   \"The American people demand transparency and accountability, and any further delay by the Department continues to deny justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's crimes,\" he wrote. \"DOJ must specify the exact grounds for the withholding of FBI interviews containing specific allegations against President Trump, as well as provide an update on the status of any ongoing investigations into allegations of sexual assault against President Trump.\"   The Justice Department has continued to defend its handling of the Epstein files release and offered differing responses to questions from NPR, other outlets and lawmakers.    Monday, a DOJ spokeswoman declined to answer questions on the record about these specific files, what's in them, and why they are not published. After NPR's report published Tuesday, the Justice Department reached out to NPR, taking issue with how its responses to questions were framed.    Justice Department spokeswoman Natalie Baldassarre reiterated DOJ's stance that any documents not published are privileged, duplicates or relate to an ongoing federal investigation.   Wednesday, a Justice Department X account said that they were reviewing discovery documents included in the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell and \"should any document be found to have been improperly tagged in the review process and is responsive to the Act, the Department will of course publish it, consistent with the law.\"   \n            As the Department of Justice has consistently said and has done since the January 30, 2026 publication of the Epstein files, if any member of the public, including victims, reported concerns with information in the pages, the Department would review, make any corrections, and…— DOJ Rapid Response (@DOJRR47) February 25, 2026\n   \n   When asked for comment earlier this week about the missing pages and the accusations against the president, a White House spokeswoman told NPR that Trump \"has done more for Epstein's victims than anyone before him.\"   \"Just as President Trump has said, he's been totally exonerated on anything relating to Epstein,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told NPR in a statement. \"And by releasing thousands of pages of documents, cooperating with the House Oversight Committee's subpoena request, signing the Epstein Files Transparency Act, and calling for more investigations into Epstein's Democrat friends, President Trump has done more for Epstein's victims than anyone before him. Meanwhile, Democrats like Hakeem Jeffries and Stacey Plaskett have yet to explain why they were soliciting money and meetings from Epstein after he was a convicted sex offender.\"   \n   Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have been investigating the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein files and the release of documents required by law. Garcia said yesterday a parallel investigation would be opened into these missing documents.   Have information to share about the Epstein files?

    "body": "\n      NPR's Leila Fadel asks political consultant Frank Luntz whether President Trump positioned his administration and Republicans to reach Independent voters in his State of the Union address.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Veteran pollster and political consultant Frank Luntz. He joins me now to take a closer look at how last night's address might have played with undecided or independent voters. Frank, thank you for joining us. Sorry about that.FRANK LUNTZ: Well, it's an honor. Thank you.FADEL: So going into this address, an NPR/PBS News/Marist poll found that two-thirds of independents say the State of the Union is not strong. Did the president's address hit a reset with independent voters who may have chose him in 2024 and no longer approve?LUNTZ: It was a speech to the Trump faithful from beginning to end. And, in fact, I tweeted out in the first two minutes just how unifying he was when the speech opened up. But that is not how the speech continued or ended. In the end, it was the most confrontational State of the Union that I've ever seen. And I think that's the challenge because independents have soured on politics, they've soured on the economy and, frankly, they've soured on the country.FADEL: You said it started out unifying and turned into what you saw as one of the most confrontational, or if - the most confrontational State of the Union address. What made it that way? And does the president not think he has to appeal to a larger part of America than just his core base?LUNTZ: I think he sees his core base as his electorate and that it is his responsibility to keep his promises to them, to address them, to let them know that they matter. And that's why they've stayed with him. But when you focus on independents, on people in the center, they're looking at affordability, and they believe it. They believe that prices have gone up for housing and health care. And the president spend a lot of time focusing on where prices have come down. But in the end, as one of those voters noted, perception is reality, and if you think prices are higher, you're going to punish the administration and the party in power.FADEL: So the midterms are coming up in eight months. Given the tone of the State of the Union address, do you think that he was able to appeal to a wider group of Americans at all, and will that hurt - the fact that you don't see it that way, will that hurt him and his party in the midterms?LUNTZ: In the end, the midterms have a lower turnout, and so you have to get your voters to the polls. And I do believe that the way the president agitated and the way that he framed his stuff - for example, when he asked people - asked members of Congress to stand up if you believe the American government is - primarily (ph) responsibility is to protect American citizens not illegal aliens, probably 80% of Americans would agree with that. So that was a very positive tone in turning out his voters.But people in the center are not looking for performance, they're looking for reality. And what they're asking of the president is to focus on these challenges and make things start to happen. I'm frightened for the democracy. To be really candid with you, this division is getting to the point where it's going to start to affect our day-to-day lives.FADEL: Say more about that - the tone of the speech. How do you see that translating into the day-to-day lives of Americans?LUNTZ: Well, I used to be a political consultant, and so I recognize the tactics that he used. And it was tactics that 20, 25 years ago I was recommending. But at a certain point, when I start to see people unable to talk to each other, unable to listen, the fact that 40% of Americans have actually lost friends and lost compatriots because things are so divisive, and half of Americans will no longer raise issues that they're concerned about because they're afraid of being canceled. When I see results like that, I get concerned. And this and the yelling on - from the representatives and the language that the president used, both of them were problematic. And I think problem is...FADEL: And you're referring to the Democrats yelling at the president during the speech?LUNTZ: That's correct. And I think at some point, we have to say, enough, with an exclamation point.FADEL: Beyond the divisions in this country, which are scary, when you think just strategically, does the president not think he needs Americans beyond his core base to win not just the midterms, but the next presidential election?LUNTZ: He should, and they all should. But I do want to emphasize for the people who listen to this show - because you have an incredible listening base - that they're not looking for the next election, that they're looking for the next generation, and they simply want these people to tone it down and get it done.FADEL: Pollster and political consultant Frank Luntz. Thank you, as always, for your time.LUNTZ: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      President Trump's State of the Union speech was a mix of the president touting his first-year record, slamming Democrats and creating made-for-TV moments.   \n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  President Trump addressed the nation last night at a critical moment in his presidency.LEILA FADEL, HOST:  During an almost two-hour State of the Union address, Trump was using a fair bit of exaggeration. He painted a nation that's in the early stages of a historic economic boom, though polls show most Americans disagree.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our nation is back, bigger, better, richer and stronger than ever before.FADEL: Like Republicans wanted, Trump focused much of his speech on the economy and affordability. He couldn't resist attacking political foes, though, calling Democrats crazy and blaming them for everything from rising health care costs to corruption without evidence. In a few moments, we'll ask a political consultant how Trump's message landed with independent voters. First, let's get more on the speech.MARTÍNEZ: NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez was up late watching the longest address ever to Congress. Franco, what stuck out to you?FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: Yeah, A. You know, I was struck by how much he stuck to the script, at least in the first hour of the address, which is really important because it's when the speech has its most viewers. Trump, as you noted, hit at all the notes the Republicans wanted him to hit on - the economy, housing costs, energy costs, drug prices. And, of course, ever the showman, Trump staged some key moments, you know, presenting the Medal of Honor to a 100-year-old veteran and trotting out the U.S. men's Olympic hockey team.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Here with us tonight is a group of winners who just made the entire nation proud, the men's gold-medal Olympic hockey team. Come on in.ORDOÑEZ: It was really a rare bipartisan moment of applause, even a standing ovation during, the speech.MARTÍNEZ: Now, the Supreme Court justices were sitting in front of him. Last week, they slapped down his tariff agenda. So I was wondering, Franco, what, if anything, he was going to say about them?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. Trump called the Supreme Court's ruling unfortunate and totally wrong, but he didn't actually get personal with the justices as he did last week. He actually even stopped to shake each of their hands as he walked in the room, which is, you know, quite the deliberate choice.MARTÍNEZ: Now, last year, during his congressional address, Democrats were criticized for holding up paddles with protest messages on them. So what kind of a pushback did he get this year?ORDOÑEZ: Well, at the very beginning, Congressman Al Green was escorted from the chamber for displaying a sign that read, Black people aren't apes, which, of course, is a clear reference to the racist video that Trump posted about the Obamas. But there were no paddles. Some Democrats chose to boycott, and you could see the empty seats. And there was some vitriol thrown back and forth when Trump spoke of immigration and accusations of fraud.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: But when it comes to the corruption that is plundering - it really - it's plundering America - there's been no more stunning example than Minnesota where members of the Somali community have pillaged an estimated $19 billion from the American taxpayer. Oh, we have all the information.UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: You're lying.ORDOÑEZ: And you can't really hear it so well on that tape, but Democrats started to yell out and call Trump a liar there.MARTÍNEZ: No, no, no. I was - I heard that, for sure, at the end there. Now, Franco, the U.S. might be on the verge of taking military action against Iran. Did he make a case to the American people for why this might be necessary?ORDOÑEZ: Well, he spent more time on hockey and the other staged moments, but near the end, he did speak of the Iranian regime killing thousands of protesters, you know, their nuclear ambitions and the threat that they may present building missiles - that he said, at least - will be soon able to reach the United States. But it wasn't really any new rationale for the strikes, which is concerning to a lot of Americans, including Republicans who were worried about the U.S. being drawn into a long and complicated conflict.MARTÍNEZ: That's NPR White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez. Thanks a lot.ORDOÑEZ: Thanks, A.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      President Trump spent a substantial portion of his State of the Union speech talking about the economy, including a vow to replace the tariffs the Supreme Court recently struck down.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  President Trump opened his State of the Union address by declaring a golden age of America.(SOUNDBITE OF STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It is indeed a turnaround for the ages.A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  That is not how many voters see things. Trump used the opportunity to defend his tariff policy, recently struck down by the Supreme Court, and celebrate last year's Republican tax cuts.FADEL: He also made familiar attacks on immigrants, and later, Democrats.(SOUNDBITE OF STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS)TRUMP: These people are crazy, I'm telling you.UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Vocalizing).TRUMP: They're crazy.MARTÍNEZ: In a few minutes, we'll hear about what might be next for the administration's immigration enforcement policies and the use of the military abroad. We start, though, with NPR's Scott Horsley, who was focusing on Trump's message about the economy.SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The president talked as if he had inherited a stagnant economy with record high inflation from the Democrats.(SOUNDBITE OF STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS)TRUMP: Their policies created the high prices. Our policies are rapidly ending them. We are doing really well. Those prices are plummeting downward.HORSLEY: Trump is trying to paint himself as some sort of turnaround artist here, but this just does not comport with the facts. Inflation has mostly moved sideways under President Trump, and in fact, his tariff policies pushed prices higher in some cases. GDP growth has actually slowed a little bit from the last year of the Biden administration, although it was pretty respectable at 2.2% last year. And then, of course, job growth has been much slower under this president than it was under his predecessor.MARTÍNEZ: Did he present any new economic policies?HORSLEY: He did. He talked about how half of all working Americans don't have a retirement plan right now where their bosses can contribute to match what they put in. So he says he wants to come up with a new type of plan.(SOUNDBITE OF STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS)TRUMP: To remedy this gross disparity, I'm announcing that next year, my administration will give these often forgotten American workers - great people. The people that built our country - access to the same type of retirement plan offered to every federal worker. We will match your contribution with up to $1,000 each year.HORSLEY: Now, of course, that would take help from Congress, and he didn't talk about where the money would come from. Trump also doubled down on his tariff policies just days after the Supreme Court had struck down about half of his import levies. Of course, he did so with some of the justices who ruled against him in that case sitting right in front of him.He also said that even with some of those tariffs now outlawed, the trade deals with other countries that he managed to negotiate using those tariffs aren't going anywhere because, he says, those countries are afraid of getting an even worse deal later.(SOUNDBITE OF STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS)TRUMP: But the good news is that almost all countries and corporations want to keep the deal that they already made - right, Scott? - knowing that the legal power that I, as president, have to make a new deal could be far worse for them.HORSLEY: The Scott the president's talking to there is Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. We have actually yet to see a lot of dividends from those trade deals. U.S. exports were up only marginally last year. Farm exports were down, and the overall trade deficit barely budged from 2024.MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. And, Scott, I know that he is not a big fan of the word affordability. Did he say anything about affordability in the State of the Union?HORSLEY: He did. He listed a few items where prices have come down - notably eggs and gasoline. He didn't dwell on things that have gotten more expensive, like natural gas and electricity. One of the things that's driving high electricity prices these days is increased demand from data centers. And Trump did say he has a plan to make tech companies building all those data centers cover the cost of that power so it's not borne by local ratepayers. He called that the ratepayer protection pledge.(SOUNDBITE OF STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS)TRUMP: We're telling the major tech companies that they have the obligation to provide for their own power needs. They can build their own power plants as part of their factory, so that no one's prices will go up, and in many cases, prices of electricity will go down for the community, and very substantially downHORSLEY: Now, he was short on specifics, but this does address a real political liability. Electricity prices were up more than 6% in the last year - more than double the overall rate of inflation.MARTÍNEZ: That's NPR's Scott Horsley. Scott, thanks a lot.HORSLEY: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Trump often points to his change to taxes on tips as an example of how he's trying to mitigate rising costs — and address voters' concerns.    Garrett Watson, at the Tax Foundation, said refunds will be higher on average this year for the middle class. Watson pointed to these new tax policies Trump campaigned on just over a year ago: tax breaks on tipped income, overtime pay and social security benefits.    \n   \"Often we see federal taxes, it's more slow going,\" Watson said. \"That contrasts with a lot of these new ideas, which very much were brand new, in their infancy, and were created in the context of the 2024 campaign.\"   Trump first coined the phrase \"no tax on tips\" in Las Vegas. Then-candidate Vice President Kamala Harris quickly endorsed the campaign promise. And during Trump's first year in office, the GOP-controlled Congress passed a tax deduction of up to $25,000 for tipped wages in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.   This new tax deduction leaves tipped workers — who make up 12% of the U.S. workforce according to a TurboTax survey — wondering how to get this new deduction, whether they qualify, and if it will make a financial difference.     \n   \"There's a lot of confusion or popular misperception, as there always is, with tax changes and new items,\" Watson said.   Tipped workers expect relief   Ashlee Armstrong is a waitress, wife and mother of three.   She waits tables and greets travelers at the local airport in Kalispell, Mont. — southwest of Glacier National Park.    Tips make up a significant portion of her annual wage, which Armstrong estimates at $85,000. This year, she's looking forward to tax season.   \"If I have $25,000 taken off of that, it will impact me,\" Armstrong said.    For Armstrong, the tip deduction will keep her family from jumping up into a higher tax bracket — one she can't afford. And she's not alone.    \n   In Cambridge, Mass., bartender Joe McGuirk, 60, expects a bigger-than-normal tax break.    \"It will probably end up being a boon to me,\" McGuirk said. \"I have one friend who's already started doing the taxes. It appears that he'll be getting about $5,800 back as opposed to the $1,500 he might have gotten back last year.\"   Still, McGuirk — who has tended bars for 35 years — said he doesn't think this year's tax break will meaningfully change his financial situation.    \"With the cost of everything going up, this obviously will help me,\" he said. \"With that said, other trends in our society make it, you know, it's really like using a spoon to deal with a flood.\"   Housing in Cambridge is his biggest financial pressure, but it wasn't always.    \"There's a lot of work for me here,\" he said. \"Good work that for decades allowed me to keep a roof over my head and get two kids through college. Now, my income is not commensurate with housing costs.\"   \n   Back in Kalispell, the biggest cost for Armstrong is health care.   \"It's huge,\" she said. \"My daughter was having an asthma situation and had to stay in the children's hospital ward for three days. And we don't qualify for scholarships because we make too much, but we don't make enough that we can actually afford those kind of bills.\"   Armstrong is the only one in her family with health insurance — through her job. Her kids and husband pay out of pocket for medical costs.    \n   \"We're middle class and we're also not wealthy enough that we can afford, you know, to pay insurance monthly,\" Armstrong said.   How it works and who qualifies   For those who do file for the benefit, it's up to the employees — not the employer — to separate out tips from other wages on their tax forms this year, according to Lisa Greene-Lewis, a CPA and tax expert at TurboTax. The Treasury Department is not requiring employers to do that as taxpayers and businesses transition to the tax law changes.    \n   While some employers will separate tips from other wages, Greene-Lewis said it's up to tipped workers and their accountants to double check their tipped earnings and then report the deduction.    She said tax platforms have added a section for tipped workers this year.   Greene-Lewis recommended adding up all the tips earned on paystubs to make sure no tips are missed. While it's added work, Greene-Lewis said TurboTax data shows it'll be worth it.   \"We are seeing that people will see an increased refund of up to $1,000 or lower balance due ... compared to last year\" Greene-Lewis said. \"So I would definitely take advantage of these.\"   As for eligibility, the Treasury Department issued guidance on the jobs that qualify for the tip $25,000 deduction: bartenders, waiters, beauticians, ride share drivers, baristas. etc. Workers who make over $150,000 annually can't deduct tips from their taxable income.    Treasury Department and White House officials did not respond to requests for an interview on the new tip deduction.   Will it last?    In Las Vegas, Starbucks barista Yolanda Garcia said she expects to get a financial bump this tax season — but nothing major.     \"I think it's going to help a little, but it's not much because you're going to get something once a year,\" Garcia said.    \n   Garcia and her husband support two daughters. For her family, rising grocery prices is the chief concern.   \"I used to go to for groceries like every single week,\" Garcia said. \"Now, I go like every two weeks, and now I buy like the necessities, not the things that I want.\"   Both Garcia and McGuirk in Cambridge said this new tax benefit could make a real difference if it was permanent. As it stands, the tax deduction on tips expires in 2028.   \n   \"Even if it is boon to me, it's nothing I can count on except for the next three years,\" McGuirk said. \n",

Today's top stories   NPR's senior political editor/correspondent Domenico Montanaro joins the newsletter today to break down the State of the Union address.   President Trump has been facing difficult poll numbers, tied to the economy, specifically prices and the cost of living. But in his first State of the Union address of his second term, Trump ignored those economic warts.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Donald Trump delivers his State of the Union address during a Joint Session of Congress at the U.S. Capitol on February 24.\n                \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Instead, he boasted that \"our nation is back\" and that it had achieved a \"turnaround for the ages.\" It all amounted to a long speech — record-setting, in fact — that hit familiar Trump notes on immigration and culture, with a healthy amount of the usual showmanship.   Here are five takeaways from the speech:   Trump ignored the difficulties people are facing with the economy. Voters continue to say it's their top concern, but Trump had no \"I feel your pain\" moment. And he doubled down on his unpopular tariffs, criticizing Supreme Court justices sitting feet away for ruling that most of his tariffs were illegal.The midterm message is … what Trump talks about all the time. Gory stories of immigrants causing crime and the culture wars. It's a tactic long employed by Trump, the GOP and conservative media. His message worked in 2024, but now he owns the economy and has a record on immigration.There was no legislative agenda. There was no laundry list of things Trump wants Congress to do this year. No surprise, given that Trump has spent the better part of the last year trying to consolidate power.The Democratic response had a wide range. From outbursts, silent stares and boycotts to Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger's official response, which was sharply focused on the economy, Democrats will have a choice to make on which direction the party will go. But not in 2026, with midterm elections so heavily focused on Trump.None of this will likely matter much politically because views of Trump are \"baked in.\" Views of Trump haven't changed much in the last decade, and they likely won't as a result of this speech. Trump used prime time to put on a show, from gold medals to medals of honor, and the show will go on for roughly three more years.   \n   For more up-to-date politics news, sign up for our politics newsletter here.   The House of Representatives narrowly rejected a bipartisan aviation safety bill yesterday. Lawmakers developed the proposed legislation, called the ROTOR Act, after a U.S. Army helicopter and a passenger jet collided midair near Washington, D.C. last year, killing 67 people. Safety investigators and the victims' families backed the bill, yet the Pentagon withdrew its support just before the vote.    🎧 The act would mandate wider u,se of ADS-B in and ADS-B out, a safety system that transmits an aircraft's location to other aircraft, NPR's Joel Rose tells Up First. The National Transportation Safety Board said the technology could have prevented the deadly midair collision near Washington by giving pilots more warning and time to react. Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said that the bill could create \"unresolved budgetary burdens and operational security risks.\" Parnell didn't clarify what those risks are. Rose says these concerns appear new, as the Pentagon backed the bill when it passed the Senate unanimously in December. The act's sponsors say they plan to push for another vote in the House.   Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is threatening to blacklist Anthropic after the artificial intelligence company refused to loosen its safety standards for the military. During a meeting with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Hegseth vowed to punish the company for denying the Trump administration's demands, according to two people with direct knowledge of the meeting who were not authorized to speak publicly. One person said that Hegseth suggested the Pentagon could cancel Anthropic's $200 million contract. A Pentagon official said repercussions could include the government seizing Anthropic's AI tools for use against the company's will.   \n   Deep dive   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The front lobby of the Miami Immigration Court seen on Jan. 28, 2026 in Miami, Florida.\n                \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The Trump administration fired nearly 100 judges in 2025 as part of a larger push to reshape U.S. immigration courts. These firings, as well as resignations, shrunk the number of judges in the nation's immigration courts by about a quarter in the last year, even when accounting for new hires. The Justice Department Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) lost more than 400 legal assistants, attorney advisers and legal administrative specialists, according to data NPR obtained and verified. While the administration defends its personnel decisions as a necessary correction to \"lenient\" asylum rulings, the drain has crushed staff morale, bloated backlogs and left the due process system floundering.    ➡️ The staff left behind say that the current justice system is fundamentally different from what it was a year ago. One visible change is in the work environment. People in bureaucratic roles witnessed immigration and customs officers violently arresting people in the court hallways. Some judges also say they feel pressure to align case decisions with the administration's priorities.➡️ Although the majority of courts across the U.S. have lost judges, the impact hasn't been spread evenly. The Trump administration onboarded 17 new permanent judges, but assigned only one to a court that lost the majority of its judges.➡️ Smaller courts have felt the biggest impact of personnel shrinkage. Fourteen are now operating with two or fewer permanent judges.

He channels this horror into his latest album, titled Perseverantia. The 11-part suite for piano and strings combines classical and jazz, capturing the sounds of war, empathy and hope. In an interview with Morning Edition, Neselovskyi explained that, despite how music plays a big part in his life, he was unable to play for three weeks after the Russian invasion. When he finally approached the piano, he played brutal chords that later became the basis of the suite's second movement, \"Tanks Near Kyiv.\" That is when he realized that instrumental music could deliver a message that words couldn't.

Trump's call for an abrupt end to negotiations could further inflame trade tensions that already have been building between the two neighboring countries for months.   Trump posted, \"The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs.\"   \n   \"The ad was for $75,000. They only did this to interfere with the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, and other courts,\" Trump wrote on his social media site. \"TARIFFS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY, AND ECONOMY, OF THE U.S.A. Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED.\"   Carney's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The prime minister was set to leave Friday morning for a summit in Asia, while Trump is set to do the same Friday evening.   Earlier Thursday night, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute posted on X that an ad created by the government of Ontario \"misrepresents the 'Presidential Radio Address to the Nation on Free and Fair Trade' dated April 25, 1987.\" It added that Ontario did not receive foundation permission \"to use and edit the remarks.\"   The foundation said it is \"reviewing legal options in this matter\" and invited the public to watch the unedited video of Reagan's address.   Carney met with Trump earlier this month to try to ease trade tensions, as the two countries and Mexico prepare for a review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement — a trade deal Trump negotiated in his first term, but has since soured on.   \n   More than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the U.S., and nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border daily.   Trump said earlier this week that he had seen the ad on television and said that it showed that his tariffs were having an impact.   \"I saw an ad last night from Canada. If I was Canada, I'd take that same ad also,\" he said then.   In his own post on X last week, Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, posted a link to the ad and the message: \"It's official: Ontario's new advertising campaign in the U.S. has launched.\"   \n   He continued, \"Using every tool we have, we'll never stop making the case against American tariffs on Canada. The way to prosperity is by working together.\"   A spokesperson for Ford didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night. But Ford previously got Trump's attention with an electricity surcharge to U.S. states. Trump responded by doubling steel and aluminum tariffs.   The president has moved to impose steep U.S. tariffs on many goods from Canada. In April, Canada's government imposed retaliatory levies on certain U.S. goods -- but it carved out exemptions for some automakers to bring specific numbers of vehicles into the country, known as remission quotas.   \n   Trump's tariffs have especially hurt Canada's auto sector, much of which is based in Ontario. This month, Stellantis said it would move a production line from Ontario to Illinois.\n",

So Weeks was shocked and dismayed when she learned President Trump was looking to import more beef from another country.   \" It feels like a slap in the face to rural America,\" she said. \"It makes you feel invisible and overlooked.\"   Beef prices have been soaring in the U.S. as a result of a shrunken cattle supply. On Sunday, Trump suggested buying beef from Argentina could be one way to lower costs. It comes as the president already agreed to a $20 billion currency swap to boost the South American ally's struggling economy.   \n   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Destinee Weeks said her husband's farm in northern Oklahoma has been in his family for over a hundred years. Her dream is to one day pass down the farm and ranch to their children.\n                \n                    Destinee Weeks\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Destinee Weeks\n    \n\n   \n   American cattle ranchers and agricultural groups swiftly opposed the possible deal, arguing that it would hurt ranchers. But Trump defended the move while talking to reporters on Sunday, asserting that \"Argentina is fighting for its life.\" He also claimed on Truth Social that his global tariffs have helped ranchers.   \"The Cattle Ranchers, who I love, don't understand that the only reason they are doing so well, for the first time in decades, is because I put Tariffs on cattle coming into the United States,\" Trump wrote in his Wednesday post.   Despite days of verbal clashes between president and ranchers, the White House on Wednesday confirmed plans to quadruple the tariff-rate quota for beef imports from Argentina. The same day, the Department of Agriculture announced an action plan to support domestic cattle ranchers.   The United States Cattlemen's Association said the USDA's initiative was a positive step forward, but the group was still \"deeply concerned\" about the move to purchase more foreign beef.   \"A deal of this magnitude with Argentina would undercut the very foundation of our cattle industry,\" USCA president Justin Tupper said in a statement.   Cattle ranchers say it's not their fault that prices are high   The U.S. cattle inventory is at its lowest levels in decades — a trend driven by drought and rising operation costs, which has forced many ranchers to shrink their herds.   \n   In August, the cost of ground beef per pound was about $6.63 — about two dollars more than it was four years ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. At the same time, higher prices have offered a path to recovery for some ranchers like Weeks.   \"I wanna make it very clear, when we say it's profitable, no one's riding off into the sunset in a yacht,\" she said. \"We're healing up.\"   \n   Meanwhile, some ranchers argue there's another key player shaping beef prices: the four meatpacking firms that control over 80% of U.S. beef processing.   \" The American rancher is not in control of the price of beef in this country,\" said Christian Lovell, an Illinois cattle producer and senior director of programs at Farm Action, a nonpartisan advocacy group.   Recently, two of those companies — Tyson Foods and Cargill — agreed to pay a combined $87.5 million to settle a class-action lawsuit accusing them of fixing beef prices. It's a big reason why Lovell called the cattle market \"broken.\"   \"Importing more beef is not going to fix that problem,\" he said.   Some are skeptical that importing Argentine beef will lower prices   The U.S. already imports a record amount of beef from other countries, including Argentina, according to David Anderson, a livestock economist at Texas A&M University.   The challenge with relying on foreign meat to bring down prices is that the U.S. is the world's largest consumer of beef. Anderson said it's unlikely that Argentina has nearly enough supply to satisfy America's appetite.   \"They just don't have the kind of supplies that they could export to us that would make much of a noticeable impact on U.S. beef prices to consumers,\" he said.   Anderson added that ultimately, it will take time for beef prices to stabilize.   \"There's no easy solution to bringing down prices — particularly an easy, quick solution,\" he said.   \n   The moves comes after a fallout with other farmers    John Boyd Jr., a cattle and crop farmer in Virginia and the founder of the National Black Farmers Association, has already been reeling from Trump's trade war with China, which has caused it to stop buying U.S. soybeans. Now, Boyd is concerned about his cattle business.   \"Everything that the president is messing with and interfering with affects my farming operation,\" he said.   The USDA on Wednesday responded to the ranchers' concerns by laying out a slew of plans to strengthen the country's beef industry. That includes expanding grazing access and bolstering natural disaster relief.   \n   Still, Boyd said purchasing more meat from Argentina does not sit right with him.   \"I'm opposed to Argentina getting anything else from the United States,\" he said.   These clashes are particularly notable because farmers and ranchers are a major voting bloc for Trump. Weeks, from Oklahoma, said she simply wants the president to stick to his agenda of putting America first.   \"I think that we should always choose to support our domestic producers,\" she said.\n",

One of the failed bills was a Republican-backed measure to allow employees who are deemed essential to receive a paycheck during a shutdown. Those workers, including troops, TSA agents and federal law enforcement like the Capitol Police, are currently working without pay.   An alternate version introduced by Democrats called for paying all federal employees – and blocking more mass layoffs by the Trump administration's Office of Management and Budget during the shutdown.   \n   \"We certainly shouldn't set up a system where the president of the United States gets to decide what agencies to shut down, who to pay and who not to pay, who to punish, who not to punish,\" said the sponsor of that bill, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md.   \n   Earlier this month, the White House fired several thousand federal employees, a move the courts later put on hold.   \"I don't think we should limit the president's ability, the chief executive's ability, to properly manage the federal government, and make the tough decisions sometimes to reduce the workforce,\" said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., who introduced the GOP funding measure.   The Republican-backed measure did not receive the 60 votes needed to pass. Republicans blocked the Democrats' version from a vote.   The names themselves of the rival proposals highlight the growing tensions between Democrats and Republicans as the shutdown stretches on. Republicans named their measure, \"The Shutdown Fairness Act.\" Democrats titled theirs the, \"True Shutdown Fairness Act.\"   During a Thursday press conference, House Republicans called attention to air traffic controllers who are working without pay.   \"We are all about safety,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said. \"But I can't guarantee you that your flight's going to be on time. I can't guarantee you that your flight's not going to be cancelled.\"   \n   The federal government has now been closed for 23 days, the second-longest in U.S. history and the longest full shutdown.   \n   Senate Republicans want to advance a House-passed bill that would temporarily fund the government at current levels, while Democrats are holding out for a deal to extend health insurance subsidies expiring soon.   Many Republican lawmakers think Thanksgiving travel headaches will be a tipping point for Democrats. Democrats are also under pressure as states are beginning to announce that funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Program, known as SNAP or food stamps, will run out soon.   Democrats have also said that premium spikes during the open enrollment period beginning Nov. 1 for health plans purchased on the Affordable Care Act marketplace will push Republicans to budge.   The Senate has now voted 12 times on the Republican-backed funding bill. The House has not held votes for several weeks, and senators are preparing to leave town for the weekend.   Top congressional leaders, Republican and Democrat, say they are no closer to agreeing to a path to reopen the government.\n",

After a two-hour wait, Wanda Bright had finally reached the front of the line — just as the first batch of supplies ran out.   The Capital Area Food Bank had started the day with 300 boxes, enough for 150 government employees to receive two boxes each. It turned out that the need was even greater.   Fortunately, reinforcements had been called in, and cheers erupted as a second truck backed into the shopping center parking lot. Bright sighed with relief as volunteers handed over bread and other provisions to help get her family through the week.   \n   \"A lot of us are stressed, and it takes a toll on our mental health,\" says Bright, one of an estimated 700,000 federal workers across the U.S. now furloughed, meaning they are not working at the moment. \"Some people can handle this. A lot of people cannot.\"   For many federal workers, Friday is supposed to be payday. Instead, they are getting nothing. No partial pay. No sign of when their paychecks might resume.   Meanwhile, the Trump administration has managed to move money around to ensure that some people get paid, particularly those doing work deemed critical to President Trump's priorities.   \"We got the people that we want paid, paid, OK?\" Trump said at the White House last week.   1.4 million going without pay   Altogether, about 1.4 million civilian federal employees across the country are going without pay, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank in Washington, D.C. Roughly half of them are furloughed. The other half has been deemed essential and so is continuing to work.   For many people in both groups, the lapse in congressional appropriations has brought on new financial strain in a year that has already been tough.   \n   \"This whole fiscal year — 2025 — I was worried about my job, worried about getting RIF'd,\" says Jay, a furloughed worker from the National Institutes of Health, referring to the reductions in force, or layoffs, that have already hit a number of agencies. \"It was draining, emotionally draining. Now the reality is setting in when you're not getting checks and you need to provide for your family.\"   Jay, who asked to be identified by only his first name out of fear of losing his job, carried his two boxes away from the food distribution site in a stroller. He has a 1-year-old and a 5-year-old waiting for him at home.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Pastor Oliver Carter explains the procedures for the food distribution to federal workers in line in Hyattsville.\n                \n                    Tyrone Turner/WAMU\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Tyrone Turner/WAMU\n    \n\n   \n   In Tampa, Fla., Tierra Carter is still going to work, answering calls placed to the Social Security Administration's 1-800 number. Carter, who serves as a union representative with the American Federation of Government Employees, says the lack of a paycheck has forced her to take out loans and seek a hardship withdrawal from her 401(k).   \n   \"I kind of feel like I'm in a pool and I'm trying to swim to the top, but every time I get to the middle, I'm getting knocked back down,\" she says.   Offering help to pay the bills   Many federal workers earn less than $90,000 a year — 43%, according to an analysis of March 2024 government data by the Pew Research Center. Even those earning more could see bills pile up quickly.   Credit unions, where many federal workers do their banking, have started providing some financial relief. By Wednesday, Iowa-based Veridian Credit Union had already approved more than $55,000 in \"Government Advance Loans\" — short-term, interest-free loans — for 32 members affected by the shutdown. It had also processed 80 no-fee \"Delay-a-Pays\" for members. Similarly, Denver-based Westerra Credit Union and Redwood Credit Union in Northern California have each already provided nearly $100,000 in short-term, interest-free loans to members, with more applications coming in every day.   \n   In Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia, the Community Services Agency of the Metropolitan Washington Council, AFL-CIO, has been providing emergency financial support through its Federal Worker Solidarity Fund since February. But in recent days, requests for help with groceries, rent, mortgage payments and utility bills have soared, says Sig Meilus, the organization's director.   Thursday morning, Meilus woke up to 20 new applications for assistance that had come into her inbox overnight. With no end to the shutdown in sight, she expects the trend to continue.   \"Which also means that, unfortunately, our funds are dwindling quickly,\" she says.   Shutdown begins to impact communities   Because roughly two-thirds of the civilian federal workforce is still working despite the lapse in annual appropriations, the shutdown may not be all that apparent to a lot of Americans.   But the longer it drags on, the more the public will begin to feel its economic effects, says Shai Akabas, vice president of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.   \n   Already, Akabas says, there might be a grocery store next to a federal building that's not getting as much foot traffic, or a day care that's seeing fewer children show up because their parents are furloughed. Over time, communities that have higher densities of federal workers could see less spending overall.   \"Not everybody feels it yet, but it's actually affecting the broader economy,\" Akabas says.   While Congress passed a law in 2019 ensuring back pay for federal employees after a shutdown ends, Trump suggested recently that furloughed workers shouldn't count on it.   \"We're going to see,\" Trump said a week into the shutdown. \"Most of them are going to get back pay, and we're going to try and make sure of that. But some of them are being hurt very badly by the Democrats and they therefore won't qualify.\"   Trump administration finds ways to pay some federal workers   Across the government, many federal workers are still getting paid as usual during the shutdown. Salaries for some federal employees, including the vast majority of those at the Department of Veterans Affairs, do not come out of appropriations that Congress must approve every year.   In recent weeks, the Trump administration has also engaged in what the director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, called \"budgetary twister\" in an interview on The Charlie Kirk Show.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Customs and Border Protection agents stand outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland, Ore., on Oct. 4.\n                \n                    Jenny Kane/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jenny Kane/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Active-duty military personnel got their paychecks on schedule last week, after the Defense Department dipped into its unused research and development funds to find the money.   Some 70,000 law enforcement officers with the Department of Homeland Security are also now being paid from funds allocated to the department in Trump's tax-and-spending bill last summer. Yet many of their own colleagues are not getting paid — and likely won't be until the shutdown is over — creating an unequal playing field among federal employees that grows more slanted as the shutdown continues.\n",

Today's top stories   Close to a million and a half federal workers across the U.S. are going without pay today as the government enters day 24 of the shutdown. Yesterday, the Senate blocked dueling bills to pay federal employees. The Republican bill would have paid the people still working despite the shutdown. The Democratic option would have paid everybody, including furloughed workers.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A woman walks past a sign indicating the National Gallery of Art is closed as the US government continues its shutdown Oct. 6 in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Tierra Carter, who works at the Social Security Administration, tells NPR's Andrea Hsu that she's had to take out loans and seek a hardship withdrawal from her 401(k) due to the shutdown. Carter says it feels as if she is trying to swim to the top of a pool, but every time she gets to the middle, she is knocked back down. Hsu tells Up First that if the shutdown continues, experts believe the general public will begin to feel the economic effects in their communities. Grocery stores near federal buildings are already experiencing less foot traffic.   Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier were among the more than 30 people arrested yesterday in an FBI investigation into illegal gambling. The arrests stem from their alleged involvement in two major schemes: one involving bets placed on NBA games and the other concerning underground poker games. Billups and Rozier have been placed on leave.    \n   🎧 This case is a big deal because the scandal involves leaks from multiple teams and players or coaches allegedly sharing non-public information with gamblers, says NPR's Becky Sullivan. The scheme came to light thanks to monitoring services that track bets and look for unusual patterns. For example, Rozier allegedly told a friend he would withdraw from a game with an injury, which led that friend to sell the information to a gambler. As a result, organized bettors placed about a quarter of a million dollars on proposition bets predicting Rozier would underperform.   This week, the Trump administration announced new sanctions on Russia aimed at bringing Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table to end the war in Ukraine. The sanctions target two oil giants, Rosneft and Lukoil, which make up nearly half of Russian oil exports, according to NPR's Charles Maynes. This move to sanction comes after President Trump reversed his decision after initially saying he would hold another summit meeting with Putin.    🎧 The sanctions are significant as they mark the first time Trump has followed through on threats to hold Russia accountable for the war, Maynes says. The idea for the summit came after a phone call Putin initiated with Trump. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was set to meet with Trump about the possibility of the U.S. providing Ukraine with long-range weapons. Trump decided not to give the weapons to Ukraine and said he'd meet with Putin instead. Putin informed reporters last night that the canceled meeting and sanctions undermined recent progress in restoring relations with the U.S.   \n   Today's listen   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Members of a youth orchestra outside Kyiv perform a composition they wrote about the sounds of the war in Ukraine at night.\n                \n                    Hanna Palamarenko/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Hanna Palamarenko/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   The lives of Ukrainians have changed in many ways since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, including the way nighttime sounds.

But he said he did not think the administration would ask for a declaration of war.\n                \n                    Alex Wong/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Wong/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The U.S. military carried out two more strikes on alleged drug boats this week. The attacks were not in the Caribbean Sea but in the eastern Pacific Ocean, signaling an expansion of the Trump administration's campaign against drug trafficking from South America.   Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted a video on X of a blue speedboat skipping along the ocean waters before being hit and then bursting into flames.   \"Just as Al Qaeda waged war on our homeland, these cartels are waging war on our border and our people,\" Hegseth wrote in the Wednesday message. \"There will be no refuge or forgiveness — only justice.\"   \n   The strikes represented the eighth and ninth known boat attacks, which have killed at least 37 people. The Trump administration has yet to provide public evidence to support its assertions that the individuals on the boats were cartel members and that the vessels were transporting drugs, raising concerns about the legality of the strikes and the real goals of the White House campaign.   Prior to the strikes in the Pacific, the U.S. military had been ramping up the number of troops and naval ships in the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Venezuela. International law experts say it's an unprecedented amount of military hardware to confront suspected drug boats, which has fueled questions about whether the operation is about countering narcotics trafficking or instead toppling Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.   \n   \"It's such overkill in this naval deployment that there could be no justification if all the United States is trying to do is to attack a couple of small boats and intimidate drug traffickers,\" said Benjamin Gedan, who led the Venezuela portfolio at the Obama White House. \"It's either a bluff meant to scare the pants off the Venezuelan generals and encourage them to rise up and remove the president … or actual preparations for some sort of war with Venezuela.\"   \n   Trump has insisted that he has the legal authority to launch the attacks in international waters, calling it a national security issue to save American lives.   During a meeting on Wednesday with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, Trump boasted about expanded use of force.   \"They had one today in the Pacific. And the way I look at it, every time I look because it is violent and it is very — it's amazing, the weaponry,\" he said. \"They have these boats that go 45, 50 miles an hour in the water, and when you look at the accuracy and the power. Look, we have the greatest military in the world.\"   He asserted that his actions are saving the lives of tens of thousands of Americans without providing evidence. He also said the U.S. may likely conduct strikes on land next.   \"We will hit them very hard when they come in by land,\" he said. \"We're totally prepared to do that. And we'll probably go back to Congress and explain exactly what we're doing when we come to the land.\"   Some lawmakers are raising concerns    The power to declare war rests with Congress, not the White House.   After the al-Qaida attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, Congress passed an authorization for use of military force, granting the president the ability to use the U.S. military against the terrorist group responsible for the attacks.   The Trump administration has designated several South and Central American drug cartels and gangs as foreign terrorist organizations, but Congress has not authorized the use of force against them.   Lawmakers — Democrats and some Republicans — have expressed concerns that the strikes on suspected drug boats violate domestic and international laws.   \n   Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky charged that Trump has set a new precedent of shoot first, ask questions later.   \"The idea of indiscriminately killing people without knowing their names, without seeing any evidence, without making a formal accusation or without collecting evidence,\" he said. \"It's kind of ironic that we think these people are so dangerous, we're going to kill them without any information.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., is among those in Congress raising questions about the Trump administration's strikes on alleged drug boats. \"It's kind of ironic that we think these people are so dangerous, we're going to kill them without any information,\" he says. Pictured here is Paul on Capitol Hill on June 26.\n                \n                    Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   At the White House on Thursday, Trump said he thinks lawmakers will support his administration's efforts, but when asked why he wouldn't just ask Congress for a declaration of war, he said: \"I don't think we're going necessarily to ask for a declaration of war. I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. OK. We're going to kill them. They're going to be, like, dead.\"   \n   The Trump administration has given few specifics about its legal justification for the military strikes other than that the president is taking action under his Article II powers as commander in chief and as a defensive measure.   In a notification to Congress last month, the administration said the president has determined that unspecified cartels are nonstate armed groups and that their actions amount to an \"armed attack\" on the United States.   The administration also said Trump has determined that the U.S. is in an armed conflict with nonstate actors — cartels in South America — and that the Defense Department is conducting operations against them pursuant to the laws of armed conflict.   Questions about the legality of the strikes    But legal experts say the administration's justification is full of holes.   \"What this boils down to is the president of the United States asserting a prerogative to kill people based solely on his own say-so,\" said Brian Finucane, a former legal adviser for the State Department.   Finucane, who is now with the International Crisis Group, says the pivotal legal conclusions \"are simply reached by executive fiat,\" thus \"making it permissible for the president to engage in premeditated killing.\"   \"Outside of armed conflict, there is a word for the premeditated killing of people, and that word is 'murder,'\" he said. \"And just because the administration puts together this fig leaf of a legal justification does not legitimize these premeditated killings in the Caribbean.\"   It's not just Venezuela that feels targeted. The latest strikes raised particular concerns in Colombia, which has coastlines on both the Caribbean and Pacific.   Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the U.S. of murder and charged that some of the strikes killed Colombians. Trump responded by announcing that he would stop aid payments to Colombia.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Colombian President Gustavo Petro speaks during the United Nations General Assembly in New York City on Sept. 23. Petro has said that some of the U.S. strikes have killed Colombians.\n                \n                    Leonardo Munoz/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Leonardo Munoz/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"They're not going to get away with it much longer,\" Trump said on Thursday. \"We're not going to put up with it much longer. Colombia is very bad.\"   \n   This week, a group of independent United Nations experts said even if the boats are transporting drugs, as the White House asserts, \"the use of lethal force in international waters without proper legal basis violates international law of the sea and amounts to extrajudicial executions.\"   \"These moves are an extremely dangerous escalation with grave implications for peace and security in the Caribbean region,\" wrote the experts, who are appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council.   On Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio largely listened as Trump sparred with reporters about his legal authority and allowing Congress to weigh in.   \n   When Trump turned to his top adviser on foreign policy for his thoughts, Rubio was blunt.   \"Bottom line, these are drug boats,\" he said. \"If people want to stop seeing drug boats blow up, stop sending drugs to the United States.\"   Claudia Grisales contributed reporting. \n",

About 1 in 8 U.S. residents get an average of $187 a month through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. One of those people is Shari Jablonowski. The 66-year-old widow, who lives outside Pittsburgh, is bracing to lose the $291 in food aid her disabled nephew gets each month. She raised her now-adult nephew and two nieces as her own, and even without this looming crisis, her budget is a tightrope.   \n   \"This month, I could not afford to pay … anything, gas or electric,\" she says. Instead she paid her monthly car payment, since she needs to drive to doctors' appointments, visit her mother, and one niece uses the car to get to work.   \n   If her nephew's food benefit disappears in November? \"I am very concerned I will not have heat,\" she says. It would also ruin Thanksgiving.   SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, is the country's largest anti-hunger program.   \n   \"The vast majority are children, working people, older Americans, veterans and people with disabilities,\" Joel Berg, CEO of Hunger Free America, says of food stamp recipients. \"If the SNAP program shuts down, we will have the most mass hunger suffering we've had in America since the Great Depression.\"   For most people, SNAP is the only money they get directly. Cash welfare was dramatically reduced in the 1990s, Berg notes, and Medicaid payments go directly to doctors, hospitals and drug companies.\"The only thing that really helps moderate income and low-income Americans meet their basic monthly expenses is the SNAP program. And that's why it's so vital, not only in terms of fighting hunger, but just keeping tens of millions of Americans afloat each month,\" he says.   \n   In addition, a separate nutrition program for 7 million pregnant women and new parents is also at risk of running out of money. The Trump administration tapped $300 million in tariff funds to keep WIC — the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children — afloat, but it's expected to run out within a few weeks. Some states say they'll help fill that funding gap, but not all have the resources for that.   There's pressure on USDA to keep funding SNAP   Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has warned that SNAP funding will run out on Nov. 1, and USDA has told states that payments are on hold \"until further notice.\"   The agency blames Democrats, who say they won't vote to end the shutdown unless Republicans agree to extend tax credits for the Affordable Care Act to keep health insurance premiums from skyrocketing.   \n   In a statement to NPR a USDA spokesperson said, \"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. Continue to hold out for healthcare for illegals or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments.\"   Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for the Affordable Care Act.   Food aid advocates say USDA can and should keep funding SNAP. \"SNAP still has billions of dollars in what are called contingency reserves,\" says Katie Bergh, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a non-partisan research and policy institute. That wouldn't cover the entire amount, but she says the agency could legally transfer additional funds, as they've done for the WIC nutrition program. In fact, Bergh argues USDA has a legal obligation to fund SNAP since it's an entitlement program.   Department officials did not respond to an NPR query about whether there is such a legal obligation.   The origins of U.S. food benefits go back to the Great Depression. If funding does lapse next month, Bergh says, \"We would be in uncharted territory.\"   \n   And for some SNAP recipients it could be double whammy. That's because many will be subject to new work requirements tied to the benefit starting November 1 – the same day their benefits might end.   The work requirements, passed by Congressional Republicans earlier this year, are expected to push 2.4 million people off the program over the next decade.   States and food banks are scrambling to help   In a letter Thursday, the U.S. Conference of Mayors also urged USDA not to let SNAP benefits be disrupted, saying the program helps stabilize local economies.Each month, the federal government pays $8 billion in SNAP benefits. The money is automatically added to a debit-like card that recipients can then use at groceries, farmers markets and other places. More than 250,000 food retailers count on that income, says Berg with Hunger Free America.   It's not clear whether the government will act in time to prevent SNAP benefits from ending. And if it does – but waits until the last minute – it would take days to get the benefits distributed to states and then onto people's spending cards.   Meanwhile, states are preparing for a spike in demand at food banks. Virginia, for example, declared a state of emergency and said it would provide food benefits. Colorado's governor urged people to donate to food banks, and California said it would send National Guard troops to help out at food banks, as it did during the COVID-19 pandemic.   But advocates say even expanded food charity will nowhere near make up for the loss of billions in federal funding.   Meanwhile, Shari Jablonowski struggles to think how she'll cope with a major hole in her budget. She already visits food pantries and plans to step that up. But \"there's nothing I can do to make money,\" she says. \"I'm not in the greatest of health.\"   \n   For now, she's making big batches of soup and freezing some for later.\n",

House Speaker Mike Johnson called them \"Hate America\" rallies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned that they would attract \"the most unhinged in the Democratic party.\"   Instead, the rallies were most notable for a funhouse Noah's Ark of frogs, pandas, koalas, woodchucks, sharks and lobsters. Taking a page from the protest playbook in Portland, people showed up in inflatable animal costumes.   In Washington, a poodle and a chicken danced to drum music with three dinosaurs next to the National Gallery, a short walk from the U.S. Capitol. Scott Rohrbach, a senior optical engineer at NASA, came dressed as a unicorn. It was not his first choice.   \n   \"I would have come as a frog, but I couldn't find a frog,\" said Rohrbach, disappointed that all the frog costumes were sold out.   Rohrbach said he came to protest because he fears that under President Trump, future elections may not be fair. He wore the costume to counter the Republican narrative that protesters like him are hate-filled, anti-American radicals.   Inspiration from a frog suit   \"One of the things fascists can't handle is humor,\" said Rohrbach, who added that fellow protesters posed with him for selfies and kids gave him high-fives.   President Trump has said repeatedly that he is neither a fascist nor a king and dismissed the rallies.   \"I think it's a joke,\" he told reporters. \"I looked at the people. They're not representative of this country.\"   The president answered the demonstrations with his own brand of humor, posting an AI-generated video of him wearing a crown while flying a jet and dumping what looked like excrement on protesters.   So what inspired Rohrbach and so many others to dress up like animals and mythical creatures last weekend?   It all started earlier this month in Portland. A man in a frog suit was trying to help a fellow protester at an anti-ICE rally. A law enforcement officer responded by spraying the suit's air valve with a chemical agent as captured on video.   \n   The image of the officer in a black helmet and shield going after the protester in the frog costume caught the eye of many, including Jordy Lybeck, a political streamer. Lybeck began brainstorming in real time with his viewers.   \"How much are those outfits?\" Lybeck wondered aloud. \"Are you thinking what I'm thinking? What if somebody bought a lot of them and distributed them at the facility?\"   That's exactly what Lybeck and Brooks Brown, who streams about philosophy, did. They raised money online, bought more costumes and drove them to the ICE facility in Portland.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Protesters dressed as a chicken, a poodle and a dinosaur danced to drum music a short walk from the U.S. Capitol. The No Kings protest had a carnival-like feel.\n                \n                    Frank Langfitt/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Frank Langfitt/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   They call it \"Operation Inflation.\" The goal: Undermine Trump's argument that he had to deploy troops because Portland was, as he put it, a \"war zone.\"   Absurdist humor as an effective tactic   \"People who were watching at home saw that we were mocking the lies about how Portland is a wasteland of burning nightmares,\" Brown told NPR.   He also said the costumes make protesters seem less threatening — it's hard to see out of or move quickly in an inflatable suit. Brown said he spoke to a police officer on the scene who thought the same.   \"He said he knows anyone in these costumes isn't going to be doing something that they've got to run from,\" said Brown, \"which is fair, because if you haven't been in one of these costumes, you cannot run in them.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Brooks Brown, who streams about philosophy, raised money and distributed inflatable animal costumes in Portland earlier this month. He said the strategy was to undermine President Trump's claim that protests had turned the city into a \"war zone.\"\n                \n                    Courtesy of Brooks Brown\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Courtesy of Brooks Brown\n    \n\n   \n   Kim Lane Scheppele is a Princeton professor who studies democracy and authoritarianism. She says absurdist humor can be an effective tactic against autocrats, which is how she views Trump. Scheppele recalled a case in the Siberian city of Barnaul in 2012.   Critics of Vladimir Putin, who was running for a third term as Russian president, put dozens of children's toys in the main square. The toys, which included teddy bears and Transformers, held signs criticizing corruption and calling for fair elections.   \n   Toys in Siberia    City officials in Barnaul determined the demonstration was unsanctioned. When demonstrators petitioned to hold a second protest, officials rejected it on the grounds that the toys were \"inanimate objects\" and not \"citizens of Russia,\" according to Britain's Guardian newspaper and the U.S. government's Radio Free Europe.   Scheppele says stunts like this publicize a political message while laying a trap for officials.   \"They do it in such a way that any response from the government makes them look worse,\" she told NPR.   Brown, the streamer, says dressing up as animals serves a similar purpose here. He says the funny-looking outfits change the optics of protests so that government force looks more like farce. After all, it's not easy to portray an inflatable frog — or unicorn — as \"the enemy from within.\"\n",

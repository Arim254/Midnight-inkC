Audience members were largely white (75%), women (70%), and 55 or over (72%). Dallas, Orlando, Tampa, Phoenix, Houston, Atlanta and West Palm Beach were among the top markets over the weekend, according to data from Amazon MGM Studios.   Amazon acquired the rights to the movie in early 2025 for $40 million. The company ran a flashy rollout for the film, spending $35 million on marketing, leading to questions about whether such a hefty price tag included earning President Trump's favor — or trying to. Melania is one of the most expensive documentary films ever made, with the first lady herself taking on the role of an executive producer.   \n   Critics have panned the movie, which premiered at the Kennedy Center last week with protesters dressed as Marie Antoinette outside. TikTokers encouraged viewers to instead watch Becoming, Michelle Obama's 2020 Netflix documentary, which broke the service's top 10 most popular movies in the U.S. over the weekend.   \n   Documentaries rarely receive wide theatrical releases, but Melania opened on more than 1,500 screens throughout the U.S. this weekend. Ahead of the film's global release on Friday, many on social media shared photos of their local theaters in which nearly every seat for Melania showings remained available for purchase. Analysts were predicting ticket sales in the $5 million range — making the $7 million box office good news for Amazon.   For a sense of scale: The top-grossing film this weekend was the survival horror thriller Send Help, which brought in $20 million. Following close behind was Iron Lung, also a horror film, at nearly $18 million.   But, writes David A. Gross in his industry newsletter FranchiseRe, \"This is an excellent opening for a political documentary, at more than double the average for the genre ... These are small movies, and this is a big start for a documentary.\"   Gross told NPR via email that the film's audience \"matches with the Trump fan base. The weekend audience gave the film a glowing A CinemaScore,\" which polls moviegoers. \"They see Melania as an accomplished role model — someone they look up to.\"   \n   \"As good as this opening is for a documentary,\" says Gross in his newsletter, \"for any other film, with $75 million in costs and limited foreign potential, it would be a problem.\"   Amazon is undeterred. Kevin Wilson, Amazon MGM Studios' head of domestic theatrical distribution, said in a statement that the box office numbers exceeded expectations — and that a docuseries would be on the way.   \n   \"This momentum is an important first step in what we see as a long-tail lifecycle for both the film and the forthcoming docu-series, extending well beyond the theatrical window and into what we believe will be a significant run for both on our service.\"   A notoriously private person, the first lady has gained a reputation as a mysterious figure who closely controls her public image. Melania follows the first lady during the 20 days leading up to President Trump's inauguration in January 2025, including preparation for a candle-lit inaugural dinner at which the camera breezes by Jeff Bezos multiple times. Cameras also follow the design process for her inauguration outfits, and her grieving process after her mother Amalija Knavs' death.   At the New York Stock Exchange last week, the first lady hailed the documentary as \"a window into an important period for America.\"   Editor's note: Amazon is among NPR's recent financial supporters and pays to distribute some NPR content.\n",

Above, a tarp covers construction on the building's facade on Dec. 19, 2025, after Trump announced The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts would be renamed The Trump-Kennedy Center.\n                \n                    Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   On Sunday night, President Trump abruptly announced plans to close the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts for two years \"for Construction, Revitalization, and Complete Rebuilding\" to create what he said \"can be, without question, the finest Performing Arts Facility of its kind, anywhere in the World.\"   \n   The timing of the announcement has taken many in Washington, D.C. and the arts world aback (and coincided with the annual Grammy Awards, on which much of the music world was focused). On Sunday evening, Richard Grenell, the president of the Kennedy Center, sent a memo to the arts complex's staff, which was obtained by NPR, where he wrote: \"We recognize this creates many questions as we plan to temporarily close most of our operations. We will have more information about staffing and operational changes in the coming days.\" In a public statement posted to X on Sunday, Grenell wrote: \"I am confident this sets the stage for a stronger, revitalized National Cultural and Entertainment Complex.\"   \n   We have many questions as well, which we're currently trying to get answered. NPR reached out to the Kennedy Center for comment, but we have not received a reply. If you have additional questions that you think we should pursue, please add them below.   Wouldn't Congress have to approve this?   On paper, yes. The Kennedy Center's charter stipulates that it is a living memorial to the late President John F. Kennedy and to \"preserving, fostering, and transmitting the performing arts traditions of the people of the United States and other countries.\" But Congress has not yet moved on the announced renaming of the complex back in December.   What happens to organizations, performers and unions that currently have open contracts with the Kennedy Center?   These include long-running shows like Shear Madness, which is currently booked at the center through October and several unions with Kennedy Center contracts, which range from the musicians of the National Symphony – whose current contract is set to expire next month – to backstage crew and education staffers.   What is President Trump's vision for this complex?   Artistic disciplines such as opera, classical music and dance have historically not been a priority for him; for example, he did not attend any Kennedy Center performances during his first term and the most recent class of Kennedy Center honorees did not include any artists from those fields. Would a \"complete rebuilding\" hold any space for these performing arts disciplines?   \n   Where will the National Symphony, the Kennedy Center's lynchpin artistic organization in residence, go once they've lost their home?    Their ticket sales have crumbled in the past year; does this closing of their physical space mean that they can extricate themselves from their financial relationship with the Kennedy Center?   Why has the president identified July 4 as the closing date?   That is traditionally the middle of the Kennedy Center's musical theater season – this year's announced lineup includes touring productions of The Outsiders, Moulin Rouge! The Musical and Back to the Future: The Musical, along with children's shows. What will happen to that season?   Why now?   \n   The Kennedy Center was expanded and renovated in 2019. It's an old facility in need of work, but what was not done then that Trump believes is needed now? A source close to the Kennedy Center tells NPR that among the changes that Trump has expressed enthusiasm for is the idea of putting in marble armrests at each seat in the main theater – which, along with being cold and uncomfortable, would drastically change the venue's acoustics, experts say.   What happens to the valuable and treasured artworks and historical artifacts housed at the Kennedy Center?   These range from the famed bust of President Kennedy in its grand foyer to cultural treasures gifted by various African nations in its African Lounge. What will happen to such artworks, cultural touchstones, and archival pieces? As a private citizen in 1980, Trump demolished two Art Deco friezes at the former Bonwit Teller department store on New York's Fifth Avenue, which the Metropolitan Museum of Art had expressed interest in acquiring. The site would go on to become his Trump Tower. Last October, the entire East Wing of the White House was demolished, despite the concerns of preservationists and historians.   Will the newest iteration of the complex still be tied to President Kennedy's name and legacy?   In a social media post Monday morning, Jack Schlossberg, President Kennedy's grandson who is currently running for a congressional seat in New York's 12th district, indicated that he thinks not. He wrote: \"He [Trump] can take the Kennedy Center for himself. He can change the name, shut the doors and demolish the building. He can try to kill JFK. But JFK is kept alive by us now rising up to remove Donald Trump, bring him to justice and restore the freedoms generations fought for.\"   \n   We'd like to hear from you   What questions do you have about Trump's proposed renovations to the Kennedy Center?

Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., speaks to reporters at the U.S. Capitol on May 15, 2025, in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   SUFFERN, N.Y. — Rep. Mike Lawler, a Republican in a competitive New York congressional district, ran into a disruptive and sometimes hostile crowd at a town hall on Sunday night.   With the GOP holding onto a slim majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, Democrats hope to flip the seat in this year's midterm races. The Cook Political Report considers the election in New York's 17th Congressional District, which covers several suburban New York counties in the Hudson River Valley, a toss-up race.   While appearing at a community college in suburban Rockland County, Lawler tried to appeal to the broad spectrum of constituents in his district.   \n   \"People cannot afford to live here,\" Lawler told the crowded auditorium. \"It's why I have focused extensively on key issues like housing.\"   But audience questions quickly turned to recent events in Minneapolis and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's tactics.   Just days before, Lawler had published a guest essay in The New York Times saying that the country's current immigration policy is not working and called for a \"a common-sense bipartisan solution.\"   \"I think what happened in Minneapolis is tragic,\" Lawler said Sunday. \"I believe it was entirely preventable.\"   Lawler told the town hall audience that he supports certain reforms of ICE tactics and immigration policy. He said he supports equipping ICE agents with body cameras and a ban on masks. The congressman said he also wants to create a path to legal status for immigrants who've worked in the U.S., pay taxes and have no criminal record.   \" That does not mean citizenship, but it does mean that they come out of the shadows and that they can participate in our economy and in our community without fear of being deported,\" Lawler said.   \n   While Lawler called for a thorough federal investigation into the shootings of Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minnesota, he faced jeers and insults from many in the room.   \"What is the line that you won't cross?\" one audience member could be heard asking at a microphone set up for constituents. \"What can Trump do that you'll say that's wrong?\"    Many people in the audience also demanded that Lawler be more forceful in his response to the recent fatal shootings in Minneapolis and immigration enforcement tactics in general.   \n   \"Again, my point with respect to Minneapolis is to let the investigations actually take place,\" Lawler said.   Despite the concerns expressed by constituents about ICE enforcement and immigration, the cost of living remains a top issue for voters.   Nicole Mirsky of Pearl River attended the town hall. She says she won't be voting for Lawler this year, citing concerns over affordable housing and energy prices.   Ellen Barbera from Haverstraw came out to support Lawler. She says that while her top concern is affordability, she thinks that Lawler, a Republican, will address her concerns better than a Democrat.   \n   \"I'm worried about the issues that really affect everybody,\" Barbera said. \"The cost to live here, the cost to remain here after retirement.\"   So far, several Democrats are running against Congressman Lawler in November. Democrats enjoy a significant advantage over Republicans among the district's registered voters, according to recent state voter registration data. The latest data also shows there are slightly more voters who do not identify with any party than registered Republicans among Lawler's constituents.   Lawler says he plans to have in-person town halls for his constituents in other counties that make up New York's 17th Congressional District.\n",

The 2026 test was designed to help the bureau improve the accuracy of the United States' upcoming once-a-decade head count. A mix of communities in six states, as well as a national sample of households, was expected to take part in the experiment.   But the agency is now set to reduce the number of test sites to two — Huntsville, Ala., and Spartanburg, S.C. — while adding plans to try replacing temporary census workers with U.S. Postal Service staff, according to a Federal Register notice that was made available for public inspection Monday before its official publication.   \n   The bureau is also cutting a plan to provide Spanish- and Chinese-language versions of the census test's online form, which is now set to be available only in English. Households can start using the form to respond sometime in the spring, the bureau's website now says, and if they don't, they may get a visit from a census or postal worker.   Spokespeople for the bureau and its parent agency, the Commerce Department, did not immediately respond to NPR's questions, including those about what prompted these changes. In a statement Monday announcing the \"launch of the 2026 Census Test,\" the bureau said it \"remains committed to conducting the most accurate count in history for the 2030 Census and looks forward to the continued partnership with local communities.\"   \n   Census test plans for rural communities and Indigenous tribal lands are cut   Among the locations no longer part of the census test are rural communities in western Texas and Indigenous tribal lands within Arizona and North Carolina. Those include the Fort Apache Reservation, home to the White Mountain Apache Tribe; San Carlos Reservation, home to the San Carlos Apache Tribe; and the Qualla Boundary, home to the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.   Terri Ann Lowenthal — a census consultant, who was once staff director of a former congressional subcommittee on the national count — calls this development on the road to the 2030 census \"disheartening.\"   \n   \"The descoped 2026 test plan is confusing and unclear to the public — a product, regrettably, of the administration pulling a black-out shade over all planning for 2030,\" Lowenthal said in a statement. \"Equally troubling, we already know from the last census that not fully evaluating promising new methods and improved operations, for example in rural areas and on American Indian reservations, can lead to a less accurate count in many communities.\"   The cutbacks to the test come after the bureau has refused to update lawmakers in Congress charged with overseeing its work and after the administration disbanded all the bureau's committees of outside advisers, who previously received periodic briefings on 2030 census planning during public meetings.   Over the past year, the bureau, which is the federal government's largest statistical agency, has also had multiple departures of experienced staff members as part of the Trump administration's slashing of the federal workforce.   In a statement, Democratic Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan said he was \"alarmed\" by the bureau's announcement about significantly cutting testing.   \"When the Census Bureau doesn't accurately count people, the communities most in need lose out on critical resources,\" said Peters, the top Democrat overseeing the bureau on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. \"I have long pushed the Census Bureau to conduct robust testing of strategies to reach historically undercounted communities to ensure that every person gets counted. I urge the Census Bureau to reverse its decision and conduct the 2026 Census Test with all six of the communities as planned.\"   Dante Moreno, a lobbyist for local governments at the National League of Cities, says leaders of some of the canceled test sites were informed of the bureau's changes on Monday after months without updates. The test's new focus on online census responses has now raised more concerns.   \"Rural areas in general are just less likely to have cell service or internet service. So how do you fill out those questionnaires? Or if your home is a mile away from another home, how do you make sure that people know that you exist there, that they know to come to you so you get counted?\" Moreno says.   \n   Similar questions are on the minds of the Indigenous tribal leaders whose communities are no longer invited to participate in the test, says Saundra Mitrovich, a census consultant with the Native American Rights Fund, who co-leads the Natives Count Coalition.   \"Many of our native populations are also dealing with language assistance concerns. And when we can't rightly respond to that or participate in pulling together an operations plan that will address that adequately, then it becomes a challenge. Are you listening to our communities? Are you upholding that federal trust responsibility for tribes?\" says Mitrovich, who is a tribal citizen of the Berry Creek Rancheria of Maidu Indians of California.   Exactly how postal workers will help with the census test is unclear   Preparations for this census test have already suffered from delays in raising public awareness and finalizing a staffing plan, partly due to uncertain funding from Congress. And the bureau had been waiting for months for a White House agency to approve a plan to contact administrators of college dorms, nursing homes and other group-living quarters to get ready for counting. The bureau's Monday announcement about its revised test plan makes no mention of group quarters.   Bringing on Postal Service workers to help conduct the census test is expected to raise a raft of questions among both advocates of the count and USPS. A 2011 Government Accountability Office report found that replacing temporary census workers with higher-paid mail carriers is not cost-effective. Still, such a move has had the vocal support of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who has claimed it could save the government money.   USPS spokesperson Albert Ruiz referred NPR's questions, including whether postal workers would be expected to work for the census test in addition to their regular jobs, to the Commerce Department.   \"The United States Postal Service looks forward to participating in the 2026 Operational Test in Support of the 2030 Census,\" Ruiz added.   \n   Edited by Benjamin Swasey\n",

This is \"New Gaza,\" a vision laid out by the Trump administration for the destroyed Palestinian territory after two years of war.   \"We've already started removing the rubble and doing some of the demolition,\" Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law, said while presenting the plan recently in Davos, Switzerland.   \"And then 'New Gaza.' It could be a hope, it could be a destination, have a lot of industry and really be a place that the people there can thrive, have great employment,\" he said.   \n   The Gaza Strip is only 25 miles long and about 4 to 7 miles wide. It was home to around 2.2 million people before the war, all living in densely packed cities and refugee camps. Now, nearly everyone lives in makeshift tents or bombed-out homes that are at risk of collapse. The World Bank estimated in 2024 the cost of damage to critical infrastructure alone was more than $18 billion.   The plan laid out by Kushner rests on Trump's ceasefire deal, which demands that Hamas decommission its weapons as Israel withdraws from Gaza in phases. Reconstruction would only commence in areas of Gaza where Hamas is fully disarmed, or already emptied of Palestinians and under Israeli military control.   \n   This \"New Gaza\" plan, however, makes no reference to land deed transfers nor how new housing would be allocated to Palestinians. It also does not say how families will be uprooted from existing buildings that the plan would demolish, particularly in central Gaza and parts of western Gaza City where many buildings are still intact.   Critics, including people NPR interviewed in Gaza, say it erases Gaza entirely and turns it into an investment opportunity atop the ruins of what a U.N. commission determined was a genocide committed by Israel. Israel denies the allegation, and is fighting war crimes charges internationally.   \n   It's unclear if any Palestinians were consulted in the \"New Gaza\" vision unveiled by Kushner, but he says Israeli real estate investor, Yakir Gabay, played a key role in crafting the plan. Both men are on the White House-appointed Gaza Executive Board that will oversee the plan and report to Trump's Board of Peace.   Here are five things to know about the \"New Gaza\":   1. Less space for housing than before the war   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A slide from Jared Kushner's \"New Gaza\" presentation in Davos, Switzerland, includes an annotated map outlining different areas of the Gaza Strip.\n                \n                    Screenshot by NPR/Board of Peace slide deck\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Screenshot by NPR/Board of Peace slide deck\n    \n\n   \n   Kushner's plan envisions four district-like areas for Palestinians to live in, nestled between large green areas for parks and industrial zones that appear equal in size or larger than the areas designated for housing. These industrial zones would create more than half a million jobs for Palestinians in Gaza, according to the plan.   A report published by the U.N.-Habitat agency in 2024 said 87% of Gaza was urban area and nearly all the rest was refugee camps, describing the territory as \"fully urbanized.\"   That means the plan leaves far less room for Palestinian housing than existed before the war, suggesting a smaller population in Gaza.   NPR asked the White House-appointed Gaza Executive Board whether the plan takes into account the full population of Gaza. A spokesperson, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the plans, said the figures presented for the first phase of reconstruction are \"just the start,\" without elaborating.   2. Reshaped cities with some no longer existing   The plan lays out phases for rebuilding, starting with the south. Two areas labeled as \"Gaza City\" to the north would be built in the last, fourth phase.   \n   Gaza's residential areas would be divided into quadrants, labeled as Rafah, Khan Younis, Center Camps and Gaza City. They would be disconnected from one another, and divided by large green areas designated for parks, agriculture and sports facilities. Only a few main roads connect them.   The plan would erase northern Gaza cities and refugee camps like Beit Lahia and Jabalia, replacing them with agricultural areas and zones designated for data centers and advanced manufacturing. It would raze other parts of Gaza to the ground to be rebuilt.   \n   \"You're going to remove people's homes and put parks instead, but did you ask a single person in Gaza to do this?\" said Rami Abdel-Aal, a resident of Gaza whose home in Rafah was demolished in an area now occupied by the Israeli military that's being razed to build the first such community.   \"We only want one thing: Leave us to rebuild,\" he said. \"We don't want anything from you. Just leave us to rebuild.\"   3. A new airport, but no independent land crossing    In the vision laid out by Kushner, southern Gaza would have an airport, a train and logistics hub, and a port — all nonexistent at the moment.   Gaza has been besieged by Israel since Hamas took over rule of the territory in 2007. People can only exit or enter Gaza by land with Israeli approvals through border crossings Israel controls.   But under the plan, Gaza's single border crossing with Egypt, known as the Rafah crossing, would no longer be geographically distant from Israel. It would be moved south to the tip of Gaza and renamed a \"trilateral crossing,\" touching both Egypt and Israel.   Egypt has not commented on the plan, and throughout the war has rejected Israeli control of Rafah.   \n   4. A \"New Rafah\" as the center of gravity    Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah had long been a quiet border town known mostly for its smuggling tunnels with Egypt, but Kushner's plan envisions the city as Gaza's logistics and possibly administrative hub.   Rafah, today, is nearly void of residents and under Israeli military occupation. Palestinian militias armed by Israel and opposed to Hamas operate in the area.   Under the \"New Gaza\" plan, Rafah has among the most housing of all the areas in Gaza, suggesting the population, which before the war was heavily in the north near Israel, would be pushed south.   \n   Described as \"New Rafah,\" there would be 100,000-plus permanent housing units, according to Kushner's plan. Prior to the war, all of Gaza had nearly 600,000 apartments and housing units for 2.2 million people, according to the U.N.-Habitat report. It noted a critical housing shortage even before Israeli attacks destroyed or damaged more than 90% of homes.   The new plan also says there will be some 200 educational centers in \"New Rafah.\" Before the war, Gaza had around 700 schools, including private, public and U.N.-school buildings, according to figures obtained by NPR from the U.N. relief agency for Palestinians, known as UNRWA, and the Palestinian Education Ministry. In addition, there were 17 higher education institutions, or universities.   \n   An Israeli official told NPR the ground in Rafah is being prepared to be cleared of unexploded ordnance and tunnels in order to set up temporary housing. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of the preparations. The official said that Kushner and U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff have asked Israel to accelerate operations clearing rubble in Rafah, where a neighborhood funded by the United Arab Emirates would be built to house thousands of civilians from Gaza.   The UAE's government did not respond to a request for comment.   5. A coastline for tourists and investors   The entirety of Gaza's Mediterranean coastline is designated under the plan as an area for \"coastal tourism\" with 180 \"mixed use\" towers.   The visuals for the plan are stark, and look nothing like Gaza. Futuristic towers would form a new skyline along Gaza's coast, resembling a billionaire's playground much like Dubai.   Palestinian residents of Gaza would likely be priced out of this prime, new real estate. Gaza's coastline before the war included apartment buildings, local hotels, cafes and public beaches. These beaches are people's only escape from Gaza's otherwise densely packed terrain.   Anas Baba in Gaza City, Ahmed Abuhamda in Cairo and Itay Stern and Daniel Estrin in Tel Aviv contributed to this report.\n",

    "body": "\n      The government is still in a partial shutdown, but the House Speaker predicts it will be over by Tuesday. In the meantime, lawmakers are still divided over Department of Homeland Security policy changes.   \n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  A large chunk of the federal government is shut down today.MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Congress missed its Friday deadline to fund the government after Senate Democrats stipulated reforms at the Department of Homeland Security. Those who work at other key agencies, like the Pentagon and the departments of Transportation, Labor and Education, are either furloughed or working without pay. This partial shutdown comes less than three months after the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. But this time, White House officials and lawmakers say the pause in funding will be short-lived. In a few minutes, we'll speak with No. 2 House Democrat Katherine Clark to see what she has to say about that. But first, let's get the background.MARTÍNEZ: NPR's Luke Garrett is here. So we just heard Michel mention that there's confidence this will be less shutdown and more pause.LUKE GARRETT, BYLINE: That's right. So the Senate has already advanced a massive funding package to reopen the government, and they did that Friday night after President Trump and Senate Democrats struck a deal. The agreement would reopen those shut-down agencies you mentioned, like the Pentagon and Department of Transportation, among others. But the legislation would only fund the Department of Homeland Security for two weeks. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer demanded limiting DHS funding after its agents shot and killed two Minnesotans. The idea is only authorizing two weeks of DHS funding will force negotiation over department policy. And over in the House, Speaker Mike Johnson told NBC News he can get this passed by midweek.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MIKE JOHNSON: Our intention is by Tuesday to fund all agencies of the federal government except for that one, and then we'll have two weeks of good-faith negotiations to figure it out.GARRETT: But not all House members, Republicans and Democrats, are pleased with two weeks of DHS funding.MARTÍNEZ: Ah. Now to the sticking points.GARRETT: That's right. It is Washington. On the right, some members don't want any DHS reforms, and they want to include election integrity legislation that requires proof of citizenship. This would require legislation go back to the Senate, prolonging the shutdown. On the left, some House Democrats don't even support two weeks of DHS funding.MARTÍNEZ: And yet Speaker Johnson is confident it'll pass this week.GARRETT: Right. And the reason is, you know, Trump, basically. Speaker Johnson said President Trump negotiated this Senate funding package. The deal is Trump's deal. House Republicans will fall in line, Johnson said, and they will have enough votes to reopen the government, even without Democrat support. But I should note, A, Democrats held a caucus call last night and some are considering supporting the funding bill, according to a source not authorized to share those details publicly.MARTÍNEZ: OK. So assuming they pass this massive funding package by Tuesday, Congress will only have a couple of weeks to agree on DHS funds. So what changes are on the table?GARRETT: Well, Speaker Johnson told Fox News he and Trump support some changes to DHS.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHNSON: For example, we want body cameras on Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.GARRETT: But Johnson made clear the GOP won't budge on issues of DHS agents hiding their identities with masks, citing officer safety. This doesn't line up with the changes Democrats want. Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries gave his list of demands on ABC News.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Body cameras should be mandatory. Masks should come off. Judicial warrants should absolutely be required, consistent with the Constitution, in our view, before DHS agents or ICE agents are breaking into the homes of the American people or ripping people out of their cars.GARRETT: So, A, even if the House reopens to government this week, the fight over DHS will continue on Capitol Hill, and we might have yet another partial shutdown on our hands.MARTÍNEZ: Yeesh - another one. OK. Before we even get to that, what are the impacts of this one?GARRETT: So Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought sent a letter to affected agencies on Friday. He directed those workers to, quote, \"undertake orderly shutdown activities\" like gathering belongings from work and pausing ongoing projects. And the Department of Transportation sent out guidance that nearly 14,000 air traffic controllers will continue to work without pay, starting today. But lawmakers on Capitol Hill hope these impacts will be minimal, with a quick reopen before those first paychecks are due.MARTÍNEZ: All right. That's NPR's Luke Garrett. Luke, thanks.GARRETT: You bet.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

That depends on who's discussing the enigmatic plant that's legal in some forms (for now) but faces new restrictions in other forms this fall.   The confusion comes as no surprise to Nick Johnson, author of the book Grass Roots, which looks at the history of the cannabis plant and its use as both an industrial material and a drug.   \n   \"It's one of the world's oldest domesticated crops,\" Johnson says of cannabis. \"And it's also incredibly cryptic. We still do not understand everything about its biology and why it does the things it does, how it creates the compounds and molecules it does.\"   Cannabis \"has over 480 constituents,\" according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, but U.S. regulators focus on just one: THC, the compound linked to the drug's famous psychoactive effects.   Federal laws define legal hemp differently from illegal marijuana based on their levels of THC. As long as a plant contains less than 0.3% of one form of THC (with a much stricter limit taking effect later this year), it's considered hemp, not marijuana. And while marijuana is in the process of being reclassified as a Schedule III drug instead of a more restricted Schedule I, hemp is not a controlled substance.   \n   Despite the different policies, qualities and uses, the plants are more similar than not.   \"Botanically speaking, both hemp and marijuana belong to a single species: Cannabis sativa,\" says Kelly Vining, an associate professor at Oregon State University who studies hemp genomics. In general, Vining says, taxonomists consider hemp and marijuana subspecies of Cannabis sativa.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A display at a Total Wine & More store in Arlington, Va., offers a guide to customers seeking to try THC beverages. The drinks are legal in many states, thanks to a loophole in the 2018 Farm Bill.\n                \n                    Bill Chappell/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Bill Chappell/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   But legal definitions of hemp are in hot dispute, in Congress and around the United States. A new federal law will sharply limit the amount of THC (and similar compounds) in final products rather than focusing on plants — aiming to close a loophole in the 2018 Farm Bill that spawned a multibillion-dollar industry in intoxicating drinks.   Critics say this new law should be revised, warning of calamitous effects on THC drink makers and businesses that use other cannabinoids — compounds found in cannabis — such as CBD, or cannabidiol.   The shifting definitions are just the latest twists for hemp, a former cash crop that was later banned. Here's a brief guide to its history:   Hemp was once an important U.S. crop   A staple crop in Colonial and early America, hemp was used to produce everything from the ropes and sails used on ships to the clothes enslaved people wore, as well as the twine for baling the cotton and other commodities they produced.   \n   \"Hemp was cultivated in New England as early as 1629,\" according to a history of hemp published by S.S. Boyce in 1900.   \n   Colonies such as Virginia rewarded farmers for growing hemp and penalized farmers who didn't, he noted.   There was one thing hemp was not used for, says Johnson, the author of Grass Roots.   \"Nobody was smoking weed in George Washington's time,\" he says, aiming to clear up a common misconception. \"They grew hemp. They didn't smoke it — they didn't drink it. They didn't use it at all for psychoactive purposes.\"   The origin of \"drug cannabis\"   Indigenous people in North America and South America did not use cannabis as a drug before colonizers such as Britain and Spain introduced those forms of the plant, according to Johnson. Varieties of the plant bred for mind-altering uses started far earlier and on another continent: in the Hindu Kush mountains of Afghanistan.   Compared with the towering hemp plant that was prized for its long and strong fibers, this Asian version of cannabis was short and squat and was prized for other reasons. To protect itself from sunlight's intense radiation at high altitude, Johnson says, the plant evolved a \"sunscreen\" for its flowers: the THC resin that coats the buds.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Decades before marijuana was banned under U.S. law, the drug could be imported and exported legally, if it bore stamps required by the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937.\n                \n                    U.S. Customs and Border Protection\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        U.S. Customs and Border Protection\n    \n\n   \n   The British encountered the plant in India, where locals had cultivated cannabis for psychoactive purposes for thousands of years. The cultivar's spread to the Western Hemisphere got a boost from what might seem like an unlikely event: When Britain abolished slavery in the Caribbean in 1834, it brought indentured Indian laborers to work at Caribbean plantations.   \"You start having the free or formerly enslaved Black populations mixing with the new indentured servant populations,\" Johnson says. \"The Rastafarian tradition has its roots there.\"   The new variety of cannabis spread to the mainland, along with its status as a drug or medicine for pain relief and other uses. By 1851, a cannabis extract was listed in the Pharmacopoeia of the United States, a reference used by physicians and pharmacists.   \n   Despite their distinct evolutions, cannabis plants use one mechanism to create much discussed cannabinoids such as THC and CBD, horticulture professor Vining says.   \"They're both synthesized by the same biosynthetic pathway\" in plants, she says. \"There are different enzymes that convert precursor molecules into the downstream molecules that are cannabinoids, including THC and CBD.\"   But not every cannabis plant can produce high levels of those cannabinoids. Farmers have bred hemp for centuries, Vining notes, selecting plants that offer large size and strong fibers — not THC or other cannabinoids.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Marijuana plants grow at an illegal cannabis farm during a raid by San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies in Newberry Springs, Calif., in 2024. Recreational marijuana use is legal in the state, but a black market persists.\n                \n                    Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The start of a U.S. crackdown on cannabis   The first widely recorded U.S. ban on cannabis came in 1915, in El Paso, Texas, despite the concern of doctors and pharmacists who cited its medicinal use. The El Paso Herald newspaper reported, \"It is put up by the foremost drug manufacturers in the country and is frequently prescribed, as it is a sedative of value.\"   Federal regulation of cannabis started with the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, mirroring a shift in terminology from \"cannabis\" to \"marijuana\" that is widely attributed to authorities' goals of linking cannabis to racial and ethnic groups by depicting marijuana as a scourge among Mexicans and Black people.   \n   Even tighter U.S. restrictions on cannabis came in the early 1970s, when President Richard Nixon approved adding it to the list of Schedule I drugs, such as heroin, that have no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.   Nixon did so \"over the unanimous recommendation of his drug commission that called for decriminalization,\" as NPR's Cokie Roberts reported in 2019. \"Later, his aide, John Ehrlichman, said Nixon wanted to get at pot-smoking, anti-war protesters and to disrupt Black neighborhoods with criminalization.\"   While other Schedule I drugs are known to carry fatal risks due to overdose, the Drug Enforcement Administration says, \"No deaths from overdose of marijuana have been reported.\"   \n   A new U.S. hemp definition is on the way   As President Trump's rescheduling order suggests, public opinion on marijuana has softened across political lines since the 1970s. Many states have legalized recreational or medicinal pot, and cannabinoids such as CBD have gained recognition from the Food and Drug Administration and others for their therapeutic properties. But researchers have said the federal marijuana ban makes it difficult to study the potential health risks and benefits, even as its use spreads.   The 2018 Farm Bill was an emblem of that shifting conversation, as politicians sought to differentiate between hemp and marijuana. Those changes also give lawmakers political cover to discuss easing regulations, says Adam Smith, the executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project, a legalization advocacy group.   \"We're not really in favor of marijuana, but we're not going to stop this other thing that's different,\" Smith says of the political calculus. \"But it's not different, right? It's all cannabinoids.\"   The new, more restrictive rules regulating cannabis — and defining hemp — are scheduled to go into effect in November. At that point, a final product that contains more than 0.4 milligrams of any form of THC or \"any other cannabinoids that have similar effects\" will not be considered hemp — and thus will be illegal.   Hemp beverage companies, which have built an increasingly mainstream market since the 2018 Farm Bill allowed for some hemp-derived THC products, say the change would ban drinks currently on the market that are considered low or moderate strength, from 2 to 10 milligrams of THC per container. And other hemp companies say the new law will also effectively ban some products with nonintoxicating cannabinoids like CBD if they have trace amounts of THC.   Aside from the THC debate, Vining of Oregon State University says that easing rules on hemp has helped clear the way to study more uses for the plant, from its nutritious seeds to its fibers, which can be used in \"hempcrete,\" a building material.   \n   \"There are many uses beyond drug use for Cannabis sativa,\" she says. \"And they've been used throughout human history.\"\n",

Scott Applewhite/AP\n    \n\n   \n   At the beginning of the year, it seemed like a bipartisan deal to extend the Affordable Care Act enhanced subsidies was within reach. A three-year extension passed in the House, but talks have sputtered in the Senate.   Many Republicans in Congress assert the reason for those stalled talks goes all the way back to the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010.   \"You gotta remember, Democrats created Obamacare,\" Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, told reporters on Thursday. \"It's been an abject failure in terms of lowering costs.\"   Moreno helped lead bipartisan talks in the Senate to come up with a solution to the sudden absence of enhanced subsidies that caused many people's premiums to double or triple. Most people affected by this live in states that Trump won, and Moreno is among the Republicans who have tried to come up with a deal to cushion the blow of these high premiums.   \n   But even as the parties tried to work together to solve a present-day problem, anger over the original passage of the ACA keeps coming up.   \"Congressional Republicans can't seem to quit the Obamacare repeal fight, even though the politics of the Affordable Care Act have changed a lot over the past 15 years,\" says Jonathan Oberlander, a political scientist focused on health care at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"It is, on balance, now a very popular program. Its main coverage policies, including the enhanced subsidies, have been in place for many years and helped tens of millions of Americans.\"   That makes letting the enhanced subsidies expire politically hazardous, he says.   \"It is a terrible political look for congressional Republicans, and it's a terrible reality for many of their constituents who are going to face these skyrocketing premium payments,\" Oberlander says.   Republicans are \"likely to pay a price\" in the upcoming midterm elections, he adds.   That view is supported by a poll published Thursday by the nonpartisan health research organization KFF, which found two-thirds of Americans think that Congress did the \"wrong thing\" by failing to extend the enhanced subsidies.   The survey, which was fielded in mid-January and included 1,400 people, also found that health care costs were Americans' top affordability concern, more than the cost of groceries or utilities.   \n   \"What our poll is showing is that health care costs are something that voters want to see candidates address,\" says Ashley Kirzinger, KFF's director of survey methodology. \"A significant share of them say that health care costs are going to play a major role in their decisions to vote in the midterms and in which candidates they vote for.\"   \n   Even before open enrollment on Healthcare.gov and the state marketplaces began in November, the intense political debate about the future of the enhanced subsidies has hung over the normal sign-up process. Some enrollees didn't know if they would end up with a premium that was $400 a month or $2,000 a month. Although the chances for a bipartisan deal seem slim, there is still some negotiating happening in the Senate.   \"All of this uncertainty is leading to a lot of understandable stress among patients who have relied on the marketplace and saw real gains in affordability at a time when we're also seeing downward economic trends,\" says Miranda Yaver, professor of health policy at the University of Pittsburgh.   If Congress did manage to revive the enhanced subsidies, marketplace directors said in a press call last month that they would be ready to move quickly to implement the change and reopen enrollment, but that some consumers may be lost from the market for good. Hilary Schneider, the director of the Maine marketplace coverME, says her team would try to win people back, but adds: \"When you lose consumers, getting them back is twice as hard as retaining them and it's really costly.\"   So far, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, 23 million people signed up for an ACA plan. That's down more than a million from last year, and health policy experts predict that more people will drop coverage over the coming months if they can't afford the premiums.   \n   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 4 million people could ultimately become uninsured due to the expiration of the enhanced subsidies, and that number could ultimately grow to 15 million because of people losing Medicaid coverage due to cuts in the Big Beautiful Bill, which kick in next year.   \"That is the largest increase in the uninsured population we have ever had in a short period of time, and it would wipe out about two-thirds of the gains of Obamacare,\" says Oberlander.   \"One of the larger frames here is in 2017, President Trump and congressional Republicans tried to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and they failed, and, of course, it cost them politically in the 2018 midterm elections,\" Oberlander says \"This time around, they did not launch a frontal assault on Obamacare. They did not try to repeal and replace the law. But what they are doing, in effect, is rolling back many of its core provisions.\"   Yaver agrees that, this time around, Republicans are \"finding more subtle ways to undermine [the ACA's] effectiveness\" than launching another repeal effort.   Oberlander thinks even if they're more subtle, these moves are still going to prove unpopular with voters.   \"I think they've probably bought some thin political insulation by rolling back instead of repealing, but ultimately, I still think it's going to be very unpopular to do these things,\" he says. \"A lot of Americans are not going to welcome the news that Congress is making their health insurance less affordable.\"\n",

The family asked to use only their initials for fear of retaliation from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.   J.J. and his wife, A., didn't understand why one child's fingerprints would need checking, but they opened the door. And then they watched as their 20-year-old son was, in fact, arrested and driven away in a black SUV.   \n   \"When I saw him being handcuffed, I felt so scared,\" A. said. \"They were treating him like a delinquent.

But more than 100 refugees with no criminal background have been unlawfully arrested, with many flown to a detention center in Texas, according to a class-action lawsuit filed by refugees and advocates for them. It's part of a push the Department of Homeland Security announced Jan. 9 to reexamine thousands of refugee cases, starting in Minnesota, to investigate for potential fraud.   The focus is on those who arrived in the past few years and have not yet received a green card for legal permanent residency.   \"The Trump administration will not stand idly by as the U.S. immigration system is weaponized by those seeking to defraud the American people,\" the agency said in its announcement.   President Trump has dramatically cut refugee admissions to a record low, and in the last year admitted mostly white Afrikaners from South Africa. His administration also has stepped up allegations of public benefits fraud after a sweeping scandal in Minnesota that involved Somali Americans who'd been refugees.   \n   On Wednesday, a federal judge ordered the release of the refugees in Minnesota and granted a temporary pause in detentions, which he said had been made \"without warrants or cause,\" while the case plays out.   \"At its best, America serves as a haven of individual liberties in a world too often full of tyranny and cruelty,\" U.S. District Judge John Tunheim wrote in the order. \"We abandon that ideal when we subject our neighbors to fear and chaos.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A. hugs her son, who was detained by federal agents a few weeks earlier, in Minneapolis on Jan. 26.\n                \n                    Zaydee Sanchez for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Zaydee Sanchez for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Refugees are \"probably the most vetted\" immigrants   Jane Graupman, executive director of the International Institute of Minnesota, which resettles refugees, said the way they're being treated is \"un-American.\"    \"Refugees are probably the most vetted population that comes to the United States,\" she said. \"The FBI's already checked them. The immigration services already checked them. They've had biometric screenings.\"   Graupman said many of the refugees detained in Texas have also been released out into the streets there.   \"They have no money, no documents, no way to get home,\" she said, adding that one man's employer drove to Texas to bring him back to Minnesota.   The Department of Homeland Security did not answer NPR's questions about why people have been sent to Texas, and whether agents have found evidence of wrongdoing. \"Minnesota is ground zero for the war on fraud,\" it said in a statement.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A. and her husband hold hands inside their home in Minneapolis.

He represents a single mother sent first to Texas and then detained several more days back in Minnesota.   Srodulski said DHS is relying on an arcane statute that allows it to detain people with pending green card applications, but it's not supposed to be used to search for fraud.   \"I ultimately think the goal is cruelty,\" he said. \"And I think somebody poring through the statutes came across this … and decided to make it a practice.\"   \n   While detained, his client did not have the diabetes medication she takes twice a day. At one point she was grilled for seven hours, essentially relitigating her entire refugee case. Srodulski called that highly unusual and said if there were suspected fraud the questions would have been more narrowly focused. With no wrongdoing, she was approved for a green card and has been released.   \"It's very frustrating,\" said Beth Grosen, whose Lutheran church sponsored Srodulski's client when she arrived in the U.S. After the woman's arrest, Grosen helped find a safe place for her son to live and sent money for phone calls from Texas. The woman works at a day care, and after her sudden disappearance no one knew when she'd be back.   \"The parents of the children are heartbroken,\" Grosen said. \"There's ripples throughout our community when crazy things like this happen.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                J.J.'s son holds his younger sister as she draws on a window.\n                \n                    Zaydee Sanchez for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Zaydee Sanchez for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   A familiar fear   Back at the Venezuelan family's apartment, their son explained how he was detained for three days in Minnesota. The room was crowded and he had to sleep with his ankles shackled, anxious the whole time that he'd be deported.   \"They didn't tell me why I was arrested or why I was being released,\" he said.   He wondered if it happened because he was stopped for driving too fast the day before his arrest. The officer saw his key chain and asked if he was from Venezuela.   \"Minneapolis was beautiful. We expected a peaceful life here,\" J.J. said, sitting next to his son and wife on the couch. But now their traumatic ordeal, and the whole immigration crackdown, reminds them of what they fled.   \"In Venezuela, pro-government paramilitary groups act this way. They cover their faces; you can only see their eyes,\" A. said. They kidnapped young men her son's age and some never returned. Now, in the U.S., she said, \"I relived that same fear.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      Amid the partial government shutdown, we hear from House Minority Whip Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., about funding for the Department of Homeland Security.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  So what does accountability in the Department of Homeland Security's immigration enforcement program look like to the people who are holding up government funding to try to get it? We'll ask Representative Katherine Clark from Massachusetts. As minority whip, she is the No. 2 Democrat in the House of Representatives, and she is with us now. Good morning, Representative. Thanks for joining us.KATHERINE CLARK: Good morning, Michel.MARTIN: So before we get to the changes that Democrats like yourself want to see, we've just heard from Luke that the funding bill is on the table probably tomorrow. How is the Democratic leadership recommending lawmakers vote?CLARK: We are having conversations with not only the American people in our districts but across our caucus to see where members are. But this is going to be a vote where members are going to make their own decision. But let me tell you this - Democrats are united that there has to be change, accountability and real reform at ICE. We have to stop the chaos in the streets, the threats to the security of the American people and law-abiding immigrants and make sure that there is investigations into the horrors that we have seen transpire in Minneapolis and St. Paul.MARTIN: So I think what I hear you saying is you're not going to impose party discipline on this vote. Is that what you're saying?CLARK: I am telling you the exact opposite. I'm telling you that there is discipline and unity of message. Now, whether those reforms are, you know, people vote that we need to see them now, and they're not willing to extend DHS budget another day, or whether they're willing to give two weeks to see if the Republicans can find something in them that is going to make them stand up to what we are seeing. Stand up to end this chaos and return security to American streets that Americans are demanding.MARTIN: So House Speaker Mike Johnson was on \"Meet The Press\" yesterday. He said some of the Democrats' demands are reasonable to him. And - while he seemed to imply that others are a nonstarter. Let's just listen to a short clip of what he said.(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MEET THE PRESS\")MIKE JOHNSON: The masks, for example, the additional judicial requirement for a warrant would be a whole other layer of effectively bureaucracy. Remember, the immigration judges have already issued warrants, and that's what the ICE officials are acting upon.MARTIN: What he's referring to there is a new ICE policy that says agents can enter people's homes without a judicial warrant, which legal advocates and even some previous DHS guidance said violates the Constitution. Obviously, you're not going to negotiate with me right here, but what reforms can you tell us are essential for you to approve any additional DHS funding?CLARK: Well, let me tell you what Mike Johnson just said. He just called the Constitution of the United States an extra level of bureaucracy. Let that sink in. What kind of message is that to people that you are saying that despite the requirements of the Fourth Amendment that are clear and are the practice of law enforcement across this country, that Mike Johnson says ICE has an exception to that Constitution. That they can be both the fox guarding the henhouse, as a Texas judge just said, and give themselves warrants to go into your home. That is so outrageous and a violation of the oath that we all take as members of Congress to uphold the Constitution. So we are looking for them to end the chaos. People want secure borders. People want to know that we are deporting criminals. People do not want chaos in their streets. ICE needs to act like every other law enforcement agency.MARTIN: So the judicial warrants is a bottom line for you - for you and other Democrats.CLARK: Yes, of course it is.MARTIN: And the body cameras...CLARK: And removing masks...MARTIN: ...And the masks.CLARK: ...Wearing ID badges, stop storming houses of worship and hospitals and schools. And we want real independent investigations into the murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. We can't even get the Republicans to agree that they shouldn't be detaining and deporting American citizens. So it's time for Mike Johnson, if he is at all serious about protecting the American people, and he has shown us time and again that he is willing to take their health care, to sit by while prices continue to skyrocket because of tariffs, to do nothing to help bring down the costs of childcare and housing and utility bills. And now he is layering on that he is going to allow this chaos in our streets with this paramilitary force without guardrails, without accountability.MARTIN: So last week, you released a joint statement with House Democratic leadership that said the Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem should, quote, \"be fired immediately, or we will commence impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives.\" The president was asked about this over the weekend, and he said that he thinks she's doing a fine job. That would indicate that you all, going forward, more than 180 of your fellow House Democrats have signed on as co-sponsor to Representative Robin Kelly's resolution to impeach Noem. What specifically would be the grounds?CLARK: The grounds would be that she has allowed a part of DHS to let down the American people, to not focus on their security, but to allow ICE to become a tool of political retribution for this president. She named Renee Good a domestic terrorist within hours without investigation and is still refusing to do an investigation. The list of things that Kristi Noem has done to threaten the security of the American people is lengthy. And we are proceeding. We are going to be the voice of the American people in Congress who are demanding accountability. We are going to build our case. We will continue to hold town halls, investigative hearings. We will be listening and collecting evidence. And together with the American people, we will hold Kristi Noem and the GOP accountable for the abuses of this lawless administration.MARTIN: Before we let you go - we only have about 30 seconds here - what confidence would you have that the president wouldn't immediately nominate somebody with the exact same policy and tactical perspective that she has?CLARK: We will deal with that when we get there. But right now, we have to draw a line in the sand and say that Kristi Noem is not fit to be in charge of the security of the American people. DHS has a very important mission, and she has let the American people down and is increasing the chaos and the violence that we are seeing against people on our streets.MARTIN: That is House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts. Representative Clark, thank you for joining us.CLARK: Thank you, Michel.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

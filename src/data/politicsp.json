Trump announced ahead of the meeting that board members have pledged $5 billion for reconstruction, a fraction of the estimated $70 billion needed to rebuild the Palestinian territory decimated after two years of war. Members are expected to unveil commitments of thousands of personnel to international stabilization and police forces for the territory.   \n   \"We have the greatest leaders in the world joining the Board of Peace,\" Trump told reporters earlier this week. \"I think it has the chance to be the most consequential board ever assembled of any kind.\"   \n   The board was initiated as part of Trump's 20-point peace plan to end the conflict in Gaza. But since the October ceasefire, Trump's vision for the board has morphed and he wants it to have an even more ambitious remit — one that will not only complete the Herculean task of bringing lasting peace between Israel and Hamas but will also help resolve conflicts around the globe.   But ahead of the board's first gathering, the Gaza ceasefire deal remains fragile and Trump's expanded vision for it has triggered fears the U.S. president is looking to create a rival to the United Nations. Trump earlier this week said he hoped the board would push the U.N. to \"get on the ball.\"   \"The United Nations has great potential,\" he said. \"They haven't lived up to the potential.\"   Some US allies remain skeptical   More than 40 countries and the European Union have confirmed they will send officials to Thursday's meeting, according to a senior administration official who was not authorized to comment publicly. Germany, Italy, Norway and Switzerland are among more than a dozen countries that have not joined the board but are expected to attend as observers, the official said.   \n   The U.N. Security Council held a high-level meeting Wednesday on the ceasefire deal and Israel's efforts to expand control in the West Bank. The U.N. session in New York was originally scheduled for Thursday but was moved up after Trump announced the board's meeting for the same date and it became clear that it would complicate travel plans for diplomats planning to attend both.   Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin told reporters earlier this week that \"at the international level it should above all be the U.N. that manages these crisis situations.\" The Trump administration on Wednesday pushed back on the Vatican's concerns.   \n   \"This president has a very bold and ambitious plan and vision to rebuild and reconstruct Gaza, which is well underway because of the Board of Peace,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. \"This is a legitimate organization where there are tens of member countries from around the world.\"   Mike Waltz, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., also pushed back on skeptical allies, saying the board is \"not talking, it is doing.\"   \"We are hearing the chattering class criticizing the structure of the board, that it's unconventional, that it's unprecedented,\" Waltz said. \"Again, the old ways were not working.\"   Questions about disarming Hamas   Central to Thursday's discussions will be creating an armed international stabilization force to keep security and ensure the disarming of the militant Hamas group, a key demand of Israel and a cornerstone of the ceasefire deal.   But thus far, only Indonesia has offered a firm commitment to Trump for the proposed force. And Hamas has provided little confidence that it is willing to move forward on disarmament. The administration is \"under no illusions on the challenges regarding demilitarization\" but has been encouraged by what mediators have reported back, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.   \n   Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto pledged to work closely with other leading Islamic countries invited by Trump to \"join in the endeavors to try to achieve lasting peace in Palestine.\"   \"We recognize there are still obstacles to be overcome, but at least my position is at least we have to try, and we have to do our best,\" he said at an event at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday, where he met with members of the business community.   On Thursday, updates are expected from the Gaza Executive Board, the operational arm of the board, about its efforts to create a functioning government system and services for the territory, according to the official who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the broad outlines of the meeting.   In addition to Trump, the official said other speakers at the conference would include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, the executive board's high representative Nickolay Mladenov, and Waltz.   Michael Hanna, U.S. program director at the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit group focused on preventing conflicts, suggested the skepticism some U.S. allies are showing is not unwarranted.   \"Without any clear authorization for the expansion of its mandate beyond Gaza, it is unsurprising that many U.S. allies and partners have chosen to decline Trump's offer to join the board,\" Hanna said. \"Instead, many of the states most invested in Gaza's future have signed up with the hope of focusing U.S. attention and encouraging Trump himself to use the influence and leverage he has with Israel.\"\n",

Ford embarked on the first of its sea trials to test various state-of-the-art systems on its own power for the first time, April 8, 2017, from Newport News, Va.\n                \n                    Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Ridge Leoni/AP/U.S. Navy\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Ridge Leoni/AP/U.S. Navy\n    \n\n   \n   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran and the United States leaned into gunboat diplomacy Thursday as nuclear talks between the nations hung in the balance, with Tehran holding drills with Russia and the Americans bringing another aircraft carrier closer to the Mideast.   The Iranian drill and the arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier near the mouth of the Mediterranean Sea underscore the tensions between the nations. Iran earlier this week also launched a drill that involved live-fire in the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow opening of the Persian Gulf through which a fifth of the world's traded oil passes.   \n   The movements of additional American warships and airplanes don't guarantee a U.S. strike on Iran — but it does give President Donald Trump the ability to carry out one should he choose to do so. He's so far held off on striking Iran after setting red lines over the killing of peaceful protesters and Tehran holding mass executions, while reengaging Tehran in nuclear talks earlier disrupted by the Iran-Israel war in June.   \n   \"Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia, and the Airfield located in Fairford, in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social website, seeking to pressure the United Kingdom over its plans to settle the future of the Chagos Islands with Mauritius.   Meanwhile, Iran struggles with unrest at home following its crackdown on protests, with mourners now holding ceremonies honoring their dead 40 days after their killing by security forces. Some of the gatherings have included anti-government cries, despite threats from authorities.   Iran holds drill with Russia   The drill Thursday saw Iranian forces and Russian sailors conduct operations in the Gulf of Oman and the Indian Ocean, Iran's state-run IRNA news agency reported. The drill will be aimed at \"upgrading operational coordination as well as exchange of military experiences,\" IRNA added.   \n   China had joined the \"Security Belt\" drill in previous years, but there was no acknowledgment it participated in this round. In recent days, a vessel that appeared to be a Steregushchiy-class Russian corvette had been seen at a military port in the Iranian city of Bandar Abbas.   Iran also issued a rocket-fire warning to pilots in the region, suggesting they planned to launch anti-ship missiles in the exercise.   \n   Meanwhile, tracking data showed the Ford off the coast of Morocco in the Atlantic Ocean midday Wednesday, meaning the carrier could transit through Gibraltar and potentially station in the eastern Mediterranean with its supporting guided-missile destroyers.   Having the carrier there could allow American forces to have extra aircraft and anti-missile power to potentially protect Israel and Jordan should a conflict break out with Iran. The U.S. similarly placed warships there during the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip to protect against Iranian fire.   Anti-government chants made at mourning ceremonies   Mourning ceremonies for those killed by security forces in the protests last month also have increased. Iranians traditionally mark the death of a loved one 40 days after the loss. Both witnesses and social media videos showed memorials taking place at Tehran's massive Behesht-e Zahra cemetery. Some memorials included people chanting against Iran's theocracy while singing nationalistic songs.   The demonstrations began Dec. 28 at Tehran's historic Grand Bazaar, initially over the collapse of Iran's currency, the rial, then spread across the country. Tensions exploded on Jan. 8, with demonstrations called for by Iran's exiled crown prince, Reza Pahlavi.   \n   Iran's government has offered only one death toll for the violence, with 3,117 people killed. The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which has been accurate in previous rounds of unrest in Iran, puts the death toll at over 7,000 killed, with many more feared dead.\n",

Today's top stories   Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg will take the stand in Los Angeles today in a trial that could reshape social media. The plaintiffs are accusing platforms like Instagram and Facebook of being intentionally designed to hook teenagers, sparking a nationwide youth mental health crisis. The case hinges on whether the tech companies engineer \"defective products\" to exploit vulnerabilities in young people's brains.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg will testify Wednesday in a major lawsuit against social media companies that claims their products are defective and harmful to children.\n                \n                    Nic Coury/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Nic Coury/AP\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 For years, social media companies have avoided legal consequences by using a legal shield known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, NPR's Bobby Allyn says. The law protects online platforms from liability for user-generated content by treating sites as intermediaries rather than publishers. Now, lawyers are suing the tech companies under product liability laws. They argue that the platforms are essentially defective products because of features such as infinite scroll and autoplay. The plaintiffs say that the social media sites' impact on children's brains is similar to that of a slot machine and that the companies should be held accountable. If the jury sides with the plaintiffs, the case could result in a multi-billion-dollar settlement and significant changes to social media apps' operations.   \n   Tricia McLaughlin, the public face of the Trump administration's mass deportation policies, is leaving the Department of Homeland Security. The agency confirmed her exit yesterday from her role as the DHS' assistant secretary for public affairs. McLaughlin's departure comes as the agency is shut down after lawmakers failed to pass a budget to fund it through the end of the fiscal year.   The U.S. and Iran have committed to further negotiations after representatives from the two countries held indirect talks in Geneva this week. Both parties said they would meet again to attempt to reach a deal on Iran's nuclear program. The Trump administration wants Iran to have no nuclear weapons and zero enrichment. Iran insists it has the right to enrich uranium for research and civilian usage.    🎧 The next meeting is expected to be in a couple of weeks, NPR's Jackie Northam says. Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said yesterday's meeting was constructive and negotiators made some progress. However, Araghchi added that there is still more work to be done before the two countries meet again.   Warner Bros. Discovery has given CBS' parent company, Paramount Skydance, one last chance to sweeten its bid against Netflix for the company. The news comes as Anderson Cooper announced his departure from 60 Minutes after nearly two decades as a correspondent. Stephen Colbert also recently accused CBS of blocking an interview with Democratic Senate candidate James Talarico from airing on TV.    \n   🎧 The recent headlines should not be seen as separate incidents, NPR's David Folkenflik tells Up First. The Ellison family, who are behind Paramount, is close to President Trump and wants to stay on his good side. The family's connection to the president has shaped decisions surrounding the company's news division. One of those choices is the network's recent pick for CBS News' editor-in-chief, Bari Weiss. She came to CBS with the proposition that the mainstream media is too woke and anti-Trump, Folkenflik says. He adds that many of her decisions have been unwelcome by the journalists at CBS. Cooper says he is leaving the show to spend more time with his children. NPR spoke to three associates, who are not authorized to discuss what is happening within CBS, who say Cooper has also expressed concerns about Weiss' leadership.

The growth of the 287(g) program is one of the most visible shifts in Trump's immigration strategy. In 2019, during Trump's first term, local police agencies signed just 45 of these 287(g) agreements. As of Feb. 13, ICE reported 1,412 active agreements across 40 states and territories — signing over 1,130 of them in 2025 alone. Here's a look at how the program works:    ➡️ The jail enforcement model of the program involves local authorities checking everyone entering jail with criminal convictions or pending charges for legal U.S. status. If they are in the country illegally, ICE will be notified, and they will be held in jail pending ICE removal.➡️ The warrant service officer model, similarly to the jail enforcement model, allows police to execute administrative warrants on migrants in their jails.➡️ The task force model of the program allows officers to stop, question and make arrests for immigration violations. This model makes up the majority of 287(g) agreements in place, according to ICE data.➡️ The Department of Homeland Security says task force model training includes 40 hours of education on immigration law, ICE's Use of Force policy, civil rights law and more. Previously, local police needed about a month of training to obtain certification.   \n   Life advice   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Westend61/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   There are times when you meet someone and the conversation just flows, and you want to know more about them. Then you might say, \"We should get together sometime.\" This statement can be vague. Kat Vellos, author of We Should Get Together: The Secret to Cultivating Better Friendships, says the best thing you can do is schedule an actual time to hang out. In a conversation with Life Kit, she shared some insight on how to turn a stranger into a friend:    🫂 The spark can fizzle out if you wait too long to see the person again. Research shows that if you spend a lot of time together at the beginning of the relationship, it is more likely to stick.🫂 Try picking a memorable activity you can do together. Doing something out of the ordinary will give you both a memory you can share.🫂 Remember, it is OK that this person might not be your bestie. There are different levels of friendship. You might also decide it is best for you both to be strangers.   For tips on how to make a friendship stick, listen to this episode of NPR's Life Kit.

The president wants the government he leads to pay him billions of dollars.   Trump has filed multiple claims arguing he's been hurt by Justice Department investigations and the leak of his tax returns years ago. Now it's up to his own political appointees to determine whether to settle with their boss — and for how much taxpayer money.   \"There is a glaring conflict of interest with Trump being on both sides of the claim,\" said Edward Whelan, a former lawyer at the Justice Department and a political conservative who once clerked for the late Justice Antonin Scalia. \"It is outrageous that he and those answering to him would be deciding how the government responds to these extravagant claims.\"   \n   Unfinished business   For Trump, filing lawsuits, including those that are frivolous or where he has little chance of success, has long been standard operating procedure, a way of communicating displeasure. A White House official, speaking on background because he was not authorized to speak on the record, said these claims amount to unfinished business for the president.   It's clear they have been weighing on his mind. In December, Trump was in North Carolina nearing the end of a speech about the economy when out of nowhere, he started talking about the FBI search of his Florida resort in 2022.   \"I had these animals trying to attack me at Mar-a-Lago,\" he said. \"They went into my wife's closet.\"   \n   Federal agents seized classified documents from a bathroom, a ballroom and an office, part of a sprawling and court-approved investigation into unlawful retention of government secrets and alleged obstruction of justice.   The president viewed that search as an attack, part of an ongoing weaponization of the government against him personally. So, he filed a claim with the Department of Justice, seeking $230 million over the Florida operation and an earlier probe into his campaign's ties to Russia.   \"And they do say that, you know, it's never been a case like this,\" the president said at a rally this December, taking on the animated voice of a newscaster. \"'Donald Trump sues the United States of America. Donald Trump becomes president. And now Donald Trump has to settle the suit.'\"   \n   Trump was out of office when the administrative claims were first filed. The Russia investigation ended with no charges against Trump. Then, after he won the 2024 election, the Justice Department abandoned its appeal of the classified documents case against him in Florida. And now Trump finds himself on both sides of the dispute.   \"But isn't that a strange position to be in,\" the president said at the rally. \"I've gotta make a deal. I negotiate with myself.\"   \"An order of magnitude greater\"   There's a process in place at the Justice Department for people who say they've been harmed by the federal government.   In the normal course of business, those claims get evaluated by career lawyers. They rarely involve high profile criminal investigations like Trump's.   \"Some of them are run of the mill, right?\" said Rupa Bhattacharyya, a former Justice Department lawyer who evaluated these kinds of allegations. \"Postal vehicles get into traffic accidents, VA doctors have malpractice claims brought against them, people slip and fall in federal buildings.\"   Even in the most serious cases, like ones that involved injuries to people cleaning up after the terrorist attack on Sept. 11, 2001, Bhattacharyya said the payouts almost never amounted to more than $10 million.   \n   Trump wants a lot more than that — 23 times more — for the Justice Department investigations against him.   \"Two hundred thirty million dollars would be an order of magnitude greater than any administrative settlement the department has ever agreed to in a Federal Tort Claims Act case,\" said Bhattacharyya.   Typically, the Justice Department would fight claims in court and defend the work of its career prosecutors and FBI agents. And in this case, they would have strong legal defenses. After all, a federal judge approved the search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago property — finding probable cause.   Given how much money is at stake, people at the top of the Justice Department would make the final call. And that adds another complication.   \n   Attorney General Pam Bondi and Todd Blanche, her deputy, both used to work as Trump's personal attorneys. The third-in-command at Justice, Stanley Woodward, represented Trump's valet, who was charged as an alleged co-conspirator in the Mar-a-Lago case.   \n   \"The fear that many have is that the Department of Justice will simply fold and ask Donald Trump the individual how much money Donald Trump's administration should funnel to him,\" said Whelan, the former DOJ lawyer.   In a recent interview with NBC's Tom Llamas, Trump didn't do anything to bat down the suggestion that he would be the final decider. \"Well, what I would do, tell them to pay me but I'll give 100% of the money to charity,\" the president said.   A $10 billion lawsuit   But Trump wasn't just upset about those old Justice Department investigations. He had more scores to settle. Last month he filed another claim against the federal government, a $10 billion lawsuit over the 2019 leak of his tax returns by a contractor for the Internal Revenue Service.   Experts in tax law say that case has some big flaws. For one thing, the statute of limitations seems to have expired. What's more, the leak took place during Trump's first term in office, so the president is suing the government for actions that occurred when he was in charge. The contractor is currently serving prison time for the leak.   \n   Congressional Democrats pressed top administration officials about the IRS case in recent weeks. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told lawmakers it was an issue for the Justice Department, which is defending the Treasury and IRS in the case.   In a separate hearing, Attorney General Bondi didn't shine any additional light, telling a senator she would not discuss pending litigation.   A Justice Department spokesperson told NPR: \"In any circumstance, all officials at the Department of Justice follow the guidance of career ethics officials.\"   \n   Last summer, Bondi fired the top in-house ethics lawyer at the Justice Department, after he said he raised questions about gifts and tickets to her.   \n   Taxpayer-funded settlement   Whelan, the conservative lawyer, said one solution is to pause the IRS case until Trump is no longer president.   If the Justice Department eventually approves a settlement, the money would come from something called the judgment fund, a taxpayer funded pot of money.   Bhattacharyya said that means \"the American people are on the hook for these claims if liability is assessed against the government.\"   A spokesman for Trump's private legal team said in a statement, \"The IRS wrongly allowed a rogue, politically-motivated employee to leak private and confidential information about President Trump, his family, and the Trump Organization to the New York Times, ProPublica and other left-wing news outlets, which was then illegally released to millions of people. President Trump continues to hold those who wrong America and Americans accountable.\"   \n   Pressed during a recent press gaggle on Air Force One on whether it is fair to ask the American people to pay out such a large settlement, Trump dismissed any concern, insisting that anything he wins would go to charity.   \"They give money to charity anyway,\" Trump said. \"They give $40 billion a year to charity, our government.\"   It's unclear where Trump pulled that number. The White House did not respond to questions about it or which charities would get the money.   But at a time when Americans say their top concern is the cost of living and making ends meet, the idea of the president receiving a massive windfall from the government he leads may not sit well with voters — even if it is donated to charity.\n",

    "body": "\n      President Trump's unpredictable rhetoric and actions when it comes to foreign policy amount to what some experts call a \"madman strategy.\" Other analysts say Trump is actually a realist in this area.   \n\n    AILSA CHANG, HOST:  If there is one thing you can say when it comes to President Trump's foreign policy, it's that he likes to keep people on their toes. Trying to pin down Trump's vision of global affairs has, in fact, become a parlor game of sorts for foreign policy specialists who are searching for just the right label. NPR international affairs correspondent Jackie Northam looks at some of the theories.JACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: Last month, President Trump made it clear he wanted the U.S. to acquire Greenland, by military force if necessary. Then at the World Economic Forum in Davos, he seemed uncharacteristically coy.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Would you like me to say a few words of Greenland?NORTHAM: Trump announced he wouldn't use force against Greenland but sent a clear warning he still wanted the island in a way that left his audience guessing.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: They have a choice. You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no, and we will remember.NORTHAM: For many, such a move made no sense. But Stacie Goddard, a political science professor at Wellesley College, says Trump's moves seem incoherent because you're looking at them through the wrong lens.STACIE GODDARD: And it becomes really logical if you apply this kind of 16th century dynastic politics - say, \"Game Of Thrones.\"NORTHAM: Goddard says Trump is using a neo-royalist approach to foreign affairs, shifting policies at whim and using his enormous power as leverage. Goddard argues this imperious approach has less to do with the country's national interests and more to do with ensuring Trump's personal wealth and status.GODDARD: So he is the absolute sovereign.NORTHAM: A sovereign surrounded by a royal clique.GODDARD: Some of it is family. Some of it are loyalists. Some of them are financiers, you know, people who can actually give him the capital to do what he wants to do, and he can also pay them the spoils. And then there are also the ideologues, the people surrounding him that are giving him the legitimacy that he needs in order to be able to conduct this foreign policy.NORTHAM: Seva Gunitsky, an associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto, agrees the Trump administration operates with all the power concentrated on one individual. Gunitsky calls it a personalist style of foreign policy, which is an extension of one person's ego or psyche.SEVA GUNITSKY: Personalist leaders - they're driven purely by their own private fixations, their own incentives, not coherent national interests. And for Trump, those incentives are, you know, being flattered, not being mocked.NORTHAM: Gunitsky points to a letter Trump sent earlier this year to the prime minister of Norway trying to justify an invasion of Greenland.GUNITSKY: Where he said, you know, I've been denied the Nobel Peace Prize, and therefore, I'm no longer going to be the peace president - that's a clear indication of where his personal grievances interact with national policies.NORTHAM: But Trump's erratic rhetoric and actions could just be an act, says Roseanne McManus, a political science professor at Penn State University. She says since his first presidential campaign, Trump has claimed that U.S. foreign policy needed to be more unpredictable. McManus says Trump is employing what she calls a madman strategy.ROSEANNE MCMANUS: I think Trump doesn't really want people to know what he's thinking or how far he's willing to go. You know, it's not clear what strategy he's going to use at any time.NORTHAM: McManus says Trump's rhetoric suggests he's aware of his madness reputation and thinks it helps him get what he wants.MCMANUS: You don't actually have to follow through every single time. People just have to believe that there's some chance you might do absolutely anything.NORTHAM: Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a Mideast analyst at Rice University's Baker Institute, believes Trump is more of a realist when it comes to foreign policy - power through strength.KRISTIAN COATES ULRICHSEN: He feels that the U.S. has the upper hand and that maybe other leaders in the past haven't acted as he would see it in the U.S. national interest, by putting U.S. interests first and foremost.NORTHAM: Including invading another country.COATES ULRICHSEN: To the extent that the U.S. has the capability and the power to do that, I think he probably thinks, why wouldn't we do it if we can?NORTHAM: There are plenty of other theories about Trump's approach to foreign policy - isolationist, sovereign decisionist, the Monroe Doctrine, which has morphed into the Donroe (ph) Doctrine. Some believe Trump's style is based on reality TV. Trump's handling of foreign policy could be a bit of all of these. Only one person knows, and he's not telling.

A lawsuit filed in Boston says orders by President Donald Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum have forced park service staff to remove or censor exhibits that share factually accurate and relevant U.S. history and scientific knowledge, including about slavery and climate change.   \n   Separately, LGBTQ+ rights advocates and historic preservationists sued the park service Tuesday for removing a rainbow Pride flag from the Stonewall National Monument, the New York site that commemorates a foundational moment in the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement.   The changes at exhibits came in response to a Trump executive order \"restoring truth and sanity to American history\" at the nation's museums, parks and landmarks. It directed the Interior Department to ensure those sites do not display elements that \"inappropriately disparage Americans past or living.\" Burgum later directed removal of \"improper partisan ideology\" from museums, monuments, landmarks and other public exhibits under federal control.   \n   The groups behind the lawsuit said that a federal campaign to review interpretive materials has escalated in recent weeks, leading to the removal of numerous exhibits that discuss the history of slavery and enslaved people, civil rights, treatment of Indigenous peoples, climate science, and other \"core elements of the American experience.\"   \n   The suit was filed by a coalition that includes the National Parks Conservation Association, American Association for State and Local History, Association of National Park Rangers and Union of Concerned Scientists. It comes as a federal judge on Monday ordered that an exhibit about nine people enslaved by George Washington must be restored at his former home in Philadelphia.   The park service removed explanatory panels last month from Independence National Historical Park, the site where George and Martha Washington lived with nine of their slaves in the 1790s, when Philadelphia was briefly the nation's capital. The judge ordered the exhibits restored on Presidents Day, the federal holiday honoring Washington's legacy.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                New York politicians and activists prepare to raise a rainbow flag on a pole in Christopher Park across the street from the Stonewall Inn, Thursday, Feb. 12, 2026, in New York, a few days after it was removed by the National Park Service to comply with guidance from the Trump administration.\n                \n                    Yuki Iwamura/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Yuki Iwamura/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Besides the Philadelphia case, the park service has flagged for removal interpretive materials describing key moments in the civil rights movement, the groups said. For example, at the Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail in Alabama, officials have flagged about 80 items for removal.   \n   The permanent exhibit at Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park in Kansas has been flagged because it mentions \"equity,\" the lawsuit says. Signage that has disappeared from Grand Canyon National Park said settlers pushed Native American tribes \"off their land\" for the park to be established and \"exploited\" the landscape for mining and grazing. At Glacier National Park in Montana, Park Service officials ordered removal of materials describing the effect of climate change on the park and its role in driving the disappearance of glaciers, the suit said.   \"Censoring science and erasing America's history at national parks are direct threats to everything these amazing places, and our country, stand for,\" said Alan Spears, senior director of cultural resources at the parks conservation association.   \n   \"National parks serve as living classrooms for our country, where science and history come to life for visitors,\" Spears added. \"As Americans, we deserve national parks that tell stories of our country's triumphs and heartbreaks alike. We can handle the truth.\"   The Interior Department said Tuesday it has appealed the court's ruling in the Philadelphia case. Updated interpretive materials \"providing a fuller account of the history of slavery at Independence Hall would have been installed in the coming days\" in the absence of a court order, an Interior spokesperson said in an email.   \n   The new lawsuit is premature and \"based on inaccurate and mischaracterized information,'' White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said Tuesday.   \"The Department of the Interior is engaged in an ongoing review of our nation's American history exhibits in accordance with the president's executive order,\" but actions are not yet finalized, she said.   U.S. District Judge Cynthia Rufe ruled Monday that all materials from the Philadelphia exhibit must be restored in their original condition while a lawsuit challenging the removal's legality plays out. She prohibited Trump officials from installing replacements that explain the history differently.   \n   Rufe, an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush, began her written order with a quote from George Orwell's dystopian novel \"1984\" and compared the Trump administration to the book's totalitarian regime called the Ministry of Truth, which revised historical records to align with its own narrative.   The lawsuit over the Stonewall flag calls its removal \"the latest example in a long line of efforts by the Trump administration to target the LGBTQ+ community for discrimination and opprobrium.\"   The Pride flag was installed in 2022, becoming the first such banner to fly permanently on federal land. After the banner vanished this month, the park service cited a Jan. 21 memo that largely limits the agency to displaying Interior and POW/MIA flags, although exemptions include providing \"historical context.\"   The lawsuit argues the rainbow flag provided such context and says the park service continues to make exceptions for other banners, including Confederate ones, that help explain certain sites' history. New York politicians and activists raised their own Pride flag at the Stonewall monument on Thursday.   The Interior Department on Tuesday repeated past criticisms of New York City and its Democratic officeholders, who aren't party to the suit.   Jeff Mow, who retired in 2022 as superintendent at Glacier, said the park service \"has always taken great pride in its scholarly research, its focus on telling the truth and being very straightforward about that.\" He called Trump's order a \"disservice\" to the public, \"and it makes it very hard for those that are trying to do their jobs and being storytellers and speaking the truth.\"   \"You cannot tell the story of America without recognizing both the beauty and the tragedy of our history,\" said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, a nonprofit legal organization that filed the lawsuit on behalf of the advocacy groups.\n",

Bondi has defended the Justice Department's prosecutions during her tenure.\n                \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Win McNamee/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Some of the nation's leading defense lawyers have been trying to wrap their heads around what they consider abnormal behavior by the U.S. Department of Justice over the past year.   Now, they're debuting a tool to help track criminal cases that appear to involve irregular charging practices, including aggressive legal theories and possible political retribution against President Trump's foes.    \"We created the Case Tracker because you cannot defend against an enemy you cannot see,\" said Steven Salky, a lawyer in the Washington, D.C., area who oversees the project. \"The Tracker is intended to spotlight for the next several years the unusual cases being prosecuted by the Department of Justice.\"   \n   The new database includes the federal cases against Sean Charles Dunn, who threw a sub sandwich at a federal immigration officer, and Jacob Samuel Winkler, a homeless man accused of directing a laser pointer toward the Marine One presidential helicopter. Juries in Washington, D.C., acquitted both men.   \n   The tracker, sponsored by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL), also monitors cases where government charges of resisting federal law enforcement have been undercut by videos and eyewitness accounts from protesters.   Last week, in testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Pam Bondi batted away allegations that politics have motivated federal law enforcement decisions.   \"I came into office with the goal of refocusing the Department of Justice on its core mission after years of bloated bureaucracy and political weaponization,\" Bondi said. \"The Department of Justice's core mission is to fight violent crime; protect the American people; and defend the rule of law above all else. While our work is never done, we have made tremendous progress to make America safe again.\"   \n   But judges and juries have been turning a skeptical eye toward the work of the Justice Department. Federal jurists have questioned whether the executive branch is complying with court orders on immigration and other issues at the heart of Trump's agenda — giving rise to concerns that federal prosecutors will no longer get the benefit of the doubt in court.   Grand juries across the U.S. have rejected efforts by prosecutors to bring indictments, once considered to be a cinch because of the low bar to charge defendants at that early stage in the criminal process.   \n   The new tracker features a map that allows people to follow some of these trends across states, a way to search for specific statutes, and links to key court filings and judges' decisions.   \"This tracker is an essential tool for an era where federal overreach has become the standard operating procedure,\" said NACDL Executive Director Lisa Wayne.\n",

You're reading the Up First newsletter. Subscribe here to get it delivered to your inbox, and listen to the Up First podcast for all the news you need to start your day.   Today's top stories   President Trump convenes the first-ever meeting of the Board of Peace today at the Donald J. Trump U.S. Institute for Peace in Washington. The president says he created the group to oversee his Gaza ceasefire plan and that member states have already pledged $5 billion for Gaza's reconstruction. At today's event, Trump will address heads of state and top diplomats from around 40 countries, including the European Union.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                People snap photos outside the United States Peace Institute, with the recently added name of President Trump.\n                \n                    Allison Robbert/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Allison Robbert/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Today's meeting is significant because the next steps in the ceasefire deal that Trump pushed through last October remain unclear, NPR's Aya Batrawy tells Up First. Additionally, officials could unveil which countries made the initial pledges for reconstruction efforts. The $5 billion commitment is only a fraction of what Gaza needs. The money would go toward the Trump administration's vision for a new Gaza under Israeli control and not to the area where Palestinians are living, Batrawy says. Currently, Israeli forces occupy over half of Gaza, leaving some 2 million Palestinians in dire conditions in a sliver by the sea that Hamas governs. Among the topics that nations could discuss today is a crucial step in Trump's ceasefire plan, which involves the deployment of thousands of international troops into Gaza.   \n   U.K. police have arrested a man in his 60s on suspicion of \"misconduct in public office.\" U.K. media reports that this man is Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew. Police have investigated whether Mountbatten-Windsor shared confidential government information with his late friend, convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, while he was U.K.'s trade envoy. Mountbatten-Windsor admits to ties to Epstein and settled a lawsuit with one of Epstein's underage victims, but denies wrongdoing. The media spotted several vehicles at the royals' Sandringham estate this morning, NPR's Lauren Frayer, who is in London, confirms. Mountbatten-Windsor turns 66 today. He has been living at the estate since being evicted from his royal cottage on the grounds of Windsor Castle.   The U.S. has concluded another round of talks in an effort to end the war in Ukraine. While the White House pressures Kyiv to make concessions, it is negotiating with Moscow. Today, Russia's negotiator offered $14 trillion in deals if the U.S. drops its sanctions.    🎧 Russia is tempting the White House with huge potential profits because the Kremlin knows the Trump administration views diplomacy through a business lens, NPR's Charles Maynes says. Moscow suggests that lifting sanctions and achieving \"peace\" would unlock American investment in rare earth minerals, energy, and mining. Russia continues to insist its victory in Ukraine is inevitable, despite the glacial pace of its gains and heavy battlefield losses. Russia's talking points are designed to convince Trump that Ukraine's surrender serves everyone's interests. Ukraine continues to refuse demands to surrender territory.   \n   Trump is demanding billions of dollars from his own government by filing multiple claims against the Justice Department. He argues that past investigations and the leak of his tax returns years ago hurt him. Now, he has forced his own political appointees to decide whether to pay their boss with taxpayer funds. These claims amount to unfinished business for the president, says a White House official, who was not authorized to speak on the record.

The action prompted outcry over the racist trope. The White House deleted the post, and Trump deflected the blame to an aide. Scholars and civil rights advocates, steeped in the language and aesthetics of white nationalism, find the post to be part of an overtly racist trope. They say it fits a year-long pattern where extremist rhetoric, visual material and other media have found their way into public messaging from federal agencies.    ➡️ The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is behind the most notable examples of extremist themes in federal messages, some extremist researchers say. The agency has generated a body of propaganda in its effort to recruit large numbers of new federal agents.➡️ Researchers cite the characterization of immigration as an \"invasion,\" federal calls to \"defend the homeland\" and the promotion of \"remigration\" as examples where the administration has mainstreamed once-fringe concepts.➡️ The Trump administration dismissed connections between its messages and white nationalist movements. A DHS spokesperson suggested NPR is \"manufacturing outrage\" when responding to questions about the connections.

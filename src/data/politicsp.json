It was an early target of the Department of Government Efficiency this year.   On Wednesday, the State Department said it renamed the organization to the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace to \"reflect the greatest dealmaker in our nation's history.\" The new name could be seen on its building, which is near the State Department.   \n   Trump has spent months openly lobbying for a Nobel Peace Prize even though he was passed over for this year's installment — arguing he had a hand in easing a series of conflicts around the world. But Trump has also ordered strikes on suspected drug vessels off the coast of Venezuela and repeatedly threatened that attacks on land could be coming, which would be an act of war against that country.   The takeover of the Peace Institute was also anything but peaceful, with his administration seizing the independent entity and ousting its board before actually affixing his name to the building.   Anna Kelly, a White House spokesperson, said: \"The United States Institute of Peace was once a bloated, useless entity that blew $50 million per year while delivering no peace. Now, the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace, which is both beautifully and aptly named after a President who ended eight wars in less than a year, will stand as a powerful reminder of what strong leadership can accomplish for global stability.\"   She added, \"Congratulations, world!\"   George Foote, a lawyer for the former Institute leadership and staff, said the renaming \"adds insult to injury.\"   \"A federal judge has already ruled that the government's armed takeover was illegal. That judgment is stayed while the government appeals, which is the only reason the government continues to control the building,\" Foote said.   \n   Since March, the headquarters has switched hands multiple times in court actions related to the DOGE takeover. A final decision on its fate is pending in federal appeals court.   USIP has maintained the organization is an independent creation of Congress and outside the president's executive authority. The administration argues it is an executive branch organization.   After Trump fired the institute's board in the the spring, the staff was fired as well and the building was turned over to the General Services Administration.   A federal district court overturned the action in May, putting the headquarters back into the hands of USIP leadership. But that action was reversed weeks later by a federal appeals court.   \n   Employees at this juncture have been fired twice and the building is in GSA's possession.   The building is expected to be the backdrop for the signing of a peace agreement Thursday between Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi and Rwanda's President Paul Kagame. High-ranking officials from the African Union, Angola, Burundi, Kenya, Togo, Qatar, Uganda and the United Arab Emirates are also expected to attend the signing, according to Yolande Makolo, a senior adviser to Kagame.   The USIP website remained unchanged Wednesday night, but its lead item was headlined, \"President Donald J. Trump to Sign Historic Peace Agreement at USIP Headquarters,\" followed by a write-up of the deal between Congo and Rwanda that Trump was overseeing at the institute on Thursday.   The Institute of Peace was created by Congress in the 1980s. President Ronald Reagan signed the bill into law in 1985. Described as an independent, nonprofit think tank funded by Congress, its mission has been to work to promote peace and prevent and end conflicts while working outside normal channels such as the State Department. It was operating in 26 conflict zones, including Pakistan, Afghanistan, Mali and Burkina Faso, when DOGE shut the operation down.   \n   There is also broad speculation that Trump will be awarded a new peace prize from FIFA on the sidelines of the World Cup draw, happening in Washington on Friday.\n",

On Tuesday, Trump called Somali immigrants \"garbage\" and said he wanted to send them \"back to where they came from.\" He continued on Wednesday, saying, \"they've destroyed our country and all they do is complain, complain, complain.\"   The tirade came less than two weeks after Trump threatened to strip temporary legal protections from Somali migrants living in Minnesota.   \n   Trump and other conservatives have also recently seized on criminal investigations and news reports of fraud in Minnesota's social services system — some of which was allegedly committed by Somalis — to disparage the entire community.   Now, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement plans to target Minnesota and its Somali population in an upcoming immigration enforcement operation, The Associated Press and other outlets reported this week.   Nearly 80,000 people of Somali descent currently live in Minnesota, roughly 78% of whom reside in the Twin Cities, according to the St. Paul-based group Wilder Research.   But it didn't begin with the Twin Cities. Rather, some of the first Somali immigrants to enter the U.S. in the late 1990s came to a town called Marshall, about 150 miles west of Minneapolis, according to Minnesota author Ahmed Ismail Yusuf, who wrote the book Somalis in Minnesota.   \n   Somalia at the time was gripped by a civil war that caused hundreds of thousands of people to flee the country located in the Horn of Africa, and some of those who came to the U.S. found work at a Marshall meat-packing plant. As word got out about work opportunities in Marshall, other Somali refugees arrived in the region and got jobs in the hospitality industry, as taxi drivers and more, Yusuf said, forming a sizable Somali community in and around the Twin Cities.   \n   \"Those people who were hired, they brought their families. And when they brought their families with them, their families of course brought their children with them,\" he said.   The Somali refugees who settled in Minneapolis and St. Paul were also attracted by the fact that Minnesota was known for martisoor, which translates to \"hospitality\" in Somali. Yusuf said the state's \"liberal attitude and social behavior\" mirrored the immigrants' own values.   For some Somali refugees, the transition to living in Minnesota hasn't been entirely smooth. Some religious Somalis have faced barriers in practicing their Islamic faith, which can involve praying multiple times per day and the wearing of a hijab for Muslim women, according to the Minnesota Historical Society.   The society said the Somali population has also struggled to overcome its association with Islamic extremism, after the community became a recruiting target for ISIS over a decade ago.   Still, Yusuf said the Somali population has continued to grow in Minnesota and find ways to give back. \"Right now, wherever you go, still we're serving the people, we are serving the community, we are serving the state,\" he said.   Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who fled Somalia as a child and came to the U.S. as a refugee, in 2018 became the first Somali American elected to Congress.   Trump said on Wednesday that Omar \"shouldn't be allowed to be a congresswoman, and I'm sure people are looking at that. And she should be thrown the hell out of our country.\"   Omar said in a Tuesday social media post in response to Trump's earlier comments: \"His obsession with me is creepy. I hope he gets the help he desperately needs.\"   She was one of four congresswomen who Trump said in a 2019 tweet should \"go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\" At a rally shortly after his tweet about Omar, Trump paused while some members of the crowd chanted: \"Send her back.\"   \n   Yusuf said the Somali community is now \"a bit under siege\" by the Trump administration, but he noted that it also has the support of city leaders in the Twin Cities, including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter.   \"We are dealing with this,\" Yusuf said, \"but we are not dealing with it alone.\"\n",

On Thursday, The New York Times sued the Defense Department and Secretary Pete Hegseth over its new media policy.\n                \n                    Kevin Wolf/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kevin Wolf/AP\n    \n\n   \n   The New York Times sued Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Thursday over the Pentagon's new policy that requires media outlets to pledge not to gather information unless defense officials formally authorize its release.   That policy, unveiled in September, includes a ban on credentialed journalists reporting even unclassified material that isn't expressly approved for public consumption by Defense Department brass. The Times said the Pentagon policy represents an attempt to force reporters to rely solely upon officials for news involving the military and would unlawfully permit their punishment for failing to do so.   The Times — and NPR — are among the organizations that chose to give up their press passes rather than agree to the policy.   \n   In addition to the Defense Department and Hegseth, the lawsuit names Sean Parnell, the chief Pentagon spokesperson, as a defendant. \"We are aware of the New York Times lawsuit and look forward to addressing these arguments in court,\" Parnell said in a statement.   Despite surrendering their Pentagon credentials, news organizations have been aggressively reporting on military action, including U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites and Venezuelan vessels, breaking news that contradicts official accounts.   Most recently, an inspector general has found that Hegseth's private Signal chats with senior government officials about pending U.S. airstrikes in Yemen could have placed American troops in harm's way. The chats were first revealed by The Atlantic's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, whose number was mistakenly added to the chat. (NPR CEO Katherine Maher is the chairperson of the board of directors of the Signal Foundation, which oversees Signal.)   In its court documents, the Times is arguing that Hegseth's moves violate constitutional protections for free speech and freedom of the press.   \"It is exactly the type of speech and press-restrictive scheme that the Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit have recognized violates the First Amendment,\" states the brief. \"The Policy abandons scrutiny by independent news organizations for the public's benefit.\"   \n   The paper also alleges that the Pentagon violated its reporters' constitutionally protected rights to due process by making a decision on press passes out of the blue and without any path to appeal.   In its filings, the Times legal team invokes a decision from Trump's first term, in which the White House revoked then-Playboy reporter Brian Karem's permanent press pass over his coverage. A federal judge's ruling forced the administration to rescind that decision. The White House also had to return the pass of then-CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta.      The restrictions Hegseth has put in place parallel those taken throughout the second Trump administration against news outlets whose coverage it opposes. Earlier this week, the White House posted online a \"media bias offender tipline,\" inviting tips from the public about news coverage critical of the administration.   The New York Times is being represented by the noted free-speech litigator Theodore J. Boutrous. He is among the lawyers representing NPR in its suit against the White House over Trump's executive order barring all federal subsidies for NPR and PBS. A key hearing in that case is to be held Thursday afternoon in Washington, D.C.   In May, Hegseth revealed new rules limiting reporters' ability to move through many parts of the Pentagon without a formally designated escort — a change that broke years of tradition spanning Democratic and Republican administrations.   Then, in September, came the policy demanding that news organizations sign an acknowledgment they would not disclose — or even seek — unauthorized material. Hegseth posted on social media, \"The 'press' does not run the Pentagon — the people do.\"   Hegseth is a veteran and former Fox News host who came to President Trump's attention through his television presence. Fox was among the outlets whose defense correspondents banded together to object to the policy — and who left the building as a result.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Neil Wallace signals that the Fox News staff has cleared the contents of their broadcast booth in the press area of the Pentagon on Oct. 15 in Washington.\n                \n                    Kevin Wolf/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kevin Wolf/AP\n    \n\n   \n   \"The Pentagon's press access policy is unlawful because it gives government officials unchecked power over who gets a credential and who doesn't, something the First Amendment prohibits,\" Gabe Rottman, vice president of policy at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said in a statement. \"The public needs independent journalism and the reporters who deliver it back in the Pentagon at a time of heightened scrutiny of the Department's actions.\"   \n   This week, the Pentagon formally welcomed a new press corps willing to abide by its policy — correspondents and outlets that embrace a pro-Trump tilt or peddle conspiracy theories.   \"We're glad to have you,\" Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson told the newcomers on Tuesday. \"Legacy media chose to self-deport from this building. And if you look at the numbers, it's pretty clear why no one followed them. National trust in these mainstream media outlets has cratered to 28 percent, the lowest ever recorded. The American people don't trust these propagandists because they stopped telling the truth.\"   Among the new arrivals: the far-right political activist Laura Loomer, who often has Trump's ear; the Gateway Pundit, which declared bankruptcy to avoid liability for judgment in defamation suits; and LindellTV, backed by MyPillow founder Mike Lindell, who supported Trump's spurious claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential elections.   Several of the new arrivals posted separate photos on social media claiming they had been told they had been given the former Pentagon office of a Washington Post reporter. At least one corrected himself after being mocked online, saying he had been given mistaken information. He did not specify whether that incorrect information came from Pentagon officials.

It's no secret that my interest in Missouri redistricting borders on obsession. Some of my love for the subject stems from its importance. The lines and where they are drawn can determine which party has a better shot at winning any given district. But I also have a lifelong interest in cartography, including nearly winning my middle school geography bee and getting to talk to a National Geographic mapmaker while tagging along on a work trip with my dad.   \n   Still, at the time I sent that text, I thought there was no way that Missouri Republicans would plunge back into congressional mapmaking in 2025 — especially after redistricting in 2022 sparked a bitter schism within the Missouri legislature.   I was wrong.   Very wrong.   Missouri ended up becoming the second GOP-led state behind Texas to redraw congressional lines at the behest of President Trump. And Missouri Republicans were upfront about their rationale: They wanted to oust Democratic Congressman Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City to help prevent Republicans from losing control of the U.S. House in 2026.   And Missouri Republicans didn't just pass a new map: They broke all sorts of legislative norms and precedents to push it to Gov. Mike Kehoe's desk.   But in the rush to obtain a short-term victory for Republicans in Washington, D.C., Missouri Republicans may have ushered in the new map's doom from at least two different directions.   EnterAir Bud    Redistricting detractors have filed a slew of lawsuits — including a particularly important one around whether it's even allowed for Missouri lawmakers to redraw congressional boundaries in the middle of a decade. That case is still in its early stages, but the Missouri Supreme Court is expected to decide sometime next year.   \n   On the surface, redistricting foes seem to have a solid case — a constitutional amendment that they say only allows for congressional redistricting after a census. But Missouri Republicans appear to have a secret weapon to counter that contention: The Air Bud Rule.   In the 1997 Walt Disney film, a referee allows Buddy the Dog to play basketball because, after searching frantically through a rule book, \"there ain't no rule that says a dog can't play basketball.\"   Flash forward to 2025: Defenders of the Missouri redistricting plan have rallied behind a similarly constructed argument: \"There's nothing in the Missouri Constitution that says lawmakers can't redistrict mid-decade.\"   Air Bud analogy is a slam dunk   When I first heard this argument, I started to ask Missouri lawmakers if they'd seen Air Bud.    Some, like Republican Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, had seen it — and acknowledged that the GOP defense of the map was basically the Air Bud Rule. (When he was a state senator, Hoskins successfully sponsored a bill designating two legendary canines, Old Drum and Jim the Wonder Dog, as Missouri's official Historical Dog and the state's official wonder dog.)   \"Other states have different processes as far as when they can redistrict for congressional seats. But in Missouri, there's nothing, in my opinion, that says that we cannot do this,\" said GOP Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, who then joked that the new map should be named the \"Air Bud Clause\" if judges uphold it.   The analogy gained popularity among those entangled in redistricting.   Democratic state Rep. Mark Boyko mocked Republicans by citing the Air Bud Rule on the House floor. And during arguments earlier this month in Jefferson City, Chuck Hatfield, an attorney representing plaintiffs trying to strike down the new congressional lines, said in court this month, \"we don't do Air Bud rules in Missouri for very good reason, but that's essentially what the argument is from the state.\"   \n   \"It's like if my children ask me: 'Can we have ice cream tonight?' And I say, we're going for ice cream tomorrow,'\" Boyko said. \"And they say: 'Well, you haven't said we're not having ice cream tonight, so we're having ice cream tonight, too.' No.\"   Although Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway had never seen the film, in an interview with me, she said the \"ain't no rule that says a dog can't play basketball\" principle is \"not a bad analogy\" in describing the state's main argument.   \"The Constitution says that redistricting shall happen after the decennial census. It doesn't say that it shall happen immediately after; that it should happen only once per decade; that it can't be revisited,\" Hanaway said. \"I don't know what happened to Bud. I'm guessing he probably didn't get to play basketball since you're using that analogy. But I think our chances of prevailing are pretty good.\"   When I informed her that Buddy not only got to play basketball, but he also played football in the classic film Air Bud: Golden Receiver, Hanaway said: \"Man, I have missed a whole genre. I really got to catch up on that.\"   A surprise referendum   But the biggest threat to the Missouri redistricting plan may not be the lawsuits.   One day, after the draining first week of the redistricting special session in September, I took a walk near my house in St. Louis. That's when a question popped into my head: If lawmakers managed to pass the map, were there enough members in the Missouri House to make the map go into effect right away? If not, Republicans wouldn't be able to avoid Missouri's very robust referendum process.   While getting my kids ready for bed, I realized the answer was … no. The new map that Trump and Missouri Republicans wanted so badly could be subject to a statewide vote. If signature gatherers just got enough names collected before Dec. 11, the map couldn't go into effect for the 2026 election cycle, defeating the entire purpose of the redistricting special session.   \n   My story for St. Louis Public Radio was published before members of the House ended up giving first-round approval to the redistricting bill. Lawmakers ended up passing the map anyway, without much trouble — even though voters could end up wiping out their work.   After the special session ended, though, it was clear that a lot of lawmakers had no idea that the map could potentially be nullified through a statewide vote.   Opponents of the map have been scouring the state to collect signatures to put the plan up for a statewide vote. State Rep. Bryant Wolfin said he was unaware the map could go up for a statewide vote — adding \"I guarantee the majority of the caucus did not as well.\"   Whether the Trump White House realized that Missouri's new map could be put up for a vote is unclear. Officials did not reply to a request for comment. But there's no debate that the referendum generated a lot of excitement among despondent Missouri Democrats who suffered through yet another bad election cycle in 2024.   \"I don't even like politics, OK? I just know we need transparency,\" Jefferson City resident Frida Tucker told me in September. \"We need to stop the power grab. We don't need to do it every three years, OK? Like, something's not right here.\"   So what did I learn from following along on this wild Missouri redistricting saga?   For one thing, it's important to pay attention to seemingly insignificant details, like the vote count of a bill that was always expected to pass.   And other takeaway? Maybe revisit 1990s Disney films before a redistricting cycle, because you never know when a throwaway scene could inspire a legal theory that sinks or saves a nationally-watched proposal.

As you can imagine, at the Department of War, we got a lot of things to do. So I didn't stick around for the hour and two hours, whatever, where all the sensitive site exploitation digitally occurs. So I moved on to my next meeting.INSKEEP: Hegseth has a long history of advocating more lethality, as he calls it, with fewer lawyers. In a moment, we'll hear what a former high-ranking military lawyer thinks. We begin with the facts.MARTÍNEZ: NPR congressional correspondent Deirdre Walsh is with us. So we just heard Hegseth say that he had a lot on his schedule the day of that strike. What other details did he talk about Tuesday?DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: He said he gave the initial order to strike the boat and then said he learned the details about the second strike a couple of hours later and said it was a decision made by Admiral Frank Bradley, who leads U.S. Special Operations Command. While Hegseth stressed he personally didn't make the call for a follow-on strike, he said Bradley had the complete authority to do so.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HEGSETH: And by the way, Admiral Bradley made the correct decision to ultimately sink the boat and eliminate the threat.WALSH: You know, it's worth noting that Hegseth's comments yesterday are different from his initial response when The Washington Post first reported on these strikes, and he criticized the reporting. Now he's acknowledging there was the second strike. President Trump, for his part, said he knew the military took out the boat, but he didn't know whether it was one strike or two or three, and he wasn't involved in it.MARTÍNEZ: All right. So what are top Republicans on Capitol Hill saying about the attack?WALSH: Both House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune say they back the move by House and Senate Armed Services committees to review the boat strikes and expect to get answers. The speaker said he wouldn't prejudge anything before they get the facts. Committees are expected to seek video and audio of the operation. Questions on the Hill really center around whether the second strike broke U.S. law or would be considered a war crime if the administration's claim to be at war with narcotraffickers is accepted. And members of both parties want to review evidence and this timeline. Majority Leader Thune said he backed current U.S. policy, saying he agreed the administration had the authority for these attacks in the Caribbean. But when Thune was asked directly about whether he has confidence in Hegseth, he sidestepped the question.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN THUNE: Well, I think that the fundamental question is, is the country safer than it was under the Biden administration? I think the answer to that is unequivocally yes.WALSH: Thune said the Trump administration's peace through strength policies are working, and Hegseth is part of the team that put those in place. But he also added that Hegseth serves at the pleasure of the president. Not exactly an endorsement of the secretary.MARTÍNEZ: All right. So it seems like both GOP leaders of the House and Senate want at least some answers. Any word on how they'll try to get them?WALSH: You know, we haven't seen a lot of oversight from Republican committee chairmen in the first year of the Trump administration. But I will say, on this issue, both chairs in the House and Senate came out really quickly and vowed vigorous oversight of these boat strikes. It's unclear if they're going to have public hearings or classified sessions. Admiral Bradley's in town and is expected to brief lawmakers later this week. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wants Hegseth to release the video of the attack, and he's demanding that he testify publicly.MARTÍNEZ: All right. That's NPR congressional correspondent Deirdre Walsh. Thanks a lot.WALSH: Thanks, A.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Smith/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Democrats in Washington want to impose legal requirements on whom the Trump administration can bring in as temporary immigration judges, after the White House terminated at least a dozen tenured judges.   A bill introduced on Wednesday by California's Sen. Adam Schiff and Rep. Juan Vargas would authorize the attorney general to appoint temporary immigration judges that have served on appellate panels, are administrative judges in other agencies, or have 10 years of immigration law experience.   Such limits would preclude much of the administration's effort to authorize up to 600 military lawyers to be temporary immigration judges; as part of that move, the White House scrapped the requirement that temporary immigration judges should have immigration law experience.   \n   The legislation was introduced after the administration fired at least 14 immigration judges in the last two weeks, according to the union that represents them, with many of those having been terminated after years of experience on the bench. Those layoffs add to more than 90 other terminations so far this year, according to a count kept by NPR and the union that represents immigration judges.   The firings come as the administration seeks to reshape who serves on courts and makes decisions about which immigrants are allowed to stay in the U.S.   There are no Republican cosponsors on the measure, meaning it's unlikely to pass in a GOP-controlled Congress. But the legislation adds to the scrutiny that Democrats have brought to the administration's approach to immigration courts and their personnel.   Former immigration judges and lawyers say that bringing on people without experience is a potential benefit for permanent judges seeking a long career as an immigration judge. But it can present a steep learning curve and potential violations of due process if a judge's stint is only months-long, as would be the case with military lawyers, or JAGs, they say.   \n   \"The Trump administration's willingness to fire experienced judges and hire inexperienced or temporary 'deportation judges,' especially in places like California, has fundamentally impacted the landscape of our justice system,\" Schiff told NPR in a statement.   \"Given the administration's unlawful terminations of qualified judges, and their plan to leverage the power of temporary positions to speed up their mass deportation agenda, the risks of grave injury to families, fairness, and due process have expanded,\" he said.   The Trump administration authorized the use of military lawyers as temporary judges in an effort to streamline the millions-long backlog of immigration cases in the courts.   \n   That backlog has only gotten worse as immigration courts, which are housed within the Justice Department, have seen efforts to restructure their workforce.   NPR has tracked at least 140 immigration judges who have been fired, quit or took an early retirement offer from the administration. At least 90 of them, including those who were supervisors, have received termination notices from the administration. Of the judges fired between February and October this year, most had experience in immigration defense, an NPR investigation found.   Latest round of layoffs   The latest round of firings hit courts in San Francisco, New York and Boston, with at least seven judges fired in just one of New York's courts earlier this week. Many of the firings, like for other civil servants in the federal workforce, focused on employees still inside their two-year probationary period.   But this recent string of layoffs included at least 13 experienced judges who had been with the agency for years, NPR has identified.   Jeremiah Johnson was among those recently terminated. He had been a judge in San Francisco since 2017 but received a short email just before Thanksgiving, notifying him his time with the agency was over.   \n   He said he got no indication his performance was amiss. In the weeks leading up to his termination, new lawyers with Immigration and Customs Enforcement had been shadowing hearings in his courtroom, a sign he believed showed his courtroom conduct was a good learning space. He had also just received an additional set of cases for people held at the Eloy Detention Center in Arizona, adding to his responsibilities.   \"I was doing my job. I was there hearing cases, moving things along. I was also trying to uplift the morale of my colleagues and coworkers and team,\" Johnson said. Despite working at the agency for seven years, he got the same email as dozens of others. A few sentences explaining that the attorney general has decided his time was over, with no other explanation.   \n   \"I was fired for doing my job. And frankly, I think this administration doesn't want judges following the law,\" Johnson said.   The Executive Office for Immigration Review, the agency that houses immigration courts, has disputed that it seeks to prioritize judges who would be more likely to decide immigrants should be deported; it says judges have legal, ethical and professional obligations to be impartial to either side.   \n   The agency has said it evaluates all immigration judges regardless of background on factors including conduct, impartiality, adherence to the law, productivity and performance, and professionalism.   Some judges have sued the administration over their terminations, arguing that they may have been terminated on various protected grounds such as nationality or gender.   \"Most recently, yesterday, I was sued by an immigration judge who we fired,\" said Attorney General Pam Bondi during a Tuesday cabinet meeting. \"One of the reasons she said she was a woman. Last I checked, I was a woman as well.\"   Push for \"deportation\" judges   Meanwhile, the administration has recently added 36 judges, including 25 temporary ones, and launched a campaign to hire \"deportation\" judges. The agency did not respond to questions over how many applications it has received in the first few weeks of the hiring campaign. The campaign was launched prior to the recent firings of 15 judges.   The hiring campaign offers a pay recruitment incentive for those who work in one of eight courts across New York, California and Massachusetts, where firings and resignations have depleted the workforce.   \"Define America for generations\" and \"restore integrity and honor to our Nation's Immigration Court system\" are among the selling points for the position, in addition to remote and full-time teleworking benefits. Most immigrants are required to appear in person at their immigration hearings, and most courts, administrative and judicial, have returned to in-person work since the pandemic.   \n   Each judge who is terminated or resigns leaves behind thousands of cases, with those scheduled for this year now rescheduled to as far out as 2030. Immigration advocates have warned the layoffs contribute to the backlog.   \"Reducing the immigration court backlog is one of the highest priorities for the Executive Office for Immigration Review,\" said Kathryn Mattingly, a spokeswoman for the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which houses immigration courts. \"EOIR is committed to making further advancements to its operational efficiency, thereby helping to ensure timely justice for both parties involved and the public it serves.\"   \n   —NPR's Anusha Mathur contributed to this report.\n",

His findings were shared with NPR by a source who has seen the document but was not authorized to discuss it publicly.    \n   The report concludes that Hegseth, who sent the information about targets, timing and aircraft to two Signal groups, including his wife and brother, violated Pentagon policies about using personal phones for official business. Hegseth would not sit for an interview with investigators, the report said, and would only provide a written response.   In his response, Hegseth stated that he was able to declassify information; the inspector general did not determine whether Hegseth had declassified information in the chat by the time it was shared, but acknowledged that, as secretary of defense, he had the authority to do so.   Hegseth also told the inspector general that he believed the investigation was political and that he lacked faith in Stebbins, according to the source.   In a statement, chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said the findings absolved Hegseth of any wrongdoing.    \"The Inspector General review is a TOTAL exoneration of Secretary Hegseth and proves what we knew all along — no classified information was shared. This matter is resolved, and the case is closed,\" Parnell said.    \n   In a separate statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended President Trump's national security team and its handling of sensitive information.   \"This review affirms what the Administration has said from the beginning — no classified information was leaked, and operational security was not compromised,\" Leavitt said.    The report is the product of months of investigation. The probe was launched in April in response to a request from the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Roger Wicker of Mississippi, and Jack Reed, the panel's top Democrat.    \n   Over the course of the investigation, the report states, Hegseth only provided a few of his Signal messages to the inspector general. As a result, Stebbins was forced to rely mostly on screenshots of the chat from the Atlantic, according to the source.    One member of the Armed Services committee, Arizona Democrat Mark Kelly, responded to the report by saying \"it's pretty clear he shouldn't have been using his cell phone and an unsecure app, unofficial app with regards to DOD, to be sharing that kind of information.\"    \"It's not too hard to see how our adversaries can get that information and pass it on, to the Houthies in this case, and put those lives at risk,\" Kelly said.    The report's expected release comes as Hegseth faces pressure to answer for the administration's controversial campaign to strike boats in the Caribbean Sea that are allegedly carrying drugs to the U.S. from South America. One of those strikes has forced the administration to answer questions about whether the U.S. fired on the survivors of a bombing on Sept. 2, a move that military experts say could constitute a war crime if the administration's claim to be at war with narco traffickers is to be accepted.    \n   Hegseth's leadership at the Pentagon has been dogged by controversy. Critics have highlighted that the Army National Guard combat veteran and former Fox News host lacks the same level of experience as his predecessors at DOD.    In his Senate confirmation hearing, the social conservative told lawmakers that \"lethality, meritocracy, warfighting, accountability and readiness\" were his top priorities for the role. Since being sworn in, he's overseen the agency through drastic changes, firing several top officials, placing restrictions on troops and veterans that are transgender and rebranding the agency as the Department of War.    \n   The White House reiterated continued confidence in Hegseth on Wednesday, with Leavitt saying in a statement that, \"President Trump stands by Secretary Hegseth.\"      NPR disclosure: Katherine Maher, the CEO of NPR, chairs the board of the Signal Foundation.

Before the law, children with disabilities were often turned away from public schools. \"They were invisible,\" says Martin. Right: Maggie Heilman and her daughter, Brooklynn, 14, at their home in a Kansas City suburb. Brooklynn has Down syndrome and her own special education plan thanks to IDEA.\n                \n                    Thomas Simonetti and Katie Currid for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Thomas Simonetti and Katie Currid for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Fifty years ago, just after Thanksgiving of 1975, President Gerald Ford signed the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, the landmark law that created special education as it exists today, and guaranteed all children with disabilities the right to a \"free appropriate public education.\"   Yet, \"rather than celebrating progress, we face a crisis,\" warned a recent letter to Congress, signed by hundreds of disability, civil rights and education groups.   That crisis, according to the letter, is \"the dismantling of the very infrastructure Congress created to ensure children with disabilities could reach their full potential.\"   \n   The Trump administration has fired, or tried to fire, many of the federal staff at the U.S. Department of Education who manage and enforce federal disability law, though Education Secretary Linda McMahon has said federal funding for special education is not at risk.   In a November op-ed in USA Today, McMahon wrote that \"returning education to the states does not mean the end of federal support for education. It simply means the end of a centralized bureaucracy micromanaging what should be a state-led responsibility.\"   But, in interviews with 40 parents, educators, disability-rights advocates, subject matter experts and Education Department staffers, NPR heard a growing fear: that the Trump administration's efforts to cut federal staff and oversight of special education could return the U.S. to a time, before 1975, when some schools denied access or services to children with disabilities.   What special education means to one mom and her daughter   Maggie Heilman's 14-year-old daughter, Brooklynn, has never known a world without the 50-year-old law later renamed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Maggie Heilman and her daughter Brooklynn play checkers. Brooklynn loves games, painting her nails and listening to Taylor Swift.\n                \n                    Katie Currid for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Katie Currid for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   The family lives in a Kansas City suburb. Brooklynn, who has Down syndrome, loves hanging out with her sisters, playing basketball and listening to music \"all day, and on the bus,\" Brooklyn says.   \n   \"And she dances all day,\" her mom adds.   \"In circles,\" Brooklyn says. \"Over and over.\"   The teen is now in eighth grade, has her own special education plan, thanks to IDEA, and loves her middle school. But sixth grade was difficult.   \"I was having a hard time,\" Brooklynn says.   In October 2023, Heilman says, she got a call from Brooklynn's school that her daughter had become agitated after refusing a request to come to the classroom's reading table. Eventually, Heilman says, Brooklynn was secluded for 20 minutes in a padded room the size of a closet.   \n   \"That 20 minutes changed the trajectory of our lives,\" Heilman recalls. \"I had a child who loved to sing and dance and communicate and hug, and, after that moment, she stopped talking.\"   Seclusion in school, as a practice, is allowed in many states — if students pose an immediate danger to themselves or others. However, the practice can also be traumatic.   Heilman says she told school staff she thought Brooklynn's seclusion was extreme. Through the winter, she said, the school turned to informal seclusion, separating Brooklynn in other physical spaces or school offices.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Brooklynn, center, loves playing Uno with her mom and sisters.\n                \n                    Katie Currid for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Katie Currid for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   As a result, Heilman says, Brooklynn repeatedly missed some of her traditional classes. \"And we just saw our daughter's health — physically, mentally, emotionally — deteriorate.\"   Finally, Heilman asked that Brooklynn be transferred to a different middle school, where staff assured her they don't seclude students. Brooklynn's situation improved dramatically, but, worried for the students who came after Brooklynn, Heilman still requested a state-level investigation into her daughter's previous seclusion. The state did not find the district at fault.        Heilman also filed a complaint with the U.S. Education Department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR), arguing that Brooklynn had been secluded unnecessarily and that, as a result, she was denied her right to a free, appropriate public education.   \n   That complaint kickstarted a new ordeal for Heilman and her family.   Counting on a federal system as it's being dismantled   OCR is the fail-safe for families who believe their child's civil rights are being violated at school because of their disability. A family can submit a discrimination complaint, and one of OCR's attorneys will review it and, if justified, open an investigation — no need to hire an expensive lawyer or advocate.   OCR has investigated a Texas district for restraining students; a Maryland district for how it handled the bullying of a disabled student; and an Arizona district for forcing students with disabilities to end their school day earlier than general education students.   \n   Department records show OCR began investigating Heilman's complaint in October 2024.   \n   But Heilman says her assigned attorney was removed around the same time the Trump administration began a broad reduction-in-force. According to emails Heilman shared with NPR, her case was then assigned to a different attorney.   Heilman says she has heard nothing about the investigation since June, when this second OCR attorney assured her, in an email, that Brooklynn's case is \"currently still in investigation.\"   Several OCR attorneys spoke with NPR on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by the Trump administration. Two of them said Heilman's second attorney worked in an OCR office that was gutted in October, in a second round of layoffs. Those fired workers have since been reinstated, but Heilman says she has heard nothing about her complaint.   Of the administration's decision to cut many attorneys who protect students' civil rights, Heilman says, \"it's telling families with children like Brooklynn that their hurt doesn't matter.\"   Before special education, children with disabilities were \"invisible\"   Before 1975, children with disabilities were commonly denied access to public school classrooms.   \"They were invisible,\" says Ed Martin, who helped write the landmark 1975 law. \"They had been kept at home. Our goal was to end that.\"     \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Ed Martin began his career as a young professor of speech therapy at the University of Alabama. He was invited to Washington, D.C., in the 1960s to work on disability issues.\n                \n                    Thomas Simonetti for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Thomas Simonetti for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   In 1970, U.S. public schools educated just 1 in 5 children with a disability, according to the Department of Education, and excluded nearly 1.8 million children.   Martin, now 94, says he organized hearings for parents to share their stories with lawmakers.   \"There was one mother who told us a story about the school bus stopping at the foot of her driveway,\" Martin recalls, \"and her daughter standing in the window crying, saying, 'Why can't I go with the other kids?'\"   When Ford signed the new law, it cemented a bold idea: that students with disabilities have a right to an individualized, public education and that the U.S. government would help pay for it.   \n   Margaret Spellings ran the Education Department under Republican President George W. Bush, and says special education isn't just about doing what the law requires — it's a public good.   \"We're talking about a lot of kids who have abilities and disabilities that can be remediated, that can make them productive citizens,\" Spellings says, \"and that is in our interest as a nation to have these students meet their full potential.\"   In fiscal year 2024, the law provided nearly $15 billion to help school districts pay for specialized classroom instruction and speech and physical therapy, among other services.     Including its early intervention programs for infants and toddlers, IDEA helps more than 8 million children with disabilities in the U.S.   To manage and enforce not just IDEA but a cluster of federal disability laws, Congress placed a pair of offices inside the Department of Education. The Office for Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS), which includes the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), oversees special education under IDEA, providing guidance to states and directly to families. The other key office is OCR, the Office for Civil Rights. It does not enforce IDEA but investigates allegations of disability discrimination, which often overlap with family complaints that allege IDEA violations.   Since these offices were created, support for their mission — to help families, districts and states in their efforts to protect and educate children with disabilities — has transcended politics. Spellings says, \"We have long had, for the last 50 years — until this year — huge bipartisan support and fealty to the law.\"   Until this year.   Devastating special education cuts    According to court records, the Trump administration fired 121 of 135 employees at OSERS during the recent government shutdown.   \"We can't, in our wildest imagination, understand how the secretary can fulfill her obligation under the law with so few staff,\" said Denise Marshall, head of the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates (COPAA).   \n   Since those cuts, the 121 staffers have been reinstated as part of the deal to end the shutdown, though the administration could lay them off again after Jan. 30.   When NPR asked the Education Department if it planned to retain these staff beyond that date, the press office replied with a statement: \"The Department has brought back staff that were impacted by the Schumer Shutdown. The Department will follow all applicable laws.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon during a television interview outside the White House. In an op-ed published in USA Today, McMahon wrote, \"protecting students' civil rights is work that will never go away.\"\n                \n                    Samuel Corum/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Samuel Corum/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"This is a part of the process of making a smaller federal footprint and turning responsibilities over to states,\" says Jonathan Butcher, acting director for the Center for Education Policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation.   Heritage's Project 2025, created as a policy blueprint for a second Trump administration, calls for IDEA funding to be \"converted into a no-strings formula block grant\" to be sent directly to districts — that section's author, Lindsey Burke, now works at the Education Department.   In her op-ed, and previously, McMahon has reassured families that funding for students with disabilities \"will continue indefinitely.\" It's the federal oversight she's cutting or moving.   But an OSERS staffer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, worries that, without federal support staff, \"states don't have the systems or the staffing to do this.\"   Ed Martin, who helped write IDEA 50 years ago, says that, without enough staff, there's also no guarantee the money will be spent on the children who need it most: \"The administration has decided that nobody needs to watch [the money].\"   \"The secretary's words are hollow\"   The Trump administration has also made deep cuts to the Office for Civil Rights. In March, it moved to close seven of OCR's 12 regional offices and to fire 299 workers, leaving roughly half the staff the office had in January. This is when Maggie Heilman lost her first attorney.   In October, the administration attempted to fire another 137 staffers, including gutting the office investigating Heilman's complaint. This left 62 employees at OCR who had not received a termination notice — about 10% of the office's January headcount.   \n   \"I'm just shocked that they can destroy an entire unit of an organization that's created by statute,\" said R. Shep Melnick before some cuts were reversed. Melnick is a professor of American politics at Boston College who has been writing about OCR for decades.   As at OSERS, the employees who were fired in October have since been reinstated, but, again, there is no guarantee they will be allowed to stay beyond Jan. 30.   In a statement, the department's press secretary for legal affairs, Julie Hartman, told NPR: \"We are rebuilding and refocusing OCR to enable the office to protect students and enforce the law.\"   Thousands of languishing civil rights complaints   Even as the administration has tried to cut OCR's enforcement attorneys, it has aggressively used the office to enforce new priorities, going after districts and colleges that support transgender students or embrace diversity, equity and inclusion.   \n   In a statement, Hartman told NPR that OCR had \"strayed\" under Biden and that Trump \"is reorienting OCR to what it's meant to be: a law enforcement agency, not a social-justice advocacy arm of the federal government.\"   Public data suggests a shift away from disability-related investigations.   Since Trump took office, OCR has reached resolution agreements in 73 cases involving alleged disability discrimination. Compare that to 2024, when OCR resolved 390, or 2017, the year Trump took office during his first term, when OCR reached agreements in more than 1,000 such cases.   In these agreements, school districts often commit to a host of fixes — such as launching a program to monitor the use of restraint and seclusion — that help not just the student at the center of the complaint but other students as well. Still, they require labor-intensive investigations into complaints like Maggie Heilman's, with attorneys conducting interviews and collecting documents.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                After Brooklynn's first day at her new middle school, her mother, Maggie Heilman, remembers, \"She was smiling. She said, 'Thank you, Mommy. I fit in. I love you.'\"\n                \n                    Katie Currid for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Katie Currid for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   In her USA Today op-ed, McMahon said, in spite of the cuts to OCR, \"protecting students' civil rights is work that will never go away.\"   \n   To that, Marshall, of COPAA, replied: \"Bullcrap. The secretary's words are hollow.\"   It is possible some of OCR's responsibilities could be shifted to other federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, says Kenneth Marcus, who ran OCR during the first Trump administration and founded the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law.   That doesn't appear to have happened yet, Marcus says. But if it does, he says, \"it is entirely possible that this shift will leave us stronger when it comes to civil rights, but we will need to see the details.\"   Spellings, the former Republican education secretary, says that if the administration continues to focus its diminished resources on high-profile political fights, it will run the risk of failing the parents of disabled children even as it says it champions parents' rights in general: \"I believe it when they say, 'Let's put parents in charge.' … OK, so what about the parents who want their options as described in [federal disability law]?\"   What's next?   The endgame for the Trump administration, as the president and his education secretary have said repeatedly, is to close the U.S. Department of Education and move the federal jobs and funding streams it considers essential to other agencies.   On social media, McMahon and her staff have openly mocked the department, which she has said is \"mostly a pass-through for funds that are best managed by the states.\"   The problem with that view, says Jacqueline Rodriguez of the National Center for Learning Disabilities, is that states need and often want support when it comes to special education. And that support comes from the hundreds of federal staff the administration has been trying to fire.   Without them, Rodriguez says, \"we are concerned special education will cease to exist.\"   \"I'm fearful,\" says one state director of special education, who spoke with NPR on the condition of anonymity out of concern the government would retaliate against that state. \"I think it's good for states to know there's federal oversight and that they'll be held accountable. The concept of leaving special education up to states sounds great, but it's scary. What happens if one state decides to interpret the law one way, but another state disagrees and interprets it differently?\"   \n   Fifty years ago, Ed Martin helped write the law that made clear to all states and all public schools: Children with disabilities deserve better. The law, he says, was \"an affirmation of the values of the country.\"   He hopes that's still true.   Edited by: Nicole CohenVisual design and development by: LA Johnson\n",

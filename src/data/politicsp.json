Vásquez/AP\n    \n\n   \n   A federal court has upheld the new congressional map approved by California voters last month, giving Democrats a chance to counter the nationwide redistricting effort led by President Trump and his Republican allies.   The court challenge to the redistricting plan had been brought by the California Republican Party and the U.S. Department of Justice. The court found that the new district map did not violate laws against racial gerrymandering.   The Republicans argued that the new map was motivated by a desire to increase the voting power of Latinos. The court, in a two-to-one ruling, rejected that claim, noting that voters approved the measure, called \"Proposition 50\" and there was no evidence they acted on racial grounds.   \n   \"The evidence presented reflects that Proposition 50 was exactly what it was billed as: a political gerrymander designed to flip five Republican-held seats to the Democrats,\" wrote U.S. District Judge Josephine L. Staton in the majority opinion.   The court denied the Republican plaintiffs' request the court issue an injunction blocking the redistricting as the case proceeds to a final judgement. The Republicans could still appeal the ruling.   \n   Usually states redistrict early in the decade after the decennial census. But Trump set off a mid-decade redistricting race as he tries to prevent Democrats from taking control of the House. This summer he pushed Texas Republicans to redraw that state's districts, potentially helping the GOP win five House seats in 2026. Missouri and North Carolina have each redistricted to help the GOP in one seat.   After the Texas redistricting, California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom vowed to respond by redrawing the map in his state. At his urging, lawmakers put the matter on the ballot and California voters approved a redistricting plan there in a special election Nov. 4. That measure passed with 64 percent of the vote.   For Democrats, it's been about confronting Trump   For Democrats who supported California's redistricting measure, it was not as much about redrawn lines as it was an ideological battle. Supporters largely viewed it as an opportunity for the blue state to push back against the Trump administration. Newsom argued the approach was necessary to counter the GOP-led redistricting effort in Texas and \"fight fire with fire\" and boost Democrats' chances ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.   \n   The Republican-led lawsuit against the measure contended it violated the law by disproportionately giving the state's Latino voters a stronger voice over other racial voting blocs.   In a dissenting opinion, Judge Kenneth Lee, who was appointed by President Trump in 2018, said the designer of the map, hired by the Democrats, had publicly said that he was aiming to boost Latino voting power.   \"The Democratic supermajority in the California state legislature wanted to curry favor with Latino groups and voters—and to prevent Latino voters from drifting away from the party,\" Lee wrote.   The majority ruling rejected that argument, finding that it was not the mapmaker or even the legislature that held the deciding power but rather the voters on the proposition and that it was debated by proponents and opponents as a partisan move.   In her opinion, Staton, appointed to the bench by President Obama, found a \"mountain of evidence produced by Defendants that the voters intended to enact a partisan gerrymander.\"   \"Republicans' weak attempt to silence voters failed,\" wrote Newsom in a statement. \"California voters overwhelmingly supported Prop 50 – to respond to Trump's rigging in Texas – and that is exactly what this court concluded.\"   Overall, the redistricting race is close with Republicans on track to tilt a couple or few more seats their way than Democrats have. Indiana Republicans refused to follow Trump's lead last month and redistrict there. But Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has vowed to lead his state in drawing a new map that will favor the GOP.   Meanwhile, Virginia Democrats have started the redistricting process to favor their party in that state. Currently, the House stands at 218 Republicans and 213 Democrats and if Democrats take control, they could slow Trump's agenda or launch investigations into his administration.

    "body": "\n      President Trump gave a speech in Detroit that was supposed to focus on the economy, but it veered off-topic quickly and covered a lot of unrelated ground.   \n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  Voters say affordability is a top concern, so it makes sense that the economy is expected to be one of the main issues in this year's midterm elections.STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  President Trump has started traveling around the country, giving speeches about the economy. He was at the Detroit Economic Club on Tuesday, although he did not exactly stay on topic.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And now, after less than 12 months in office, this is the easiest speech to make. I have great people, and all I'm doing is spewing off what the hell we've done. Even Venezuela wasn't too bad, was it, huh?MARTÍNEZ: NPR's senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith is here to break it all down. Tam, the president is kind of proud of what he calls the weave. Is that what we just heard here?TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Yes. Yes, it is. He was really all over the place in this speech, changing topics midsentence and boasting about being off the teleprompter 80% of the time. This speech included insults from more than half a dozen politicians, Republicans and Democrats alike. And then there was his impression of his predecessor.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Remember the speeches Joe would make? First of all, they'd last a matter of seconds, you know? (Impersonating Joe Biden) Thank you very much.You ever notice Joe would always cough before a speech? State of the Union he gets, (impersonating Joe Biden coughing).KEITH: And picture the president making contorted facial expressions to go along with the sound effects.MARTÍNEZ: OK. So beyond the impersonations, what did the president actually say about the economy?KEITH: First off, he said, it is great. He boasted that grocery prices are, quote, \"starting to go rapidly down.\" That was on the same day that the government announced that in December, grocery prices had their biggest spike since 2022. He went into some detail about his view that when gas prices come down, other prices will come down as well.Of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he said, that jerk will be gone soon, and then he teased new proposals.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: In the coming weeks, I will be laying out even more plans to help bring back affordability. And again, remember, that's a fake word by Democrats. Prices were too high. They caused the high price.KEITH: And these regular riffs about affordability being a con job or a fake word really risk undercutting his message and are also out of line with the pain that people say they're feeling.MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. Trump mentioned laying out even more plans. Any idea what those plans are?KEITH: He said he's going to outline a proposal at the World Economic Forum in Davos next week to bring down home prices by getting private equity companies out of the U.S. housing market. And Trump has started talking about a plan to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for a year. Thus far, he is just talking about asking the companies to voluntarily make that change. And, yes, these absolutely sound like ideas you've heard before from Democrats, not Republicans. Trump even called Senator Elizabeth Warren this week to talk ideas, but the response from Republicans on the Hill has been pretty tepid so far.MARTÍNEZ: OK. Now, one other thing happened at the Ford truck plant that Trump toured before the speech, and it involved the president giving the middle finger.KEITH: Yeah. TMZ posted a video of the incident. Someone shouted what sounded like pedophile protector, presumably about the Epstein files. In response, Trump appeared to mouth an expletive, then gave the middle finger to the person who was shouting. In a statement, White House communications director Steven Cheung said, quote, \"a lunatic was wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage, and the president gave an appropriate and unambiguous response.\"MARTÍNEZ: OK. NPR's Tamara Keith. Thanks a lot.KEITH: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

NPR wasn't able to independently confirm the scale of the grant cancellation. The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) didn't respond to a request for clarification.   \"We are definitely looking at severe loss of front-line capacity,\" said Andrew Kessler, head of Slingshot Solutions, a consultancy firm that works with mental health and addiction groups nationwide. \"[Programs] may have to shut their doors tomorrow.\"   \n   Kessler said he has reviewed numerous grant termination letters from \"Salt Lake City to El Paso to Detroit, all over the country.\"   Ryan Hampton, the founder of Mobilize Recovery, a national advocacy nonprofit for people in and seeking recovery, told NPR his group lost roughly $500,000 \"overnight.\"   \n   \"Waking up to nearly $2 billion in grant cancellations means front-line providers are forced to cease overdose prevention, naloxone distribution, and peer recovery services immediately, leaving our communities defenseless against a raging crisis,\" Hampton said. \"This cruelty will be measured in lives lost, as recovery centers shutter and the safety net we built is slashed overnight. We are witnessing the dismantling of our recovery infrastructure in real-time, and the administration will have blood on its hands for every preventable death that follows.\"   Copies of the letter sent to two different organizations and reviewed by NPR signal that SAMHSA officials no longer believe the defunded programs align with the Trump administration's priorities.   The letter points to efforts to reshape the national health system in part by restructuring SAMHSA's grant program, which \"includes terminating some of its … awards.\"   According to the letter, grants are terminated as of Jan.13, adding that \"costs resulting from financial obligations incurred after termination are not allowable.\"   \n   The National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors sent a letter to members saying it believes \"over 2,000 grants [nationwide] with a total of more than $2 billion\" are affected. The group said it's still working to understand the \"full scope\" of the cuts.   This move comes on top of deep Medicaid cuts, passed last year by the Republican-controlled Congress, which affect numerous mental health and addiction care providers.   Requests for comment from SAMHSA and the Department of Health and Human Services were not immediately returned.    Kessler told NPR he's hearing alarm from care providers nationwide that the safety net for people experiencing an addiction or mental health crisis could unravel.   \"In the short term, there's going to be severe damage. We're going to have to scramble,\" he said.   Regina LaBelle, a Georgetown University professor who served as acting head of the Office of National Drug Control Policy during the Biden administration, said the SAMHSA grants pay for lifesaving services.    \"From first responders to drug courts, continued federal funding quite literally save lives,\" LaBelle said.  \"The overdose epidemic has been declared a public health emergency and overdose deaths are decreasing. This is no time to pull critical funding.\"   The American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychiatric Association Foundation said that among the programs eliminated are two administered by the APA Workforce Development Initiative and APAF's Notice. Talk. Act. at School Program. \"Overnight cuts to thousands of programs nationwide are nothing short of catastrophic, placing millions of Americans with unmet mental health and substance use disorder needs at even greater risk,\" APA President Dr. Theresa M. Miskimen Rivera said in a statement. \"Our programs, which only represent a fraction of what's been cut, establish a vital pathway for psychiatrists to serve those in need, especially in areas experiencing mental health professional shortages, and in schools.\"   \n   The Workforce Development Initiative includes programs that reach college and high school students who are considering the field of psychiatry. The APAF's program provides free mental health training for K-12 school staff. \"We can only imagine the good that the thousands of other programs that were eliminated were doing, and we call on the administration to reinstate the funding immediately,\" APA CEO and Medical Director Dr. Marketa M. Wills said in the statement.\n",

Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., says she found out about the investigation when she received a call from the office of Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. The New York Times first reported Slotkin's knowledge of the investigation.   Rep. Maggie Goodlander, D-N.H., Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., and Rep. Chris Deluzio, D-Pa., say federal prosecutors have also asked to question them about the video.    \n   A spokesperson for Pirro's office declined to \"confirm or deny the existence of an investigation\" of either Democrat.    The video, posted on social media in November, featured six congressional Democrats, all with military or intelligence backgrounds, pointing to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.   \"No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution,\" the lawmakers said in the video.   President Trump called the video message \"treasonous\" and amplified a social media post suggesting the six members should be hanged. The White House later said the president was not suggesting the six members be killed. Still, several reported receiving death threats and bomb scares.   \"This is the President's playbook,\" Slotkin said Wednesday. \"Truth doesn't matter, facts don't matter. And anyone who disagrees with him becomes an enemy and he then weaponizes the federal government against them. It's legal intimidation and physical intimidation meant to get you to shut up.\"   Slotkin said she has received 1,000 threats, including a bomb threat at her house, and that her parents were victims of swatting — the term for when someone makes a false report of a crime to law enforcement to elicit an overwhelming police response.   \"Right now speaking out against the abuse of power is the most patriotic thing we can do,\" Slotkin said.   \n   In a separate statement on Wednesday, Crow said President Trump was \"pressuring his political appointees to harass me for daring to speak up and hold him accountable.\"    \"I won't be intimidated and will keep fighting to uphold my oath to the Constitution and defend our country,\" Crow wrote in a statement.   \"These threats will not deter, distract, intimidate, or silence me,\" Goodlander wrote. \"I will continue doing my job and upholding my oath to our Constitution. And I will never give up the ship.\"   A spokesperson for Deluzio said in a statement that the congressman \"won't be intimidated.\"    In November, the FBI requested interviews with the members who participated in the video.   And Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said this week that the Pentagon would censure one of the lawmakers, Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., a retired Navy combat pilot.   That could allow the Pentagon to demote Kelly or reduce his retirement pay. Kelly sued Hegseth and the Pentagon on Monday, saying the government is retaliating for speech protected by the First Amendment.   The action comes as the Trump administration is wielding the Justice Department to target other political opponents, including Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

Hawley reversed his initial support for a Venezuela war powers resolution and voted to block the legislation after receiving assurances from the White House.\n                \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Republicans in the Senate have blocked a war powers resolution that would have required President Trump to secure authorization from Congress before launching any further military operations in Venezuela.   The resolution's defeat came less than a week after five Republicans broke ranks with their party and joined Democrats on a procedural vote to advance the measure -- a rare rebuke for President Trump from within the GOP. The initial vote was an immediate response to the surprise operation earlier this month that led to the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.   Those votes drew a furious response from President Trump, who called for the Republican defectors to lose their seats in Congress.   \n   By Wednesday, Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., was able to flip two of those five Republican votes against the measure. The final vote was 51 to 50, with Vice President JD Vance brought in to break a tie.   The resolution was blocked with the support of Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Todd Young, R-Ind., two of the five Republicans who had sided earlier with Democrats. Speaking to reporters, Hawley said his concerns about U.S. intervention in Venezuela had been alleviated by speaking with Secretary of State Marco Rubio. For his part, Young said he changed his mind after receiving assurances from senior national security officials \"that there are no American troops in Venezuela.\"   \"I've also received a commitment that if President Trump were to determine American forces are needed in major military operations in Venezuela, the Administration will come to Congress in advance to ask for an authorization of force,\" Young said in a statement.   The positions of the three other Republicans who sided with Democrats on last week's vote — Maine's Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul of Kentucky — went unchanged.   \"Republicans should be ashamed of the Senators that just voted with Democrats in attempting to take away our Powers to fight and defend the United States of America,\" Trump wrote after last week's vote.   \n   The vote was the latest setback in efforts by Senate lawmakers to reassert control over the use of military force. A pair of similar measures were also defeated last year. But as President Trump continues to raise the prospect of military force in other parts of the world, including Iran and Greenland, Senate Democrats have signaled they intend to continue forcing additional war powers votes.\n",

    "body": "\n      \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n   LIBERTY COUNTY, Ga. — What brings Greg Reyes to this Walmart south of Savannah are the low prices. He and his wife keep a close eye on their limited budget; she's retired and he's disabled. Their grocery list is always the same. But the prices have been changing.   \"I used to pay like $40 a year ago, and now we're paying like $60,\" Reyes says. In his bags today are some chicken, turkey and beef. Other things simply had to go. \"We don't buy ice cream no more because it's expensive,\" Reyes says. \"It's kind of sad, but we have to do it like that.\"   \n   The cost of living in the U.S. rose 2.7% in December compared with a year before, according to Tuesday's federal data. That's a steady slowdown after a yearslong stretch of intense inflation, but still painful. The past year also brought a global trade war, as President Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on nearly all imports. And the world continued to grapple with extreme weather, from droughts to downpours.   All of this is showing up in our shopping carts.   \n   Since 2018, NPR has tracked the prices of dozens of items at this suburban Walmart superstore. Walmart is America's most popular retailer and the world's largest, which gives it the power to negotiate with suppliers for some of the lowest and most stable prices.   Here's what we learned on our latest price-check visit, in December. (Or skip the analysis to see the full details of NPR's shopping cart.)   Prices in NPR's basket rose 5% on average last year   Almost half the items on NPR's shopping list got more expensive in 2025, including shrimp, Oreo cookies, Coca-Cola and Dove soap. Some price increases, notably on items made in China and Vietnam, appear to be tariff related. Other price hikes had to do with weather events affecting harvests of crops such as cacao and coffee beans.   \n    Loading... \n   Just under a quarter of the items on NPR's list got cheaper, including eggs, milk and Cheerios. And many packaged foods stayed the same after years of price hikes.   As affordability became Americans' top concern, big brands began to worry about shoppers switching to store-label competitors or skipping some purchases altogether. To entice weary shoppers, NPR found, Walmart offered more discounts in December than it had in previous years.   A few disclaimers about our method:   We went through almost every aisle in this Walmart to come up with the 114 items. (The full table is below.) To account for possible changes in package sizes, we focused on the price per unit, whether it was an ounce of salsa or a square foot of aluminum foil.NPR reached out to the producers of all the items on our list that changed in price. Most companies did not respond. The few that did — including Kikkoman and Campbell's — noted that Walmart, as the retailer, has ultimate control over the prices that shoppers see on shelves.A Walmart spokesperson said in a statement: \"We remain dedicated to providing our customers Every Day low prices, with the goal of having the lowest price on a basket of goods over time.\" A store, for example, might extract deals from suppliers or charge slightly more for several items in order to sell something else at a break-even price or even below cost.   Tariffs loom over store shelves    Loading... \n   With tariffs being the biggest story in retail in 2025, signs of their impact inevitably showed up in Walmart's aisles. Though it's hard to pin any price increase on tariffs with certainty, the through line was noticeable.   Some of the biggest price jumps were on items imported from countries saddled with hefty tariffs: Walmart's store-brand paper folders made in China (up 46%), swai fish fillets from Vietnam (up 34%), Farberware's plastic measuring spoons made in China (up 19%) and Schwinn's infant bike helmet, which used to be made in China but is now made in Vietnam (up 18%).   Walmart, Farberware and Schwinn did not comment on the impact of tariffs to NPR, but several other companies did. Dole, whose canned pineapple from Southeast Asia got 25% more expensive, cited weather-related crop shortages and tariffs on goods imported from the region.   \n   Reynolds Wrap, whose aluminum foil rose in price by 13%, called out \"historic and sustained cost increases over the past year, driven by tariffs, global supply pressures, rising energy costs, and limited availability.\" Much of U.S. aluminum comes from Canada, and these imports now face a 50% tax.   Walmart in May warned that new tariffs would lead to higher prices, as Trump threatened 145% tariffs on goods from China. The White House later paused, changed up and even rolled back some of its trade plans, namely on food items. By August, Walmart officials said tariff costs were rising \"each week,\" although the company was able to mitigate many of them. In November, incoming Walmart CEO John Furner said tariffs brought \"less impact\" than expected early in the year.   \n   Climate chaos roiled many industries    Loading... \n   Some of the items with the worst price hikes are repeat offenders: coffee, beef and chocolate. They, too, were affected by tariffs — such as beef and coffee coming from Brazil — but the main culprit was the weather.   At this Walmart, the price of Maxwell House ground Colombian coffee rose by 46% in 2025 and its breakfast K-Cups by 34%. The costs of Hershey's and Lindt chocolates jumped around 26%. A pound of ground beef went up 30%, and the store now prominently displays a cheaper option: a blend of beef and ground pork.   The cost of coffee beans has soared as climate change has brought erratic rainfall patterns, floods and droughts to farmlands. Cacao harvests, too, have come up short for three years straight; West African farmers, who grow most of the world's supply, have dealt with extreme weather, changing climate patterns and disease in their aging trees. And the U.S. beef supply is at its lowest in decades, driving cattle prices to record highs, in part because of drought.   Kraft Heinz (which owns Maxwell House), Hershey and Lindt & Sprüngli in statements all cited the unprecedented higher costs of key raw materials, adding that they've also absorbed or offset part of those costs.   Shrinkflation continues in the laundry aisle   When inflation peaked after the COVID-19 pandemic, some manufacturers stealthily raised prices by shrinking their products — shampoo, paper towels, chips and candy — while charging the same or slightly more. In 2022, for example, NPR's Walmart visit found that Dove soap bars had shrunk by a quarter of an ounce, while rising in price by a few cents. (Dove maker Unilever did not comment.)   Last month, NPR spotted one case of shrinkflation: Tide laundry detergent. But the company says it's actually efficiency.    Loading... \n   NPR first spotted Tide selling less laundry detergent per bottle in 2022: The amount of liquid had shrunk to 92 ounces from 100 ounces before the pandemic, and the price had risen by a dollar. After that, the cost stayed the same, but the contents shrank to 84 ounces in 2024 and then to 80 ounces in December.   The label continuously promised enough detergent for 64 loads of laundry.   Procter & Gamble, which makes Tide as well as Head & Shoulders shampoo (whose price rose almost 18%), told NPR that both products saw \"meaningful upgrades\" in the past year. Tide specifically got the \"most significant upgrade to its liquid formula in over 20 years,\" according to the company, with a \"boosted\" level of active cleaning ingredients and updated dosage instructions.   \"The result is superior cleaning performance in a smaller dose,\" a Procter & Gamble representative said.   Good news! Some things are cheaper    Loading... \n   The biggest price drop finally came for eggs after record highs earlier in the year due to the persistent bird flu. By December, the price of a dozen eggs at Walmart dropped 30%. The cost of butter also dipped, by almost 16%, thanks to a glut in dairy production.   And as inflation-weary shoppers tighten their belts, brands have started doing something they rarely do: lowering prices. PepsiCo (maker of Lay's, Cheetos and Tostitos) last month said it would cut prices to boost sales. General Mills (maker of Cheerios, Betty Crocker and Annie's) also confirmed it plans to discount roughly two-thirds of its offerings. NPR's price check found Cheerios costing 19% less than a year ago.   A Walmart spokesperson also told NPR that the chain has added more discounts (or \"rollbacks,\" in Walmart parlance) than it had in the past two years. The company cited 13,000 of them in the first three quarters of 2025, of which about 2,000 became permanent price cuts.   Loading...\n",

The case before the court was brought by Illinois Republican U.S. Rep. Michael Bost and other candidates, who wanted to challenge a state law that allows election officials to count mail ballots that arrive up to two weeks after Election Day, as long as they're postmarked on time.    Many states have laws that offer a buffer, or grace period, to voters to return mail ballots in case there are issues with the postal service, for example.   \n   A lower court ruled that Bost did not have standing to challenge the Illinois law.   The conservative-majority Supreme Court, in a 7-2 ruling, disagreed.   Chief Justice John Roberts authored the opinion, writing that \"[c]andidates have a concrete and particularized interest in the rules that govern the counting of votes in their elections, regardless whether those rules harm their electoral prospects or increase the cost of their campaigns.\"   Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote a concurring opinion, joined by liberal Justice Elena Kagan. Liberal Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor dissented.   In her dissent, Justice Jackson argued that the court was giving candidates the ability to sue in advance of provable harm, despite the fact that most voters don't have that ability.   \"In a democratic society like ours, the interest in a fair electoral process is common to all members of the voting public,\" she wrote. \"I believe that political candidates can and should be held to the same actual-injury requirements as other litigants.\"   \n   The ruling was cheered by the conservative group Restoring Integrity and Trust in Elections, with its president, Justin Riemer, writing in a statement that the decision is \"a major win for the rule of law in our elections. Too many courts for too long have avoided grappling with legitimate and meritorious challenges to election rules by dismissing cases on standing grounds.\"   But Wendy Weiser with the Brennan Center for Justice warned that allowing candidates to challenge laws without proving harm first could also create an influx of frivolous lawsuits.   \n   \"At a time of conspiracy theories & stress on elections, SCOTUS just opened the floodgates to candidates challenging election rules,\" she wrote on X, \"regardless of whether those rules will impact their races. Bost could unleash frivolous suits to undermine election confidence or disrupt results.\"   Richard Pildes, a legal scholar at NYU School of Law, wrote for Election Law Blog that he believes the court's decision was right, however. He wrote that it \"will advance the important systemic interest in having the legality of election laws resolved in advance of elections.\"   He wrote that waiting until actual harm is provable creates \"fraught circumstances\" by forcing any sort of legal resolution until after voting — and often counting — has completed.   \"One of the important policies about the conduct of election[s] is that the rules be clearly settled in advance of the election,\" he wrote. \"The Bost decision will contribute to that important aim of the election system.\"   While the Bost case dealt with the narrow issue of legal standing, the Supreme Court will also consider a separate challenge to mail ballot grace periods themselves.   \n",

Letters terminating funding went out late Tuesday night, sending shockwaves through the country's public health system. Letters will be sent soon restoring that funding.   \n   After a political backlash from Republicans and Democrats, the Department of Health and Human Services has reversed course and the grant money will be restored.   This decision to terminate the funding caught care providers across the United States completely by surprise, triggering a powerful negative response from lawmakers in Washington and from organizations all over the country. The story was first reported by NPR.   Now an administration official with direct knowledge of the decision, who asked NPR not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak about the change, says the decision is being reversed and the grants are being restored.   \n   More than 2,000 organizations and grant recipients are being notified as quickly as possible, according to the source.   Public health advocates said their organizations were breathing a sigh of relief but were also alarmed and shaken.   \"It was a day of panic across the country.  People are deeply alarmed but hopeful that this money is being restored,\" said Hannah Wesolowski with the National Alliance on Mental Illness.   \"This speaks to the bipartisan support in Congress for mental health. We heard from offices on both sides of the political aisle who were working on this issue throughout the day,\" she added.   The termination letters that were sent out Tuesday said bluntly that a wide variety of mental health and addiction programs didn't align with the Trump administration's public health agenda and would no longer be funded. This took care providers by surprise.    The backlash triggered a series of high-level meetings inside the Trump administration, and by Wednesday evening the decision had been rescinded.    NPR hasn't been able to determine who made the initial decision to cut these funds, nor would sources say who made the decision to restore the money.    Public health officials around the U.S. described the last 48 hours as chaotic.\n",

Today's top stories   President Trump delivered a speech yesterday at the Detroit Economic Club. He touched on the U.S. economy but also meandered into other topics. The president has started traveling around the U.S., addressing a top concern for voters: affordability. The economy is expected to be one of the main issues in this year's midterm elections.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump speaks at the Detroit Economic Club in Detroit, Michigan, on Jan. 13, 2026.\n                \n                    Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Throughout his speech, the president would change topics mid-sentence and insulted more than half a dozen politicians, including former President Joe Biden, NPR's Tamara Keith tells Up First. Trump said the economy is great and boasted about the low cost of groceries. He also stated that \"affordability\" is a fake word by Democrats, but Keith says the riffs of the term risk undercutting his message. The president said he plans to outline a proposal at the World Economic Forum next week to reduce home prices by removing private equity companies from the U.S. housing market.   The Department of Labor's latest inflation report showed that inflation, overall, neither improved nor worsened from November to December.    \n   🎧 Natural gas prices have risen more than 10% over the last year, the Labor Department reports. This affects nearly half of the U.S., which uses natural gas for heating, resulting in higher heating bills, NPR's Scott Horsley says. A significant amount of natural gas is used to generate electricity, which in turn drives up prices. Grocery prices were also up sharply last month. Most forecasters believe the Fed will hold interest rates steady when policymakers meet later this month, as inflation remains higher than the central bank's target.   At least six federal prosecutors in Minnesota have quit after Justice Department leaders pressured them in the investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Macklin Good. Rather than focusing on the federal agent who shot Good last week in Minneapolis, political leaders wanted the prosecutors to find dirt on her widow. The resignations have disrupted other federal investigations, including one into social services fraud.    🎧 The resignations amount to a big loss of career DOJ talent who prosecuted several major cases, Minnesota Public Radio's Matt Sepic says. The DOJ leaders pressured the prosecutors to look into Good's widow, Becca Good, for ties to activist groups, which is not illegal, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. This source also informed Sepic that they are concerned that Trump's focus on immigration has drawn resources away from the fraud investigation.   \n   Deep dive   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                People wait outside immigration court in October 2025 in San Francisco.\n                \n                    Minh Connors/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Minh Connors/AP\n    \n\n   \n   The Trump administration plans to close the San Francisco Immigration Court by the end of the year. The announcement comes as immigration judges have spent the last year facing pressure to expedite their caseloads and streamline deportations. Teresa Riley, the chief immigration judge, sent an email about the closure to court employees and judges last week. The email also explained that all personnel will now transfer to the Concord Immigration Court, approximately 30 miles away. San Francisco's immigration court has been among those hit by the Trump administration's push to fire judges.    ➡️ The Trump administration fired nearly 100 judges in 2025, according to an NPR count cross-referenced with the judges' union and several individual courts.➡️ The U.S. is starting this year with fewer than half the judges from a year ago. At least two courts — in Aurora, Colo., and in Oakdale, La., — have no judges left, just the court supervisor.➡️ With fewer judges and courts, immigrants are seeing their cases pushed back as far as 2030. Lawyers say the delays make their clients more susceptible to arrests and deportations.

Movement can boost a person's mood and can actively relieve symptoms of depression, according to a new study. Scientists evaluated 73 randomized controlled trials involving around 5,000 people with depression, with many of them also having tried antidepressant medications. The findings highlighted \"that exercise is one of the most evidence-based tools for improving mood,\" says psychiatrist Dr. Stephen Mateka. This is how exercise mirrors some of the effects of medication:    🚴 Exercise improves neurotransmitter function, like serotonin and dopamine. This benefit aligns with the way the medicine provides relief.🚴 Physical activity can trigger the release of brain growth factors. This is contrary to how depression can decrease neuroplasticity, making it harder for the brain to adapt and change.🚴 Prescribed exercise can be hard to start for someone with depression. However, light to moderate movements can benefit you as much as an intensive workout.   \n   3 things to know before you go   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Cartoonist Scott Adams poses with his a life-size cutout of his creation, Dilbert, in 2014.\n                \n                    Lea Suzuki/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Lea Suzuki/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Scott Adams, the controversial cartoonist behind Dilbert, has died at age 68.

Kennedy Jr., listen.\n                \n                    Alex Brandon/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Alex Brandon/AP\n    \n\n   \n   WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to place an additional 100% tax on Chinese imports starting on Nov. 1 or sooner, potentially escalating tariff rates close to levels that in April fanned fears of a global recession.   \n   The president expressed frustration with new export controls placed on rare earth elements by China — and said on social media that \"there seems to be no reason\" to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping as part of an upcoming trip to South Korea.   Trump later told reporters he had not canceled his meeting. \"But I don't know that we're going to have it,\" he said during an Oval Office appearance on another subject. \"I'm going to be there regardless, so I would assume we might have it.\"   \n   Trump also suggested there may be time to ratchet down his steep new tariff threat. \"We're going to have to see what happens. That's why I made it Nov. 1,\" he said.   China's new restrictions   On Thursday, the Chinese government restricted access to rare earth minerals, requiring foreign companies to get special approval for shipping the metallic elements abroad. It also announced permitting requirements on exports of technologies used in the mining, smelting and recycling of rare earths, adding that any export requests for products used in military goods would be rejected.   On social media, Trump described the export controls as \"shocking\" and \"out of the blue.\" He said China is \"becoming very hostile\" and that it's holding the world \"captive\" by restricting access to the metals and magnets used in electronics, computer chips, lasers, jet engines and other technologies.   Trump said in a post that \"starting November 1st, 2025 (or sooner, depending on any further actions or changes taken by China), the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying.\" The president also said the U.S. government would respond to China by putting its own export controls \"on any and all critical software\" from American firms.   \n   The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment.   Trump is known for using threats as a tactic   The S&P 500 tumbled 2.7% on worries about the rising tensions between the world's largest economies. It was the market's worst day since April when the president last bandied about import taxes this high. Still, the stock market closed before the president spelled out the terms of his threat.   Not only could the global trade war instigated by Trump be rekindled, but import taxes being heaped on top of the 30% already being levied on Chinese goods could, by the administration's past statements, cause trade to break down between the U.S. and China in ways that could cause growth worldwide to slump.   \n   While Trump's wording was definitive, he is also famously known for backing down from threats. Earlier this year, some investors began engaging in what the Financial Times called the \"TACO\" trade, which stands for \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\"   The prospect of tariffs this large could compound the president's own political worries, potentially pushing up inflation at a moment when the job market appears fragile and the drags from a government shutdown are starting to compound with layoffs of federal workers.   The United States and China have been jostling for advantage in trade talks, after the import taxes announced earlier this year triggered the trade war. Both countries agreed to ratchet down tariffs after negotiations in Switzerland and the United Kingdom, yet tensions remain as China has continued to restrict America's access to the difficult-to-mine rare earths needed for a wide array of U.S. technologies.   There is already a backlog of export license applications from Beijing's previous round of export controls on rare earth elements, and the latest announcements \"add further complexity to the global supply chain of rare earth elements,\" the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said in a statement.   \n   There are other flashpoints in the trade relationship, including U.S. restrictions on China's ability to import advanced computer chips, sales of American-grown soybeans and a series of tit-for-tat port fees being levied by both countries starting on Tuesday.   Analysts say there's time to de-escalate   Trump did not formally cancel the meeting with Xi, so much as indicating that it might not happen as part of a trip at the end of the month in Asia. The trip was scheduled to include a stop in Malaysia, which is hosting the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit; a stop in Japan; and a visit to South Korea, where he was slated to meet with Xi ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.   Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, said Beijing's move was a reaction to U.S. sanctions of Chinese companies this week and the upcoming port fees targeting China-related vessels — but said there's room for de-escalation to keep the leaders' meeting alive. \"It is a disproportional reaction,\" Sun said. \"Beijing feels that de-escalation will have to be mutual as well. There is room for maneuver, especially on the implementation.\"   Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., said China holds leverage because it dominates the market for rare earths with 70% of the mining and 93% of the production of permanent magnets made from them, which are crucial to high-tech products and the military.   \"These restrictions undermine our ability to develop our industrial base at a time when we need to. And then second, it's a powerful negotiating tool,\" she said.   Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a think tank, said Trump's post could \"mark the beginning of the end of the tariff truce\" that had lowered the tax rates charged by both countries.   \n   \"Mutually assured disruption between the two sides is no longer a metaphor,\" Singleton said. \"Both sides are reaching for their economic weapons at the same time, and neither seems willing to back down.\"\n"

The contest in the purplish state is often seen as a gauge of national voter sentiment in between a presidential election and the midterms. This year, some late breaking events may be reshaping the race. Here's Margaret Barthel of member station WAMU.MARGARET BARTHEL, BYLINE: First, there's the government shutdown. Virginia is home to about 320,000 federal workers. Right now, many of them are furloughed. The Trump administration's cuts to the federal workforce have hit the commonwealth hard, with an estimated 11,000 jobs eliminated, and Democrats are eager to use their votes to push back.(APPLAUSE)BARTHEL: That much was clear at a recent town hall meeting in northern Virginia. Marsha Peltz (ph) was there. She said her son lost his federal job in a mass layoff earlier this year. Now he's a contractor worried about his paycheck again. And that's got her feeling motivated to get out and vote.MARSHA PELTZ: There's not much I can do on a federal level. But on a state level, I do have some influence. So I'm encouraging my neighbors, please, go out and vote. Please volunteer.BARTHEL: That's good news for the Democrat in the governor's race. She's former Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger. On the campaign trail, she portrays herself as a champion for affordability and a defender of federal workers. Here she is at a debate on WAVY-TV last night.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: It is only increasing the challenge that they are facing after months and months of the attacks from this White House under DOGE.BARTHEL: Stephen Farnsworth is a professor of political science at the University of Mary Washington.STEPHEN FARNSWORTH: When you add up all those people who have directly or indirectly some downstream effect of federal employment, it is a very, very damaging environment for Republicans.BARTHEL: The Republican in the race is Virginia Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears. She's supported Trump's cuts to government jobs, insisting she's helped create plenty of jobs in the private sector. Instead, she talks a lot about transgender kids in bathrooms and locker rooms. Here she is last night.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)WINSOME EARLE-SEARS: This is not hard. Are you going to change in a gym where men are nude in the locker rooms? Are you going to do that, Abigail?BARTHEL: Her message is motivating for conservative-leaning voters like Ursula Bocall (ph), a federal contractor who came to a Moms for Liberty event to hear Earle-Sears speak.URSULA BOCALL: It just seems that now there's more of a push of the schools to over-insert themselves in the whole sort of sexuality issues that are going on in schools.BARTHEL: And there's another big development that may boost Earle-Sears, a scandal in the race for attorney general - violent and disturbing text messages from the Democratic candidate, Jay Jones, recently surfaced by the National Review. In a series of 3-year-old messages, Jones imagines a distressing scenario where a top Virginia Republican is shot. He goes on to wish the Republicans' children would die, too. This in hopes that he would change his policy positions. Zack Roday is a partner with Ascent Media, a Republican-leaning strategic communications firm.ZACK RODAY: It's going to fire up a whole lot of infrequent, probably right-of-center to conservative voters that are not Republican consistent voters. They may vote in presidentials. They don't vote in governors' races.BARTHEL: Virginia Republicans, President Trump and the Fraternal Order of Police have called for Jones to drop out. Spanberger has condemned the messages but hasn't said he should leave the race, and Republicans are already running ads criticizing her for it. In the meantime, early voting is in full swing in the commonwealth with nearly 450,000 ballots already cast.For NPR News, I'm Margaret Barthel in Arlington, Virginia.(SOUNDBITE OF ROEDELIUS AND TIM STORY'S \"CONCISE\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

And on Capitol Hill, there has been almost no sign of progress.   Seven times, lawmakers have filed into the Senate chamber to vote on the same two proposals to reopen the government — one backed by mostly Republicans, the other by Democrats. And seven times, they failed to end the shutdown.   Senators say they aren't even formally negotiating, which begs the question: what are they doing? And what does the stalemate say about the state of the Senate?   \"People are really just kind of dug in and everything is hyper-politicized,\" said Sen. John Fetterman, D-Penn., one of two Democrats voting with Republicans on their short-term spending bill.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. John Fetterman, D-Penn., sits on the steps of the U.S. Capitol on Oct. 1, the first full day of the government shutdown. \"People are really just kind of dug in and everything is hyper-politicized,\" he said this week.\n                \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Most Democrats are holding out for a deal to renew expiring health insurance subsidies. But the spending bills need 60 votes to advance, which means bipartisan support is the only way forward.   \n   Sitting on a bench outside the chamber this week, Fetterman said the endless loop of votes is not what he envisioned serving in the Senate would be like.   \"I think people should realize there's no glamor,\" he said.   President James Buchanan described the U.S. Senate as \"the world's greatest deliberative body.\"   Ask senators if they think that's true, and you get a lot of responses like this from Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., who laughed upon hearing the question.   \"I wish we did more deliberating,\" he said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., leaves a Senate Democratic meeting at the U.S. Capitol Building on Oct. 3. A Baptist pastor, Warnock said maybe his GOP colleagues would come around.\n                \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Even so, Warnock said voting no on the Republican-backed bill in order to preserve the subsidies before they run out at the end of the year is exactly what his constituents sent him to Washington to do. A Baptist pastor, Warnock said maybe his colleagues across the aisle would come around. \"It's never too late to come to Jesus,\" he said.   At the onset of the shutdown, Republicans promised more cracks in the Democratic caucus. Democrats said the same about the Republicans. Neither has happened.   \"The further we go, the deeper we get dug in. That's the way I see it,\" said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., speaks as U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. \"The further we go, the deeper we get dug in,\" he said about the shutdown this week.\n                \n                    Win McNamee/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Win McNamee/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   And that can make it seem a little like groundhog day. Reporters have to repeat the same questions. Lawmakers respond with the same answers. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., walked away from one press gaggle muttering, \"My god, make it stop.\"   \n   Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, said he does not believe this is what the founders intended.   \"If you think about it, we've only passed two or three bills this year,\" he said. \"And that's not what this institution was designed to do.\"   But some lawmakers are trying to keep a bipartisan spirit of give-and-take alive, even if the shutdown talks are at an impasse. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., and Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., chatted for several minutes on the floor during a vote earlier this week.   Were the lawmakers just shooting the breeze?   \"We're having substantive discussions,\" Peters said later.   \"There's a lot of other issues we're working on as well,\" Rounds said. \"We're still trying to do some other stuff besides the shutdown itself.\"   Late Thursday, the Senate did pass the annual defense bill with overwhelming bipartisan support.   A bipartisan group of senators also traded ideas over Thai food earlier this week, though Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, was tight-lipped about the details.   \"I don't talk about what happens at mealtimes,\" she said.   Asked why informal bipartisan gatherings were important, even when neither side seems willing to bend, Murkowski said, \"If you don't have communication, nothing changes, right?\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, walks to vote at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. \"If you don't have communication,\" she said, \"nothing changes, right?\"\n                \n                    Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., also attended, but skipped the Thai food. He said he prefers staples like hamburgers and hotdogs. Mullin said the group didn't negotiate the end of a shutdown, but did talk about what should happen after it ends.   \"We don't always agree, but we can be friends,\" Mullin said. \"That's the benefit right now because we trust each other, so we can have candid conversations and they've been pretty productive.\"   There have been glimmers of a potential path forward, including chatter about a possible vote after reopening the government to extend the subsidies. Though that potential compromise is still a non-starter for many Democrats.   \n   And tensions seemed to be growing on Friday as the Trump administration began to carry out mass layoffs of federal workers during the shutdown.   \n   But Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said Thursday that the repetitive votes do have value.   \"Votes tend to be the reason that everybody comes to the floor and then spends time talking to try to find a solution,\" he said. \"We haven't found a solution yet, but we're going to keep at it.\"   But the senators went home Friday with no deal and the shutdown now stretching into another week.\n"

The White House has thrown into question whether some will ever be made whole.   Still, for the first time in awhile, Monica Gorman is upbeat.   \"I'm feeling energized, honestly,\" says Gorman. \"It's felt for so long to me like federal workers have just been screaming into a void.\"   Gorman works at NASA and is a member of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers (IFPTE). She spoke in her personal capacity and not on behalf of the government.   \n   Long before Congress failed to pass a funding bill, the Trump administration essentially started shutting down the government bit by bit, Gorman says. At NASA, entire offices have been shuttered, including her own at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. She had been using data science to predict the cost of future NASA missions.   Due to cuts proposed in Trump's budget request, she was reassigned to a new position working on a lunar communications project. Her first day was supposed to be Oct. 1 — the same day the government shut down.   Now, the shutdown has given her hope that some in Congress may be willing to assert their Constitutional authority over spending and push back against some of the sweeping cuts.   \"To see people in Congress taking a harder line, I feel like we're finally being heard now in a way that we weren't before,\" she says.   \"I'm done being afraid\"   Even as the government shutdown has brought financial and emotional stress to federal workers and their families, it's also given a boost to some who see the standoff in Congress as an opportunity to get the word out that things are not okay.   \n   Nine months into President Trump's second term, Gorman and other federal workers tell NPR they are coming together to strategize, talk to reporters, meet with members of Congress and sound the alarm about everything the government has already lost: institutional knowledge, funding for vital services, the means for holding officials accountable.   Fear of retaliation by the Trump administration has left many federal employees reluctant to speak on the record with NPR. But now?   \"I'm done being afraid of them,\" Gorman says. She believes many others are too. \"They say the best organizer is a bad boss, and we all have the same bad boss.\"   \n   NPR asked the White House for a response to the criticism coming from some civil servants. In a statement, spokeswoman Abigail Jackson wrote: \"President Trump was elected by a resounding majority of Americans to carry out the agenda he is implementing. Federal workers who are actively resisting the Trump agenda are, in reality, working against the American people who elected the President.\"   Connecting with others for support and information   Sarah Kobrin, who has worked at the National Cancer Institute for nearly 22 years, says the Trump administration's repeated attacks on the federal workforce have brought government workers closer.   \"They have made us much, much stronger,\" she says, speaking in her personal capacity.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief with the National Cancer Institute, is known for her work on the HPV vaccine.\n                \n                    Claire Harbage/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Claire Harbage/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Kobrin says she has met all kinds of people in other agencies and around the country. They've been forced by the Trump administration to turn to each other for information about the administration's latest directives — and for support.   Earlier this year, Kobrin faced the difficult task of calling grantees to inform them that their research funding had been terminated. She'd been told her area of expertise — uptake of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine — was not a priority of the current administration. With so much of her work hobbled, she now refuses to stay silent.   \"I see the dismantling of the government and the scientific enterprise, specifically, and must speak,\" she says.   Still, in a workforce of more than 2 million people, Kobrin acknowledges that not all federal workers are weathering the shutdown and the turmoil of the past nine months the same way.   \"I know there is certainly a wide variety of what people need. How afraid they are, how stable they feel,\" she says. \"It's hard not to be paranoid under the current circumstances.\"   With unions sidelined, grassroots employee networks grow   Earlier this year, President Trump issued an executive order ending collective bargaining rights for most federal employees, citing national security concerns even at agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Weather Service. That executive order faces multiple lawsuits.   \n   Also targeted were unions representing employees at the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), including a local chapter of the National Federation of Federal Employees that was led by Stephanie Rice, an employee of BLM based in Alaska.   \n   With the union's future looking dim, Rice began looking for other ways to connect with federal workers and discovered the Federal Unionists Network, the group that Gorman is also a part of.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Stephanie Rice is an employee of the Bureau of Land Management based in Alaska.\n                \n                    Stephanie Rice\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Stephanie Rice\n    \n\n   \n   Now, from her base in Anchorage, Rice has been able to stay engaged and informed, even with little information coming through official channels.   \"This sort of crowdsourcing across the country, with everyone saying, 'I saw this. What have you heard?'… has been really useful,\" she says, speaking in her personal capacity.   Before her time in Alaska, Rice served for six years in the Air Force's Office of Special Investigations. She's devoted her entire adult life to public service.   \"I believe very strongly that my job as a civil servant is to carry out the lawful instructions of the sitting administration, regardless of whether I think it's a good policy,\" she says. \"That's my job, and I did it under the first Trump administration.\"   But this time, she believes the administration is acting lawlessly, including by sidelining the unions.   \"The time for us to stand up and do something about it is now. We might not get another opportunity,\" she says.\n"

    "description": "Alexandra is one of many people who lost their jobs for posting about the conservative influencer's death. She described the online mob that got her fired as \"state-sponsored censorship.\"",
    "body": "\n      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Xinyue Chen for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Scrolling through social media during a work break, Alexandra realized she was going to lose her new job.   An X account with over 500,000 followers had reposted a screenshot of a Facebook post she'd made about slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk.   \"You log onto Twitter and you see half a million people following a page, including Elon Musk. They're saying, you better fire this person,\" said Alexandra. \"I knew that they were going to fire me because of the pressure by the mob.\"   \n   The X account also named Alexandra and her employer. NPR is not naming the X account and also only using Alexandra's middle name because she is concerned about her safety.   Less than three hours after the X post about her, Alexandra's employer fired her via email. There was no conversation, Alexandra said. She had started the cybersecurity job just two weeks before.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                After a post on X named Alexandra and her employer, an employment termination email arrived in her inbox.\n                \n                    Keren Carrión/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Keren Carrión/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   And then there were the threats. One user on Facebook asked Alexandra how she liked an Italian restaurant across the street from where she lives in New York City, a sign that someone had tracked down her address and possibly other personal information.   \"4.5 out of 5 stars, sounds pretty decent,\" the post said.   Alexandra left her apartment. \"If they can come for me on the Internet, they can definitely come for me in real life.\"   She first went to a friend's place across town. \"I woke up in her kid's princess room in the morning, and then I went to another friend's house in Connecticut for the next three or four days.\"   \n   Alexandra is among the people who lost their jobs because of their social media posts about Kirk's death. She is not the only one who has expressed concerns about physical safety after naming-and-shaming campaigns online. While such campaigns are not new, both Alexandra and researchers watching them noted how the scrutiny is now sharply focused on employment, and that pressure now comes with the weight from figures with political power.   Guest-hosting the podcast Kirk used to host, Vice President Vance told viewers to call out people for what he called \"celebrating Charlie's murder.\"   \n   \"Hell, call their employer,\" he said. Online, people traded tips to not only make phone calls, but to also leave negative Google reviews and send emails to management. Multiple websites popped up to collect offending social media posts and information about the people who posted them.   Born in the former Soviet Union, Alexandra moved to the U.S. with her family as an infant decades ago. \"My entire life, they would tell me that they left to come here for me, you know, with no idea of ever being able to return\".   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Alexandra's family moved to the U.S. from the Soviet Union so she could grow up with more freedoms.\n                \n                    Keren Carrión/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Keren Carrión/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Her family left, she said, so she could grow up with more freedoms — something she now feels is at risk. She understood that her former employer could fire her for any reason, but she feels frustrated that it happened — in her view — because of an online pressure campaign backed by people with political power. \"I don't think that was ever what the standard issue response was.\"   \"What's currently happening is state-sponsored censorship,\" Alexandra said, \"While it may not be officially documented sponsored by the state, it is verbally sponsored by the state.\"   From employed to unemployed in eight hours    Alexandra wrote the Facebook post that got her fired at 10:13 A.M. on Sept 12, two days after Kirk was assassinated.   The post was a riff on Kirk's own words about an attack on Paul Pelosi, the husband of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, after a man entered their home in San Francisco and attacked Paul with a hammer shortly before the 2022 midterms. He sustained a fractured skull and other severe injuries.   \n   Days after the attack, Kirk spoke about the attacker on his show, \"And why is he still in jail? Why has he not been bailed out? By the way, if some amazing patriot out there in San Francisco, or the Bay Area, wants to really be a midterm hero, someone should go and bail this guy out, I get his bail is about $30,000 or $40,000. Bail him out and then go ask him some questions.\"   Alexandra's post mimicked Kirk's words: \"They caught the guy (allegedly)...\" she wrote after the alleged gunman was named and arrested. \"And why is he still in jail? Why has he not been bailed out? By the way, if some amazing patriot out there in Utah wants to be a midterm hero, someone should go and bail out Tyler Robinson... Bail him out and then go ask him some questions about Charlie.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Ever since the post on X revealed her personal information, Alexandra worries for her personal safety.\n                \n                    Keren Carrión/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Keren Carrión/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Alexandra said \"it was horrible\" the way Kirk died. \"I felt as bad for him as I feel for any victim of gun violence, especially in schools.\"   \n   But she said she was objecting to the way \"everybody was making him to be a martyr for free speech and some kind of hero nationally ... a hero, because he was a right-wing Christian nationalist.\"   \n   In recent years began to frame his political arguments in explicitly Christian terms, including some tropes and imagery used by activists with anti-democratic aims.   \n   \"I don't value those things.\" Alexandra said, \"As an American, I don't think we have to value the same things. We just have to protect each other's ability to say, though.\"   For the first few hours, Alexandra's post didn't draw much attention. The ire she faced only started after she commented on someone else's friends-only Facebook post. That person was criticizing posts that were what he called an \"endorsement of Charlie Kirk's death\"   \"[W]e are quoting him. If you big mad you mad at him\" Alexandra wrote around midday. \"I had said that comment and then went back to work,\" Alexandra said.   She did not see his response until much later.   \"You cannot redeem yourself here. Your presence is voluntary, I'm only leaving you for the wolves,\" wrote her now-former Facebook friend. The two have since blocked each other.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                \"As an American, I don't think we have to value the same things. We just have to protect each other's ability to say, though,\" Alexandra said.\n                \n                    Keren Carrión/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Keren Carrión/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   More comments flowed in, focusing on who her employer was. Around three o'clock, another account wrote, \"It would be a shame if people started posting this,\" followed by a screenshot of Alexandra's post that echoed Kirk's words.   \"Already submitted, currently going viral on Twitter,\" a third account wrote. \"Have a good day\"   Around the same time, the prominent X account with half-a-million followers posted a screenshot of Alexandra's original post. It was sharply critical of what she'd written and gave her full name and the name of her employer. Within minutes, other accounts replied.   \"On it,\" one account wrote, \"this time I'm contacting any board/investor contacts as well and leaving the CEO in the dark.\" Another posted a screenshot of the employer's contact information.   \n   About two-and-a-half hours later, the account that screenshotted the employer contact information followed up with another screenshot that appears to be an email from Alexandra's employer, saying that it was \"reviewing the situation internally\"   About 20 minutes after the email screenshot, Alexandra was fired by email.   Alexandra's employer confirmed to NPR that a firing was made that day but did not confirm it was her, saying the decision was \"based on the employee's failure to adhere to our established company policies.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Alexandra had only recently started her new job when she was fired.\n                \n                    Keren Carrión/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Keren Carrión/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   The reach of large accounts   Unlike the many posts that went viral in the wake of Kirk's assassination, Alexandra's message did not have a particularly broad reach.   It garnered fewer than 100,000 views and before Alexandra's employer fired her, it had under 80 replies.   The dozens of comments or even emails and phone calls probably weren't as big of a concern for an employer as worries about even bigger heavyweight users the post could potentially draw, said Daniel Trottier, a professor at Erasmus University Rotterdam, who has studied naming and shaming online campaigns.   \n   Multiple users with much smaller followings tagged Libs of Tik Tok and Laura Loomer, two prominent users who have a history of publicizing other accounts they disagree with. Libs of Tik Tok is an account run by right wing influencer Chaya Raichik, who has a track record of running targeted campaigns against drag queens and children's hospitals that she falsely accused of performing certain kinds of gender-affirming surgery on young children.   Although no one tagged Musk, X's most influential user, he has interacted with the account that shared Alexandra's post multiple times in the past.   \"Having Elon Musk as part of this — I can imagine that for the employers in this case, they could see how it could potentially escalate,\" Trottier said.   Alexandra agreed, \"If they did this in real life and I was physically in an office, they [employer] wouldn't be like 'oh, you're fired here.'\"   \n   She said, \"They wouldn't do that. They would say 'no, you guys are crazy — like, what are you talking about? And why are you here?'\"   \"They're only worried because of the exposure of that page on Twitter and Elon being part of it,\" she said.   While busy exposing other people, many of the online activists appeared to have no desire to unmask themselves. The large account that highlighted Alexandra is run anonymously. The account and its followers tried to pressure one employer when, according to a screenshot, the employer asked for the name, business address and phone number of the person writing in to complain before they would provide an update.   \"Is this an attempt at intimidation or a threat?\" an anonymous sender wrote in the screenshot. The large X account called for more pressure.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The large account that highlighted Alexandra's private information is run anonymously.\n                \n                    Keren Carrión/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Keren Carrión/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   The employer, a real estate company, did not respond to NPR's requests for comment. No one associated with the X account that shared Alexandra's post responded to NPR's requests for comment.   Consequences   Although the rapid succession of reports about people being fired for their posts about Kirk's death seems more widespread than in other instances, it's not yet clear exactly how many people have been affected, and how often such campaigns manage to get people fired. At least one of the databases that compiled information about Kirk-related social media posts and their authors is no longer online. Self-proclaimed hackers claimed responsibility for taking the site down though it's not possible to verify their claims.   Employers have responded to campaigns in different ways. In one case NPR was able to verify, a public institution resisted disciplining a staff member despite pressure from multiple branches of local government. The staffer in question is a survivor of a mass shooting and posted a meme critiquing Kirk's support for gun rights. Meanwhile other staff members at other public institutions have been fired for making similar critiques, some of whom had family and friends who survived gun violence.   \n   A review of the timeline of the X account that highlighted Alexandra shows that it targeted at least 150 people for their speech about Charlie Kirk between Sept 10 to Sept 19. It flagged outcomes of their campaigns for just 13 cases, of which NPR was able to verify 12. Ten employers fired their employees, and two — one state legislator and one pet store owner — issued statements standing behind the employee.   In several other cases, employers did not respond even as the X account posted repeatedly, doubling down on its pressure campaign.   The kinds of consequences people should face for making unpopular or distasteful statements has often been ambiguous in previous naming and shaming campaigns, Trottier said. But what's notable this time, he said, was the explicit focus on firing people.   \"I don't think there is much controversy in the idea that the notion of proportionality is out the window,\" Trottier said.   \n   Nine days after Kirk was killed, the large X account stopped calling for people to get fired over their posts about Charlie Kirk. President Trump announced he wanted to hike visa fees on immigrant workers and the account moved onto critiquing the visa system.   Alexandra has not moved on. Having returned to her apartment, she continues to worry about her safety. \"There was a guy standing on the roof across the street from my house. And normally there's not usually people there. And normally it wouldn't really, really faze me. But I lowered my shades.\" She's appealed to X to take down the post about her to no success, and she has been seeking legal help.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Alexandra continues to worry about her safety.\n                \n                    Keren Carrión/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Keren Carrión/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Alexandra said she has warned friends about posting online. \"I probably was on social media too much. So okay, you win. I'm not going to post more things on the internet.\" She took down photos of herself, made her Facebook posts non-public and archived the post that got her fired.   \n   But she's worried about the larger chilling effects on speech. \"Where does this stop? What if I went to a protest? And what if I made a sign that somebody took a picture of and they didn't like it?\"   NPR's Jude Joffe-Block contributed reporting   Have a tip?

President Trump and his allies, including Rudy Giuliani, have falsely blamed Dominion and its machines for rigging the 2020 election, taking votes from Trump. The baseless claims against Dominion caused one of its executives to go into hiding in 2020, and led to numerous defamation lawsuits.    \n   Giuliani recently reached a confidential settlement with Dominion. Most notably, Dominion won a nearly $800 million defamation case against Fox News.   Earlier this year, an official with Trump's Justice Department reached out to county clerks in Missouri and asked to inspect Dominion voting equipment they used in 2020.   The Liberty Vote release makes a couple of nods to conservative election priorities, including calling the acquisition \"a bold and historic move to transform and improve election integrity in America.\" Conservatives in recent years have used the phrase \"election integrity\" and talked about increasing faith in the nation's voting systems.   \n   The release also notes that one of Liberty Vote's priorities is \"[l]everaging hand-marked paper ballots enabling compliance with President Trump's executive order, and ensuring election security and compliance with federal standards.\"   Most U.S. voters already vote using hand-marked paper ballots. Much of Trump's March executive order on voting has been halted by federal judges.   The new company is founded by Scott Leiendecker, a onetime St. Louis Republican election director who founded an election technology company that's broadly used by election officials.\n"

    "body": "\n      NPR's Scott Detrow talks with Jake Sullivan, national security adviser to former President Biden, about President Trump's plan for peace in Gaza.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  The ceasefire is now in effect between Israel and Hamas. The Israeli military has pulled back from certain positions in the Gaza strip. In the coming days, a hostage and prisoner exchange is set to begin, and hundreds of humanitarian aid trucks are expected to be allowed into Gaza. It's all part of President Trump's 20-point peace plan, a plan whose outline does closely resemble that of his predecessor, former President Joe Biden. Here to talk about this moment and what is ahead is Jake Sullivan. He served as National Security Advisor to President Biden and was deeply involved in negotiations and policymaking around the Gaza War. Welcome back to the program.JAKE SULLIVAN: Thanks for having me.DETROW: Look, let's start. We've been here before. As you deeply know, you and others in the Biden administration helped broker a multiphase ceasefire in the final days of the administration. Then it fell apart a couple of months later. So what to you may be different now?SULLIVAN: Well, first, I think we have to start with the good news, which is we have a ceasefire. The guns have gone silent. Unless something terrible happens, hostages will be coming out and aid will be going in. And these hostages have been living through hell, and they're finally going to be reunited with their families. And Palestinian civilians have been living through hell, and they're finally going to get a measure of relief. So there are a lot of questions about what comes next for the long term. But in the immediate term, it does look as though all of the parties have determined that the next step will be ceasefire, hostages, aid relief, and that formula is a good formula on a very basic human level.DETROW: I wanted to ask you about something that we heard on our show this morning on Morning Edition. We talked to veteran hostage negotiator Gershon Baskin, who was involved in these talks, and he told my colleague, Leila Fadel, about what was different this time, and he said President Trump made a difference. Here's what he said.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)GERSHON BASKIN: Let's face it, Benjamin Netanyahu and Ron Dermer, his main ally in the Israeli government, support the American Republican Party, not the Democratic Party. They were hostile to Barack Obama. They were hostile to Joe Biden, and they're very supportive of Donald Trump. So that was one thing. Biden never had the leverage over Netanyahu that Trump has.DETROW: I'm curious what your response is to that statement.SULLIVAN: Well, first, I would say that when President Biden left office, there was, as you said, a ceasefire in place. There were hostages coming out. There was aid going in then. And more importantly, there was a roadmap for a final and comprehensive end to the war. Israel actually walked away from that under President Trump, and we had six more months of fighting. So I'm very glad that President Trump finally came around to the view that this war had to end and applied pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu. But I think something else happened, as well, which is that Hamas' position got very badly weakened over the course of this time. One year ago today, Hamas' leader, Sinwar, was still alive. There were still Hamas military elements. Today, Hamas is a shadow of its former self, and that's part of why we ended up where we are.DETROW: Yeah.SULLIVAN: So I believe that it's a combination of facts on the ground and the fact that it was time for the American president - past time for the American president, in this case, President Trump, to bring pressure to bear to end this war.DETROW: I do want to ask about one more contrast between Presidents Trump and Biden that a lot of people in Israel, especially, have been telling our reporters that they felt like President Trump was much more willing to make direct threats in public, in private, and they felt like that made a difference in getting both sides to try to end this war. Do you think there's any accuracy to that?SULLIVAN: Well, I didn't really see direct threats in public against Prime Minister Netanyahu. I've seen some reported threats that he made privately but not publicly, and, of course, President Biden had very tough private conversations with Prime Minister Netanyahu. I did see some of the public threats with respect to Hamas, but he made those threats six months ago and obviously, Hamas kept fighting. He's made them recently. So to me, the key thing here is that Israel had no more military objectives to achieve in Gaza, and Hamas had lost a huge amount of its capacity to continue to resist militarily. And when you put those two things together, this situation was ripe to be resolved. I would argue that it was ripe to be resolved months ago after the first ceasefire came into place and that we've had months of needless fighting. But I am glad that they finally come around to the position where they've got the ceasefire in place, and now I hope that they can make it durable by actually working on the remaining points of this plan.DETROW: What are your biggest questions about what the Israeli government and military does in the coming months, based on all of your experiences dealing with them?SULLIVAN: Well, a huge question is what actually happens with the disposition of Israeli forces inside Gaza? They've pulled back to a certain extent, but they, of course, have not fully withdrawn. And then a second main question is what happens to Hamas? To what extent are there Hamas fighters who continue to operate inside Gaza in the future? And then the final question is who will govern Gaza as we go forward? The right answer is a Palestinian government that does not include Hamas, does not include any terrorist organizations. Is that achievable? I think these are all very difficult and challenging both logistical and political issues, and it's what the Americans and all of the Arab countries as well as the Israelis and Palestinians are going to have to turn to next.DETROW: I've noticed that you've been pretty introspective in recent interviews. I read a quote where you said that sometimes you have a hard time sleeping at night just because of the nature of the job you held for four years. I'm wondering, do you, in this moment, as you think about things and how this took two years, is there anything you're thinking perhaps if we had done this differently, exerted pressure differently, this war could have ended sooner?SULLIVAN: Of course I think about that. I think about that all the time because there's been such a massive human toll, a massive human toll for innocent Palestinians, a massive human toll for the hostages and their families. So I wrestle with that every day, and I don't think I'd be human if I didn't. But I think it's also important to recognize, again, that we left office with a ceasefire in place, and that ceasefire broke down in March, and we've had six months of fighting since President Trump has been president - or more than six months of fighting. So I hope the Trump administration is also asking itself the same question. Is there anything they could have done to end the war sooner than now, and is there any lesson that they take from the last time the ceasefire broke down to make sure that it doesn't break down again?DETROW: That is Jake Sullivan, National Security Advisor under former president Joe Biden. Thank you so much for talking to us.SULLIVAN: Thanks for having me.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), speaks with reporters outside of the West Wing of the White House in July 2025.\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   More than a week into the government shutdown, layoffs of federal workers have begun, following through on administration threats to slash the size of government during the shutdown.   In a court filing late Friday, lawyers for the government wrote that an estimated 4,200 employees across at least seven agencies began receiving reduction in force, or RIF, notices on Oct. 10.   The declaration, from Office of Management and Budget (OMB) senior advisor Stephen Billy, came in response to an order from the federal judge assigned to a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's shutdown layoffs.   \n   Word that layoffs were underway first came from OMB Director Russell Vought in a social media post on X that said, \"The RIFs have begun.\"   While the administration initially offered few details on the scope of what it called \"substantial\" layoffs, some federal employees began sharing actual layoff notices on social media while federal employee unions said they'd been notified of pending cuts.   Asked by reporters Friday how many workers may lose their jobs, President Trump did not give an exact figure, but told reporters \"it'll be a lot.\"   \"We'll announce the numbers over the next couple of days, but it'll be a lot of people, all because of the Democrats,\" Trump said.   \n   In his declaration, OMB senior advisor Billy stressed that while the information he was providing Friday was the most current, the situation \"is fluid and rapidly evolving.\" The numbers are subject to change, he wrote, suggesting more RIFs could come in the future.   Here are the agencies affected by the RIFs, according to the declaration, with the estimated numbers of employees who will be affected:   Department of Health and Human Services: 1100-1200 employees    Earlier Friday, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon confirmed that RIF notices are being sent out to agency employees.   \n   \"HHS employees across multiple divisions are receiving reduction-in-force notices as a direct consequence of the Democrat-led government shutdown,\" said Nixon shortly after Vought's post. \"All HHS employees receiving reduction-in-force notices were designated non-essential by their respective divisions.\"   Nixon blamed the Biden administration for creating a \"bloated bureaucracy,\" although HHS has already cut more workers — 20,000 workers through an earlier RIF and through voluntary resignations and retirements — than were added during the Biden administration.   Department of Education: 466 employees    A union representing Education Department employees said in a statement that \"multiple union members\" confirmed that at least two offices would be affected by RIFs: the Office of Communications and Outreach as well as the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education.   \"This administration continues to use every opportunity to illegally dismantle the Department of Education (ED) against congressional intent,\" AFGE Local 252 president Rachel Gittleman said in a statement on Friday. \"They are using the same playbook to cut staff without regard for the impacts to students and families in communities across the country.\"   \n   Department of Housing and Urban Development: 442 employees    Antonio Gaines, president of AFGE Council 222, representing employees of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) across the country, confirmed to NPR that the union had received notice from HUD of its \"intent to fire a number of employees.\"   \"We are in the process of reviewing the notice, assessing the impact and magnitude of the agency's decision, while acquiring legal guidance from the National office,\" Gaines wrote.   A HUD spokesperson said the reduction in force was \"to align our programs with the Administration's priorities and the appropriations available to the department.\"   Treasury Department: 1446 employees   On Reddit, IRS employees posted screenshots of actual RIF notices they had received, informing them of their last day, Dec. 9.   \"The Internal Revenue Service has determined it is necessary to abolish some positions in INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY to further workforce shaping efforts,\" read one such notice.   \n   An employee with the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund shared a notice that the entire organization was set to be abolished.   Environmental Protection Agency: 20-30 employees    In court filings, the Trump administration said the EPA has not made a final decision on \"whether or when to issue RIF notices.\"   But earlier Friday, AFGE Council 238 president Justin Chen said he'd learned that Environmental Protection Agency employees overseeing recycling and composting initiatives, plastics reduction and other programs, were among those targeted for layoffs.   \"Weakening the EPA workforce is a direct threat to the health and safety of Americans,\" wrote Chen in a statement. \"If Trump thinks he is only hurting federal workers with this decision, he is sorely mistaken.\"   An EPA spokesperson blamed Democrats and the government shutdown for the layoffs.   Other agencies   The other agencies mentioned in the declaration are the Commerce Department, with 315 employees affected; the Energy Department, with 187 employees affected; and the Department of Homeland Security, with 176 employees affected.   Here's what's ahead with mass layoffs at federal agencies : NPR   Federal law is specific about the process that RIFs must follow, including a minimum 60 days' notice of their end date, or 30 days if a waiver is granted by the Office of Personnel Management.   Some agencies may need to notify unions or Congress, and then draft official notices to send to affected employees. The notices are required to include information such as the reasons for the RIF and the effective date.   Unions seek legal recourse, again   The declaration came in a lawsuit filed by several unions over the threat of RIFs ahead of the shutdown, arguing \"the Trump administration has made unlawful threats to dismantle essential federal services and functions provided by federal personnel, deviating from historic practice and violating applicable laws.\"   U.S. District Judge Susan Illston had ordered the Trump administration to detail the status of \"any currently planned or in-progress RIF notices to be issued during/because of the government shutdown.\" Illston will hold a hearing in the case next Wednesday.   \n   In a statement Friday, American Federation of Government Employees National president Everett Kelley slammed the RIFs announcement.   \n   \"It is disgraceful that the Trump administration has used the government shutdown as an excuse to illegally fire thousands of workers who provide critical services to communities across the country,\" he said.   Since the shutdown began, the Trump administration has made several threats to cut spending, fire workers and not pay some furloughed employees, arguing that the reductions are the fault of Democrats who won't drop their demands for extended health care subsidies in exchange for reopening the government.   The White House has also said its decision to freeze transportation funding in Chicago and New York and cancel billions of dollars in Biden-era energy project grants are a continuation of their push to shrink the size and scope of the federal bureaucracy.   Mass layoffs were a hallmark policy of the Department of Government Efficiency effort that began when Trump returned to office in January.   In February, a memo from the Office of Personnel Management and OMB asked federal agencies to prepare multi-phase plans to implement Trump's \"workforce optimization initiative\" that includes layoffs and what the workforce would look like when the new fiscal year started Oct. 1.   As NPR has previously reported, many agencies that implemented layoffs at the pressure and direction of DOGE have hired back workers in recent weeks, citing the inability to perform basic tasks and carry out Trump's policy priorities.   While the Trump administration has argued that cuts to the federal government need to happen because of the lapse in funding, some experts say a shutdown does not mean layoffs are necessary.   \"There is no statute requiring them to lay off a substantial share of federal employees during a temporary government shutdown,\" Jessica Riedl with the center-right Manhattan Institute said. \"That statute doesn't exist, and such practice has not occurred during previous shutdowns.\"   \n   Layoffs dampen chance of funding compromise   Top Republicans on Capitol Hill are pinning blame for the mass layoffs on Democrats, who have refused to support a Republican-backed measure to reopen the government because it does not extend health insurance subsidies that are expiring later this year.   GOP leaders also hoped the threat of mass layoffs would compel Democrats to relent. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said the Trump administration was left with no choice.   \"I think they held off as long as they could,\" Thune told reporters Friday.   But Democrats say Republicans are taking advantage of the shutdown to continue their ongoing effort to slash the footprint of the federal government.   \"Let's be blunt: nobody's forcing Trump and Vought to do this,\" Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote in a statement Friday. \"They don't have to do it; they want to. They're callously choosing to hurt people—the workers who protect our country, inspect our food, respond when disasters strike. This is deliberate chaos.\"   Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine., told reporters on Thursday that a bipartisan group was making progress on a possible path to end the shutdown that would include a vote on health insurance subsidies after the government reopens.   But hope of a compromise may be fading again, as the layoffs inflame tensions in Congress even more.   Collins was among the few Republicans to criticize the layoffs on Friday.   \"I strongly oppose OMB Director Russ Vought's attempt to permanently lay off federal workers who have been furloughed due to a completely unnecessary government shutdown caused by Senator Schumer,\" Collins wrote. \"Regardless of whether federal employees have been working without pay or have been furloughed, their work is incredibly important to serving the public.\"   NPR's Cory Turner, Jennifer Ludden and Michael Copley contributed to this report.    Have information you want to share about agency reduction-in-force plans and other changes to the federal government?

While the agency continues to disburse retirement and disability benefits, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them.   These official letters act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits.   \"Not only do people need these letters when they apply for those benefits, but they also often need to recertify to prove that they continue to have an eligible income level, and it often happens on a deadline,\" says Kathleen Romig, director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.   \n   Beneficiaries can still access their verification letter online and through the Social Security Administration's automated phone system, the agency says. But during the shutdown, in-person support for the letters is suspended, and when recipients call in to speak with a field office representative, they can't get help with their letter.   And field office workers tell NPR that many people are calling in, seeking assistance. (The workers who spoke to NPR were speaking on behalf of their union because they can't speak on behalf of the Social Security Administration.)   \"Anywhere between 60 to 70% of our calls are, 'I need my benefit verification letter right now at this time' during the shutdown,\" says Tierra Carter, a teleservice worker at an office in Tampa, Fla., who also represents a chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees. \"A beneficiary cannot receive a benefit verification letter from the telephone receiver or by walking in through their local Social Security office. And that burdens a lot of our recipients.\"   \n   Romig notes that \"Social Security beneficiaries are much older than the American population on average, so not everybody has a lot of facility with online tools. And likewise, Social Security serves many people with disabilities. And those disabilities could include things that make it hard to use a device, like cognitive disabilities or motor skills or memory issues.\"   Additionally, critics of the SSA's automated phone system, which include a group of Democratic senators, have reported that it often glitches, loops and doesn't solve a caller's problem.   \n   Barri Sue Bryant, who has worked at the agency for 20 years and represents the Wilkes-Barre, Pa.-area union, says a lot of these calls \"tear at our heartstrings.\"   She says she got a call this week from an elderly man who doesn't know how to use a computer and needed a benefit verification letter so he could finalize his mortgage.   \"So, he was going to lose the mortgage if he didn't get it in time,\" Bryant says. \"And then we also had an 89-year-young woman who needed it to get her rent subsidy or she was going to lose it. So, she ultimately could lose her housing over it.\"   In a statement to NPR, an agency spokesperson said beneficiaries will continue to get their payments, but \"as a result of the lapse in appropriation, SSA is following the contingency plan for continued activities.\"   Bryant and other Social Security employees say it's frustrating that they can't provide the verification letter service during the shutdown.   \"They don't consider benefit verification letters essential, but they are to the public, you know. It really runs many of their lives,\" Bryant says.   Christine Lizotte, a claims representative for the agency in Auburn, Maine, who also represents a union chapter in New England, says even when beneficiaries are able to set up an account online, they often have issues.   \"We have some that have navigated it, set up an account, can't remember their email, can't remember their password,\" she says.   \n   Lizotte said the timing of this shutdown is particularly worrisome in Maine.   Open enrollment for fuel assistance, which for some people requires one of these SSA letters, has begun. She says it's already getting cold in New England, and many folks are calling in for letters and are now worried their assistance won't be sorted out in time.   \"If you don't have your application done, by the time it gets cold — and I mean, it's starting to get cold — you may lose out or you may have a delayed fuel assistance voucher, which means the first few months you might be cold,\" she says.   \n   \"So it feels like this huge disservice that we've spent our entire careers here to help these individuals and now are being told, 'Oh, I'm sorry — we can't help you today.' And that is beyond frustrating. Goes against everything we are.\"   \"Almost at a breaking point\"   Many workers report an uptick in these frantic and upset callers at a time when SSA workers themselves are struggling.   Because of the shutdown, employees are going without pay, and many of them have also taken on more work in the past several months due to thousands of staff departures at the agency prompted by the Trump administration.   \n   Alex Creese, a claims specialist with the agency in Aurora, Colo., says on behalf of his local AFGE union chapter that many employees are \"living paycheck to paycheck\" and are worried about paying their bills as long as the shutdown continues. He said the stress of these heartbreaking calls from recipients is exacerbating an already tough situation.   \"Right now, with the shutdown, our hands are tied and we're already stretched so thin that now we're stretched even thinner,\" he says. \"So whether it's these programs that we can't offer or programs that we can offer, everything's being impacted. And right now we're just almost at a breaking point.\"   Creese worries that even more employees will leave the agency.   \"We are running on fumes right now,\" he says. \"If the shutdown continues, then … I could see all these talented people leaving. It's just not a good situation right now whatsoever.\"\n"

Santiago/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   A federal grand jury in Virginia has indicted New York Attorney General Letitia James on one count of bank fraud and one count of making a false statement to a financial institution — charges that come after steady pressure from President Trump to prosecute one of his longtime political foes.   James, a Democrat who pledged to investigate Trump during her campaign, eventually sued Trump and his company for inflating the value of some of its properties, winning more than $450 million in the civil business fraud case. The financial penalty was later thrown out on appeal.    At one of his own campaign rallies last year, Trump called for both James and the judge in that case to \"be arrested and punished accordingly.\" The president has been persistent in his calls since taking office, writing \"JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED\" in a post on Truth Social last month that was directed at U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.    \n   Thursday's indictment accuses James of lying on her application for a $109,600 mortgage to buy a property in Norfolk, Va., in 2020, alleging she promised her financial lenders it would be a secondary property for her personal use — but that she instead rented it out. The government says she benefited from \"ill-gotten gains\" of $18,933 from favorable terms including a lower borrowing rate and a higher seller credit.   In a video posted to social media, James denied the charges as \"baseless\" and criticized the president's actions as a \"grave violation of our constitutional order.\"     \"This is nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system,\" James said. \"He is forcing federal law enforcement agencies to do his bidding, all because I did my job as the New York state attorney general.\"    Federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia spent months on the case this year. A Republican career prosecutor there determined there was not enough evidence to bring a case against James. Then he was forced out of his job by the White House, only to be replaced by Lindsey Halligan, a former insurance lawyer in Florida with no experience as a prosecutor.   \"No one is above the law. The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust,\" Halligan said in a statement. \"The facts and the law in this case are clear, and we will continue following them to ensure that justice is served.\"   \n   Last month, Halligan secured an indictment against former FBI Director James Comey, who has pleaded not guilty to two felony charges.   The charges for James have been pushed in part by Ed Martin, the weaponization czar inside the Justice Department who traveled to Brooklyn to stand outside one of James's properties, where he was photographed by The New York Post.    Abbe Lowell, a lawyer for James, has criticized Martin for targeting Democratic lawmakers and other figures to settle scores for Trump.    \"We are deeply concerned that this case is driven by President Trump's desire for revenge,\" Lowell said in a statement on Thursday. \"When a President can publicly direct charges to be filed against someone — when it was reported that career attorneys concluded none were warranted — it marks a serious attack on the rule of law. We will fight these charges in every process allowed in the law.\"   James is scheduled for an initial court appearance on Oct. 24. \n"

That came mere days after Trump said in the wake of the U.S. operation to oust Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend that \"Colombia is very sick too\" and accused Petro of \"making cocaine and selling it to the United States.\"   \n   In comments to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump added of Petro, \"He's not going to be doing it very long, let me tell you.\" Asked whether U.S. intervention was possible, Trump responded, \"Sounds good to me.\"   Later Wednesday, addressing thousands of protesters that he had mobilized to rally against U.S. military threats, Petro said he had spoken with Trump for roughly one hour.   \"I talked about two things: Venezuela and the issue of drug trafficking,\" he told the crowd in downtown Bogotá, where demonstrators had just minutes earlier chanted slogans against the United States at Petro's behest.   Petro explained to the audience that Colombian politicians allegedly linked to narco-trafficking misled the U.S. president about Petro's record to turn Trump against him.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Supporters of Colombian President Gustavo Petro attend a rally he called to protest comments by U.S. President Donald Trump, in Bogota, Colombia, Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2026.\n                \n                    Santiago Saldarriaga/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Santiago Saldarriaga/AP\n    \n\n   \n   \"Those (people) are responsible for this crisis — let's call it diplomatic for now, verbal for now — that has erupted between the U.S. and Colombia,\" he said.   Trump now suddenly warming to Petro is especially surprising since Colombia's president called the U.S. operation in Venezuela an \"abhorrent\" violation of Latin American sovereignty. He also suggested it was committed by \"enslavers\" and constituted a \"spectacle of death\" comparable to Nazi Germany's 1937 carpet bombing of Guernica, Spain.   \n   Colombia has long been among America's staunchest Latin American allies, a pillar of Washington's counternarcotics strategy abroad. For three decades, the U.S. has worked closely with Colombia, the world's largest producer of cocaine, to arrest drug traffickers, fend off rebel groups and boost economic development in rural areas.   Still, before Trump's conciliatory post, tensions had been rising between the U.S. and Colombia for months.   The Trump administration imposed sanctions in October on Petro, his family and a member of his government over accusations of involvement in the global drug trade. Colombia is considered the epicenter of the world's cocaine trade.   Trump began his monthslong pressure campaign on Maduro by ordering dozens of lethal strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats launched from Venezuela in the Caribbean. He eventually expanded the operations to also target suspected vessels in the eastern Pacific that came from Colombia.   The U.S. in September added Colombia, the top recipient of American assistance in the region, to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years. The designation led to a slashing of U.S. assistance to the country.   \"He has cocaine mills and cocaine factories,\" Trump said of Petro on Sunday. \"He's not going to be doing it.\"\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Scott Detrow speaks with Council on Foreign Relations President Michael Froman about the U.S. attack on Venezuela, the \"Don-roe\" doctrine and Stephen Miller's statements about Greenland.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  Make America great again. That phrase has been in our political ecosystem for 10 years now. But it's never been entirely clear what time period in American history President Trump is referencing. Is it the 1980s, maybe the 1950s? What about further back, say, the 1890s? As we enter the second year of Trump's second term, his major policy decisions and tactics increasingly rival the imperial Gilded Age presidencies of the late 1800s.There's Trump's tariff policies, which echo the Tariff act of 1890. In the late 19th century, many government personnel decisions were made, with no apologies, with two goals in mind - boosting the backers of the party in power and rewarding people and companies who made financial contributions to that ruling party. Back then, it was the railroad industry. Now AI is the billion-dollar industry. And its leaders are courting favors with the Trump White House.Then there's foreign policy. From 1867 to 1899, the United States acquired several territories including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Now, in 2026, President Trump has declared the U.S. will, quote, \"run\" Venezuela after the seizure and ouster of President Nicolás Maduro. And he and top aides like Stephen Miller are talking about other international moves, too, using blunt language about U.S. military force and U.S. raw strategic interests that, by and large, went away in the 20th century. Here's Miller on CNN.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STEPHEN MILLER: We live in a world in which you can talk all you want about international niceties and everything else. But we live in a world - in the real world, Jake - that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power.DETROW: So how is the second Trump administration changing the world order? That's something we are going to discuss with Michael Froman. He is the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and served as President Obama's trade representative. Thanks for talking to us.MICHAEL FROMAN: Thanks for having me.DETROW: I want to start with the U.S. military going into Venezuela and seizing its president. What was your response? What did you think about?FROMAN: Well, first, I don't think that there's any great tears to be shed over Maduro, who was a ruthless leader and alleged to be quite corrupt and criminal in his activity. You know, however, going in and decapitating a government certainly seemed at odds with the president's initial views on regime change and getting involved in the internal affairs of other countries. We now have a situation where we've sort of done regime change without, at least so far, changing the regime, in that we've got the rest of the Maduro government - including the defense minister, the interior minister, the vice president, who's now acting president - very much maintaining control.You know, I think from an international perspective, as you said, this hearkens back to a period of time when the U.S. would just declare that it was going to use force or other means to expand or to secure access to resources. I think one of the big questions is, how do other countries interpret this?DETROW: You've talked about a phrase we've heard a lot, the rules-based international order. This is something the Biden administration was very focused on. This is something American allies in Europe talk a lot about, the idea that there is a set rules and standards and countries have to follow them. And the argument you hear from Stephen Miller and others in the Trump White House is that's bogus, that that's a veneer. That's never been true. And foreign policy is about strength and it's about power and it's about the U.S. seizing what it wants. What happens to the world if that's U.S. foreign policy going forward?FROMAN: So, I mean, certainly, power has always been an element of international relations. But post-Second World War, the U.S. decided that it could exert global leadership and it could exert its power most effectively by getting other countries to buy into a set of rules that, more or less, we designed and that served our interests very well for a long period of time. Now, sometimes that involved us constraining our own capacity to act unilaterally, but it certainly prevented other countries from doing that. Or it tried to prevent that.  And no rules-based system is perfect. You know, in the international legal system, I think if most countries follow most of the rules most of the time, it has been deemed a success.DETROW: But does Miller have a point, though, that might've been right all along? Like, the U.S. and its allies have not seen it in their interest to go to war with Russia in Ukraine directly. No one stopped the United States from seizing Maduro. And now Miller is saying, who's going to stop America if it seizes Greenland?FROMAN: So I think Stephen Miller is right that power matters and how you exercise power matters. I think the question is, we have been successful for 80 years in using our power and U.S. leadership to shape a system that all of the other countries bought into, more or less, and that one kept the peace broadly in the world. What this administration has done is said, look, we're going to put that to the side. And we're going to go back in many respects to, as you suggested, an earlier period where what mattered was your hard power and how you exercised it, and whether any other country could stand up to you in doing so.And we do have the largest military in the world. And we do spend more on our military than the next several countries combined. We have real challenges out there, including China, that is engaged in a major military modernization plan and a major military modernization buildout. But we are still the dominant military power in the world. And the question is, how do we use that military power?DETROW: I mean, you're speaking about this very rationally and strategically. But don't we have a lot of evidence at this point that a lot of the decision-making is just, I would like to add to the United States, I would like to leave my mark in one way or another, with the Trump White House and President Trump specifically? Like, it seems like he's talked out loud about that being kind of what - part of the reasons he's taking these actions.FROMAN: Well, look, a little bit like the comment about running Venezuela but basically doing it - or leaving the current government in place and really focusing on a few issues that the U.S. cares a lot about, like oil, and not so much on democracy or on economic reform in Venezuela, etc. I think one could take that same approach to Greenland. I think there are really serious issues of Arctic security. And we ought to be more engaged in the Arctic Circle, particularly with climate change. As the polar ice caps are melting, that becomes a much more viable trade route.And so, you know, we should be more engaged up there for our own national security, and the Danes and the Greenlanders are very happy to cooperate with us. And there's even a framework. There's even agreement between us as to how we would - how we could further build out our cooperation in that area. But I think the president is right. We probably do need to engage much more actively with Greenland and Denmark and ensure that we've got the capacity on Greenland to address our Arctic security needs.DETROW: Has any of this surprised you, based on what President Trump and his top advisers talked about heading into their second term?FROMAN: Yes. I'd say there was a lot of expectation coming into the second term that the president was going to be an isolationist. And he is clearly not an isolationist. He has been deeply engaged internationally from Day 1. And what we've seen is - whether it's regime change in Venezuela or the state building that is slated to go on in Gaza around the ceasefire plan that the president negotiated - that this very much involves active U.S. participation and active personal participation by the president.DETROW: That's Michael Froman, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations. Thank you so much for talking to us.FROMAN: Thanks for having me.(SOUNDBITE OF HARRY GREGSON-WILLIAMS AND RUPERT GREGSON-WILLIAMS' \"THE GILDED AGE (MAIN TITLE THEME)\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the longest-serving Democrat in Congress and once a rival to become House speaker, will announce Thursday he is set to retire at the end of his term.   Hoyer, who served for years in party leadership and helped steer Democrats through some of their most significant legislative victories, is set to deliver a House floor speech about his decision, according to a person familiar with the situation and granted anonymity to discuss it.   \"Tune in,\" Hoyer said on social media. He confirmed his retirement plans in an interview with The Washington Post.   \n   At 86, Hoyer is the latest in a generation of senior-most leaders stepping aside, making way for a new era of lawmakers eager to take on governing. Retirements have been high in the political parties, Democrats and Republicans, ahead of the midterm elections in November that will determine control of Congress.   \n   First arriving in the House in 1981 after a special election, Hoyer's reach extended beyond his Chesapeake Bay-area district, and he quickly climbed the leadership ranks to become the No. 2 Democrat. He served as majority leader after Democrats swept to power after the 2006 election, and again in 2019 after they regained control during President Donald Trump's first term.   Through those years Hoyer worked as a partner and sometimes rival to Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, part of a trio of top Democrats alongside Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina.   That was the era when Democrats, with President Barack Obama, ushered the Affordable Care Act and other signature legislation to law.   During the Trump era, as Democrats worked to win back House control, Hoyer campaigned to court blue-collar voters outside of party strongholds and positioned himself as a potential alternative to Pelosi. For years, Hoyer championed what he called his \"Make it in America\" agenda to boost industry, production and jobs.   \n   But the leaders have often moved in tandem, and when Pelosi announced last fall she would end her own storied career after this term, Hoyer's next step was widely watched.\n",

Her comments come amid growing alarm among administration critics about the muscularity of U.S. foreign policy following the military operation in Venezuela on Saturday that led to the arrest of the nation's president, Nicolas Maduro.   \n   Trump has repeatedly voiced support for the U.S. acquiring Greenland, dating back to his first term in 2019. Trump has said Greenland is vitally important to U.S. priorities in the Arctic, and expressed interest in the territory's large amounts of rare earth minerals.   \"Right now, Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,\" Trump told reporters over the weekend. \"We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.\"   The president's continued focus on Greenland is posing a test for trans-Atlantic relations.   In a joint statement released Tuesday, the leaders of seven European nations defended Greenland's sovereignty, saying it \"belongs to its people.\"   \"It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland,\" read the statement from the leaders of Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the U.K.   Several European leaders, including Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, have fervently pushed back on Trump's comments, saying that an attack on Greenland by the U.S. military would jeopardize the NATO military alliance.   Trump addressed NATO tensions in a post on Truth Social on Wednesday morning, saying the U.S. \"will always be there for NATO, even if they won't be there for us.\"   \n   Leavitt told reporters on Wednesday that previous presidential administrations have also entertained making a play for Greenland, but when pressed on why the White House wouldn't rule out using military force to take over the country, she pushed back.   \"I know that past presidents and past leaders have often ruled things out. They've often been very open about ruling things in and basically broadcasting their foreign policy strategy to the rest of the world, not just to our allies, but most egregiously, to our adversaries. That's not something this president does,\" she said.   Speaking from Capitol Hill, Secretary of State Marco Rubio echoed Leavitt, telling reporters that Trump's interest in Greenland has gone unchanged since his first administration. Rubio said military intervention was not a preference for the administration, but he did not rule it out.   \"Every president retains the option,\" Rubio said. \"I'm not talking about Greenland. I'm just talking about globally.\"   Among Republican leaders in Congress, discussion about military intervention in Greenland has been met with skepticism. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters Wednesday that while the U.S. may see \"geopolitical and strategic importance\" in Greenland, \"we're not at war with Greenland. We have no intention — we have no reason to be at war with Greenland.\"   \"There's a lot of thoughtful discussion to be had there, and that's what we expect is going to happen,\" he added. \"So all this stuff about military action and all that, I don't, I don't think it's, I don't even think that's a possibility. I don't think anybody's seriously considering that. And in the Congress, we're certainly not.\"   Democrats have broadly panned the notion of a military intervention against the island and its roughly 57,000 inhabitants. On Tuesday, Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., said he intends to introduce a resolution to block Trump from \"invading Greenland.\"    \n   \"We must stop him before he invades another country on a whim,\" Gallego wrote on social media. \n",

The pair detailed a process of \"stabilization,\" \"recovery\" and \"transition.\"   Rubio told reporters step one will involve \"quarantine\" for Venezuela, a process that will include selling sanctioned oil and distributing the profits.   \n   \"We don't want it descending into chaos,\" Rubio said. \"Part of that stabilization and the reason why we understand and believe that we have the strongest leverage possible is our quarantine.\"   Rubio went on to explain that the continued seizure of oil tankers is part of the plan, in addition to the process of selling sanctioned oil.   U.S. forces seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker, originally bound for Venezuela, in the North Atlantic Wednesday.    \"We are going to take between 30 and 50 million barrels of oil,\" Rubio said. \"We're going to sell it in the marketplace, at market rates, not at the discounts Venezuela was getting. That money will then be handled in such a way that we will control how it is dispersed in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people, not corruption, not the regime.\"   \n   Rubio said step two will focus on \"recovery,\" where access to the Venezuelan market will be restored in a way that is \"fair.\"   He said at the same time, they will \"begin to create the process of reconciliation nationally within Venezuela, so that the opposition forces can be amnestied and released and from prisons or brought back to the country, and begin to rebuild civil society.\"   Rubio did not offer details of how step three — \"transition\" — will work. He said some phases would overlap.   Reaction from lawmakers    Lawmakers were clamoring for a briefing from the administration, which did not notify Congress until after the operation concluded.    Top lawmakers received a classified briefing on Monday, but Wednesday's all-member briefing was the first time rank-and-file members received a detailed brief from top administration officials.    \"We had, I believe, a full house,\" said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. \"General Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, gave a very precise, detailed narrative about the operation and what happened.\"    Johnson said the administration's objective is not to have U.S. boots on the ground.    \"That is not their expectation,\" he said.   The partisan divide was on full display as lawmakers left the briefing, with Republican lawmakers praising the operation while Democrats criticized the administration for not being forthright.    \n   \"We have clarity on the mission and what's to come next,\" said Rep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla. \"This administration has put people in place who have clear vision and a spine in which to execute.\"   Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., told reporters the briefing showed the military \"clearly had a plan\" but that he thinks the administration is \"completely winging it\" on next steps.   \"I did not get a sense that they have any legitimate plan for what comes next,\" he said. \"And although we obviously can't talk about their answers to questions in a classified briefing, there are a lot of questions from both Democrats and Republicans about what comes next, what the timeline is — and they basically refused to answer any of those questions.\"   Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., agreed the briefing included details on the military operation itself but was dissatisfied with the discussion about the path forward.    \"In terms of what comes next, it does not seem that this administration seems to be forthright, transparent or frankly have communicated the thought necessary,\" she said.   Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he wants the administration to answer questions in public hearings. He's repeatedly cited concern about the administration taking similar actions in other countries and said he's dissatisfied with the answers given to him by administration officials.    \"They're avoiding all public discussion,\" he said. \"We need answers to these questions and we need them made publicly.\" \n",

The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit record highs on Monday and Tuesday, lifted in part by some Venezuela-related stocks.\n                \n                    TIMOTHY A.

CLARY/AFP via Getty Images/AFP\n    \n\n   \n   Wall Street traditionally detests \"uncertainty.\" But in the first days after the United States removed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro from power, U.S. investors are shrugging off the geopolitical instability — and mostly focusing on the positive.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit record highs on Monday and Tuesday, lifted in part by some Venezuela-related stocks. The S&P 500 also closed at a record high on Tuesday. Meanwhile, investors who own Venezuelan bonds — including some large U.S. financial institutions — also saw those struggling assets surge in value.   \"We're in a different ballpark now,\" says Eric Fine, who invests in bonds as emerging-markets portfolio manager at VanEck Funds, and whose investment firm bought Venezuelan sovereign debt a few weeks ago.   \n   U.S. oil companies were the immediate, and stated, beneficiary of the country's attack on Venezuela: President Trump said during a weekend press conference that U.S. oil companies would now be able to invest in Venezuela, to \"fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country.\"   Big Oil stocks have swung up and down since. Shares in Chevron, the last major U.S. oil company remaining in Venezuela, soared on Monday before retreating on Tuesday. Other oil companies and oil field-services providers — including Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips, and Halliburton — followed the same trajectory.   Another potential Wall Street beneficiary: Elliott Investment Management, a hedge fund founded by billionaire and influential Republican donor Paul Singer. A U.S. judge in November approved Elliott's $6 billion bid to take over Citgo Petroleum, a subsidiary of Venezuela's state oil company. Maduro's government had denounced and appealed the sale, which has yet to be approved by the U.S. Treasury Department.   But the potential Wall Street winners from the United States' dramatic intervention in Venezuela go far beyond oil. Here are some other U.S. investor groups that are benefitting:   Venezuela's long-suffering bondholders   For years, Venezuela's debt seemed like a dud investment. In 2017, Venezuela missed payments on bonds issued by the government and its state-owned oil company — leaving foreign investors, including U.S. financial institutions, holding tens of billions of dollars of its debt.   \n   Now many of those investors are hoping that the United States's removal of Maduro — and its intention to take over Venezuelan oil — will boost the country's economy, and ultimately its ability to repay its creditors.   \"There are much, much greater upsides in the bond market than what investors went to sleep thinking they were on Friday,\" says VanEck's Fine.   His fund manager bought Venezuelan government bonds \"in the last few weeks,\" betting that the Trump Administration's increasingly aggressive rhetoric around Venezuela would eventually lead to some kind of action. Now Fine is hopeful that the interim presidency of former Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez will eventually lead to elections and a future Venezuelan government that is \"arguably more market-friendly.\"   For a long time, \"we really didn't see much [that was] interesting in Venezuela. It is highly indebted, and there was no prospect of regime change,\" Fine says.   But now, from a purely financial point of view, \"I think it's a great opportunity,\" he adds.   U.S. weapons makers are on the up and up   The surprise U.S. seizure of a foreign leader on his home soil did increase geopolitical instability, which sometimes can rattle Wall Street. But this week, it benefitted some equity investors — especially in weapons manufacturers and other defense contractors.   Shares in Lockheed Martin, Boeing, RTX Corp., and General Dynamics are all up this week, with the latter hitting an all-time high.   Precious metals are soaring    At the same time that stocks hit record highs, so did some of the precious metals that investors traditionally use as a hedge against uncertainty and risk. Gold prices rose early this week, while silver prices reached a new record high.   So did the price of copper — which may not be needed for pennies anymore, but which is in high demand for data centers, electric vehicles, and a host of other manufacturing purposes.   \n   Copper is also sometimes seen as an indicator of the nation's shift towards renewable energy — providing a greener contrast to Wall Street's excitement this week over Venezuelan oil.\n",

    "body": "\n      President Trump has shared mixed messages about the future of Venezuela after capturing the country's president. A look at his evolving plans for Venezuela.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  President Trump continues to suggest a lengthy and active U.S. role in Venezuela after capturing leader Nicolás Maduro. Well, he said the U.S. will run Venezuela for a period.MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Trump has proposed several plans for the future of Venezuela's government and economy, with U.S. companies playing a key role. And now, apparently, Venezuela is handing over oil to the U.S. In a few minutes, we'll talk about all this with former diplomat Tom Shannon. But first, let's get the latest information.FADEL: NPR's Franco Ordoñez joins us now to talk about all of this. Hey, Franco.FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, HOST:  Hey, Leila.FADEL: OK. So many questions about what's next for Venezuela, and it feels like everything is kind of happening ad hoc. Does the president have a plan?ORDOÑEZ: I mean, there really are so many questions. The truth is, President Trump and his aides are not really clear about the future of Venezuela. As we've reported, you know, they did not get behind the popular opposition leader, María Corina Machado, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, saying she didn't have enough support from the people. And while there have been a lot of calls for new elections in an interview about Venezuela's future, Trump told NBC News it's going to take a, quote, \"period of time,\" and the U.S. first needs to, quote, \"nurse the country back to health\" again.FADEL: OK. So who is running the country then? Who's going to run the country?ORDOÑEZ: Well, for now, Trump is backing Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodríguez. And there are also a number of other ministers from the Maduro regime, who are still in charge, including his interior minister and his defense minister. I was actually talking with Ambassador John Bolton, who served as national security adviser in the first Trump administration, and he told me that he doesn't see those officials just rolling over for Trump.JOHN BOLTON: I don't think that's what they think they're doing. I think they think they are still the Maduro regime, just without Maduro. And I think it's going to be very hard, much harder than Trump understands, to get them to do what he wants them to do.ORDOÑEZ: And, Leila, it sure looks like the regime is fighting all it can to hold on, cracking down on dissent in Venezuela, arresting journalists and others. And I should probably also note that Bolton has become a fierce Trump critic after he was fired from the administration. And more recently, Trump's Department of Justice is prosecuting Bolton for allegedly mishandling classified info.FADEL: Right. And there are a lot of questions about what Trump means when he says the U.S. will run Venezuela, right?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah, absolutely. Right now, and - you know, while Trump's secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has been having conversations with Rodríguez, a lot of eyes are also actually on Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller, who's also among the group of U.S. officials overseeing Venezuela. Now, of course, Rubio - he's a Cuban American from Miami, certainly well steeped in these issues, having worked on them for decades. Miller is better known for his immigration policies, and more recently, actually, depicting U.S. ruling over the hemisphere by force.FADEL: And President Trump has made it clear that a lot of this is about Venezuela's oil, and he made a pretty stunning announcement last night on Truth Social. What did he say?ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. I mean, last night, Trump announced on social media that Venezuela will turn over 30 to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S., and then the U.S. will sell it at market price with proceeds overseen by him.FADEL: Is this all aboveboard? I mean, is this legal?ORDOÑEZ: I mean, I think the circumstances of which Venezuela is giving this oil are also very unclear. I mean, Trump is saying that U.S. may also subsidize the oil companies to help revive Venezuela's oil industry, which really indicates a much longer-term project for the U.S. Trump has said it could take less than 18 months to rebuild the Venezuelan infrastructure, but experts say it'll take much longer, multiple years to fix the decaying system.FADEL: OK. So many questions ahead. I'm sure we'll be talking again very soon. Thank you, Franco.ORDOÑEZ: Thank you.FADEL: That's White House correspondent Franco Ordoñez.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.

    "body": "\n      In a meeting with House Republicans Tuesday, President Trump tried to offer his party a \"roadmap\" to maintain their congressional majorities in the midterms.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  There is something that Donald Trump can't quite wrap his head around.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But I wish you could explain to me what the hell's going on with the mind of the public because we have the right policy.MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  That was the president speaking to House Republicans on Tuesday about the possibility of losing the House in this year's midterm elections. He was trying to offer his party a road map to win, as he called it.FADEL: So was he successful? NPR senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro watched the speech, and he joins me now. Domenico, good morning.DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning.FADEL: So what are the headwinds Republicans are facing at the start of this year?MONTANARO: Yeah. I mean, never mind the headline-changing action in Venezuela. You know, right at the beginning of his speech yesterday, Trump acknowledged the vulnerable position that he and his party are in simply because of history.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: We won everything. But they say that when you win the presidency, you lose the midterm.MONTANARO: And it's true that midterms are hard on a president's party. You know, on average, they lose more than two dozen seats, and it's worse when a president's approval rating is below 50%.FADEL: Right. And we know Trump's approval rating - certainly, it's been below 50% for a while.MONTANARO: Yeah. And he's facing his lowest approval ratings of his second term, and it's been in large measure because of the cost of living.FADEL: Yeah.MONTANARO: But Trump didn't offer much yesterday in his speech on that. In fact, it took him 48 minutes before he even started talking about the economy at all. And when he did, it was about the stock market being at historic highs, and he touted his tariffs, which have actively raised prices on many things. And people have been telling pollsters for months that they feel Trump's policies have made the economy worse.FADEL: So if he didn't talk about strategy on prices, what did he talk about?MONTANARO: I mean, it's culture issues mostly. That's, you know, hardly unusual for Trump. He's always - seems to be weaving back to that, as he calls it. He said being against transgender athletes in sports is such a winning issue that he'd save it for the week before the election. He did an imitation of a woman lifting weights, one he said that his own wife doesn't like. She says it's not presidential, but he went on to do it anyway. He talked about pushing for voter ID laws, immigration and crime, which in his mind are all related, he said, and his attempts at lowering drug prices on weight loss drugs, which he referred to as fat drugs. And he complained a lot about how he doesn't get the credit he feels he deserves. And he lamented at one point, what have you done for me lately? - is the way you have to run your life nowadays.FADEL: Now, Trump was speaking on the same day that Republican Congressman Doug LaMalfa of California died. He was 65. Republicans already had a historically small majority. Will it be even harder now for Republicans to pass legislation?MONTANARO: Well, it would if there was a clear legislative agenda from Republicans in Congress, but there really isn't one right now. And a lot of those culture issues are things that Trump has gone around Congress on using executive powers. Now, one area where they could do something would be on health care. Here's what Trump said about that.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: You can own health care. Let - figure it out. Let the money go directly to the people.FADEL: OK. Own health care. How feasible is that?MONTANARO: Well, Republicans, as we know, have had a long time to, quote, \"figure it out\" - more than a decade - and they haven't been able to, and they've been against extending Affordable Care Act subsidies. But it's one thing to campaign on a slogan like, let the money go to the people. It's very different to be president and to try to legislate on it. So if you're a Republican in a swing district, when the ACA is about as popular as it's ever been, you got to be scratching your head wondering, what is the strategy?FADEL: NPR's Domenico Montanaro. Thank you, Domenico.MONTANARO: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Michel Martin speaks to former diplomat Tom Shannon about what the Trump administration is planning next for Venezuela.   \n\n    MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  We're going to talk about - more about all of these issues with Ambassador Tom Shannon because he served as a diplomat in Venezuela. He was later ambassador to Brazil. He was also undersecretary of state for political affairs under President Obama and during President Trump's first term. Now he is a senior international policy adviser at the law firm Arnold & Porter, and he was nice enough to come by our studios this morning. Good morning, Ambassador. Thanks for joining us.TOM SHANNON: Hi. Good morning. Delighted to be here.MARTIN: So let me just briefly start with the president's claims to Venezuelan oil. How might exactly the country turn over tens of millions of barrels of oil to the U.S. to then be sold at market price, as the president said is going to happen?SHANNON: It's not clear at this point. He did say that secretary of energy would handle this. The U.S. does purchase oil for our strategic oil reserves, but typically, the United States is not in the business of buying oil, refining it or selling it on a market. So it's not clear if he's going to use private brokers, private refineries, private companies or how this is going to be done, but I'm sure the details are going to emerge in the near term.MARTIN: So let me just talk about some of the things that Franco brought up, which is, first of all, much of the Maduro regime remains in place. As a diplomat, you worked with Maduro. You met the new interim leader, Delcy Rodriguez. First of all, what do you understand the president to mean when he talks about running Venezuela? And how is Delcy Rodriguez likely to react to what the president is saying about what he expects from her?SHANNON: When the president says we're running Venezuela, I don't believe he means we're governing it. I actually think the president wants to avoid the mistakes we made in Iraq and Afghanistan when we took over a country entirely and were responsible for all aspects of the administration of the state.What I think he's trying to say is that we're going to set a direction for it, that we're going to put it on an economic recovery path and that we're going to open up its oil and gas reserves to the world in a way that is consonant with U.S. interests. The challenge that he's going to face, however, is that by removing President Maduro, he did not effect regime change. He effected a leadership change. The Chavista state is still in place, and this is the group that he has chosen to work with.MARTIN: So do we have a sense of what the administration's goals for Venezuela actually are? I mean, is it to restore democracy, or is it to ensure a compliant regime? Because aren't - those aren't the same things. Is it to restore a decent standard of living? - which is one way to curtail this - these immigration flows because that's why so many people are fleeing the country. Or is it to control the oil resources to benefit the U.S. and to end drug trafficking? - as he claims that they are sort of a pivotal part of that. Do we have a sense of what his real priorities are?SHANNON: They're not entirely clear yet, but I think in the short term, he needs a compliant regime. And I think in the long term, he does have in mind some kind of political transition. To what is not clear. How is not clear. And it's not at all clear whether this compliant regime will comply. And this is the challenge that he is going to face because the leadership that has been left behind in Caracas is thoroughly Chavista, thoroughly committed to the vision of Hugo Chavez and Nicolas Maduro.And they believe themselves not only to be radical revolutionaries, but also the last of the South American anti-imperialists. And I have trouble imagining them, whatever concessions they make in the short term, to survive. I have trouble imagining them being our tool in reshaping Venezuela.MARTIN: Do you have a - any sense of why the president is so reluctant to embrace the opposition? There were elections. There is a sense that - this is one of the points that Venezuelans that we've spoken to in recent days have impressed upon us, that unlike Iraq, there were elections. There is an opposition, which is functional, which does seem to have legitimacy. The president seems to be very unwilling to embrace them in any way. Do you have any sense of why that is?SHANNON: I believe that he - I think he understands the importance of the Democratic opposition. I think he understands that Maria Corina Machado and the candidate who supposedly won the 2024 elections, Edmundo Gonzalez, did indeed overwhelmingly win that election and that they do have broad public support.But I think what the president realizes is that, as I noted earlier, the state - in other words, the security forces, the armed forces, the structures of state, the judiciary and beyond - are all Chavista. And I think he's reluctant to try to impose a democratic opposition on a state that has not been deconstructed. But the question is, how do you deconstruct it? And in the process, how do you show a degree of respect for the Venezuelan people? Because at the end of the day, the Venezuelan people are that part of the equation that has been left out.MARTIN: One question I have for you based on your long career at the State Department is given all of the draconian sort of cuts to the State Department and agencies like USAID and to organizations like the National Democratic Institute under this administration, are the resources there, the infrastructure in the United States there, to effectuate and support the kind of transition that the president seems to envision? Because those are the agencies and the people who would carry that out. I mean, when you talk about just providing sort of food assistance and things of that sort, I mean, those are the agencies that would carry that out. So does the infrastructure still exist in this country to support the kind of changes that the president is calling for?SHANNON: The short answer is no. The reality is is that by removing USAID, the United States no longer has neither the personnel nor the structures and systems, nor the capacity to deliver large amounts of development aid and assistance to other countries. And on top of that, we have no embassy in Caracas. We haven't had an embassy since 2019. And we've cut anywhere from a quarter to a third of our professional diplomatic staff around the world. And so we don't have people who could be surged into Venezuela to play a role, and we don't have the means to protect them, even if we could, on the ground.And so in order for the United States to play a role inside of Venezuela, we would have to reopen our embassy, put hundreds, if not thousands, of people on the ground and dedicate resources in a way that we just can't do right now.MARTIN: A lot to talk about here. Just to sort of clarify for folks who may not follow these issues as closely as you have done, you're saying - by Chavista, you mean followers of...SHANNON: Correct.MARTIN: ...Hugo Chavez...SHANNON: Yes, indeed.MARTIN: ...Who was the predecessor to Nicolas Maduro.SHANNON: Exactly.MARTIN: That is Ambassador Tom Shannon, former undersecretary of state for political affairs. He's currently with Arnold & Porter, an international senior adviser there. Thank you so much for coming by and sharing these insights with us.SHANNON: Thank you. A pleasure.MARTIN: I do hope we'll talk again.SHANNON: OK.(SOUNDBITE OF DIRTWIRE'S \"SAILING THE SOLAR FLARES\")\n    Copyright © 2026 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Pro-Trump influencer and YouTuber Benny Johnson being interviewed in Phoenix earlier this year. Johnson is one of many political influencers with close ties to the Trump administration.\n                \n                    Charly Triballeau/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Charly Triballeau/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Less than two weeks since YouTube personality Nick Shirley posted a 42-minute video alleging widespread fraud at Minnesota day care centers run by people of Somali descent, the Trump administration is freezing streams of federal funding — including $10 billion to five Democratic-led states — and has sent 2,000 federal agents to Minnesota to wage an immigration crackdown.   \n   Furthermore, Minnesota's Democratic governor and former vice presidential candidate, Tim Walz, announced Monday he will no longer seek a third term, citing the need to focus on running the state rather than his campaign.   Pro-MAGA influencers on X declared victory as they also shared new, unsubstantiated fraud allegations about other social service providers in both Minnesota and other states.   \n   \"Tim Walz was almost Vice President of the United States,\" wrote Rogan O'Handley, a pro-Trump commentator with more than 2 million followers on X. \"Now he's dropping out of the Governor's race in Minnesota in disgrace. All because a 23-year-old kid with a camera and a thirst for justice exposed billions of his fraud. May @nickshirleyy's work create 1,000 more Nick Shirleys.\"   Shirley himself posted to X on Monday, \"I ENDED TIM WALZ.\"   Shirley's video was amplified by Vice President Vance and has garnered more than 138 million views on X — though his claims about specific day cares and other businesses receiving public funds without providing services remain unsubstantiated. But the swift policy and political repercussions the video helped propel illustrate the symbiotic relationship between online content creators and the Trump administration's policy goals.   Online content that purports to show evidence of a problem, like fraud in a Democratic state, can be harnessed by policymakers to justify policy changes they wanted to pursue, said Kate Starbird, a professor at the University of Washington who studies the spread of online rumors during crises and breaking news events. She said a similar dynamic has played out in the past with content alleging wasteful USAID spending, or posts claiming that diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives are to blame for accidents.   \n   \"They become really effective for driving policy that aligns with where those policy makers want it to go,\" Starbird said. \"Whether that's de-fund social programs in blue states or eliminate DEI initiatives throughout all of the universities, these kinds of dynamics have been very effective for the second Trump administration.\"   One factor is that Trump's Cabinet is made up of people who understand the power of online content because that is the world they came from, said Shannon McGregor, a professor at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who studies the role of social media in politics.   \n   \"There's both people who are and were influencers with cabinet-level positions and other staff positions,\" McGregor said. \"This is sort of all about harnessing the attention economy where attention equals power.\"   McGregor said another time this dynamic has been on display is when Trump-aligned content creators in cities like Portland have made videos presenting anti-ICE protests as violent and disruptive that helped bolster the Trump administration's justification to crack down, including by sending in the National Guard. The White House has given some of these creators special access and invited several, including Shirley, to participate in a roundtable to discuss antifa in October.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Political influencer Nick Shirley speaks at an event at the White House on Oct. 8, 2025. Shirley's viral video alleging fraud at Minnesota day care centers that receive federal funding prompted the Trump administration to halt funding several Democratic-led states.\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Some child care employees featured in Shirley's video have received threatening phone calls or been the targets of vandalism. While Shirley's video appeared to show there were no children present at the day cares he visited, Minnesota state officials from the Department of Children, Youth and Families said they visited nine of the day cares featured in the video and found children at all of them except one, which was not yet open for families. The agency also told media outlets one day care featured in the video had been closed since 2022.   \n   At the same time, other fraud schemes in state social service programs have been well documented. At least 78 people have been criminally charged related to a $250 million scheme involving a COVID-era nutrition program. The majority are from the Somali community, which has a significant presence in the state and is often a target of Trump's ire.   These legitimate fraud cases make it difficult to interpret new unverified claims that have been made by social media influencers. Allegations that are now spreading online could be misinterpreting records or exaggerating minor issues — or could be exposing actual fraudulent activity.   \"It's so hard to fact check the claims that come out in these ways,\" said Starbird. \"And by the time they get fact-checked, the impact of those claims has already happened — people have already made up their minds of what they believe.\"   Content creators have posted videos of themselves in recent days knocking on the doors of what appear to be day cares and home health care businesses in other states, including in Ohio's Somali community. A parody video that purported to show a vacant day care in Los Angeles that received $42 million was also shared online in recent days by some users who did not appear to realize it was satire.   In an appearance on Fox News on Monday night White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt mentioned \"great independent journalists like Nick Shirley\" for helping the Trump administration uncover fraud, before describing the federal response in Minnesota and Trump's belief that Walz is \"criminally liable.\"   The Trump administration indicated this week it is freezing $10 billion in funds for child care centers and cash welfare payments for Minnesota, California, Colorado, Illinois and New York due to fraud suspicions. The freeze followed other announced changes to federal funding for child care centers nationwide.   \"California, under Governor Gavin Newscum, is more corrupt than Minnesota, if that's possible???? The Fraud Investigation of California has begun,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social early Tuesday but did not provide more details.   \n   Just 23 minutes later, pro-Trump podcaster Benny Johnson posted to his 4 million followers on X that he would be heading to California next week to investigate fraud and asked for tips. By Tuesday evening he claimed he had received \"over 1,000 messages from whistleblowers, public officials and State employees exposing California waste, fraud and abuse\" and alleged $250 billion in potential fraud.   \"The pipeline from rumor to policy is now shorter than the time it takes to verify a claim,\" wrote Renée DiResta, a Georgetown University professor who studies how information travels online, in her newsletter. \"That's a remarkable — and dangerous — shift. People have always believed rumors, but now government elites ride them when they provide justification for what they wanted to do anyway.\"\n",

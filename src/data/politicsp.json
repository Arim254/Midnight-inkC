    "body": "\n       Loading... \n   California voters this week made the biggest Democratic move yet against President Trump's effort to reshape voting maps in favor of Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections.   They overwhelmingly approved a map for congressional districts that could help Democrats win five more seats in the U.S. House. The ballot language itself referred to Texas, where Trump convinced Republican leaders to draw new lines this summer aimed at turning five seats for his party.   States usually redistrict at the start of the decade following the decennial census. But Trump has set off a redistricting race across the country, saying that keeping the Republican advantage in the U.S. House, now just a few seats, is key to his agenda. It also would continue to protect him from investigations by a Democratic-led House.   \n   So far, the GOP has gained an edge in five seats in Texas, one in Missouri, one in North Carolina and a potential net gain of one to two in Ohio.   That means the GOP could pick up nine or so seats in the midterms next year, with the potential to pick up another four or five if Republicans in Indiana, Kansas, Florida or Louisiana decide to redistrict. But that scenario could change if court challenges prevail, among other factors.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks during a campaign event to urge Californians to back redistricting in Proposition 50, Saturday in Los Angeles.\n                \n                    Ethan Swope/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Ethan Swope/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Meanwhile, Democrats tilted five seats their way in California. And, a sixth in Utah seems likely to move toward Democrats. In Virginia, Democrats have started a process that could result in two or three seats. Maryland and Illinois might add one seat each — but Democrats haven't decided to go for them yet.   Overall, Democrats have fewer options than Republicans.   How does redistricting work again?   There are 435 members of the U.S. House representing about 760,000 people each. Every 10 years, as populations change, the national census shows how many seats each state gets and the states draw new district maps.   However people vote, the way their votes are divided up into districts can determine how many seats are won by Republican or Democratic candidates.   \n   Gerrymandering is when the party in power draws the lines to favor a party or group. Gerrymandering for political advantage is legal in many states. But as a result, voters can see their votes weakened and their districts become less competitive, which can lead to a more polarized, gridlocked Congress.   It's illegal to gerrymander to dilute the voting power of a racial group. That's often done by \"cracking\" communities into different districts or \"packing\" them together into one district.   But partisan gerrymandering sometimes overlaps with racial gerrymandering.   \n   Trump has lots of places to go for Republican advantages   Trump's calls for redistricting come as his party faces a tough trend next year. In the last five midterm elections, the party that held the White House has lost seats in the U.S. House.   In the states, a party typically needs control of the legislature to redistrict for its political gain, and Republicans have that in more states than Democrats do.   Since Texas redistricted, Trump has brought Republican lawmakers from Indiana and Kansas to the White House to make the case and urged Florida to follow. Louisiana Republicans are considering their options.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A woman looks at the Trump-backed Missouri congressional map in the state House on Tuesday, Sept. 9, 2025, in Jefferson City, Mo.\n                \n                    Brian Munoz/St. Louis Public Radio\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brian Munoz/St. Louis Public Radio\n    \n\n   \n   Some Republicans have stopped short of granting Trump's wish. Ohio Republicans could force a lopsided redistricting this year, when the state's current maps expire, but so far they've struck a deal with Democrats for fairly marginal changes. Kansas Republicans say they don't have enough votes from their own party to pass redistricting in the legislature — yet.   \n   It's worth noting that lawsuits may factor in. A Texas judge is considering a case after a trial there and Republicans have sued in California. And a case before the U.S. Supreme Court could loosen laws against racial gerrymandering and end up favoring Republican redistricting.   \n   Aside from California, Democratic-led states are just starting to take steps   Democrats' options are more limited. They control fewer legislatures, and in states where they do, there tend to be more restrictions around redistricting.   Some Democratic-led states, including California, and fewer Republican ones, have commissions in various forms designed to reduce political influence on the process. That's why it took a public vote to sideline the commission and redraw lines in California.   Other Democratic states have lengthy constitutional or legal steps required to redistrict. New York can't complete the redistricting process in time for 2026. Virginia Democratic lawmakers voted to start a process aimed at flipping a couple seats, but redistricting there would still require another vote by them in January and then it would go to voters.   Illinois Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker says he hasn't ruled out redistricting but in that state Republicans already only hold three of 17 seats. Maryland could redistrict, but that state only has one Republican seat. Both states are under pressure from Democrats to do what they can.   As Republicans point out as evidence of partisan gerrymandering, some Democratic-majority states have barely any districts represented by Republicans in the first place. Massachusetts has nine Democrats in its nine seats.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Mary Louise Kelly speaks with domestic extremism correspondent Odette Yousef about Tucker Carlson's interview with white nationalist and holocaust denier Nick Fuentes and the rift it's creating.   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  It's Thursday, and that means another drop of NPR's national security podcast. On this week's Sources & Methods, how extreme views on the far right are dividing Americans. Now, that is clearly a political story, but what does it have to do with national security? I put that to NPR domestic extremism correspondent Odette Yousef.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)ODETTE YOUSEF: You know, 9/11 was a physical assault on U.S. soil by a foreign enemy, and I think that that is sort of traditionally how we've thought about the question of national security. And so now, fast-forward to January 6, when we look at what happened that day, sort of the attempt to forcefully prevent the results of a Democratic election from going forward, that was a threat from within. So national security does include sort of this concern about domestic extremism. The way that I think about it is that these strands of an authoritarian movement that we're seeing on the right really are about taking apart the very principles of inclusive democracy that distinguished America from its enemies on 9/11.KELLY: Now, Odette and I were talking about this because of a controversy that's splitting the Republican Party. Specifically, conservative talk show host Tucker Carlson's interview with Nick Fuentes. Fuentes has praised Hitler, defended Jim Crow and called for a holy war against Jews. A think tank closely aligned with the Trump administration initially defended the interview.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)KELLY: This was not a hard-hitting interview. This was a friendly chat.YOUSEF: It was. I mean, you can find many of Nick Fuentes' statements online. I mean, he's online all the time. You know, at one point in the interview he talks about his love for Stalin.KELLY: Stalin who - just for the record, the Soviet leader who killed millions of his own people. Go on.YOUSEF: That's right. So yeah, it was an odd sort of treatment of the opportunity to really query Nick Fuentes, I would say.KELLY: Although, why did this interview in particular trigger such a big fight within the GOP that we're sitting here talking about it as a national security story? Because Tucker Carlson has had - I'm trying to remember - a Holocaust conspiracist on his show before. He has promoted the racist theory, the Great Replacement conspiracy theory.YOUSEF: So the furor seems really to be centering on the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank based in Washington, D.C., that played a large role in creating Project 2025. Carlson is a close friend to the Heritage Foundation. And there were calls for the Heritage Foundation basically to chastise Tucker Carlson for having platformed Nick Fuentes.KELLY: And they did the opposite, at least initially.YOUSEF: Yes. The head of the Heritage Foundation, Kevin Roberts, declined to do that. He posted a video on X where he said they wouldn't capitulate to pressure from the, quote, \"globalist class\" to cancel people on the right. Globalists, this is a well-known dog whistle among antisemitic conspiracists. So his refusal to sort of distance the Heritage Foundation from this created this uproar on the right. And so several people working at the Heritage Foundation, particularly on their effort to fight antisemitism, left the organization. But there was also, like, a wider controversy just within the Republican Party, where current and former senators basically were like, it's time to draw the line and disavow the, quote, \"Hitler is cool\" wing within the party.KELLY: Yeah. I'll just name-drop a few of them. Senator Ted Cruz. Senator Mitch McConnell. We also heard from conservative podcaster Ben Shapiro. There are plenty of conservatives out there...YOUSEF: Senator Lindsey Graham.KELLY: Right - condemning the Fuentes appearance. But I - you know, there's a bigger context. This interview did not happen in isolation. And I'm thinking of some other racist rhetoric coming from parts of the political right just a couple of weeks ago. Politico published this - excerpts from a group chat. This was leaders of Young Republican groups.YOUSEF: Yeah, that's right. So private chats that were happening among leaders of Young Republicans in four states, where they were saying things like, I love Hitler and...KELLY: Joking about sending political opponents to the gas chamber and so on. I do need to note, NPR has not independently verified those texts. We're citing Politico reporting here. Which did not stop Vice President JD Vance from leaping into the fray. This is him talking about pearl-clutching in an episode of \"The Charlie Kirk Show.\"(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE CHARLIE KIRK SHOW\")JD VANCE: And I really don't want us to grow up in a country where a kid telling a stupid joke - telling a very offensive, stupid joke - is cause to ruin their lives.KELLY: I don't want to grow up in that kind of country either, but I will note that the people in this alleged chat were all adults, right, Odette?YOUSEF: Yeah. I mean, Young Republicans goes up to the age of 40, and some of them held elected positions. These weren't people that were still in college, necessarily.KELLY: NPR's Odette Yousef on our national security podcast Sources & Methods. You can hear it wherever you get your podcasts.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      The 85-year-old California Democrat's departure will mark the end of an era in Congress. In 2007, Pelosi became the first woman elected to serve as U.S. House speaker.   \n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  In a video released this morning, California representative Nancy Pelosi, the first woman elected speaker of the House, tells her San Francisco constituents that she will not be seeking reelection in Congress.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NANCY PELOSI: We have always led the way, and now we must continue to do so by remaining full participants in our democracy and fighting for the American ideals we hold here.MARTÍNEZ: Pelosi, a Democrat, was first elected 38 years ago and served two separate times as speaker. Senior political correspondent Scott Shafer from member station KQED in San Francisco has followed her career for decades. Scott, how did she ultimately get back on track to become speaker two decades later? I mean, you followed her from the very, very start.SCOTT SHAFER, BYLINE: Yeah. Well, I came to San Francisco a few years before she ran for Congress, and there, those vintage images in that video you just played were very poignant. They referenced the AIDS epidemic, the 1989 earthquake, ribbon-cuttings for major transit projects and more. And, you know, she recalled that the slogan for her first campaign was a voice that will be heard, which certainly turned out to be true. You know, when she got elected, Pelosi was not really well-known outside of Democratic circles. But she grew up in a political family, and later, she chaired the California Democratic Party, and then she raised money for Democratic Senate candidates nationwide. She knew a lot of important people in the party. So when she got to Washington, she could quickly cultivate relationships that really served her well later on.MARTÍNEZ: What would you say are some of her biggest accomplishments?SHAFER: Well, when she got to Washington during the Reagan administration, her district was ravaged by the AIDS epidemic. She made increasing federal funding a top priority, and that made a huge difference.Second, I'd say, the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. It really would not have passed in 2010 without Pelosi's shoulder to the wheel. She had to overcome resistance, not just from Republicans, but also from reluctant Democrats. Some of them wanted a less sweeping bill, but she made it happen.And then third, I'd say her emphasis on helping to make her party more diverse, encouraging, especially more women, women of color to get involved in politics. You know, there's nearly five times as many Democratic women in the House as when Pelosi arrived, and the number of Democratic women of color has grown more than 10 times over that span. She had a lot to do with that.MARTÍNEZ: Nancy Pelosi's known as a bit of a partisan warrior, but did she ever set that aside?SHAFER: She did. You know, in 2008, the final year of the George W. Bush administration, the economy was collapsing. She and Bush weren't particularly close, but she agreed to round up enough votes to stabilize financial institutions. Critics called it a Wall Street bailout. But, you know, that was a big example of her ability to reach across the aisle. In fact, when her official portrait was unveiled in 2022, Republican - former Republican speaker John Boehner noted that Pelosi would put nation over party and said that she was the most effective speaker of either party.MARTÍNEZ: Now, today's announcement comes just days after voters passed Proposition 50 that's going to help Democrats win more seats in the midterm elections. That's here in California where I am - where you - where both of us are, actually.SHAFER: Yeah.MARTÍNEZ: What do you make of the timing? Does one thing have to do with the other?SHAFER: Well, I talked to her on Election Day, and she said she was hoping for a big Prop 50 win and said right after that, she would turn to thinking about her future. Of course, Pelosi very much wants Democrats to retake the House, and Prop 50's going help with that. She sees that as really essential to putting a check on what she sees as President Trump's excessive use of force and use of executive power. And so with Prop 50's landslide win, it's a chance for Pelosi to take a victory lap and say it's time to let another generation lead.MARTÍNEZ: That's Scott Shafer from member station KQED. Scott, thanks.SHAFER: You're welcome.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n    TONYA MOSLEY, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Tonya Mosley. This week, voters across the country went to the polls for a handful of special and local elections. And the outcome is that Democrats won big and small races in what was seen as a referendum on President Donald Trump. But while people were looking at governors' races in New Jersey and Virginia and the mayoral race in New York, it was that ballot initiative in California that may have the biggest preview of what's to come leading up to the 2026 midterm elections. Proposition 50 allows California Democrats to redraw congressional maps to potentially win five more seats. The measure passed by a huge margin, after which Governor Gavin Newsom made it clear what he feels should happen next.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GAVIN NEWSOM: My call tonight, in the spirit of Whitman, who talked about the powerful play goes on - we all must contribute a verse. And so we need the state of Virginia. We need the state of Maryland. We need our friends in New York and Illinois and Colorado. We need to see other states with their remarkable leaders that have been doing remarkable things meet this moment head on as well to recognize what we're up against in 2026. And let me make this crystal clear. We can de facto end Donald Trump's presidency as we know it. The minute Speaker Jeffries gets sworn in as speaker of the House of Representatives, it is all on the line, a bright line in 2026.MOSLEY: Even when the ballot is small, the stakes can still feel large, and they're often a preview of what's to come. The health and future of American elections, particularly next year's midterms, are at the center of journalist David Graham's latest reporting for The Atlantic. In his piece titled \"Donald Trump's Plan To Subvert The Midterms Is Already Underway,\" Graham explores how the groundwork is already being laid for the conflict in the 2026 midterms, from new voting restrictions and legal challenges to the ways political leaders are reshaping the systems that govern elections themselves. His reporting draws on conversations with election officials and legal experts and those on the front lines of administering the vote. Graham is a staff writer at The Atlantic and author of The Atlantic Daily newsletter. He's also the author of \"The Project: How Project 2025 Is Reshaping America And The World.\" David Graham, welcome back to FRESH AIR.DAVID GRAHAM: Thank you for having me.MOSLEY: First off, your reaction to this week's victories for the Democrats.GRAHAM: I think what's notable here is not just that Democrats won, but the margins by which they won. You know, we saw, for example, in New Jersey, a governor's race that many people thought might be close, but it was something like 13 points. So I think it is a sign of rejection of a lot of Trump's priorities by voters who either were a little bit blase about the 2024 election or maybe even willing to vote for Trump then. And one thing that I think Trump has really done is made voters more engaged and made them pay closer attention. I think that was something that was a factor in this week's election. People are turning out at a high level. You know, New York City mayoral turnout was very high. It's a very political moment.MOSLEY: Well, President Trump has said on Truth Social as the results came in that the losses were because he wasn't on the ballot. Your reporting suggests the big question isn't can Democrats win, but whether they'll be allowed to win in 2026. As we look towards the midterms, what should Americans understand about the difference between Tuesday's results and what you're warning could happen in the midterms?GRAHAM: I think there's several things that are important. The first one is simply scale. These elections are an important bellwether for 2026 and they offer us some early indications, but they're not what will determine control of the House. And so we're going to see much more focus from the White House on what it can do to tip the scales in favor of Republican candidates. The stakes are much higher for Trump, who doesn't want to see his agenda stymied by a Democratic House and is also nervous about the prospect of a possible third impeachment. So I think the stakes will be higher and the opportunities for bad actors to interfere will be many more.MOSLEY: You know, what happened with California Prop 50 was in response to what happened in Texas, where Texas Governor Greg Abbott did the exact same thing - called a special session to redraw maps to grab five GOP seats. What are we seeing in GOP-led states? Is this also something that is being pushed for to redraw those maps?GRAHAM: Yeah. So it's not just Texas. We've also seen new maps in Missouri. We saw a new map in North Carolina. We saw a new map in Ohio, which makes two currently Democratic districts much more red. And there's an ongoing battle in Indiana, and I think this is such an interesting case, where the White House has been pressuring Indiana Republicans to redraw their maps. And there's real resistance on the state level from legislators who don't want to do this. And so you see them in real time trying to resist pressure from the White House. I think who wins that will be a useful sign for just how effectively the White House can pressure people. But it does feel like an arms race where both sides are trying to squeeze as many districts as they can and, I think, you know, on the Democratic side, where Democrats feel like they're forced to take up methods that they have in the past rejected. So Trump makes everyone behave a little bit more like him.MOSLEY: And we're just talking about a handful of seats. So there's a lot at stake for both sides.GRAHAM: Yeah. I mean, it's going to be, by all accounts, a very close election. If Trump didn't think it was a close election, he would not be pressuring Texas to squeeze a few seats here or North Carolina to squeeze a seat there. If the margin of victory is - I don't know - maybe 10 seats, experts told me they think it's pretty hard to steal that kind of election. But if it's only three or five seats, it's much easier to have shenanigans that cast doubt on things and try to flip the result and to defy voters' will.MOSLEY: This week, anecdotally, we've seen reporting of lines wrapped around the corner for this special election. People seemed to come out to vote. We were also forewarned that the Justice Department would be sending election monitors to a handful of polling places in California and New Jersey, and there was reporting that some folks saw those monitors. Have you heard word of what happened with those monitors? And also, can you kind of talk about why particularly having monitors come to this type of election cycle is so unusual?GRAHAM: Yeah. DOJ has election monitors, and they do keep an eye on some races. But what's different here is the kind of races they're choosing and what the Justice Department seems to focus on. Historically, the Justice Department has been very concerned about voter suppression, and it's been looking at places where that has historically been an issue. What we see in these cases this year is the Justice Department going to places that are important elections for Democrats, so, for example, the New Jersey governor's race, which was expected to be fairly close, or to California, where there is this important referendum on redistricting, and putting monitors there. So there's a concern about intimidation where there's no real threat of, you know, problems with elections.And also, I think experts see this as a little bit of a dry run for 2026 where the Justice Department starts sending out monitors now to get people accustomed to the idea. Then they send out more monitors potentially next year, and there's where you start to worry about intimidation or pressure on local officials or on voters as well, who may not want to deal with inconvenience or may feel that there's some sort of threat to them.MOSLEY: Your piece actually starts off with this made-up but very specific scenario set a year from now on Election Day in Maricopa County in Arizona. In this made-up scenario, you say CE agents are at polling places. Marines have seized voting machines, and the invocation of martial law has happened. How realistic is this scenario, and why did you choose particularly Maricopa County as a place for it?GRAHAM: I looked at Maricopa because it's a perfect spot for a lot of these questions. There aren't that many competitive districts in the House at this point because so many states have already gerrymandered. But in - around Maricopa County, there are two districts that are expected to be very competitive in next year's elections. And it's also a purple state where you can imagine a lot of focus from both parties. And it's a state where you have both Republican and Democratic officials who will be influential in that race and where Trump has tried to interfere in the past.I don't know how realistic it is, but I think everything that I lay out in this scenario is something that experts told me could happen and something that they want to be prepared for. And this is maybe the worst-case scenario where you have, for example, the presence of Marines coming in, where you have the FBI getting involved, or you have voting machines getting seized. But these are all things that Trump or his allies have talked about or considered and things that match with kind of actions that have taken place so far.MOSLEY: Talk to us about the realities for election officials all the way down to poll workers. I mean, they've had a hard time the last few elections. You tell stories about them getting death threats, having to get restraining orders.GRAHAM: Yeah. It's amazing the way American elections work. And in some ways, it's amazing they work so well, that they depend on a patchwork of local officials with different laws in every state, different rules in different counties. They require volunteers. They require people who are poorly paid and who have become real targets for harassment, particularly in the last few years. A couple things have happened as a result of that harassment. We've seen an exodus of experienced election officials, people who simply don't want to have those jobs. They go and they do something else. We've seen threats against them. That means they have to worry more about security and spend less time on the sort of basic administration of elections that they want to do. We've seen pressure campaigns against these people.So, you know, on one level, we saw President Trump in 2020 calling, for example, the Georgia secretary of state and asking him to find almost 12,000 votes. But we also had people in Trump's orbit calling local officials and trying to pressure them to change things. We saw the kind of public harassment of people like the local officials in Maricopa County. And that makes it very hard for election officials to do their job. It, you know, detracts from what they're doing. They're also facing funding cuts, including cuts for security - cybersecurity and physical security - from the federal government. So really, in every way, the work of these election officials has gotten a lot harder.MOSLEY: You actually spoke with a former Maricopa County recorder, and they told you that standing up to Trump was incredibly lonely and that very few people will have your back, especially if you're Republican. That particular recorder, Stephen Richer, he lost his primary to a MAGA candidate. What does that tell us about the incentive structure for Republicans who might want to defend election integrity?GRAHAM: I think this shows why Republicans either would be reluctant to stand up for Trump or simply might not run for these kinds of offices. Stephen Richer is an interesting character because he is forthrightly conservative. His politics are conservative, but he's also somebody who cares a lot about elections and about truth. And when Trump was claiming that the Maricopa County elections in 2020 were tainted by fraud, he stood up along with several other elected Republicans in the area and said, no, these elections were fair. And for that, he became a target of extensive harassment, you know, by individuals, by - he was attacked in conservative media. And then he lost this campaign.So that's both, you know, a warning that you shouldn't get out over your skis if you're one of these Republicans and you won't be supported by other Republicans. But also, people like that are not going to run for the offices that oversee local elections if they know that they can't win and that they'll become targets.MOSLEY: Our guest today is David Graham, staff writer at The Atlantic. Our interview was recorded yesterday morning. And after our discussion, California Republicans filed a lawsuit challenging the redistricting maps voters approved as unconstitutional. We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF TIM DELAUGHTER'S \"DEBATE MONTAGE\")MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR, and today we're talking to journalist David Graham, whose recent reporting for The Atlantic looks at how efforts to reshape election systems and narratives are already influencing the political landscape ahead of the 2026 midterms.Thinking about Trump's power over the media, you - in your Maricopa scenario, where you project what could happen next year during the midterms, you describe how conservative outlets would likely be running wall-to-wall coverage alleging fraud, offering tales of immigrants being bussed to voting locations. And this part of that scenario is not speculation because we actually saw versions of that in 2020. Trump, though, now has even more control over the information ecosystem. Can you talk a little bit about what's different this time, about how quickly false narratives can spread?GRAHAM: I think we've seen a major shift in a lot of ways. So one thing that - is that in 2020, Fox News was, for the most part, skeptical of Trump's claims of fraud. And what Fox saw was that when they cast doubt on them, viewers started fleeing to alternative, more Trump-friendly outlets. So I don't think we'll see Fox do that again because they didn't - they don't want to lose their viewers. So that's an important thing. But then you start looking at more traditionally mainstream outlets. There's a danger.Trump has threatened CBS and Paramount. He's threatened ABC and put a lot of pressure on them, as we've seen. The new owner of CBS is the son of a Trump donor. Trump has indicated he's very happy with the ownership of CBS, but he's also said that he - you know, he's sued them before and he would sue them again, and that it means they're going to be nicer to him. He said this just on \"60 Minutes\" a few days ago. So he clearly believes that he can bully the press, and I think there are signs that he's been successful in doing that.And then finally, you look at other media. So in 2020, for example, Twitter and Facebook were really active in knocking down misinformation and disinformation about voter fraud. We've seen them pull back on any of that sort of misinfo, disinfo regulation effort since then, in part because of pressure from Trump and his aides. So we can't expect those outlets to be doing anything to help voters get clarity. And we also see TikTok, which may be sold to people friendly to the president as well and is a major source of information. So, you know, the whole ecosystem of information seems to have shifted pretty drastically since that 2020 election.MOSLEY: We know that President Trump has asserted power over elections through executive orders, demanding proof of citizenship to vote, which is already required, insisting that only ballots received by Election Day be counted regardless of state law. Federal judges have blocked these orders. One judge even said that the Constitution doesn't grant the president any specific powers over elections. But you write in your piece that that may not matter. Can you break that down?GRAHAM: Right. Federal election law is a little bit confusing. But Congress has some power over elections, setting election laws. But the president simply doesn't have a role in it. And that's something that it's not in the Constitution, it's not in the law, and courts have recognized that for a long time. Trump has tried to respond to that by simply asserting power. So for example, we've seen him issue an executive order where he does things like mandate that states don't count any ballots postmarked but received after Election Day because he says there's only one Election Day. He's asked the Election Assistance Commission to decertify voting machines because of kind of spurious claims that they might be insecure.So in the absence of real legal authority, he's simply saying these things and daring someone to tell him no. And we've seen courts knock some of those things down. But also, you know, local election officials may heed what he's doing. And even if they don't, it creates a concern about fraud. And he's tried for years to make voters doubt the result even before the votes have been counted.MOSLEY: You've suggested that North Carolina in particular is kind of like the canary in the election coal mine. Can you explain that?GRAHAM: Sure. I think we can see, with the exception of military deployments, many of the possibilities for how, a playbook for how you might interfere with national elections. So in North Carolina, we have seen, for example, efforts for years to suppress votes by doing things like reducing early voting hours or introducing limited voter ID. We have seen years of gerrymandering by both parties to try to ensure that, you know, elections are slanted, most recently by Republicans who are in power. We've seen a partisan takeover of the state board of elections, replacing a sort of professional election administrator with a Republican lawyer.And all of these things affect the rules ahead of time. Then you get to Election Day, where you have potential vote suppression. You have claims of fraud. So in an election in 2016, we saw lawsuits that were really kind of a harbinger of Trump's claims in 2020, saying there was fraud in major Democratic jurisdictions without providing a lot of evidence of that. And then in 2024, we saw a state Supreme Court race in which the Democratic incumbent won a narrow but solid victory and her Republican opponent attempted to get thousands of votes thrown out.Everyone agreed that the voters had followed rules but believed that their registrations were invalid because of officials' errors, wanted these votes thrown out and almost was successful in the state court system, getting fellow Republican judges to rule for him. And it was only stopped when a federal court ruled against him, and that was when the Democrat was finally able to be sworn in. So you can see this effort from well before the election, right up to Election Day and then even after the election to do anything you can to win the seats at all costs.MOSLEY: You know, what's so interesting as well is that, at the same time, the governor in North Carolina is a Democrat. So how much power does he have with state elections?GRAHAM: This is a great question because they have stripped a lot of his power. Until this year, the state board of elections was under the control of the governor. They moved that power from the governor to the state auditor, who is a newly elected Republican official. Also, in North Carolina, election maps, redistricting is entirely under control of the legislature, and the governor has no role. So that's also allowed them to go around the governor. The result is we have maps where even though this state is, North Carolina is fairly closely divided between Republicans and Democrats. Republicans hold near supermajorities in both houses of the state legislature, and they have a huge advantage in the U.S. House delegation as well.MOSLEY: Let's take a short break. If you're just joining us, my guest is David Graham from The Atlantic. And we're talking about his reporting on election systems and political power ahead of the 2026 midterms and what those efforts reveal about the current state of American democracy. We'll be right back after a short break. I'm Tonya Mosley and this is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF ANDRES VIAL, ET AL.'S \"BLUEHAWK\")MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Tonya Mosley. And today, I'm talking with David Graham, a staff writer at The Atlantic, who covers politics and national affairs. His recent piece, Donald Trump's Plan To Subvert The Midterms Is Already Underway, undermines how political leaders and institutions are shaping, and in some cases straining the foundations of American democracy as we move toward the 2026 midterms. I want to delve into your reports about the deployment of the military. We've seen the acceleration as you said, that many experts didn't expect until 2028, Can you delve a little bit deeper into how that acceleration happened?GRAHAM: It's happened in a bunch of ways, and it's been interesting to see the ways in which Trump has justified deploying military. In Los Angeles, initially, it was to support ICE operations. Then in Washington, D.C., the claim was that out of control crime required the use of the National Guard - even though crime was at the time and continues to drop in D.C. More recently, we've seen as Trump threatens or, in fact, does deploy federal law enforcement and also the National Guard in other cities, the focus has shifted back towards immigration.So on the one hand, that achieves a goal for him, but it also gets Americans used to the idea of armed troops in the streets as something that is not a totally foreign scenario, not totally unheard of. And that's important going into the elections. If you try to deploy lots of the military in, say, late October 2026, it's going to raise a lot of fuss and a lot of attention. But if people are already accustomed to that, it won't be something new. And I think that's a concern that a lot of the election experts I talked to had.There is specifically a federal law that bans sending armed men in the language to any election of facilities unless there is an actual active rebellion. But there are ways to get around that. If you already have troops in the street or if you already have a strong presence of, say, ICE agents in the streets, you're not sending them to polling areas. You're not specifically interfering with the election, but you may have some of the same effect - and I think that effect is also worth parsing a little bit.On the one hand, there was a question of intimidation. People may just not want to come to the polls if there are, you know, heavily-armed people in the streets. The answer you get from people on the MAGA right is, well, if you're a citizen, you have nothing to fear. And I think as we've seen many arrests of citizens by ICE and including detention of citizens, that doesn't really hold water anymore. But the other problem is inconvenience. If you have heavy vehicles on the streets and checkpoints and, you know, lots of soldiers or guardsmen, it makes it hard to get to election places. And that inconvenience can keep people from voting.Especially in a midterm where people are not as motivated or as energized as they are in a presidential election. So all of these little bits on the margin can start chipping away at how many people are willing or able to cast their votes.MOSLEY: You write about this striking irony. So Trump talks constantly about election security, but he's gutted the agency that actually protects it. He cut a third of CISA's workforce, the people who help local officials defend against hackers. The administration has also slashed millions in funding, and then he appointed this woman, Heather Honey, to oversee election integrity. Remind us who she is and what this tells us about what she's been given as her directives.GRAHAM: Heather Honey is one of these figures who rose to prominence in the aftermath of the 2020 election as a sort of self-styled election analyst - and she was involved in efforts in some states to raise questions about whether there had been fraud. As we know, there was no evidence of fraud. All the legal cases that concerned the 2020 election were defeated. But Honey now has been appointed to this new position at DHS that concerns election integrity, and we don't know exactly what her powers might be or how she might use them - in part because this position is new and because the administration has not told us a lot about it.But I think if you put it alongside those other efforts to reduce the security in other ways, the worry is that she'll use that perch to either pressure local officials to do things that - where there's security or that are against the law, or else simply that she will cast doubt on the elections and create concerns among the electorate about whether elections have been fair.MOSLEY: Let's talk about the power of the courts for a moment. You've pointed out that most election-related cases are actually decided in lower courts where Trump and his allies haven't had much success historically. But if election-related cases are appealed and make their way to the Supreme Court - which has shown a willingness to defer to executive authority at times - what kind of timeline could we be looking at as we think about the midterm elections? Could cases tied to the 2026 midterms realistically be resolved before votes are cast or counted?GRAHAM: This is a really good question, and it depends a little bit on the kinds of cases we see. On the one hand, the Supreme Court has been taking a lot of steps on the shadow docket. On the other hand, the courts tend to be reluctant to interfere with elections too close to the election. You know, they've held historically that you don't want to change the rules of the election within the last, you know, weeks, months - and so they tend to be fairly restrained about that. So there's a question not only of things that might come to the court before the election, but also things that might come to the court after the election - emergency appeals, issues about stopping voting or you know, a scenario like the Bush v. Gore case in 2000.One thing that experts did tell me, though, is Bush v. Gore, although it is a very controversial and very high profile, is a little bit unusual. Usually these cases don't make it to the Supreme Court. And usually when they do, on election issues as compared to some of these other things, court watchers see the court being a little bit more restrained and hesitant to rock the boat.MOSLEY: Let's take a short break. If you're just joining us, my guest is David Graham from The Atlantic, and we're talking about his reporting on election systems and political power ahead of the 2026 midterms - and what those efforts reveal about the current state of American democracy. We'll be right back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR. And today, we're talking to David Graham, a staff writer at The Atlantic and author of \"The Project: How Project 2025 Is Reshaping America.\" His latest article, \"Donald Trump's Plan To Subvert The Midterms Is Already Underway,\" examines the vulnerabilities in America's election system and how political leaders are already preparing to test them.I want to play a clip from a speech President Trump gave at a conservative Turning Point Action summit in the summer of 2024 where he talks about voting. Let's listen.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You won't have to do it anymore. Four more years. You know what? It'll be fixed. It'll be fine. You won't have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians. I love you, Christians. I'm a Christian. I love you. Get out. You got to get out and vote. In four years, you don't have to vote again. We'll have it fixed so good you're not going to have to vote.MOSLEY: So that was President Trump at a conservative Turning Point Action summit in the summer of 2024. His people later said that he was referring to fixing the problems with voting. But I could also see where it sounds like he could also be saying there won't be a need to be any more elections. How have scholars that you've spoken to interpreted this?GRAHAM: They see it as a dangerous statement. Trump has a habit of sort of pushing the envelope in these statements and then writing it back as either a joke or saying he didn't mean that. What I heard time and again was people saying, you know, we believe there will be elections in 2026. Everything moving forward indicates that. There's preparation. Trump wouldn't be pushing states to gerrymander if he didn't think there were going to be elections, so we're not going to see canceled elections. But the question is whether they are really free and fair. And when he says things like that, it doesn't sound like he's preparing for free and fair elections, especially when you take that next to the actions he's taking to undermine the security of the system in other ways and to cast doubt on it.MOSLEY: Is there a scenario where he could declare a national emergency around the 2026 elections if the turnout isn't what he expected or wants?GRAHAM: What's, I think, scary about emergency powers for the president is that they're fairly broad and a lot of them are unexplored. So we've seen people around Trump suggesting that declarations of emergency would be really useful. And what's unclear is whether courts would allow that, how fast courts could react to stop them. You know, could courts react before, for example, voting machines were seized, which would raise questions about chain of custody and whether tallies could be trusted, or would they be slower to get to it? And what would he do with that kind of emergency power? Would it be seizing machines? Would it be sending troops into the street? So the broad leeway presidents have and the lack of clarity around how courts would react make that a scenario that a lot of experts are concerned about.MOSLEY: Can you talk also about some of the other things that are happening, maybe not at the federal level, not with the administration, but with other folks who are supporters of Trump's agenda? There was this story that came out recently of a former GOP election official buying Dominion Voting Systems, saying that he'll push for paper ballots. There are other actors who are also working in ways to shift and change the way we actually vote.GRAHAM: I think this question of the purchase of Dominion is really interesting. And it has definitely raised some alarm bells from people. You know, election officials who I trust have been treating that one, I would say, with some caution. This is somebody who worked in election administration for a long time. And they're waiting to see whether the new company will actually make big changes or if this is mostly sort of a rhetorical shift designed to appeal to the right. But there are a lot of concerns at the local level and in other places about what might happen. We saw election officials in 2020 who have now been forced from office who stood up to Trump, including many Republicans. And we've seen election deniers running for and being elected to local offices. So they now have control over voting in some places.We have seen Republicans take control of state election authorities in places like North Carolina. We saw in Colorado an odd situation where a Republican consultant contacted county officials in several counties and asked them to provide access to their voting machines to the federal government. And he claimed he was working with the White House. Now, that would be against state law. All of them told him no. And the White House said that he was not designated to do this. But it's a strange situation. And anything that would provide that kind of third-party access would raise questions about the integrity of the system and whether we could trust the votes.MOSLEY: You know, one of the things that has been talked about is President Trump seeking a third term. What have the folks that you have talked to, who are making projections or fearful of making projections, said about this particular concern?GRAHAM: This is a little bit like Trump trying to interfere with state election administration, where it's very clear what the law says. There is not a way for a president to run for a third term. It's also very clear that the Constitution is intended to bar, you know, these weird maneuvers that have been discussed, for example, where Trump would run as a vice presidential candidate, and then whoever was at the top of the ticket would resign and let him take over. So the authority isn't there. But Trump has also tried in many cases to overstep his authority, to do things that he doesn't have the power to do. And he's been stopped by the courts or, you know, the courts have allowed things to go forward on a temporary basis.So they're not worried that there's some legal maneuver that would work. What they're worried is that he might do it and there might be no one who was able or willing to stop him from running for a third term. And this gets very technical, but there are questions of how, for example, you would disqualify a Trump third term given prior litigations about the 14th Amendment and whether Trump could be disqualified before the 2024 race. It quickly gets very weedy even though the Constitution is so clear.MOSLEY: Why are people saying that the 14th Amendment should have barred President Trump from running in 2024?GRAHAM: There were a lot of people who argued that because the 14th Amendment barred insurrectionists, which was a post-Civil War way to disqualify former Confederates from office, they said that Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election qualified him as an insurrectionist. And as a result, he should not be allowed on ballots. And we saw efforts in some states to remove him from the ballot. And those went to the Supreme Court, which ruled basically that states don't have a lot of authority to do that on their own unless the federal government - in particular, Congress - has already deemed somebody to have been involved in an insurrection. So the question is then, would Congress say that Trump couldn't run for a third term? And if they didn't, is there any enforcement mechanism?MOSLEY: Let's talk a little bit about Congress because, again, the legal experts you talk to refuse to make predictions about the presidential race in particular in 2028. But if Democrats do manage to retake the House or the Senate in 2026, despite all of the interference that you describe, what happens next? Does Trump accept those results? What does the period between November 2026 and January 2027 look like?GRAHAM: It's interesting to see what's going on now in Congress, where there has been a Democrat elected in the special election in Arizona, Adelita Grijalva, who has not yet been seated in the House, simply because Speaker Mike Johnson refuses to seat her. So one concern is, if there is an election that is not certified in time and the majority is Republican, could they elect Speaker Mike Johnson and then refuse to later seat Democrats who have been elected? It's a little bit of a complicated scenario, but that's a possibility.The other question is what Trump might try to do to consolidate power ahead of the seating of, you know, a new House sort of in that lame-duck period. Where might he try to push congressional Republicans to give him new powers or do things that they wouldn't block? And then after a new House is sworn in, if it's a Democratic majority, the question is how he will interact with them. For example, would he comply with subpoenas? Will he comply with oversight requests? During his first term, he was really eager to kind of stonewall Democrats in the House. But he's gone further on many things than he did in his first term. And so I'm curious to see what that might look like, how he might be more aggressive in refusing to cooperate with a new Democratic majority.MOSLEY: How does money play into this? We see billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, you know, help Trump's goals. We also saw a lot of that in the mayor's race in New York with endorsements as well.GRAHAM: Money in American politics is so central. And even though voters have consistently indicated a preference for stronger rules, they're not there. We have seen billionaires flocking to Trump in particular, and although Democrats have billionaire backers of their own, one concern is whether the system will remain equitable and also whether Democrats are able to rely on their sort of small-dollar donations. When you have something like ActBlue under investigation, it's a real threat to the Democratic fundraising machine.And so you already have a system that is shot through with money. You have fewer restrictions on it. You have bodies like the Federal Election Commission basically hamstrung by partisanship and by lack of appointments. And so campaign finance is a little bit of a wild west right now, and it creates more opportunities for the federal government to put thumbs on scales.MOSLEY: You know, because President Trump has been so unpredictable, he's broken so many norms, it requires a lot of speculation to predict the future. How do you reality check the threats to elections with facts, what you write about in your articles?GRAHAM: It's a challenging thing. And, you know, there have been plenty of occasions where I have talked to experts and they've said, this is not possible. And then something happens anyway because Trump simply, you know, goes around the law or defies the law or the Supreme Court issues something unexpected. I just try to ground this really closely in understanding both what the law is and how Trump might try to get around it and to pay close attention to the things that he and the people around him are saying.I also think that, you know, the recent past gives us some good indications. For example, we saw Trump calling local officials in 2020 and trying to get them to help him. He didn't face serious consequences for that. That gives us a good reason to expect he would try to do something like that again. We can guess that he might try to deploy troops on the streets because he's already doing that now. Often these things are foretold well ahead of time.MOSLEY: David Graham, thank you so much for this conversation.GRAHAM: Thank you.MOSLEY: David Graham is a staff writer at The Atlantic.

    "body": "\n      For a decade, political support for Israel has come from conservative Christians. But now isolationism and antisemitism are changing the tone.   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  For decades, Israel has enjoyed strong support from American conservatives. Now some prominent influencers on the political right are questioning that support. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has more on what's driving the change and what it could mean.GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Red-state America has been a fan of Israel. Just ask Jackson Lahmeyer, an evangelical pastor in Oklahoma.JACKSON LAHMEYER: In the past, everyone that was in our Christian conservative circles, you just assumed everybody supported Israel.BRUMFIEL: That evangelical support is deeply rooted in faith, he says, but recently, Lahmeyer has noticed the conversation is changing quite a bit, particularly online.LAHMEYER: Some very influential leaders, all of whom I like - Tucker Carlson, Candace Owens, Marjorie Taylor Greene - have taken a very controversial stance in regards to the nation of Israel that has actually been more of a Democratic Party platform item.BRUMFIEL: Like in August, when Tucker Carlson interviewed a nun from the West Bank about the suffering of Palestinian Christians. Carlson said he wanted to raise awareness among Americans.(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE TUCKER CARLSON SHOW\")TUCKER CARLSON: Israel couldn't exist without the United States, and it has the support of so many Christians in the United States. And I don't know if they're fully aware. I think they would care if they knew.BRUMFIEL: The war in Gaza has prompted other prominent Republicans like Steve Bannon to raise criticisms of Israel. Curt Mills is editor of The American Conservative magazine. He says many of these personalities never supported Israel, and they sense now is the moment to speak up.CURT MILLS: Tucker and Bannon are political operators and, in a lot of ways, true believers. But they are also very effective businessmen, and they would not be doing these programs if nobody gave a hoot. There's an audience for this. People are frustrated, people are angry, and they have reason to be.BRUMFIEL: That frustration is about more than just suffering in Gaza, Mills says. Many conservatives want America to avoid becoming entangled in new wars, particularly in the Middle East, and they worry the Trump administration is allowing Israel to drive military decisions like America's attack on Iran earlier this year.MILLS: They are using Donald Trump's presidency like a rented car - the Israelis, the Israel lobby, the Netanyahu government, the neoconservatives in his ranks.BRUMFIEL: So outrage over the war in Gaza and the America First agenda are driving some of this conservative opposition to Israel, but there's something else - antisemitic conspiracies. Take, for example, this comment podcaster Candace Owens made about a recent meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a group of U.S. social media influencers.(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"CANDACE\")CANDACE OWENS: Two years ago, the mere idea that you might share a perspective that Jews are controlling the media, that would be considered antisemitic. You would be called a Jew-hater. Fast forward to 2025, and Bibi Netanyahu is now hosting an on-camera meeting.BRUMFIEL: The idea that Jews control the media is a long-held antisemitic trope. Owens has made other antisemitic remarks in the past, though she has repeatedly said that she does not hate Jewish people. And just last week, Tucker Carlson hosted Nick Fuentes, a white nationalist who has called Hitler awesome.(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE TUCKER CARLSON SHOW\")CARLSON: I'm going to just shut up, and you tell me what you actually believe.NICK FUENTES: Yeah...BRUMFIEL: Fuentes went on to make numerous antisemitic statements, including that he believed Jews were more faithful to Israel than the countries they were born in and that Jewish people prevent America from unifying around a common vision for itself.(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE TUCKER CARLSON SHOW\")FUENTES: The main challenge to that, a big challenge to that, is organized Jewry in America.BRUMFIEL: Carlson's interview with Fuentes sparked a firestorm on the right. Some Republicans blasted him for giving Fuentes a platform, while others, like the president of the conservative Heritage Foundation, supported Carlson's right to have an open dialogue. Why is this happening now? Shibley Telhami is a scholar at the University of Maryland who tracks public opinion about Israel.SHIBLEY TELHAMI: Among Republicans, there's still support for Israel. That is really the core support for Israel right now. But what we've seen is really a shift.BRUMFIEL: He says the Gaza war has damaged Israel's image, particularly with young conservatives. A Pew poll this spring found the number of Republicans under 50 with an unfavorable view of Israel has jumped 15 points since 2022. Telhami's own work shows that only 24% of young Republicans sympathize with Israel in the current conflict. And separate polling has also showed that younger conservatives are more likely to agree with antisemitic statements than other groups. Put it all together and, he says, influencers are free to speak up.TELHAMI: These people who are critics of Israel on the right feel more empowered because they now see that even public opinion is on their side among the young generation of Republicans.BRUMFIEL: It remains to be seen what this actually means for America's relationship with Israel. American Ambassador Mike Huckabee is a devout evangelical Christian, and the Trump administration continues to be broadly supportive.TELHAMI: The question, of course, is whether the shift in public opinion in and of itself would lead to a shift in policy, and that's not a straightforward line.BRUMFIEL: But it is clear that, on the American right, support for Israel is no longer the given it once was.

In 2007, she became the first woman elected to serve as speaker of the House.   \"For our daughters and our granddaughters: today we have broken the marble ceiling,\" she said at the time.   \n   As speaker and House Democrats' leader, Pelosi was known for her shrewd political judgment and incisive skills as a legislative strategist.   She was also a consistent political target for Republicans, who cast her — a San Francisco multi-millionaire — as the ultimate coastal elitist. Pelosi, who raised five children before coming to Congress, rejected the characterization.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Rep. California Nancy Pelosi holds a watch on June 4, 1991 reportedly smuggled out of China. - Pelosi said the watches were given to soldiers who helped crush the Tiananmen Square protesters.\n                \n                    Chris Assaf/AFP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chris Assaf/AFP\n    \n\n   \n   \"From kitchen to Congress\"   Pelosi was first elected in a special election in 1987. She famously claimed she went \"from the kitchen to the Congress\" after raising her children and staying active in state politics.   Fond of saying \"Congress has the power of the purse,\" she began her time on Capitol Hill as an appropriator, a role she drew from throughout her career. She quickly rose through Democratic leadership and became the first woman to lead a major party in either chamber when she was elected as the House Democratic minority leader in 2002.   She led Democrats to retake the House majority in 2006 and after her history-making speakership election in 2007, Pelosi held the gavel for four years — until Republicans won back control of the chamber.   \n   Pelosi, who often called herself a \"master legislator,\" could reliably deliver Democratic votes on must-pass legislation when necessary, although her first speakership came at a complicated time — a financial crisis was looming and ultimately brought the U.S. economy to its knees.   In September 2008, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke huddled with congressional leaders in the speaker's office on the second floor of the U.S. Capitol. There, Paulson outlined a pending financial crisis \"from the depths of hell,\" as Pelosi later described it. The Bush administration was asking Congress for $700 billion to prop up the U.S. economy.   \n   \"When I asked Bernanke what he thought of the secretary's characterization, he said, 'If we do not act immediately, we will not have an economy by Monday.' This was Thursday night. Everyone in the room was flabbergasted,\" Pelosi later recalled.   After Barack Obama was elected that fall, Pelosi pushed forward the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, a stimulus package to counter the effects of the Great Recession. She was also instrumental in passing the Dodd-Frank reforms to the banking industry and was an architect of the Affordable Care Act. The sweeping health care reform law became the signature achievement of Obama's presidency.   In the wake of those bills, the far-right Tea Party movement helped harden Republican opposition to Obama and Democrats more broadly, and Democrats saw major losses in the 2010 midterm elections that relegated Democrats to the minority and ended Pelosi's first run as speaker. Obama himself described the defeat as \"a shellacking.\"   There was growing expectation that Pelosi would retire from Congress after losing the gavel and control of the House. She was featured in attack ads in swing districts, where Republicans used her image relentlessly and effectively to characterize the entire party as far-left elitists.   Ultimately, Pelosi reclaimed the gavel in 2019 — the first person to do so in over 60 years. Originally thought by analysts to be too liberal to be an effective leader, her legacy is ultimately that of a centrist and legislative pragmatist.   A long tenure   Pelosi served alongside four presidents during her time as speaker.   Her contentious relationship with former Republican President George W. Bush was an early showcase of her ability to turn from aggressive critic to critical legislating partner.   \n   Her relationship with President Trump was more fractious. She led two presidential impeachments and created the bipartisan Select Committee to investigate the Jan. 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol.   It was the election of President Joe Biden and Democrats gaining control of both chambers of Congress that saw Pelosi enact trillions in new spending through the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS bill and the bipartisan infrastructure law.   When Democrats lost control of the chamber in the 2022 midterm elections, Pelosi stepped down from leadership amid demands for a turnover to allow a new generation of leaders to ascend. Pelosi continued to serve in the House during a time when Democrats continued to search for a path out of the minority in Washington.   \n   \"History will note she is the most consequential speaker of the House of Representatives in our history,\" then-President Biden said at the time.   That same year, Pelosi's husband, Paul, was violently attacked by an intruder who broke into their home demanding to see the then-speaker. Paul Pelosi underwent surgery to repair a skull fracture and serious injuries to his right arm and hands. The attack was a stark example of the increase in political violence in the country.   Some two years later, Pelosi reportedly played a role privately and publicly in encouraging Biden to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race.   In 2024, Pelosi was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country's highest civilian honor.   Earlier this year, Pelosi signaled she would wait to make an announcement on her political future until after California voted on Proposition 50, a ballot measure that would enable state leaders to temporarily redraw current congressional lines to favor Democrats.   In a recent interview on CNN, Pelosi said she had \"no doubt that if I decided to run, I would win.\"   \"It isn't arrogant,\" she said. \"It's confident.\"\n",

Now they have to live with him — and their reactions range from threatening to leave the city to pragmatic acceptance.   \"I think it's the stages of grief,\" says Kathryn Wylde, who runs the Partnership for New York City, an influential business group that represents more than 300 large employers.   Wylde has been brokering meetings between her members and Mamdani in the past several months. Her response to his victory this week was both practical and tinged with optimism.   \n   \"The Partnership works with whoever wins,\" she says. \"Zohran has won resoundingly, and so we will seek to be his partner in dealing with the challenges facing the city, which are considerable right now.\"   Those issues include the ongoing affordability crisis that Mamdani made a central message of his campaign. But he has proposed addressing it with some policies that businesses and the wealthy people who run them widely dislike, including a rent freeze and higher taxes.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Supporters celebrate at an election watch party in Brooklyn on Nov. 4, 2025 after Zohran Mamdani was projected the winner in the New York City mayoral race.\n                \n                    Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   Speaking to WNYC on Wednesday, Mamdani promised to spend his first 100 days \"taking concrete and substantive actions to deliver on the cost of living crisis that is pushing so many New Yorkers out of the city.\"   He also promised to take on \"corporate greed.\"   CEOs' opposition to Mamdani is about both business and emotion   Practically speaking, Mamdani will be unable to raise taxes without help from New York State's government. But his proposal at least threatens to make the city more expensive for both businesses and billionaires in an effort to rein in costs for the rest of the city's residents.   Wylde points out that some business leaders had other reasons for opposing him. His rhetoric about \"corporate greed\" and his identity as a Democratic socialist tend to be trigger words for dyed-in-the-wool capitalists.   \n   And then there's his relatively youthful age of 34 — which was part of his appeal for young voters, but more off-putting to chief executives who may be decades older.   \"The universal [initial] reaction was, 'Is this young man someone you would hire to run a 300,000 person corporation?' And of course the answer was, 'No way,'\" says Wylde.   There are also deeper, emotional stakes for many CEOs in New York City, which has the largest Jewish population outside of Israel. The conflict between Israel and Hamas, and Mamdani's criticism of the Israeli government, became a major tension in this election.   \n   About one third of Jewish voters cast their ballot for Mamdani, according to CNN's exit polls. He spoke out against antisemitism and said Wednesday that he looks forward to working with Jewish leaders across the city.   Meanwhile, some of Mamdani's most vocal billionaire opponents seemed to accept their defeat this week. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman spent some $2 million on efforts to defeat the new mayor — but on Tuesday, he publicly congratulated him.   \"Now you have a big responsibility,\" Ackman posted on X. \"If I can help NYC, just let me know what I can do.\"\n",

That was the finding of a jury on Thursday in the case of a man charged with assault for throwing his hoagie at a federal officer in Washington, D.C.   The jury's conclusion came after about seven hours of deliberations. The case of the Subway sandwich has come to symbolize how many in the nation's capital feel about the Trump administration's surge of federal law enforcement to the city.   \n   A bystander's video captured Sean Charles Dunn in August calling federal officers racists and fascists. He thought they were about to do an immigration raid at a gay nightclub on Latin Night.   He also threw his Subway sandwich at Gregory Lairmore, an agent with U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Lairmore, who was wearing a bulletproof vest, told jurors the sandwich exploded and he smelled onions and mustard — though he wasn't hurt. Dunn was later caught by police and fired from his job at the Justice Department.   \n   The U.S. attorney's office in D.C. initially tried to charge Dunn with felony assault. When a grand jury failed to indict him on that charge, the case was downgraded to a misdemeanor charge for assaulting or impeding a federal officer. Prosecutors said Dunn went too far, and people should not be allowed to throw things at law enforcement.   Dunn argued that he was being singled out because of his criticism of the Trump administration. His lawyers also teased out the absurdity of the situation, arguing it was a harmless gesture that caused no harm or injury. Lairmore, who was wearing a bulletproof vest, admitted during the trial that he received gag gifts from colleagues, including a plush sandwich and a patch that says \"Felony Footlong.\"   \"I'm relieved and I'm looking forward to moving on with my life,\" Sean Charles Dunn said outside the courthouse on Thursday after the jury's verdict.\n",

Today's top stories   The government shutdown is now in its 37th day, and President Trump has been urging Republicans to end it by eliminating the Senate filibuster. Earlier this week, some Democrats expressed their interest in finding a way to resolve the shutdown, but their victories at the ballot box on Tuesday have emboldened many to hold firm. Meanwhile, the president acknowledged that the shutdown hurt Republicans on election night.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) speaks to reporters during a news conference on Nov. 5, 2025, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. The record for the longest shutdown in the U.S. Government was broken on Wednesday as it entered its 36th day.\n                \n                    Tom Brenner/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Tom Brenner/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Most Republicans are not in favor of ditching the filibuster, as Trump has sought, but some bipartisan talks appear to have picked up steam this week, NPR's Sam Gringlas tells Up First. The solution that Senate Democrats and Republicans could be discussing is a short-term funding measure until December or later, along with votes on a small package of regular appropriations bills. Republicans would need eight Democrats to sign onto a deal to reopen the government. However, the expiring health care subsidies remain a sticking point during these talks.   The Supreme Court has heard arguments in a case about Trump's tariffs, but has not yet issued a major ruling. Trump utilized a 1977 law, known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, to impose the tariffs. The central question of the case is whether the law gives the president the authority to impose tariffs on products from countries worldwide. The justices' opinions are not yet known, but their questions yesterday indicate that they were skeptical of Trump's position.    \n   🎧 If the court rules against Trump, the ultimate impact on tariffs is unclear. NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben says the ruling would make a bunch of his tariffs illegal. Tariffs like the ones he's imposed on goods like steel and aluminum, however, would remain in place. The president has stated that this is the most important Supreme Court case ever. If the high court ruled against the president, it would be the first time they have tried to rein in his power.   In Chicago this week, the Trump administration has been taken to court by city residents who oppose the aggressive immigration campaign there. Judge Sara Ellis has listened to hours of testimony from citizens' accounts of jarring encounters with federal agents. Another judge, Robert Gettleman, presided over a hearing on Tuesday on the conditions inside an immigration holding facility in a Chicago suburb.    🎧 Ellis is preparing to hand down her ruling today in the preliminary injunction, according to Jon Seidel with Chicago Public Media and the Chicago Sun-Times. It would essentially extend the order she issued last month, limiting the use of force by federal agents against protesters. During yesterday's eight-hour hearing, Ellis heard from a woman who found herself staring down the barrel of a gun for filming the arrest of day laborers. She also listened to the video testimony of U.S. Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino, who stated that the use of force has been \"more than exemplary.\"   \n   Deep dive   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Natalya Kosarevich/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Tax season is approaching. The tax breaks extended under President Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" primarily benefit high-net-worth individuals and high-income earners. While middle-income households may experience modest relief, the majority of benefits will be allocated to those with substantial earnings, investment income, or large estates. Here are some provisions in the bill that favor upper-income individuals and families:    💰 Starting next year, Americans will have a permanent lifetime exemption for estate and gift taxes set at $15 million per individual and $30 million per married couple, up from $13.99 million and $27.98 million limits.💰 The exclusion for capital gains from sold qualified small business stock issued after July 4, 2025, has increased from $10 million to $15 million for companies with assets up to $75 million.💰 Bonus depreciation has been extended. This tax incentive enables businesses to immediately deduct 100% of the cost of qualifying assets, such as machinery and vehicles, rather than spreading the deduction over several years.

    "body": "\n      Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the first woman ever elected Speaker of the House, announced Thursday that after 38 years in Congress, she will not seek another term.   \n\n    JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  Democratic representative Nancy Pelosi, the first woman ever elected speaker of the House, announced today that she will not seek another term. Pelosi spent 38 years representing her San Francisco constituents in Washington. KQED senior politics correspondent Scott Shafer looks back at her historic legacy.SCOTT SHAFER, BYLINE: As Representative Nancy Pelosi prepares to exit the political stage at age 85, she leaves behind a long list of accomplishments, including passage of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Pelosi was first elected in 1987 to fill a seat left vacant by the death of Representative Sala Burton. Her first campaign was no cakewalk. Some of her opponents painted her as privileged and out of touch, including city supervisor Carol Ruth Silver at a televised debate held at KQED.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CAROL RUTH SILVER: How can she relate to people like me - a single parent, working mother?SHAFER: But Pelosi held her ground.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NANCY PELOSI: My attitude is, they'll take the low road and I'll take the high road, and I'll get to Congress before them.SHAFER: And she did, quickly showing her political chops. Years later, her reputation as a tough-as-nails street fighter was well established, as she acknowledged in 2018.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PELOSI: As I always say to the candidates, you have to know how to take a punch and throw a punch.SHAFER: Pelosi arrived in Washington as the AIDS epidemic was ravaging her district. She pushed for more federal funding at a time when the Reagan administration was ignoring it. Ernest Hopkins with the San Francisco AIDS Foundation said Pelosi's impact was felt far outside her own district.ERNEST HOPKINS: She understood that we could not end the HIV epidemic without addressing the epidemic in Black and Latino communities, and so she was all in.SHAFER: But Pelosi's rise to power within the Democratic Party was not easy.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PELOSI: And when I did run for high office and leadership, some of the men said, who said she could run (laughter)? Well, that just lit my fire, really.SHAFER: In 2006, Democrats reclaimed a majority in the House for the first time in 12 years. They elected Pelosi to be the next speaker. Pelosi was a partisan warrior, but Republicans used her as a foil, a liberal Democrat from San Francisco, tying her to other Democrats running in more conservative parts of the country.There were times when she worked across the aisle. During the last year of George W. Bush's presidency, when the economy was cratering from the subprime mortgage crisis, she rounded up enough Democratic votes to save financial institutions, which critics described as a Wall Street bailout. Even former Republican speaker John Boehner praised her at the unveiling of Pelosi's official portrait in 2022.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN BOEHNER: And the fact of the matter is, no other speaker of the House in the modern era, Republican or Democrat, has wielded the gavel with such authority or with such consistent results.SHAFER: Pelosi's superpower was cultivating relationships and understanding how to win enough votes to pass legislation. She was also a thorn in the side of President Trump. In a meeting in the Oval Office during Trump's first term, Pelosi said the blame belonged squarely on the president if there were a government shutdown.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PELOSI: You should not have a Trump shutdown. Are you having a (ph)...PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: A what? Did you say Trump?PELOSI: A Trump shutdown.SHAFER: A photo of her emerging from that meeting with the president wearing a vibrant red coat and sunglasses became an iconic image. Democrats retook the House in 2019, and Pelosi was elected speaker a second time, guiding two impeachments of Trump, efforts that ultimately failed in the Senate. She became the face of the Democratic Party's resistance, dramatically ripping up a copy of Trump's State of the Union speech in 2020. She later gave her reason in an interview with KQED, saying it was, quote, \"full of lies.\" Pelosi made history as the first woman and the first Californian to become speaker. But as Governor Gavin Newsom notes, it's what she did with that power that mattered.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GAVIN NEWSOM: You may never get something like this back. It will take 40, 50 years for someone to build the kind of credibility that she's built and the influence and the capacity to deliver.SHAFER: Several candidates are already vying to replace her. Whoever wins will be hard-pressed to match Pelosi's ability to wield power.For NPR News, I'm Scott Shafer in San Francisco.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      The extension of the extra financial help to buy Affordable Care Act health insurance is still up in the air. Republicans have politics and policy to weigh.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  It's open enrollment time for people who have to buy health insurance on their own through HealthCare.gov, and that's about 24 million Americans. Coming up, we'll speak with Democratic Senator Ron Wyden about the debate in Congress over extending the Affordable Care Act subsidies set to expire at the end of the year.A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  First, let's get an overview over where things stand on what's also known as Obamacare with Julie Rovner. She's the chief Washington correspondent with our reporting partner KFF Health News. So, Julie, people can shop for their health insurance, but the price they're seeing may not be final. Why is that?JULIE ROVNER: That's right. You know, there always been tax credits to help people afford their coverage on the Affordable Care Act health exchanges. In 2021, Congress made those tax credits much larger because they were concerned during the pandemic that more people should have health insurance, and it really worked. It doubled enrollment in the Affordable Care Act. Well, those extra subsidies are set to expire at the end of December. Congress is still fighting over whether to extend them. So people who are getting on the internet now and looking at the prices are seeing the un- or un-extra-subsidized...MARTÍNEZ: Yeah.ROVNER: ...Prices, which in many cases are much, much larger. But we still don't know if Congress is going to extend those additional subsidies, which would bring those prices down.MARTÍNEZ: So you said Congress is still fighting over this. How likely politically, though, is it that Congress will actually act?ROVNER: Well, we will see. In the fairly near future, the Senate has promised a vote to Democrats in order to get them to reopen the government. That's set for no later than the end of next week. Republicans, though, are still scrambling to have something to offer as an alternative.MARTÍNEZ: Now, when it comes to that alternative, what is it? Do they have a plan?ROVNER: A lot of Republicans have plans, but they're not all on the same page. In fact, we saw early last week, President Trump floated a plan that would have extended the subsidies temporarily. And that met with a big backlash, and he backed off. And you've got, you know, some Republicans saying we shouldn't be giving any kind of tax credits or subsidies to insurance companies. We should give the money directly to individuals. Economists say that's not going to help most people pay their health bills, even if they have kind of a minor health ailment. So Republicans, as they have been for the last 20-some years, are divided over how to proceed.MARTÍNEZ: So what are the takeaways, then, for people who need to buy health insurance in these ACA marketplaces?ROVNER: Well, we're looking at a pretty hard deadline. If you want to have insurance starting January 1, you have to select a plan by December 15, which is obviously just two weeks away. You know, many - there are many ways to sort of calculate what your premiums would be without these additional tax credits and what they would be if, for some reason, Congress actually manages to extend them. But right now, it's pretty hard for the average consumer to figure out what to do because it's pretty hard for us political reporters to figure out what we should be doing.MARTÍNEZ: Two weeks away, though - I mean, that's not a lot of time. I mean, what are the odds Congress even acts before then?ROVNER: It seems unlikely Congress will act before then. However, if Congress does eventually act and extends the tax credits, then there will be an opportunity for people who have selected plans to go in and sort of select a new plan. Maybe they're going to shop - you know, they'll select a cheaper plan for next year because that's all they can afford. And if the tax credits get extended, they might be able to afford something more akin to what they have now, and they will be able to go back and change it. In most states, open enrollment doesn't end until January 15. And obviously, if Congress makes some changes, they can also extend that open enrollment again. So people shouldn't panic as much as...MARTÍNEZ: OK.ROVNER: ...They may be panicking now.MARTÍNEZ: That's Julie Rovner, chief Washington correspondent with our partner KFF Health News. Thanks a lot.ROVNER: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Leila Fadel speaks with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., about the debate in Congress to extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of the year.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  For more on the politics surrounding health care costs and extending Affordable Care Act subsidies, Senator Ron Wyden is on the line. The senior Senator from Oregon is the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. Good morning, Senator.RON WYDEN: Hey. Thanks for having me.FADEL: Thank you for being here. I want to start with what we just heard from Julie Rovner there. You know, December 15 is when a lot of people have to sign up for their coverage to start January 1. That gives Congress two weeks to get something done to address insurance costs. Is that possible?WYDEN: Well, a clean extension of the tax credits is the only timely step that's going to prevent millions of Americans from experiencing a big premium increase. And that's going to happen very quickly. And the problem is that the Republicans want to tack on harmful policies that mostly help big insurance. So we Democrats are trying to work with the Republicans and both sides, but we've been talking to them for a long time, and they've got to move.FADEL: What specific policies are you concerned about?WYDEN: Big insurance policies, policies that are junk insurance, for example, basically, savings accounts, for example, that give a few benefits, but nothing that's going to help with cancer. It's mostly stuff that helps big insurance.FADEL: Last week, House Republican leaders pushed back against a reported White House plan that would have extended the Affordable Care Act subsidies for two years. What did you make of that backlash?WYDEN: Well, clearly, they're fighting, but the problem is, Trump has always had concepts, but never a real bill. And this legislation, as far as we can tell, is going to be mostly higher deductibles, more co-payments, junk insurance, not going to do something for working families. That's our bottom line.FADEL: What are the biggest sticking points when it comes to finding a compromise on this issue to get an extension...WYDEN: Well, it seems...FADEL: ...Or some type of movement?WYDEN: Yeah. It seems in the last couple of days Trump is actually rejecting some effort at tax credits, and I think that's the only timely thing that's going to keep people from getting clobbered in the short term. We're going to say, we'll work with them. For example, I've written a policy that's very aggressive in terms of fighting fraud. They say they care about it. So if they want to be bipartisan, we'll work with them.FADEL: Are there signs that there is traction for what you want among Republican - your Republican colleagues?WYDEN: Well, everybody's coming back today. My sense is a lot of families were around the Thanksgiving table, wondering how they were going to deal with these huge increases. They'll be talking to their senators, and I think they're going to say, get something done. We had a hearing before we left, and what people just said is, get it done. Lower these premiums.FADEL: I think everyone, though, agrees that this is a short-term solution to a long-term problem, the - which is health care is unaffordable for a lot of Americans, especially without these subsidies. Is there a solution to address the root cause of high health care so this doesn't become a political debate every few years where Americans are wondering whether their premiums are going to go up?WYDEN: Once we've dealt with this issue, we're ready to go on the long term. In particular, I'm going to be focused on these out-of-control administrative costs. Looks like they're racking up close to a trillion dollars a year. It's insanely complicated. That'll be a priority for me.FADEL: What - beyond that, when you look at reforms, what reforms should the Affordable Care Act be undergoing?WYDEN: Well, certainly, we can look at a variety of approaches, and I'm going to talk about fighting fraud. I've introduced a proposal that would allow us to deal with these out-of-control insurance brokers. We ought to have tough criminal penalties on them, and then we ought to go after these big insurance proposals.FADEL: As part of the deal to end the government shutdown, Senate Republicans promised Democrats to hold a vote on a Democratic health care bill by mid-December. Do you expect that vote to be successful?WYDEN: My proposal is, let's get to work. We're going to talk to the Republicans. Right now, there's no deal, but if there isn't a bill, there's going to be an awful human crisis. Millions are going to lose coverage. I've got folks at home in Eugene, Oregon, you know, who are looking at a 500% increase in premiums. We're going to have folks devastated.And, by the way, Julie Rovner knows this. It's going to jack up employer-sponsored health care costs, as well, to the biggest increase we've seen in small businesses in years.FADEL: Looking ahead at next year's midterm, is health care the main issue that your constituents are concerned about?WYDEN: Well, the combination of the huge Medicaid cuts and what's going to be done to rural hospitals, this makes this a front-and-center issue. I've always said health care is the most important issue because if you and your loved ones don't have your health, everything else goes by the board. There are going to be a lot of people who can't pay for health care with this.FADEL: And what is your message to both your Democratic colleagues and Republican colleagues right now as you think about health care costs?WYDEN: My message is, we want to support legislation that lowers health costs and prevents Americans from losing their health insurance. We will work with anybody - Republicans - that'll meet that standard.FADEL: That's Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon. Thank you for your time.WYDEN: Thanks for having me.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Meanwhile, Venezuela is warning that the U.S. intends to invade the country and seize its oil reserves.MARTÍNEZ: For more, we now go to John Otis, who is covering the story from neighboring Colombia. John, the U.N. says these American strikes violate international law. Some U.S. lawmakers now have raised the issue of war crimes, but there is no declaration of war against Venezuela.JOHN OTIS, BYLINE: Yeah. That's correct. There's no formal war between the two countries, but Trump has said that he's waging war against Venezuelan drug traffickers. And as you mention, U.S. forces have destroyed more than 20 alleged drug boats, killing more than 80 people. But The Washington Post reported that following one of the first strikes back in September, there were initially two survivors clinging to the boat wreckage. According to the post, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had given an order to kill everyone aboard alleged drug boats and that this order led to a second strike in which those survivors were killed. Here's Senator Tim Cain, a Democrat from Virginia, speaking on the CBS News program \"Face The Nation.\"(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FACE THE NATION\")TIM KAINE: If that reporting is true, it's a clear violation of the DOD's own laws of war, as well as international laws about the way you treat people who are in that circumstance. And so this rises to the level of a war crime if it's true.OTIS: Hegseth has called The Post report fake news. And Trump, speaking with reporters last night on Air Force One, backed him up. But the House and Senate Armed Services Committees have vowed to increase oversight of the boat strikes.MARTÍNEZ: Now, President Trump has been warning airlines to steer clear of Venezuelan airspace. So what does that mean about a possible attack?OTIS: Yeah. You know, ever since his first term, Trump has been pushing for regime change in Venezuela. Its president, Nicolas Maduro, has crushed the country's democracy and its economy, prompting about 8 million Venezuelans to flee overseas. Trump has also confirmed that he recently talked to Maduro on the phone, though he didn't provide any details. On Sunday, Venezuela's vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, read a statement from Maduro claiming that this is all about oil.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DELCY RODRIGUEZ: (Speaking Spanish).OTIS: Now, here she's saying Venezuela formally accuses the U.S. government of trying to take control of Venezuela's vast oil reserves. But experts say the 15,000 U.S. troops based on warships in the Caribbean are not enough to take control of Venezuela. Trump could instead order limited attacks on Venezuelan territory, or he might just stick to these boat strikes.MARTÍNEZ: Now, John, while all this is happening, President Trump then suddenly announced that he has plans to pardon a former Honduran president who is convicted of drug trafficking. So why that? Why now?OTIS: Yeah. The timing on this is quite strange, amid Trump's antinarcotics campaign and just before the Honduran presidential election that took place on Sunday. But Trump has also been quick to defend former presidents elsewhere in the world who get into legal hot water. Juan Orlando Hernandez is a former Honduran president who was sentenced last year in the U.S. to 45 years in prison for helping to traffic more than 400 tons of cocaine into the U.S. Without providing any evidence, Trump claimed that Hernandez was, quote, set up by the Biden administration and that he deserves a full pardon.MARTÍNEZ: That's John Otis reporting from the Colombian capital of Bogota. Thanks a lot, John.OTIS: Thanks.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

In a Truth Social post, Trump said \"To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.\"   The Venezuelan government responded with a statement saying Trump's comments violate international law and are a \"colonialist threat\" to the country's sovereignty.   \"No authority outside the Venezuelan institutional framework has the power to interfere with, block, or condition the use of international airspace,\" the statement said.   \n   As of Sunday afternoon, Flightradar24 shows planes continuing to fly in Venezuelan airspace.   This comes a day after the Senate and House Armed Services committees said they would look into the Pentagon after The Washington Post reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave an order to kill all crew members aboard a boat suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean in September. NPR has confirmed the Washington Post's reporting.   The military has carried out at least 21 strikes and killed at least 82 people on alleged drug boats as part of \"Operation Southern Spear,\" a campaign that the Trump administration says is aimed at tackling drug-trafficking.   Venezuela said in its statement that \"such statements represent an explicit use of force, which is prohibited by Article 2, paragraph 4 of the U.N. Charter of the United Nations.\"   Democrats have also strongly criticized the administration's strategy, saying the military didn't have enough evidence that the boats were carrying drugs before conducting the strikes. Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland, told ABC'S This Week on Sunday it's possible the military's actions could be considered a \"war crime,\" and that Hegseth should be held accountable.   \"They've never presented the public with the information they've got here,\" Van Hollen said, \"But it could be worse than that, right? If that theory is wrong, then it's plain murder.\"   \n   However, Republican Senator Eric Schmitt, a member of the Armed Services Committee, said on Sunday Morning Futures on Fox News that Trump is acting \"well within his Article 2 powers\" when it comes to curbing drug smuggling by striking the boats.   \"I think it's a two part strategy,\" Schmitt said. \"One is to get rid of the precursors that are coming from China, and then take out the cartels that are distributing this and bringing it to the United States of America.\"   Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have expressed frustration at Trump's stance on Venezuela, and that the Trump administration conducted the strikes without legislative approval.   \"Trump's reckless actions towards Venezuela are pushing America closer and closer to another costly foreign war,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer posted on X on Saturday, hours after Trump's post about Venezuelan airspace.   Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former Trump ally, also posted on Saturday, saying \"Reminder, Congress has the sole power to declare war.\"\n",

Its goal is to elect at least a handful of independents to disrupt the two-party system on Capitol Hill.\n                \n                    Glenn Harvey for NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Glenn Harvey for NPR\n    \n\n   \n   The rise of AI assistants is rewriting the rhythms of everyday life: People are feeding their blood test results into chatbots, turning to ChatGPT for advice on their love lives and leaning on AI for everything from planning trips to finishing homework assignments.   Now, one organization suggests artificial intelligence can go beyond making daily life more convenient. It says it's the key to reshaping American politics.   \"Without AI, what we're trying to do would be impossible,\" explained Adam Brandon, a senior adviser at the Independent Center, a nonprofit that studies and engages with independent voters.   \n   The goal is to elect a handful of independent candidates to the House of Representatives in 2026, using AI to identify districts where independents could succeed and uncover diamond in the rough candidates.   In a time when control of the House balances on a knife's edge, winning even a handful of seats could deny either party from getting a majority and upend the way the House currently operates.   It's a bold proposition in a system that hasn't seen a new independent candidate win a House seat in 35 years.   But data shows a rise in moderate and independent voters. Gallup found 43% of Americans — a record high — claiming the independent label in 2024. Exit polls that year showed 34% of voters identified as independent, up from 26% in 2020.    \"There's a huge chunk of people who for different reasons can't stomach either of the two parties,\" said David Barker, a professor of government at American University. \"It's the first time in a long time where a plurality of Americans are now identifying as independents, and so that does seem to signal a pretty important shift.\"   Brandon said that shift is what makes the time right to disrupt the status quo.   \"It's like Uber and taxis. You had a system with an obvious flaw, that had entrenched operators and took a radical change to go completely around it,\" he told NPR. \"And that's what we're feeling now. People are so stuck into 'Republican' and 'Democrat' and we're like, well, there's something else.\"   \n   \"We're political fighters\"   Trying to throw a wrench into the stranglehold of a two-party system is an uphill battle, pushing against political orthodoxy and plenty of skeptics.   But the Independent Center's strategists are a far cry from political newbies.   \"We're political fighters,\" said Brandon, who served as president of FreedomWorks, the conservative grassroots group that helped turn Tea Party activists into a political force before closing its doors last year. \"We have built a team of people that know how to do this. We're not going to be pushovers.\"    Brandon works closely with Brett Loyd, who runs The Bullfinch Group, the nonpartisan polling and data firm overseeing the polling and research at the Independent Center. He previously worked on President Trump's polling team, when the president was a candidate.   \"I'm a statistician. I kind of joke that I worked for the RNC because they offered me a job before the DNC,\" he said with a smile. \"My job is numbers and sentiment and game theory. It's not necessarily Republican or Democratic.\"   He makes it clear the goal of their work isn't to erase partisanship altogether.   \"This isn't going to work everywhere. It's going to work in very specific areas,\" Loyd said. \"If you live in a hyper-Republican or hyper-Democratic district, you should have a Democrat or Republican representing you.\"   But with the help of AI, he's identified 40 seats that don't fit that mold, where he said independents can make inroads with voters fed up with both parties. The Independent Center plans to have about 10 candidates in place by spring with the goal of winning at least half of the races.   Brandon predicts those wins could prompt moderate partisans in the House to switch affiliations.   \"I had one Republican [member] tell me in his office, 'I'm too chicken**** to do this right now,'\" he recalled. \"'But if you can do this, I will join you.'\"   \n   From mining Reddit to matching on LinkedIn   Their proprietary AI tool created by an outside partner has been years in the making.    While focus groups and polling have long driven understanding of American sentiments, AI can monitor what people are talking about in real time.   \"Polling is a snapshot in time — a Tuesday at 11 when you got the phone call or you were at the focus group, this is how you felt, but then you went home and your views changed. We can watch that,\" Brandon said.    They're using AI to understand core issues and concerns of voters and to hunt for districts ripe for an independent candidate to swoop in.   \"A district that's 50% Republican and 50% Democratic that keeps flip-flopping because of who showed up on a given night, is that something that is truly independent versus a district in Arizona where a plurality is independent but they're plugging their nose and voting?\" Loyd explained. \"We're looking at voter participation rates. What districts have really low turnout because those people aren't excited to go to the ballot box.\"   He's also looking at districts with younger voters, who he said embrace the independent message.    \"When I say Gen Z and millennials, people keep rolling their eyes and they're like, 'the kids,'\" he said. \"Well, those kids are going to be more than half the electorate in the next presidential election.\"   From there, the next step is taking the data and finding what the dream candidate looks like.   The Independent Center is recruiting candidates both from people who reach out to the organization directly and with the help of AI.    They can even run their data through LinkedIn to identify potential candidates with certain interests and career and volunteer history.   \"Usually they're not self-promoting, but their actions leave a footprint,\" Loyd said, giving the example of someone volunteering at an event covered by the local paper. \"We ask our AI to find that footprint.\"   \n   The AI also informs where a candidate is best placed to win.   Brandon points to one instance where a candidate was poised to run in their home district. The AI showed the district next door is a better bet.    \"Thirty minutes way, perfect fit,\" he said. \"And that's what [that person's] going to do, because we found they matched up perfectly.\"   \"What's wrong with spoiling something people don't like?\"   One criticism Brandon and Loyd acknowledge they hear often is the idea of \"spoilers\" — nonwinning candidates whose presence on the ballot affects which candidate wins.   \"It's a partisan, archaic line,\" Loyd said. \"What's wrong with spoiling something people don't like?\"   He said the people criticizing independents getting into races as spoilers have an entrenched interest in the current system.   \"The Republican and Democratic establishments still live in a world that's binary. It's Coke or Pepsi, it's Ford or Chevy, it's MSNBC or Fox News,\" he said. \"That works for people that watch MSNBC and Fox News. Everybody else? We don't live in that binary system anymore.\"   Brandon said the only thing to do is lean in.   \"We're going to embrace the spoiler because what we're spoiling is a pretty corrupt system.\"\n",

Now, lawmakers may be put to a vote on the issue.   \n\n\n    A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  The Indiana House of Representatives will hold a session today to talk about redrawing the state's congressional map. President Trump has been pushing Republican-led states to do that in order to help his party win seats in next year's election. California Democrats countered with their own map. Ben Thorp of member station WFYI in Indianapolis is following this. Ben, there has been some suspense about whether lawmakers would actually take this up, and now they will. So what's expected to happen?BEN THORP, BYLINE: Yeah, so keep in mind both chambers of the legislature are controlled by Republicans. Today, the state House is expected to meet and talk about what these new congressional maps might look like. The Senate has been more divided and could meet next week, and we'll see whether they pass a new map. Republicans behind the push, such as state Senator Mike Young, say they want to ensure that their party won't lose the U.S. House after next year.MIKE YOUNG: I don't want to cry on Wednesday morning, following that election, knowing that we could've done something and we didn't.THORP: Right now, Indiana is represented in the U.S. House by seven Republicans and two Democrats. Some Republicans want to see that be 9-0 even though there are plenty of Democratic voters in the state. About 4 in 10 Indiana voters backed Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.MARTÍNEZ: What's been happening the last couple of months to get to this point?THORP: Well, for months, the Trump administration has really put pressure on Indiana lawmakers to be part of this nationwide redistricting push. Vice President Vance visited the state a few times, and several lawmakers went to the White House. But some Republican senators, like Spencer Deery, say they don't want to see gerrymandering normalized.SPENCER DEERY: I think that this is ultimately something that could harm the conservative movement. It could harm just the functioning of our constitutional republic.THORP: On the other hand, Republican Governor Mike Braun has been for redistricting and said lawmakers should come in today and talk about that among some other issues.MARTÍNEZ: Oh, yeah, there have been some threats - right? - both political and personal to Indiana lawmakers.THORP: Yeah, senators initially voted in November not to come back and take this issue up. And around then, both Governor Braun and President Trump threatened in statements on social media to support primary challenges against any senators who don't support redistricting. Lawmakers also say they have faced anonymous threats, including bomb threats to their families, although the motives aren't clear. And several reported being victims of swatting attempts, with law enforcement called to their homes under false reports of domestic violence.MARTÍNEZ: Now, in Indiana, this isn't something that they'd have to present to voters, as they had to do in California. But any sense of how Indiana voters feel about this?THORP: Well, polling has consistently shown that while there is some Republican support for redistricting, there might be more Hoosiers who are against it. Some senators I spoke to said it really feels like the pressure to redistrict years before it would normally happen isn't coming from constituents, it's coming from Washington. And again, there is pressure from the national level around the country to redistrict. Democrats in California have done it. Any seat could make the difference in who controls the House next.MARTÍNEZ: All right, that's Ben Thorp with WFYI in Indianapolis. Ben, thanks a lot for your reporting on this.THORP: Thank you so much.(SOUNDBITE OF DIRTY THREE'S \"IN FALL\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      President Trump says he's closing Venezuela's airspace and further limiting immigration to the U.S. Lawmakers are facing a deadline over extending the subsidies for Obamacare.   \n\n    LAUREN FRAYER, HOST:  President Donald Trump heads back to Washington after spending Thanksgiving at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. He's been posting about Afghan nationals and immigration following the attack last week on two National Guard members near the White House. It was an attack that fatally wounded one of them. Additionally, Trump has said that Venezuela's airspace is closed. NPR White House correspondent Deepa Shivaram joins us now. Good morning, Deepa.DEEPA SHIVARAM, BYLINE: Hey there.FRAYER: So first, a fact-check - can the U.S. president close another country's airspace?SHIVARAM: Yeah. I mean, it's a fair question, Lauren, because we don't really have a lot of details or follow-up from the White House about this social media post from Trump that came over the weekend. And all the president said is that the airspace, quote, \"above and surrounding Venezuela,\" should be considered \"closed in its entirety.\" And his post was addressed to airlines, pilots, drug dealers and human traffickers. And that's pretty much all we've heard, no other details or any clarification. Is this new policy? You know, what did the president mean by this?The bottom line, though, is that the president does not have the authority to close another country's airspace. Though I will note that recently, the FAA, which is the Federal Aviation Administration - they did warn that airspace over Venezuela could potentially be hazardous, but that doesn't mean that the airspace is closed.FRAYER: Well, how has Venezuela responded?SHIVARAM: Yeah. The Venezuelan government, you know, said it forcefully rejects the president's statement. They called it a colonial threat that undermines Venezuela's sovereignty. Really no mincing words there - and, you know, keep in mind - this is what's important - this is all coming as the U.S. has conducted multiple strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea, the Eastern Pacific, on these boats that the U.S. government says are carrying drugs, and dozens of people have been killed in these strikes.And then on top of that, Trump has also recently indicated that the U.S. would stop drug traffickers by land as well. And he recently declared the government of Nicolas Maduro, who leads Venezuela, as a terrorist organization. So the tension on this issue has really escalated here.FRAYER: Deepa, switching gears - Trump said that he was requesting 500 more National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., following that shooting last week. Is that happening?SHIVARAM: Right. So the president announced he was going to add 500 more National Guard troops, like you said, to D.C. This happened shortly after the attack on guard members outside the White House - nearby the White House earlier this week. That plan appears to remain in place. Those 500 new guard members will join about the 2,000 guard members who are already in the city.And there is a new development, though, from the weekend, which is that the government has also declared that every group of National Guard members patrolling Washington, D.C, will also be accompanied by at least one D.C. police officer. The details of this - a little unclear. But a police officer who spoke to NPR on the condition of anonymity said that D.C. police officers would be getting overtime pay to do this work, so it's not interfering with their already day-to-day duties.FRAYER: And the suspect accused of shooting those two National Guard members is an Afghan national, according to authorities. He lived in Washington state. And now the president says he wants more restrictions on immigrants because of this shooting. What exactly does President Trump want to do?SHIVARAM: Yeah. Well, the president, you know, posted on social media on his platform Truth Social, and he said that he wants to, quote, \"permanently pause migration from all third-world countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover.\" He commented that reverse migration is the answer here. In the immediate aftermath of that shooting, you know, Trump said that he wanted every Afghan who entered to the U.S. after U.S. troops pulled out of Kabul in 2021 - he wanted them to be reexamined. And remember, this happened in the Biden administration, so he's laying a lot of blame on former President Joe Biden.There really isn't much detail about what that means - the timeline of this, who would be in charge. There's already a lot of security, stringent examination of people who are coming into this country. They are being vetted, but all asylum decisions just in the last day or two have been halted to ensure more vetting and screening, and that's what the president is hoping for.FRAYER: And the president and lawmakers come back this week to another pressing problem that has yet to be resolved, and that's the extension of the enhanced subsidies for Obamacare. What's the latest on that?SHIVARAM: Yeah. Remember that this was the issue that really propelled the government to shut down just a month ago. Right now, Congress is pretty divided on how to do it. There's even some division among GOP members. I think the thing to watch out for, though, is to see how the White House and President Trump will weigh in on this because Republicans, like I said, aren't really on the same page here.FRAYER: That's NPR's White House correspondent, Deepa Shivaram. Thanks so much, Deepa.SHIVARAM: Thanks.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      A recent NPR/PBS News/Marist poll found nearly 6-in-10 voters say President Trump's top priority should be lowering prices. That concern is being expressed loudly in the swing state of Wisconsin.   \n\n    LAUREN FRAYER, HOST:  Affordability. That's a word we will hear a lot of for the next 12 months. It's what voters say is a top concern, and it could be consequential in the swing state of Wisconsin. Reporters Chuck Quirmbach and Maayan Silver with member station WUWM join us now from Milwaukee. Welcome to the program.MAAYAN SILVER, BYLINE: Thank you.CHUCK QUIRMBACH, BYLINE: Thank you.FRAYER: So what are you both hearing from voters?SILVER: How cost of living are affecting people? I stopped by a turkey giveaway where people talked about struggling with basic needs and really what they want politicians to do about it.QUIRMBACH: Yeah. And I've been talking with folks about the Affordable Care Act and the expectation here that for hundreds of thousands of people covered under this Obama-era law, health care will be less affordable next year.FRAYER: And, Chuck, you've been following some of the events that Democrats are already holding around the state about health care affordability. What are they focusing on?QUIRMBACH: Well, the prediction that premiums are going up in January and that subsidies, including a federal tax credit that the state of Wisconsin says saves the average Care Act enrollee about $650 per month, may expire at the end of December. About 275,000 people here could be affected. One of them, freelance writer Nancy Peske, spoke at a news conference held by Wisconsin Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin. Peske says she may also have to pay additional costs for her son, who just landed a job with no health coverage.NANCY PESKE: So he's going to have such an astronomical premium that I'm probably going to have to pay that, too. So, yeah, it's going to be very tight.FRAYER: That's one concern. There's also the cost of living in general. Maayan, what are you hearing from some of the people you spoke with at this food giveaway that you mentioned?SILVER: Yeah. There were plenty of people in line at the turkey giveaway who directly blamed Trump for rising costs, who said they'd be voting for Democrats. But I also found some people who said they didn't foresee voting. I talked to Sharol Britton (ph). She's a 57-year-old who's been struggling financially. She gets food stamps, is on supplemental security income. And these days, she's sleeping in a van. She used to vote for Democrats, but now says she's fed up with all politicians.SHAROL BRITTON: The Trump administration, Democrat, Republican, liberal, right wing, left wing, back wing, horizontal wing, I don't give a freak. Get your stuff together, period.SILVER: Britton doesn't plan to vote until, in her opinion, politicians stop focusing on the 1% and start thinking more about people like her.FRAYER: And if voters like her stay home, that could really matter for congressional races. Chuck, tell us about some of those.QUIRMBACH: Well, the GOP has a 6-2 majority in House seats here, with Democrats hoping next year to unseat Republican Derrick Van Orden in western Wisconsin and Bryan Steil in the district south of Milwaukee. Also Republican House member Tom Tiffany from northern Wisconsin is running for governor. It's an open seat as Democratic incumbent Tony Evers is retiring. Van Orden, Steil and Tiffany have all criticized the ACA, or Affordable Care Act. The hazard in doing so is that, according to a recent polling by Marquette University, 58% of Wisconsin voters back extending the Care Act subsidies. But the polling also says the GOP Congress members' stance seems to be in line with the views of the majority of Republican voters here. Brian Norby runs an engineering firm and is chairman of the Jefferson County Republican Party west of Milwaukee. Norby says the ACA's enhanced tax credits are a political football.BRIAN NORBY: Now they're essentially being used as a political tool to heighten up the Democratic base to come out and vote. So why should we continue to extend them when they're designed by the Democratic Party?FRAYER: OK. So President Trump won Wisconsin by just under 30,000 votes in large part because of these pocketbook issues. And now, one year later, NPR polling shows that nearly 6 in 10 Americans say the Trump administration should focus on lowering prices. Maya, what are you hearing from Trump voters about this?SILVER: So sometimes voters I talked to said that economic woes, for instance, the effect of the government shutdown, were exaggerated. Others told me their budgets are tight sometimes, but they generally gave a lot of grace to Trump and his administration. That includes Aaron Eckhart (ph). He's the president of a home building company. He's also a Republican who voted for Trump. And he says of the economy...AARON ECKHART: So I think it's turning around.SILVER: So you think that President Trump is delivering on the promises that he made to make life more affordable?ECKHART: Correct. Promises made, promises kept.SILVER: Other Republicans I spoke with say that Trump had only been in office this term for a year and that he could still right the ship.FRAYER: So is affordability going to stay a strong issue in Wisconsin for the next, you know, 11 months until the election? Chuck.QUIRMBACH: Well, it might depend on what, if anything, the White House and Congressional Republicans come up with on the Affordable Care Act. Senate Republicans have promised to vote on extending the subsidies by next month. Wisconsin Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin says she's willing to work with, quote, any Johnny-come-lately to help families avoid higher costs come January 1.SILVER: And when it comes to higher costs overall, I'd say that Wisconsin is really a tale of two states, urban and rural, red and blue. And while voters around the state are concerned with prices, some really have unique concerns. There's manufacturers around the state grappling with tariffs. There's Wisconsin's big agricultural center. It's the dairy state that everyone knows about, but it also has a sizable soybean, corn, ginseng crops. So it's also the number one cranberry-producing state in the country, which is really relevant for this time of year. These farmers and rural voters have long been loyal backers of President Trump. But in part because of tariffs, Democrats are really trying to make inroads there.FRAYER: That's Maayan Silver and Chuck Quirmbach of NPR member station WUWM in Milwaukee. Thank you.MAAYAN SILVER AND CHUCK QUIRMBACH: Thank you.(SOUNDBITE OF JOAN SHELLEY SONG, \"OVER AND EVEN\")\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A 'We Accept Food Stamps' sign hangs in the window of a grocery store on Oct. 31 in Miami. The Trump administration is targeting the food stamp program, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), for major changes, citing data about the program it has demanded from the states that administer the program.\n                \n                    Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins is promising big changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which currently helps almost 42 million Americans buy groceries.   In recent media appearances, she said attention on SNAP during the government shutdown \"has given us a platform to completely deconstruct the program\" and said details about structural changes to the program would be released this week.   \n   Rollins has made a case for sweeping changes to SNAP by asserting her agency uncovered \"massive fraud\" in state data the agency demanded, and has emphasized statistics suggesting wrongdoing without providing the underlying data or details.   \n   The Trump administration's latest campaign for SNAP changes comes as millions of recipients are already poised to lose benefits in the coming years as states begin to implement new work requirements and eligibility rules that Republicans in Congress passed over the summer that are the deepest cuts in history to the program.   In a Fox Business interview last month, Rollins said the further changes she is proposing will \"make sure those vulnerable Americans who really need that benefit are going to get it. And for all the rest of the fraudsters and the people who are corrupt and taking advantage of it — we're going to protect the taxpayer, too.\"   Food policy experts say they are concerned that Rollins' talking points suggest a distorted view of the prevalence of SNAP recipients committing fraud, and seem to conflate fraud with payment errors of any kind.   \"My worry is that she's risking setting a public narrative that this is a program that has more fraud than it actually does, or that the people who need it and use it to meet their very basic food needs are somehow committing a crime by seeking food assistance,\" said Stacy Dean, executive director of George Washington University's Global Food Institute and a former U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) official during the Biden administration.   \n   \"And that's just it's not it's not good for the program. It's absolutely terrible for the people who need it,\" Dean said.   Comments Rollins made in recent weeks that everyone on SNAP would have to reapply sparked confusion among SNAP recipients, state officials and food policy experts. SNAP recipients already have to go through a recertification process — in most cases every six or 12 months, and it is unclear what legal authority USDA would have to add additional steps.   A group of Democratic U.S. senators sent a letter last month asking Rollins to clarify what she meant and pointed out that SNAP is facing \"unprecedented cuts\" and there is additional uncertainty after the Trump administration halted SNAP payments during the shutdown.   \"We are therefore troubled that the Administration could choose, at this moment, to add additional red tape that creates duplicative and unnecessary barriers to accessing nutrition assistance for families,\" the letter reads.   USDA officials are seemingly walking back the suggestion that there will be a new reapplication process for SNAP recipients. A statement from the agency indicates that it plans to use existing recertification protocols.   \"Secretary Rollins wants to ensure the fraud, waste, and incessant abuse of SNAP ends. Rates of fraud were only previously assumed, and President Trump is doing something about it,\" reads a statement from a USDA spokesperson. \"Using standard recertification processes for households is a part of that work. As well as ongoing analysis of state data, further regulatory work, and improved collaboration with states.\"   Unpacking Rollins' claims   Earlier this year, the USDA made an unprecedented demand to states to turn over personal data of SNAP recipients. Most Democratic-led states refused, and a federal judge in San Francisco blocked USDA from withholding funding from states that did not comply and found the federal agency's data demand was likely unlawful.   \n   But 28 states and Guam did turn over data, according to a USDA spokesperson, and Rollins has been citing statistics from that data in several media appearances in recent weeks as evidence that the food assistance program needs to be overhauled.   In a recent News Nation interview, Rollins said the state data showed that \"186,000 dead people receiving benefits, 500,000 Americans receiving benefits two times, so double what they should be receiving. We've arrested more than 120 people with SNAP fraud,\" Rollins said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins points to a chart on SNAP benefits during a news conference on Capitol Hill on Oct. 31 in Washington, D.C.\n                \n                    Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   \"And that doesn't include most of the blue states where we believe there's even more fraud and abuse. And under the last administration, the SNAP benefits increased 40%. So clearly, there's a right-sizing that needs to happen.\"   \n   The USDA has not presented data that backs up these statistics, which makes it hard to evaluate their significance.   For example, some deceased individuals will inevitably be enrolled in the program because state officials have to verify the death and provide time for the household to respond before SNAP benefits are reduced or terminated. Households that erroneously receive payments when someone is deceased must pay that money back.   As for people receiving two benefit payments, the specifics of the cases Rollins cited are still unknown, but in court filings a California state official listed a number of legitimate explanations for why that can occur — including when a SNAP household is owed a supplemental payment to correct an error.   It is also unclear what Rollins means when she says SNAP benefits increased 40% under the Biden administration. USDA did not respond to a question seeking clarification.   The department announced that SNAP payments would expand 40% due to the pandemic in April 2020 — during President Trump's first term.   Lauren Bauer, a fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution and the associate director of The Hamilton Project, analyzed USDA data but was unable to find evidence of a 40% increase under Biden. Instead, she found that during Trump's presidency benefit costs increased by more than 30%, while during Biden's term they decreased by almost 17%.   \"The dynamics of benefit increases and decreases is not really about presidencies. It's about the business cycle and where we are in terms of a recession and in terms of the climb out of it,\" Bauer said.   More SNAP changes to come   A draft of a regulation that the USDA submitted to the Office of Management and Budget last month could provide a clue for one of the changes to SNAP the Trump administration could unveil soon.   The draft calls for narrowing what is known as \"broad-based categorical eligibility\" for SNAP, which is currently used by more than 40 states to ensure welfare recipients can receive SNAP.   \n   Researchers at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute have argued this eligibility rule should be ended because states are using it to allow people with incomes above the limit set by the SNAP statute to receive the benefit. Though they also cautioned that eliminating broad-based categorical eligibility must be done in a way that addresses \"benefit cliffs\" that would disincentivize people from earning slightly more because they would lose benefits and become worse off.   Katie Bergh, a senior policy analyst at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who has criticized the potential change, estimates a policy change like this could lead to nearly 6 million people losing SNAP benefits.   \"At every opportunity, the administration is seeking additional ways to attack anti-hunger programs,\" Bergh said.\n",

The tours were on a three-month hiatus because of President Trump's decision to build an estimated $300 million ballroom, which resulted in the East Wing's removal.   Images of the demolition sparked controversy and outrage with some suggesting the excavators tearing into the East Wing were a metaphor for Trump's approach to the government since returning to office. Polling indicates a majority of Americans oppose the project.   In past years, White House tours began in the East Wing, which dazzled with decorations during the holidays, transporting visitors to a winter wonderland.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Christmas trees line the Grand Foyer of the White House.\n                \n                    Michael Zamora/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Michael Zamora/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   On Monday morning, journalists got a first look at the new, truncated tour and a preview of decorations the White House says were \"personally selected by Mrs. Trump to honor the heart of America.\"   \n   There are 75 wreaths with red bows, 51 Christmas trees, more than 700 feet of garland, more than 2,000 strands of light, more than 25,000 feet of ribbon and 2,800 gold stars, according to the White House.   \n   First lady Melania Trump and her team had far less real estate to work with as they mapped out her \"Home Is Where The Heart Is\" themed decorations. Tours now start and finish in the North Portico of the White House and include stops in the East Room, Blue Room, Green Room, Red Room and State Dining Room. The East Wing and basement rooms such as the Map Room that had previously been decorated are no longer part of the public tour route. A semi-permanent structure has been erected on the North Lawn for security screening of guests.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                An ornament from each state hangs on the White house Christmas tree in the Blue Room Monday.\n                \n                    Michael Zamora/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Michael Zamora/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   The official White House Christmas Tree is the focal point of the Blue Room. Measuring 18-feet tall, it is adorned with gold stars and white globe ornaments featuring all 56 U.S. states and territories. The ornaments were 3D printed with AI assisting in designs that feature the state bird and state flower from each. The tree was decorated by Gold Star families, who lost a loved one as a result of active-duty military service.   \n   \"Home is made safe because of the Gold Star families who sacrificed for our country, wherever they might call home across the world,\" said Nicholas Clemens, the communications director for the first lady and an unofficial tour guide for the media preview.   The Green Room \"celebrates family fun\" according to a White House description of the decorations, and features large Lego portraits of President George Washington and Trump. Each portrait contains 6,000 Lego bricks.   \"They were put together by volunteers,\" said Clemens. He described a scene straight out of the movies as dozens of volunteer decorators from all over the country climbed ladders, carried boxes of garland and tied many bows to get the halls decked and ready for the return of public tours.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Trees line the Grand Foyer inside the White House.\n                \n                    Michael Zamora/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Michael Zamora/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   The Red Room features more than 10,000 blue butterflies meant to celebrate young people \"including youth who've experienced foster care, who are still figuring out where home is and what that might mean,\" said Clemens. In addition to the butterflies, ornaments on the Christmas tree say \"Be Best\" and a ribbon threading through the branches reads \"Fostering the Future,\" two of the first lady's initiatives.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Butterflies spiral out of a tree in the Red Room.\n                \n                    Michael Zamora/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Michael Zamora/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   The East Room is decorated to mark America's 250th anniversary, which comes next year and according to the White House, showcases \"the patriotic colors of our flag and some of our national symbols.\"   A large golden curtain covers what Trump has described as a \"knock out wall,\" that will lead to the massive ballroom he plans to build where the East Wing once stood. \"It looks pretty nice right now, but it's going to look a lot better in a little while,\" Trump said last month.   \n   As always, the highlight of the State Dining Room is the gingerbread White House. This one depicts the White House as viewed from the South Lawn with a giant American flag made of sugar, mirroring the new and massive flag poles added by Trump earlier this year. The second floor of the gingerbread South Portico is open so viewers can get a glimpse of the Yellow Oval, a room in the private residence where first families gather.   \"You'll be able to peer in and see the current design of the ... Yellow Oval as it currently is designed for the Trumps,\" said Clemens. \"So you'll get a real-time glimpse into what it looks like.\"   \n   A program for the tour lays out the confectionary feat by the numbers. The gingerbread White House contains 120 pounds of gingerbread dough, 100 pounds of pastillage dough, 10 pounds of chocolate and 5 pounds of royal icing. Other than a few small lights \"everything else is made of something that you can eat,\" said Clemens.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A gingerbread White House is displayed in the State Dining Room.\n                \n                    Michael Zamora/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Michael Zamora/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Asked about the smaller footprint of the tour this year and Trump's renovations, Clemens declined to comment.   While the East Room demolition is the highest-profile project since Trump returned to office, the president has been on a remodeling spree, making changes to the White House at a frenetic pace. The Rose Garden has been transformed into a patio surrounded by flowers that is modeled after an outdoor space at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. The Oval Office is now gilded from floor to ceiling. And the Lincoln bathroom in the residence also got a major makeover featuring a whole lot of marble.   Tour tickets can be requested through members of Congress, who get an allotment for their constituents.\n",

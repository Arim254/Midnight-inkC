Historically, Tennessee's 7th Congressional District is a fairly conservative district that gave President Trump roughly 60% of the vote last November. Former Rep. Mark Green, who resigned in July, won by a similar margin.    But in more recent history, Democrats have overperformed their 2024 margins in special elections this year by an average of 13% and are coming off a string of high-profile victories in races up and down the ballot last month.   \n   That dynamic means the race between Republican former state Department of General Services Commissioner Matt Van Epps and Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn has captured national attention in the closing weeks of the campaign.    In final stretch, outside money floods race    According to the latest Federal Election Commission data, outside groups have spent more than $6.5 million on the race, including more than $1.6 million from the pro-Trump MAGA Inc. super PAC. Two-thirds of the total super PAC spending has come in the last two weeks of the race as early voting picked up in earnest.    Scant public polling of a typically lower-turnout special election coupled with a less reliable sense of who will make up the electorate has also added pressure on both parties to squeeze out every vote in what could be a tight race.    An Emerson College poll released last week found Van Epps slightly ahead of Behn but within the margin of error among voters surveyed. Surveys released in October from Democratic-aligned firms showed Van Epps with an 8-point advantage, roughly in line with the average Democratic special election overperformance this year.   \n   Campaigns focus on cost of living   The closing sprint of the race has seen a slew of surrogates make campaign stops and virtual appearances to support the candidates. Former Vice President Kamala Harris and Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin attended canvassing events for Behn last month, while former Vice President Al Gore and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez headlined a Zoom rally Monday evening.    House Speaker Mike Johnson held a get-out-the-vote rally Monday morning for Van Epps that featured Trump calling on speakerphone to proclaim that the \"whole world is watching Tennessee right now.\"    \n   Both parties are making affordability a top issue in the race, especially on the airways. Van Epps has embraced Trump's endorsement while also focusing his closing message on the economy.    In one ad, Van Epps decried \"career politicians\" and promised to \"bring down prices, create good paying jobs, and lower health care costs for working families.\"   Behn's closing ad promised that she would \"shake up Washington\" by \"making health care more affordable, bringing down the cost of living, and protect workers and small businesses from job-killing tariffs.\"   During a Monday evening telephone rally for Van Epps, Trump dismissed affordability as something Democrats mentioned to distract from what he said are his administration's numerous accomplishments.    \"They like to talk about affordability,\" Trump said in the Monday evening tele-rally for Van Epps. \"To them it's just a con job, it's just a word.\"\n",

Behind the scenes, Fox News' controlling owners, executives and biggest stars didn't believe the wild claims from President Trump and his allies. Nonetheless, the voting tech company's officials received death threats. Its reputation and financial prospects were badly damaged.   These claims are contained in legal filings at the heart of a hearing that will take place in a Manhattan courtroom Tuesday afternoon over whether a multi-billion dollar defamation lawsuit against Fox News should be allowed to proceed to a full jury trial.   \n   The lawsuit is being brought by Smartmatic, a London-based voting technology firm that played a limited role in the 2020 race but was, nonetheless, accused on Fox shows of taking votes away from Trump and throwing them to Biden. Smartmatic is suing for $2.7 billion.   The reason these allegations are so familiar is that the company's claims closely echo those from a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems. Fox News stars and their on-air guests also blamed that company for Trump's loss, as they served up a stew of baseless conspiracy theories about the election.   In both the Dominion and Smartmatic suits, Fox's top hosts and executives were revealed to have desperately sought to appease the network's pro-Trump viewers. Viewers peeled away from Fox in droves after it became the first major U.S network to project that Biden would prevail in the key state of Arizona on election night in 2020. Trump attacked Fox and encouraged his fans to tune into right-wing alternatives like Newsmax and OANN instead.   In 2023, a Delaware judge found that Fox had defamed Dominion ahead of the trial. On the eve of the trial – and founder Rupert Murdoch's scheduled public testimony – Fox paid $787.5 million to resolve the case. The sum is considered to be a record in U.S. media litigation.   \n   The network made no admission of error but released this statement: \"We acknowledge the Court's rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false.\"   Neither Smartmatic nor Fox would comment for this story. Smartmatic sued Fox News in February 2021, before Dominion did, but the Dominion case moved briskly through Delaware's streamlined trial system. Smartmatic named several co-defendants, including such stars as the late Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo and Jeanine Pirro, along with Trump's legal advisers Rudolph Giuliani and Sidney Powell, who were frequent guests.   In past remarks, Fox has pointed to what it says are clear distinctions between the two defamation cases: different jurisdictions, different judges, and different plaintiffs.   \"The evidence shows that Smartmatic's business and reputation were badly suffering long before any claims by President Trump's lawyers on Fox News and that Smartmatic grossly inflated its damage claims to generate headlines and chill free speech,\" Fox News said in a statement released through a spokesperson. \"We are eager and ready to continue defending our press freedoms.\"   As in the Dominion case, Fox has argued its hosts were engaging in legitimate coverage of newsworthy claims by newsworthy figures - the president and his legal advisers - and those claims had not yet worked its way through various legal proceedings. Trump's campaign and his allies lost almost every legal and procedural challenge they filed to the election results.   In its court documents, Fox has also directed much of its legal energies to disputing Smartmatic's claims about the voting technology company's financial health, prospects and damages. And the network's legal filings have questioned the firm's stated origins and its actions abroad.   In October, federal prosecutors charged Smartmatic in a scheme to pay more than $1 million in bribes to a Philippine government official for contracts related to the 2016 national elections there. Company officials denied the allegations, contending the charges were \"targeted, political and unjust.\"   \n   New York State Supreme Court Justice David B. Cohen rejected Fox's request to put a hold on the litigation until after those criminal charges were fully tried.   Smartmatic was operating in just one jurisdiction in the U.S. during the 2020 elections: Los Angeles County, which was all but guaranteed to swing toward Biden in a heavily Democratic state. The company says it was on the brink of making big gains in the U.S. and abroad after the elections - only to have those business aspirations dashed by the way in which Fox stars amplified wild and unfounded claims from Trump allies.   Fox never retracted the claims. After Smartmatic threatened to sue, Fox aired an unusual segment featuring Eddie Perez, an outside voting technology and integrity expert. Perez was questioned by an off-camera producer. Perez shot down one allegation after another about Smartmatic. Fox broadcast it on the shows hosted by Bartiromo, Dobbs, and Pirro.   Perez told NPR he did not consider the segment a correction, but he said he was glad to offer Fox viewers accurate information after it so frequently ran what he considered election disinformation.   Evidence submitted in court filings suggests that, inside Fox, few believed the wild claims made on the air. Senior Fox executives and even its stars made clear privately they knew that Trump had lost, according to testimony and exchanges presented in the public record. The filings also reflect the way in which Fox stars saw their interests aligning with the interests of the Republican Party under Trump, even when they did not always agree with what he was saying.   Host Jesse Watters texted Fox News comic host Greg Gutfeld, \"Think about how incredible our ratings would be if Fox went ALL in on STOP THE STEAL,\" according to legal filings. Watters later testified under oath he never found such claims credible.   \n   In court documents, Pirro was revealed to have lobbied then-Republican National Committee Chairperson Ronna McDaniel weeks ahead of the election to purchase copies of her book in bulk, as the RNC had done for Fox's Sean Hannity.   \"I'm the Number 1 watched show on all news cable all weekend,\" Pirro texted, according to court records. \"I work so hard for the President and party.\" McDaniel demurred. (The exchange was first reported by the Guardian.)   Once Trump refused to accept the results of the election, Pirro - a former prosecutor - was among those who repeatedly amplified the false claims of fraud. She later testified that she did not think Trump was cheated of victory. Pirro is now the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia.   \"Fox executives and its personalities have consistently lied to their viewers,\" a spokesperson for Smartmatic said in a statement to NPR earlier this fall. \"They knew what they were saying was untrue when they were willingly destroying Smartmatic's reputation, though when under oath they admitted they knew better the whole time.\"   According to its court filings, Smartmatic's legal teams also unearthed a Fox News workplace survey from summer 2020 - as Trump ran for re-election - in which numerous staffers complained about the network's bias.   \"We need a recalibration of our standards of conduct for our [on-air] talent, as well as the truthfulness of our reporting,\" one Fox employee wrote. \"It often feels like our editorial view and specifically our on-air talent has changed to just working for the current administration and will say anything that will be flattering to them. It seems like there's a fear that we cannot anger the president or his most zealous supporters, and have abdicated all pretense of truthful reporting; often allowing guests to say lies unchallenged, or saying false information ourselves to the detriment of our reputation.\"   \n   Other colleagues complained about cheerleading by Fox personalities and objected to multiple on-air stars \"covertly advising\" the president.   In court documents, Fox's attorneys called the remarks incomplete and said they represented a cherrypicked handful of negative remarks. Fox noted it was designated a \"Great Place to Work\" by the organization conducting the workplace survey.   The day after Smartmatic sued Fox, the Fox Business Network canceled Dobbs' show. Dobbs was never seen on Fox airwaves again. He died in July 2024.   Fox has a record of playing hardball but ultimately settling cases close to trial, as it did – albeit very late in the game – in the Dominion case. (The Murdochs did much the same before settling with Prince Harry and a prominent British politician in January in a case involving their U.K. newspapers.) The company, so far, is maintaining a similar stance publicly in this case, gambling that Smartmatic's own shortcomings will help forestall the need for a similar outcome.\n",

Lakanwal, an Afghan national, is accused of shooting two National Guard soldiers on Nov. 26. One of those soldiers, 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom, died from her wounds. On Monday, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey described the other guard member, 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe, as in \"serious\" condition.   \"My biggest concern was that [Lakanwal] would harm himself,\" the refugee resettlement volunteer told NPR. \"I worried he would be suicidal because he was so withdrawn.\"     \n   The volunteer spoke with NPR on condition of anonymity because they said they feared for their safety, as well as the safety of others in their volunteer community, because of possible retaliation for having worked with Afghan refugees, including the Lakanwals.   They said when they first met Lakanwal in 2022 at his home in Bellingham, Wash., he appeared hopeful and outgoing. \"He was outside with his kids, laughing and playing and having animated conversations with other Afghan men,\" they said.   Lakanwal held jobs for brief periods and hosted gatherings at his home, the volunteer said, but by 2023 he began isolating himself and appeared \"defeated\" by the challenges of finding steady work and adapting to life in the United States.   The volunteer shared with NPR emails sent in January 2024 that raised alarms about Lakanwal's well-being. The Associated Press first reported about the contents of the emails on Saturday.   \"He spends most of his time in his darkened bedroom, not speaking to anyone, not even his wife and older kids,\" one email said. \"I personally believe that [Mr. Lakanwal] is suffering from both PTSD and from his work with the US military in Afghanistan,\" the volunteer wrote, adding that they are \"not a healthcare professional.\"   \n   Speaking on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said U.S. officials believe Lakanwal was \"radicalized\" while living in the United States.   \"We do believe it was through connections in his home community and state, and we're going to continue to talk to those who interacted with him,\" Noem said.   But the volunteer who worked with Lakanwal and other Afghan refugees in Washington state told NPR they saw no sign of radicalization. Instead they described an individual who seemed to be experiencing a deepening personal crisis, complicated by Lakanwal's poor English-language skills and deepening cultural isolation. The volunteer said there were no organized resources for refugees beyond their initial welcome.   \"Families were just in my mind abandoned into the community,\" the volunteer said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                This photo provided by the U.S. Attorney's Office on Nov. 27 shows Rahmanullah Lakanwal.\n                \n                    AP/U.S. Attorney’s Office\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        AP/U.S. Attorney’s Office\n    \n\n   \n   Before coming to the U.S. in 2021, Lakanwal served in one of Afghanistan's elite counterterrorism units, according to AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that supports Afghan refugees and is run by U.S. veterans and others who served in Afghanistan. Lakanwal's unit was operated by the CIA with direct U.S. intelligence and military support, according to AfghanEvac, and fought the Taliban on behalf of the U.S. government.   CIA Director John Ratcliffe said in a statement last week that the shooter involved in the attack was admitted into the U.S. \"due to his prior work with the U.S. Government, including CIA.\"   The volunteer told NPR they had no detailed knowledge of Lakanwal's military duties and never observed him expressing hostility toward the United States. They said his increasingly erratic behavior never suggested any kind of threat or danger.   \"I was so shocked that this happened. I asked myself, 'Were there warning signs?' No,\" the volunteer said.   While the volunteer couldn't provide insight into Lakanwal's possible motive for the alleged attack, they were aware of him making long drives like the one that took him to Washington, D.C., last week. Beginning in 2023, Lakanwal would disappear for weeks at a time in the family car, roaming as far as Arizona and Illinois.   \n   \"He drives day and night and sends map pins to one of the volunteer sponsors and we can grab photos from Instagram stories, but no other communication. His family generally does not know where he is or when he will be back,\" said one of the volunteer group emails written in January 2024.   Emails shared with NPR also indicate volunteers in Washington state attempted to reach out to professional refugee aid groups, including World Relief and the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI), hoping to find help for Lakanwal's deteriorating mental state, but they got limited response.   \"A group of concerned individuals [volunteering on refugee resettlement] in the Seattle area had a meeting in January 2024 to talk about dwindling resources for these families, and frustration was expressed,\" the volunteer told NPR.   NPR reached out to World Relief and USCRI for comment. USCRI didn't respond. World Relief sent a statement declining to say whether the organization had any involvement in Lakanwal's resettlement in the United States.   \"We cannot confirm whether or not we have served any specific client without permission from our federal government partners who administered the process for bringing Afghans to the United States beginning in 2021,\" the World Relief statement said.   The group added that it \"provided services to those [refugees] assigned to us by our governmental partners\" and said it is supporting law enforcement in the investigation of Lakanwal's case.   Following last week's violence, the Trump administration moved to freeze refugee cases involving Afghan nationals and launched a review of refugees and migrants from more than a dozen countries living legally inside the United States. Activists working with asylum-seekers from Afghanistan told NPR they view Lakanwal's alleged violence as an isolated case.   \"You can't paint with a broad brush this entire community. The vast majority of Afghans who have come here are just good upstanding citizens,\" said Shawn VanDiver, a Navy veteran who heads the group AfghanEvac.\n",

    "body": "\n      Amid reports Pete Hegseth ordered a second strike on a Venezuelan boat, NPR's Mary Louise Kelly speaks with Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine about how Congress is handling oversight of the Pentagon.   \n\n    MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  More than 80 people have now been killed by U.S. strikes on suspected drug boats. There are growing questions about an order to kill two of those people - whether it amounts to a war crime.Here's what we know. On September 2, the U.S. carried out two strikes on a boat in the Caribbean. The second killed two remaining survivors. Details of that second strike were first reported by The Washington Post last week. Today, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, quote, \"authorized\" Admiral Frank Bradley to conduct both strikes, that Admiral Bradley issued the order and, quote, \"worked well within his authority and the law.\"Well, on Capitol Hill, both the Senate and the House Armed Services Committees are asking for a full accounting, and among the lawmakers asking, Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine. We've reached him at Capitol Hill. Senator, thanks for being with us.TIMOTHY KAINE: Mary Louise, glad to talk today.KELLY: How clear are you on details of what exactly happened, with this second strike killing two people who had initially survived?KAINE: Mary Louise, it's very murky. I think up here, the - I'm on the two most relevant committees, Armed Services and Foreign Relations, and we're very, very troubled - and it's a bipartisan concern - about the reporting of the second strike that killed these survivors. And so there are many, many unanswered questions about...KELLY: There is a video of these strikes.KAINE: ...The entire mission (inaudible).KELLY: It sounds like you haven't seen it.KAINE: I have not seen the video. That's correct.KELLY: You've asked to see it?KAINE: I've asked a whole series of questions that I have not gotten answers to. I asked a series of questions in a letter dated September 10, and most of my questions have not been answered.KELLY: If this September 2 - if the first and second strikes happened as The Washington Post has reported it, as NPR and others have confirmed, would it be illegal? Would it be a war crime?KAINE: Well, on the legality, Mary Louise, let's start with the first strike. I have maintained since these strikes began that there's no legal authorization for them. And I have reviewed the Office of Legal Counsel classified opinion setting out a legal rationale. Because it's classified I can't discuss its contents, but I can say I found it completely unpersuasive that this mission is lawful at all.But onto the second strike. Set aside the first strike - whether these missions are legally authorized. The second strike, if you go after survivors of an attack and you kill them, that is a clear violation of both DOD Law of War Manual and international conventions about the treatment of wounded combatants. And so if the reporting is correct - that on orders from the secretary of defense a strike was made to kill the survivors of this first attack - if that reporting is correct, it's a war crime under both American law and international law.KELLY: And just to be as clear as we can be with, as we're acknowledging, limited data - we haven't seen this video of what actually happened - but the importance of it being a second strike. I mean, if the U.S. is - has made a decision, an order has been given, attack this boat, kill everybody on it, the detail of the second strike is because they survived. You're supposed to - what? - take them prisoner of war, give them...KAINE: Yes.KELLY: ...Some opportunity to plead their case?KAINE: Yes. You're supposed to take them prisoner and then you decide. I mean, here's another fact that a lot of folks have focused (ph) on. There was a subsequent strike where there were survivors - one Colombian and one Ecuadoran. The administration picked them up and then returned them to Colombia or Ecuador. If they were narcotraffickers, why weren't they arrested? Why weren't they put on trial or pressured to reveal their higher-ups? Why were they sent back to Colombia and Ecuador, where they were released back into the civilian population? That fact on a subsequent strike raises real questions about whether we're even striking combatants or whether we're striking people claiming that they're narcotraffickers when they're actually not.KELLY: So again, the administration is defending these strikes - says they are legal. The defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, has said the intent of these strikes - I'm quoting a post he put up on X - the intent of the strikes is to stop lethal drugs, destroy narco boats and kill the narco-terrorists who are poisoning the American people. Senator Kaine, what's wrong with that?KAINE: That would be a great rationale if you presented it to Congress and let Congress vote that we should be at war to do just that. Our Constitution makes very plain that war is initiated by Congress. Once initiated, the president, secretary of defense and others are the commander-in-chief that implement the initiation of war. But war is not for the president to decide. The framers of our Constitution decided that, Mary Louise, when George Washington was president. They didn't even want George Washington to unilaterally take the nation to war, and they certainly wouldn't want Donald Trump doing it either.KELLY: I want to talk about the War Powers Resolution that you were planning to reintroduce. This would require congressional approval for military force in the Caribbean. You did try to get that through this fall. You couldn't get enough of your colleagues to support it. What has changed?KAINE: Mary Louise, there's two separate resolutions. They're very closely related. One deals with boat strikes in international waters in the Caribbean and the Pacific. And you're right, we filed that. Adam Schiff was the lead sponsor. I was his co-sponsor. We got two Republican votes. We needed at least four. I then led a similar resolution - no war in Venezuela or against Venezuela without congressional approval. We got two Republicans. We needed at least four. Both of those resolutions, though, were voted on for a lot of the subsequent developments. So with the Venezuela situation - the amassing of troops around Venezuela, the president closing the airspace, announcing that he's authorized covert operations - this has escalated dramatically.KELLY: Right.KAINE: And similarly, the strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific, including with the revelation about the second strike, the retirement - the early retirement of the SOUTHCOM commander, the decision by the U.K. to stop sharing intelligence with us - Congress needs to assert control here.KELLY: Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine. As you heard, he sits on the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Affairs committees. Senator, thank you.KAINE: You bet.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The tours were on a three-month hiatus because of President Trump's decision to build an estimated $300 million ballroom, which resulted in the East Wing's removal.   Images of the demolition sparked controversy and outrage with some suggesting the excavators tearing into the East Wing were a metaphor for Trump's approach to the government since returning to office. Polling indicates a majority of Americans oppose the project.   In past years, White House tours began in the East Wing, which dazzled with decorations during the holidays, transporting visitors to a winter wonderland.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Christmas trees line the Grand Foyer of the White House.\n                \n                    Michael Zamora/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Michael Zamora/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   On Monday morning, journalists got a first look at the new, truncated tour and a preview of decorations the White House says were \"personally selected by Mrs. Trump to honor the heart of America.\"   \n   There are 75 wreaths with red bows, 51 Christmas trees, more than 700 feet of garland, more than 2,000 strands of light, more than 25,000 feet of ribbon and 2,800 gold stars, according to the White House.   \n   First lady Melania Trump and her team had far less real estate to work with as they mapped out her \"Home Is Where The Heart Is\" themed decorations. Tours now start and finish in the North Portico of the White House and include stops in the East Room, Blue Room, Green Room, Red Room and State Dining Room. The East Wing and basement rooms such as the Map Room that had previously been decorated are no longer part of the public tour route. A semi-permanent structure has been erected on the North Lawn for security screening of guests.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                An ornament from each state hangs on the White house Christmas tree in the Blue Room Monday.\n                \n                    Michael Zamora/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Michael Zamora/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   The official White House Christmas Tree is the focal point of the Blue Room. Measuring 18-feet tall, it is adorned with gold stars and white globe ornaments featuring all 56 U.S. states and territories. The ornaments were 3D printed with AI assisting in designs that feature the state bird and state flower from each. The tree was decorated by Gold Star families, who lost a loved one as a result of active-duty military service.   \n   \"Home is made safe because of the Gold Star families who sacrificed for our country, wherever they might call home across the world,\" said Nicholas Clemens, the communications director for the first lady and an unofficial tour guide for the media preview.   The Green Room \"celebrates family fun\" according to a White House description of the decorations, and features large Lego portraits of President George Washington and Trump. Each portrait contains 6,000 Lego bricks.   \"They were put together by volunteers,\" said Clemens. He described a scene straight out of the movies as dozens of volunteer decorators from all over the country climbed ladders, carried boxes of garland and tied many bows to get the halls decked and ready for the return of public tours.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Trees line the Grand Foyer inside the White House.\n                \n                    Michael Zamora/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Michael Zamora/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   The Red Room features more than 10,000 blue butterflies meant to celebrate young people \"including youth who've experienced foster care, who are still figuring out where home is and what that might mean,\" said Clemens. In addition to the butterflies, ornaments on the Christmas tree say \"Be Best\" and a ribbon threading through the branches reads \"Fostering the Future,\" two of the first lady's initiatives.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Butterflies spiral out of a tree in the Red Room.\n                \n                    Michael Zamora/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Michael Zamora/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   The East Room is decorated to mark America's 250th anniversary, which comes next year and according to the White House, showcases \"the patriotic colors of our flag and some of our national symbols.\"   A large golden curtain covers what Trump has described as a \"knock out wall,\" that will lead to the massive ballroom he plans to build where the East Wing once stood. \"It looks pretty nice right now, but it's going to look a lot better in a little while,\" Trump said last month.   \n   As always, the highlight of the State Dining Room is the gingerbread White House. This one depicts the White House as viewed from the South Lawn with a giant American flag made of sugar, mirroring the new and massive flag poles added by Trump earlier this year. The second floor of the gingerbread South Portico is open so viewers can get a glimpse of the Yellow Oval, a room in the private residence where first families gather.   \"You'll be able to peer in and see the current design of the ... Yellow Oval as it currently is designed for the Trumps,\" said Clemens. \"So you'll get a real-time glimpse into what it looks like.\"   \n   A program for the tour lays out the confectionary feat by the numbers. The gingerbread White House contains 120 pounds of gingerbread dough, 100 pounds of pastillage dough, 10 pounds of chocolate and 5 pounds of royal icing. Other than a few small lights \"everything else is made of something that you can eat,\" said Clemens.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A gingerbread White House is displayed in the State Dining Room.\n                \n                    Michael Zamora/NPR\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Michael Zamora/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   Asked about the smaller footprint of the tour this year and Trump's renovations, Clemens declined to comment.   While the East Room demolition is the highest-profile project since Trump returned to office, the president has been on a remodeling spree, making changes to the White House at a frenetic pace. The Rose Garden has been transformed into a patio surrounded by flowers that is modeled after an outdoor space at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. The Oval Office is now gilded from floor to ceiling. And the Lincoln bathroom in the residence also got a major makeover featuring a whole lot of marble.   Tour tickets can be requested through members of Congress, who get an allotment for their constituents.\n",

Several studies suggest that people in red states have more babies than those in blue states. And now a new report from a conservative-leaning group argues that that could have implications for politics and culture in the U.S. down the road. NPR political correspondent Sarah McCammon has been following this and joins us now. Hi there.SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Hey, Juana.SUMMERS: Hey there. So Sarah, just start by telling us, what is the connection between where people fall on the political spectrum and the number of kids they have?MCCAMMON: Yeah. So several studies in recent years have pointed to higher fertility rates in red states, and that's especially true since the COVID pandemic. Now a new report from the conservative-leaning Institute for Family Studies argues that young adults who identify as conservative are having more babies than their liberal counterparts. Brad Wilcox is a senior fellow at the institute and a co-author of the report.BRAD WILCOX: That has clear implications, you know, potentially for everything from kind of public schools to congressional districts to just sort of, again, kind of the trajectory of the country, politically and otherwise.MCCAMMON: And these authors looked at young adults ages 25 to 35 who self-identify as liberal or conservative. They found that young liberal women today are much less likely to have children than young conservative women, with a gap of more than 30 percentage points. And that's a big change since the 1980s, when there was a much smaller gap between liberal and conservative women.SUMMERS: How much could birth rates in red states or blue states predict the way people vote in the future?MCCAMMON: The theory is that children are likely to take after their parents, so this would mean more Republican voters in the future. But Melissa Deckman of the Public Religion Research Institute says that's not necessarily the case.MELISSA DECKMAN: It's very clear that states that have had more Trump votes are seeing an increase in child population. But remember, these children are not yet voters. And so if you're trying to speculate how they're going to vote in 10, 20 years, I think it's really difficult to conclude that this will advantage the Republican Party.MCCAMMON: Deckman says another huge variable is just President Trump himself because he's such a unique political figure and it's unclear what direction either party will go after he's no longer on the scene.SUMMERS: Do we know why young conservatives might be having more children than young liberals?MCCAMMON: You know, there's a lot of speculation about this. Republicans are more likely to be religious than Democrats, and there is a long-standing correlation between being more religious and having larger families. So that could be a reason. The authors of this new report argue that conservatives prioritize marriage and family in ways they say liberals may not. Leslie Root, a researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder, says the partisan divide is real, but she says the report leaves out a lot of women who choose to have their children later.LESLIE ROOT: And so I really think that looking at this small section of people 25 to 35 is playing into this narrative that there's this huge and growing disparity that's really, to my mind, not true.MCCAMMON: And by the end of their childbearing years, she says most women across the political spectrum do end up having kids. So this is a data point. It's an interesting and important one, but it's still an open question what the relationship between birth rates and political ideology will mean for U.S. politics in the long term.SUMMERS: NPR's Sarah McCammon, thanks so much.MCCAMMON: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.

    "body": "\n      The extension of the extra financial help to buy Affordable Care Act health insurance is still up in the air. Republicans have politics and policy to weigh.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  It's open enrollment time for people who have to buy health insurance on their own through HealthCare.gov, and that's about 24 million Americans. Coming up, we'll speak with Democratic Senator Ron Wyden about the debate in Congress over extending the Affordable Care Act subsidies set to expire at the end of the year.A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  First, let's get an overview over where things stand on what's also known as Obamacare with Julie Rovner. She's the chief Washington correspondent with our reporting partner KFF Health News. So, Julie, people can shop for their health insurance, but the price they're seeing may not be final. Why is that?JULIE ROVNER: That's right. You know, there always been tax credits to help people afford their coverage on the Affordable Care Act health exchanges. In 2021, Congress made those tax credits much larger because they were concerned during the pandemic that more people should have health insurance, and it really worked. It doubled enrollment in the Affordable Care Act. Well, those extra subsidies are set to expire at the end of December. Congress is still fighting over whether to extend them. So people who are getting on the internet now and looking at the prices are seeing the un- or un-extra-subsidized...MARTÍNEZ: Yeah.ROVNER: ...Prices, which in many cases are much, much larger. But we still don't know if Congress is going to extend those additional subsidies, which would bring those prices down.MARTÍNEZ: So you said Congress is still fighting over this. How likely politically, though, is it that Congress will actually act?ROVNER: Well, we will see. In the fairly near future, the Senate has promised a vote to Democrats in order to get them to reopen the government. That's set for no later than the end of next week. Republicans, though, are still scrambling to have something to offer as an alternative.MARTÍNEZ: Now, when it comes to that alternative, what is it? Do they have a plan?ROVNER: A lot of Republicans have plans, but they're not all on the same page. In fact, we saw early last week, President Trump floated a plan that would have extended the subsidies temporarily. And that met with a big backlash, and he backed off. And you've got, you know, some Republicans saying we shouldn't be giving any kind of tax credits or subsidies to insurance companies. We should give the money directly to individuals. Economists say that's not going to help most people pay their health bills, even if they have kind of a minor health ailment. So Republicans, as they have been for the last 20-some years, are divided over how to proceed.MARTÍNEZ: So what are the takeaways, then, for people who need to buy health insurance in these ACA marketplaces?ROVNER: Well, we're looking at a pretty hard deadline. If you want to have insurance starting January 1, you have to select a plan by December 15, which is obviously just two weeks away. You know, many - there are many ways to sort of calculate what your premiums would be without these additional tax credits and what they would be if, for some reason, Congress actually manages to extend them. But right now, it's pretty hard for the average consumer to figure out what to do because it's pretty hard for us political reporters to figure out what we should be doing.MARTÍNEZ: Two weeks away, though - I mean, that's not a lot of time. I mean, what are the odds Congress even acts before then?ROVNER: It seems unlikely Congress will act before then. However, if Congress does eventually act and extends the tax credits, then there will be an opportunity for people who have selected plans to go in and sort of select a new plan. Maybe they're going to shop - you know, they'll select a cheaper plan for next year because that's all they can afford. And if the tax credits get extended, they might be able to afford something more akin to what they have now, and they will be able to go back and change it. In most states, open enrollment doesn't end until January 15. And obviously, if Congress makes some changes, they can also extend that open enrollment again. So people shouldn't panic as much as...MARTÍNEZ: OK.ROVNER: ...They may be panicking now.MARTÍNEZ: That's Julie Rovner, chief Washington correspondent with our partner KFF Health News. Thanks a lot.ROVNER: Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "body": "\n      NPR's Leila Fadel speaks with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., about the debate in Congress to extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of the year.   \n\n    LEILA FADEL, HOST:  For more on the politics surrounding health care costs and extending Affordable Care Act subsidies, Senator Ron Wyden is on the line. The senior Senator from Oregon is the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. Good morning, Senator.RON WYDEN: Hey. Thanks for having me.FADEL: Thank you for being here. I want to start with what we just heard from Julie Rovner there. You know, December 15 is when a lot of people have to sign up for their coverage to start January 1. That gives Congress two weeks to get something done to address insurance costs. Is that possible?WYDEN: Well, a clean extension of the tax credits is the only timely step that's going to prevent millions of Americans from experiencing a big premium increase. And that's going to happen very quickly. And the problem is that the Republicans want to tack on harmful policies that mostly help big insurance. So we Democrats are trying to work with the Republicans and both sides, but we've been talking to them for a long time, and they've got to move.FADEL: What specific policies are you concerned about?WYDEN: Big insurance policies, policies that are junk insurance, for example, basically, savings accounts, for example, that give a few benefits, but nothing that's going to help with cancer. It's mostly stuff that helps big insurance.FADEL: Last week, House Republican leaders pushed back against a reported White House plan that would have extended the Affordable Care Act subsidies for two years. What did you make of that backlash?WYDEN: Well, clearly, they're fighting, but the problem is, Trump has always had concepts, but never a real bill. And this legislation, as far as we can tell, is going to be mostly higher deductibles, more co-payments, junk insurance, not going to do something for working families. That's our bottom line.FADEL: What are the biggest sticking points when it comes to finding a compromise on this issue to get an extension...WYDEN: Well, it seems...FADEL: ...Or some type of movement?WYDEN: Yeah. It seems in the last couple of days Trump is actually rejecting some effort at tax credits, and I think that's the only timely thing that's going to keep people from getting clobbered in the short term. We're going to say, we'll work with them. For example, I've written a policy that's very aggressive in terms of fighting fraud. They say they care about it. So if they want to be bipartisan, we'll work with them.FADEL: Are there signs that there is traction for what you want among Republican - your Republican colleagues?WYDEN: Well, everybody's coming back today. My sense is a lot of families were around the Thanksgiving table, wondering how they were going to deal with these huge increases. They'll be talking to their senators, and I think they're going to say, get something done. We had a hearing before we left, and what people just said is, get it done. Lower these premiums.FADEL: I think everyone, though, agrees that this is a short-term solution to a long-term problem, the - which is health care is unaffordable for a lot of Americans, especially without these subsidies. Is there a solution to address the root cause of high health care so this doesn't become a political debate every few years where Americans are wondering whether their premiums are going to go up?WYDEN: Once we've dealt with this issue, we're ready to go on the long term. In particular, I'm going to be focused on these out-of-control administrative costs. Looks like they're racking up close to a trillion dollars a year. It's insanely complicated. That'll be a priority for me.FADEL: What - beyond that, when you look at reforms, what reforms should the Affordable Care Act be undergoing?WYDEN: Well, certainly, we can look at a variety of approaches, and I'm going to talk about fighting fraud. I've introduced a proposal that would allow us to deal with these out-of-control insurance brokers. We ought to have tough criminal penalties on them, and then we ought to go after these big insurance proposals.FADEL: As part of the deal to end the government shutdown, Senate Republicans promised Democrats to hold a vote on a Democratic health care bill by mid-December. Do you expect that vote to be successful?WYDEN: My proposal is, let's get to work. We're going to talk to the Republicans. Right now, there's no deal, but if there isn't a bill, there's going to be an awful human crisis. Millions are going to lose coverage. I've got folks at home in Eugene, Oregon, you know, who are looking at a 500% increase in premiums. We're going to have folks devastated.And, by the way, Julie Rovner knows this. It's going to jack up employer-sponsored health care costs, as well, to the biggest increase we've seen in small businesses in years.FADEL: Looking ahead at next year's midterm, is health care the main issue that your constituents are concerned about?WYDEN: Well, the combination of the huge Medicaid cuts and what's going to be done to rural hospitals, this makes this a front-and-center issue. I've always said health care is the most important issue because if you and your loved ones don't have your health, everything else goes by the board. There are going to be a lot of people who can't pay for health care with this.FADEL: And what is your message to both your Democratic colleagues and Republican colleagues right now as you think about health care costs?WYDEN: My message is, we want to support legislation that lowers health costs and prevents Americans from losing their health insurance. We will work with anybody - Republicans - that'll meet that standard.FADEL: That's Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon. Thank you for your time.WYDEN: Thanks for having me.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

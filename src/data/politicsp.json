Some faced state prosecutions, while others were never charged.   A proclamation published on Martin's personal X account late Sunday listed 77 people who received \"full, complete, and unconditional\" pardons, including Rudy Giuliani, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, and Sidney Powell, a former Trump attorney who spread conspiracy theories about ballot fraud after Trump lost the 2020 election.   \n   Powell is one of four pardon recipients who previously pleaded guilty in a Georgia court after being indicted for trying to subvert the 2020 election results in Georgia.   The pardons are largely symbolic as none of the names listed were ever charged with federal crimes. Dozens of people listed were charged in multiple swing states that were the center of unfounded claims of election fraud, including Georgia, Nevada, Arizona and Wisconsin. Presidents do not hold the power to pardon state crimes.   \n   The proclamation appeared to have been signed on Friday. It also made clear that Trump was not among those being pardoned. Trump has previously said he had the \"absolute right\" to pardon himself – a claim that remains untested. The Supreme Court granted the president broad immunity for official acts committed during his presidency.   In a statement to NPR, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"These great Americans were persecuted and put through hell by the Biden Administration for challenging an election, which is the cornerstone of democracy,\" adding: \"President Trump is putting an end to the Biden Regime's communist tactics once and for all.\"   In January, Trump pardoned some 1,500 Jan. 6 rioters who participated in the siege on the U.S. Capitol four years ago. Among those pardoned were Enrique Tarrio, the former Proud Boys chairman, who was convicted of \"seditious conspiracy\" and sentenced to 22 years in the federal penitentiary.   \n   This latest string of pardons, while symbolic, appears to be part of Trump's longstanding efforts to rewrite history and amplify his false claims that the 2020 election, which was won by Joe Biden, was stolen. Pressed about those false claims in a 2022 interview with NPR's Steve Inskeep, Trump repeatedly attempted to cast more misinformation about his election loss, before abruptly ending the call.\n",

Today's top stories   A bipartisan group of senators reached a deal last night to reopen the government and end the longest shutdown in U.S. history. The vote on the first procedural step was 60 to 40, with seven Democrats and one independent joining most Republicans on the measure. The agreement would fund the government through Jan. 30.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) speaks to reporters following a vote on Capitol Hill on Nov. 9, 2025, in Washington, D.C. The Senate convened for a rare Sunday session in an attempt to end the government shutdown.\n                \n                    Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   🎧 Along with the stopgap measure to fund the government, the Democrats who defected received a promise of a vote on health care, NPR's Claudia Grisales tells Up First. Some of the Democrats who voted no were furious about the defection. Sen. Elizabeth Warren stated that the defection was a terrible mistake and that the American people want them to fight for health care. The Senate has several hurdles to clear before the measure can be passed, and even then, it will need to pass the House.   The Trump administration now has two days to increase SNAP benefits from 65% to 100% after a federal appeals court refused a request to pause a lower court's orders to do so. The administration could ask the U.S. Supreme Court to get involved in the matter for the second time in just a few days. Another battle is unfolding involving states that have already paid out full benefits after a federal judge ordered it, but before the higher court said 'not so fast,' NPR's Tovia Smith says.    \n   🎧 Much of these legal battles could be rendered moot with the expectation that when the government reopens, Congress can appropriate SNAP funding for the fiscal year. Smith says there is no certainty as to when families will receive the benefits after the shutdown ends, but in the past states motivated to get benefits flowing did so within a matter of days. When speaking with Americans who receive SNAP benefits, Smith has heard a sense of relief from some that they could soon receive the funds, and others have been cautiously hopeful.   World leaders are gathering in Brazil for the United Nations' annual climate summit, COP30, to negotiate the ongoing response to climate change. The event is expected to last about two weeks. This year, the United States will not take an active role in the discussions.    🎧 Some world leaders may be relieved that the U.S. might not show, as some are concerned that its presence could hamper the talks, according to NPR's Julia Simon. The U.S. is the second biggest polluter and will eventually need to come on board to help reach the climate goals. When it comes to tackling climate change, there are two major driving forces: politics, as exemplified by this summit, and economics, says Simon. The green economic transition is where a lot of good news for the planet is currently happening, from electric vehicles to solar power.   \n   Cost of living   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        Getty Images/Emily Bogle/NPR\n    \n\n   \n   NPR's series Cost of Living: The Price We Pay is examining what's driving price increases and how people are coping after years of stubborn inflation.    The price of electricity has increased 40% since February 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The rise in demand for electricity is partly due to the proliferation of new data centers that support the growing artificial intelligence industry. Additionally, the price of natural gas, which is used to generate electricity, has gone up. Here's what else we know:    💡 Demand for electricity is expected to grow 2.2% this year and 2.4% next year, according to the Energy Department.💡 Utilities projects that building new power supplies and a more resilient grid will exceed a trillion dollars over the next five years. If data centers receive a price break, residential customers may take on some of their costs.💡 Electricity costs can be reduced by adjusting consumption times and locations. The highest rates occur during peak demand, such as on the hottest days of summer.   Listen to why AI is partly to blame for your electricity bill going up.

A study published in 2024 found that one of the strongest predictors of a child's screen time is their parents' screen time. While it can be challenging for parents to limit screen time due to much of the work to manage the home being online, practicing moderation can set a positive example.    \n   📱 If you are with your family and would prefer to be off your device, ask yourself if that task is urgent. If it is not, save that to-do for another time.📱 Focus less on assessing the quantity of your screen time, but the quality. After your observations of what is actually beneficial, identify how you can make healthier tweaks to your screen time.📱 Create device-free zones in your home and schedule. Many parents ban devices during mealtime. You can also implement this rule during a movie night or on vacations.

As the administration started sending troops into several Democratic-led cities this summer, some members of the Ohio guard began expressing concern in a Signal group chat.\n                \n                    Al Drago/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Al Drago/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   As President Trump calls for National Guard deployments across the U.S., a small contingent of Ohio guard members has been quietly expressing concern in an encrypted group chat.   The administration started sending troops into several Democratic-led cities this summer, citing the need to crack down on violent crime and protect federal immigration facilities. The Ohio guard members now say they're alarmed at the turn the country is taking. They're even questioning their potential role in it.   \n   \"I really went to a dark place when they sent the troops to [Los Angeles], and then eventually [Washington, D.C.], and now, Chicago. This is just not what any of us signed up for, and it's so out of the scope of normal operations,\" says J, a member of the Ohio National Guard who spoke to NPR on condition of anonymity.   In the summer, Trump sent troops into Los Angeles as anti-ICE protests escalated. He then deployed guard troops into D.C., where around 2,300 still regularly patrol streets. Then a torrent of plans for deployments came — Chicago, Portland, Memphis, cities in Louisiana and Missouri. Many of them remain embroiled in legal limbo.   In Ohio, J and several other members have taken to that group chat to discuss the deployments and the accompanying anxiety they've felt. J, as well as members C and A — all part of the same unit — agreed to talk to NPR on the condition that they are only identified by their first initials, because they are not authorized to talk to the press and fear retribution for expressing their opinions.   \"I have been on two humanitarian-esque missions with the guard, which were awesome, doing the things you see on the commercial, helping these communities,\" says J. \"And then you want me to go pick up trash and dissuade homeless people in D.C. at gunpoint. Like, no dude. It's so disheartening every time I see another city — and I just wonder, 'who's going to stand up to this?'\"   \n   It's a sentiment that's building with guard members elsewhere.   In recent weeks, more than 100 active military members have reached out to About Face, a nonpartisan nonprofit made up of current service members and post-9/11 veterans to be a resource for those who might be questioning their deployments, according to the organization.   \"In the military culture, it's really easy to feel like if you have questions or dissent, you're the only person who thinks that,\" says director Brittany Ramos DeBarros, a combat veteran who served in Afghanistan.   \n   The group has started an information campaign, specifically targeting members of the National Guard around the country — using flyers, posters, even billboards — encouraging them to reach out if they're having doubts.   \"We take very seriously making sure that people do understand what they could be facing if they follow their conscience,\" says DeBarros. \"But the thing we also help people think through is, what is the cost of not following your conscience? Because as Iraq and Afghanistan vets in particular, many of us are living with that cost every day.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                With the White House in the distance, National Guard troops patrol the Mall as part of President Donald Trump's order to impose federal law enforcement in the nation's capital, in Washington, Aug. 28, 2025.\n                \n                    J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n    \n\n   \n   NPR reached out to both the White House and the Pentagon for this story.   \"Our great National Guardsmen signed up to defend the nation and serve the American people,\" wrote Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson in a statement. \"We are proud of the work they have accomplished this year, and we are confident in their collective ability to carry out any and all orders by President Trump, the Department of War, and state leaders.\"   White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson defended the deployments, saying Trump was using his \"lawful authority to protect federal assets and personnel.\" Jackson lashed out at Democratic leaders, saying they'd failed to stop violent attacks on law enforcement.   The group chat   The group chat with the Ohio National Guard members — set up on the encrypted messaging app Signal — began amid the flurry of executive orders President Trump signed as he took office. Some of them affected the military. The members say they needed a space to process it.   \n   \"It's not even necessarily expressing opinions or anything. It's just expressing questions about things that come out,\" says A.   They say the chat is active every day, with members sharing information and news articles they come across. In recent months, that chat has grown to a dozen members of their unit, and it's become largely focused on Trump's rhetoric around the National Guard and his deployments of troops to several cities.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                President Trump gestures while walking across the South Lawn of the White House, Sunday, Nov. 2, 2025.\n                \n                    Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Ohio's Republican Gov. Mike DeWine has agreed to send troops to support the administration's efforts; there are about 150 in DC right now.   That voluntary directive has come to this unit. None of the three took it. They say the orders themselves were uncharacteristically vague.   \"What exactly are we going to be doing? Are we going to have leave? And those answers aren't very clear — but in the past, it's always been very clear,\" says A. \"Anywhere that we go, there's crucial information that we get about the why behind it. And whenever we don't get that, especially for these city moves, members ask questions.\"   Growing anti-guard sentiment   A joined the guard to pay for college. J was looking for direction in life. And C felt the pull of the benefits that the guard offers and to serve her country. All three have served for years, even decades.   The three say they are grappling with whether to leave the guard, and end their military careers.   \"The only reason I want to finish my current contract is just because I feel like there's weight to what I do and say right now, and I just want to use that to do some good,\" says J.   C says she has been proud of her military career and how she has served — noting that she's served on missions that she didn't necessarily agree with before. But she worries these deployments could change that. She says she's spent a lot of time thinking about what line she won't cross.   \n   \"I've been in therapy. Lots of therapy has taken me to the point where at least I can be okay if I have to say goodbye. That sucks. Is this tarnishing my service? Is it undoing everything I thought I was fighting for?\" she says.   The three say they've felt anti-guard sentiment from some of their community and in their civilian lives.   \"Everything that has been happening is so counter to doctrine, and so counter to what we've been taught,\" C says.   Their thoughts   The Trump administration has publicly talked about using the National Guard to help with mass deportations and immigration enforcement — something broadly illegal under US law. That bothers the three guard members.   \"There is no way I would participate in that,\" says J. \"I just think when everything is said and done, people are going to have to answer for what we're seeing now, and I don't want to be any part of it.\"   A also says he's been wrestling with what he'd do if made to participate.   \"I think, like, establishing those boundaries with yourself: What am I willing to do? What am I willing to give up? And where do I draw those lines?\" he says.   The idea of troops patrolling U.S. streets — even if they're only picking up trash — is also problematic for the Ohio guard members.   \n   \"It's kind of like fearmongering. People who don't see people in uniform every day, you send 50 of them out to walk their street, it's going to send a message,\" J says.   DeBarros, the director of About Face, says she knows the tactic well.   \"In Afghanistan, we used to regularly carry out what are called presence patrols, where there was no purpose or mission other than to be present in the space and normalizing that we were there,\" she said. \"Letting people know, oh, if you act up, we are here, and we're watching.\"   \n   C has been thinking a lot about what she's willing to give up and the potential consequences.   \"I swore an oath to the Constitution, not a person,\" she says. \"I just really, really implore my peers and everybody outside looking in, to just think about that. Really think about that, and think about what that means. And if there are questions, ask them. Keep talking.\"\n",

Brazil will host COP30 from November 10-21 in the northern city of Belém.\n                \n                    Wagner Meier/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Wagner Meier/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Most of the world's nations are gathering in Brazil's northern city of Belém to negotiate the ongoing response to climate change. The United Nations annual climate summit, called COP30, begins Monday and is expected to last about two weeks.   This year, the U.S. will not play an active role in the talks. According to a White House statement to NPR, no high-level officials will attend COP30 — breaking a long-standing tradition.   During the previous Trump administration, U.S. delegates participated in the talks. Now, the administration has taken a stronger anti-climate stance, calling efforts to limit global warming a \"hoax.\"   \n   \"President Trump will not jeopardize our country's economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries,\" says White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.   President Trump began to de-prioritize climate in January, when he withdrew the U.S. from the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. In that accord, countries agreed to try to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally less than 1.5 C (2.7 F). The planet is currently on track to warm roughly 2.8 C (5 F) over preindustrial levels by 2100, according to a recent U.N. climate report.   Since the Paris Agreement, the U.S. developed policies to cut climate pollution in ways that would lower future warming. But the Trump administration's sweeping rollbacks to climate policy are affecting those efforts, as well as communities' ability to cope with climate risks, like lengthening extreme heat seasons and increasingly destructive wildfires or floods. Climate experts worry that because the U.S. is setting an example, other countries might pull back on climate goals, too.   If all U.S. climate efforts were discontinued, the U.N. report estimates, the planet could warm by an extra 0.1 C — a small fraction of the total change to the planet, but a chunk that could still have significant real-life impacts.   \n   \"Each fraction of a degree matters for communities facing floods, drought, and heat extremes,\" says Ko Barrett, deputy secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization.   Here are six major shifts in U.S. climate policy initiated by the Trump administration.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                During his two terms in office, President Donald Trump has taken steps to roll back or weaken environmental and climate policy. This term, the administration has made significant changes, from cutting federal support for renewable power to dismantling climate research efforts at agencies like NOAA.\n                \n                    Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Rolling back longstanding policies to target climate pollution   In March, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to target more than two dozen rules and policies in what the agency called the \"most consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history.\"   One key component of the administration's efforts focuses on attempting to reverse the \"endangerment finding,\" a legal basis for many of the country's climate policies.   In 2009, the EPA labeled carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses a danger to public health and welfare. But legal challenges from fossil fuel interests and their allies delayed the finalization of rules to rein in greenhouse gas pollution. Now, the Trump administration wants to eliminate that 2009 endangerment finding, which could make it easier to roll back other climate regulations.   In July, Trump's EPA argued that the country's climate pollution is not harming people and doesn't need to be regulated in the way courts and previous administrations have chosen to do it.   Reconsidering limits on climate pollution from power plants   In March, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to target more than two dozen rules and policies in what the agency called the \"most consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history.\"   One key component focuses on reversing the \"endangerment finding,\" a legal basis for many federal climate policies such as improving vehicle mileage and cutting power plant pollution.   In 2009, the EPA labeled carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses a danger to public health and welfare. Now, the Trump administration wants to eliminate that endangerment finding, making it easier to roll back other climate regulations.   In July, Trump's EPA argued that the country's climate pollution is not harming people and doesn't need to be regulated.   \n   Reconsidering limits on climate pollution from power plants   In June, the Trump administration announced plans to repeal limits on greenhouse gas emissions and other airborne pollutants from the nation's fossil fuel-fired power plants. If the proposal survives expected legal challenges and is finalized, it would eliminate controls on the second-largest source of climate pollution in the U.S., behind transportation.   The administration argues U.S. coal and gas-fired power plants are responsible for about 3% of global greenhouse gases that are heating the planet. It says that number is declining — it was 5.5% in 2005. So, the administration argues, reducing it further would provide little benefit to public health. That ignores that the U.S. is responsible for nearly a quarter of the climate pollution in the atmosphere today–more than any other nation, historically.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                During the Biden administration, the Environmental Protection Agency developed rules to reduce carbon emissions and mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants and other pollution sources. Now, several of those rules are being rolled back or reconsidered under the Trump administration.\n                \n                    Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Withdrawing support for renewable energy technologies    The Trump administration is taking steps to open up more areas of U.S. land and ocean to increased oil and gas exploration. At the same time, it has been dismantling federal support for wind and solar industries, which it falsely labels as risky and unreliable.   The new GOP spending law ends federal tax incentives for wind and solar, throwing into limbo thousands of projects. The Trump administration has also canceled more than $13 billion in funds for green energy projects and tried to halt offshore wind projects already under construction. Energy experts say it's too early to know the full impact of these policies, but in the first half of 2025, U.S. renewable investment fell by 36%, according to data from BloombergNEF.   The Trump administration is also targeting subsidies for consumers to buy climate solutions like rooftop solar, efficient heat pumps, and electric vehicles. And it ended a $7 billion grant program for local solar projects. Federal incentives for rooftop solar, heat pumps, and insulation go away Dec. 31. Tax credits for electric vehicles ended Sept. 30.   \n   Cutting climate-preparedness grants nationwide   The Trump administration has also cancelled grants for climate and environmental initiatives around the country. Grant recipients, contractors and activists say the moves have thrown into doubt the government's standing as a reliable partner.   Funding cuts have targeted a range of energy projects, as well, from transmission lines to research on capturing carbon from the atmosphere. Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the moves would set back American innovation and competitiveness.   Democratic lawmakers warn that cancelling Energy Department funding risks driving up utility bills and slowing economic growth at a time when new data centers and factories are expected to increase electricity demand for the first time in decades.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                A tropical analysis meteorologist works at his station at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida, in May 2025. Earlier this year, the Trump administration fired hundreds of NOAA staff and deleted government websites with data on weather and climate.\n                \n                    Chandan Khanna/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chandan Khanna/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   Slashing federal support for climate science and removing climate data   The Trump administration has systematically removed climate science and climate scientists from the federal government. One of the administration's targets was the National Climate Assessment, which is the most influential and widely-used source of information about how climate change affects the United States. In April, the Trump administration dismissed those who were working on the next edition of the report. In July, the federal website that hosted the most recent edition went dark.   The administration also slashed funding for climate science research at agencies like NOAA, NASA, and even USDA. The cuts have affected long-standing data collection efforts and datasets, like NOAA's Billion Dollar Disaster analysis, which keeps track of the ballooning costs of climate-worsened disasters like wildfires, hurricanes, hailstorms, and floods. The database was discontinued in May.   Lowering federal support for disaster relief and preparedness   As wildfires, hurricanes and storms get more intense, disasters that exceed more than a billion dollars in damage are on the rise. Many communities rely on federal support to prepare, including building flood protection projects, improving evacuation planning and fortifying hospitals and other vital infrastructure. The Trump administration has cancelled more than $4 billion in grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, leaving many communities scrambling to replace that funding and prevent damage from worsening hazards. The Trump administration has said it wants states to take over disaster preparation.\n",

It comes after recent clemency grants from Trump to former U.S. Rep. George Santos and an ex-CEO of a cryptocurrency exchange.   \n   While former President Joe Biden still holds the record of 4,245 clemency actions, Trump's second-term pardons and commutations are notable for their political and personal connections to the president, says Bernadette Meyler, a professor of constitutional law at Stanford University.   \"There's more of a sense of the insider pardon than we've seen previously,\" Meyler said.   In mid-October, Trump commuted the prison sentence of Santos, the disgraced New York Republican who pleaded guilty to wire fraud and identity theft last year.   Days later the president handed a full and unconditional pardon to Changpeng Zhao, the former CEO of Binance, who pleaded guilty to money laundering charges. Binance has ties to the Trump family's cryptocurrency business, but Trump said in an interview with 60 Minutes that he does not know who Zhao is.   \n   U.S. presidents are given broad authority to nullify convictions or sentences for federal crimes without the involvement of Congress or the Supreme Court. The legal principle is a holdover from English law, in which the king had what was known as the \"prerogative of mercy\" as early as the seventh century.   While Trump has granted clemency to a wide range of people convicted of federal crimes, from nonviolent drug offenders to white-collar criminals, his first term in office was also marked by several notable pardons of political allies and grants of clemency to people whose cases were advocated for by celebrities or friends. Both of those trends have been amplified during his second term, Meyler said.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Former U.S. Rep. George Santos arrives at federal court in Central Islip, N.Y., for sentencing on April 25. His sentenced was commuted by Trump in October.\n                \n                    Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP\n    \n\n   \n   \"He's much more explicit about making political statements through the use of the pardon power,\" Meyler said of Trump's second-term pardons and commutations. She said that includes granting clemency for people who have supported his political career as well as public statements he's made about why a particular crime shouldn't be punished.   Trump's pardons align with his politics …   Trump is by no means the first president to show leniency to a political ally. President Bill Clinton pardoned Mark Rich, a former hedge-fund manager whose ex-wife had donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Democratic National Committee, the Clinton Presidential Library and Hillary Clinton's New York Senate campaign. And President George W. Bush commuted the sentence of Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney.   \n   During his first four years in office, Trump pardoned his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, commuted the sentence of his friend and political confidant Roger Stone and pardoned Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law, Jared.   In his second term, Trump \"has taken the same norm-busting approach to pardons as he has in other areas,\" Jeffrey Crouch, a professor of American politics at American University, told NPR via email.   \n   Crouch pointed to Trump's move on inauguration day this year to pardon some 1,500 defendants (and commute the sentences of several others) convicted of taking part in the Jan. 6, 2021, siege on the U.S. Capitol in support of Trump's effort to overturn his electoral loss the previous fall. For comparison, Trump granted a total of 238 acts of clemency in his first term, according to the Pew Research Center.   Crouch said many presidents have waited until the \"lame duck\" period at the end of their terms to issue potentially controversial clemency grants — but not Trump. \"He did not shy away from granting early or controversial pardons and commutations in his first term, either.\"   Politics have always been entwined with the U.S. clemency process, but past presidents have often used pardons as a way to heal political divisions. George Washington pardoned some of those involved in the Whiskey Rebellion, while Jimmy Carter granted a blanket pardon to people who had evaded service in the Vietnam War.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Trump pardoned former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, who pleaded guilty to money laundering charges, in October. Binance has ties to the Trump family's cryptocurrency business, but Trump said in an interview with 60 Minutes that he doesn't know who Zhao is.\n                \n                    Jason Redmond/AFP via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Jason Redmond/AFP via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The Trump administration has used clemency to benefit some of its political backers. In May, Trump pardoned former Virginia Sheriff Scott Jenkins, an ardent Trump supporter who was convicted of taking bribes from local businessmen in exchange for auxiliary deputy badges. The day the pardon was announced, U.S. Pardon Attorney Ed Martin posted on X: \"No MAGA left behind.\" And when Trump pardoned Santos earlier this month, the president said on social media that Santos had \"the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\"   \n   The founders envisioned impeachment as one check on what is otherwise a nearly absolute presidential power, but Trump has faced virtually no criticism from fellow Republicans for his pardons and commutations.   Past presidents have also taken flak from voters for their clemency decisions. Gerald Ford's approval rating fell by more than 20 points after he pardoned Richard Nixon in 1974, and he lost the presidential election two years later to Carter.   … and his political frustrations   While Santos and Jenkins are both Trump supporters, they also fall into another category of criminal that comes up with some regularity in Trump's clemency choices: public officials of both parties convicted of corruption.   \n   Trump in February issued a full pardon for former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, after having commuted Blagojevich's prison sentence during his first term as president. Former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld received his own pardon in May following his conviction on federal bribery and attempted extortion charges in 2022. Both men are Democrats.   Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington said in June that Trump had pardoned a total of 16 former elected officials convicted of corruption charges.   Meyler, the Stanford professor, said Trump, who has characterized his own recent prosecutions as politically motivated, may view the cases of political corruption against other politicians as similarly unjust.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich signs an autograph outside his Chicago home after speaking to the press about his pardon from President Trump in February.\n                \n                    Scott Olson/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Scott Olson/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   \"Maybe it's not too much of a stretch to think that Trump feels that he was prosecuted for similar kinds of offenses and then is kind of looking out at the landscape of political figures who have been prosecuted and, you know, potentially identifies with the plight of some of them,\" she said.   In an emailed statement to NPR, the White House contrasted Trump's approach to the clemency process with former President Joe Biden's, alluding to criticism from Trump and his allies over Biden's use of an autopen to issue pardons and sign other official documents. (In June, Trump ordered an investigation into Biden's use of the autopen.)   \n   \"It's not difficult to be more involved in the pardon process when your predecessor was an autopen,\" said White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson. \"President Trump has exercised his constitutional authority to issue pardons and commutations for a variety of individuals.\"   \n   Jackson also alluded to the lame-duck pardon Biden granted to his son Hunter, as well as Biden's commutations of 37 federal death row prisoners. Biden said he made those commutations due to his objections to capital punishment at the federal level — and his worry that Trump would lift the moratorium he put on federal executions.   \"And the only pardons anyone should be critical of are from President Autopen, who pardoned and commuted sentences of violent criminals including child killers and mass murderers – and that's not to mention the proactive pardons he 'signed' for his family members like Hunter on his way out the door,\" Jackson added.   What is the clemency process under Trump? Getting his ear may help   Though it's not the only path to securing a pardon or commutation, the official process for seeking clemency is to submit a formal application to the U.S. pardon attorney.   \n   Martin, the current pardon attorney, was appointed by Trump after the president withdrew his nomination to be the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia in the face of Republican opposition. The Trump administration fired the former pardon attorney, Liz Oyer, in March after she refused to restore the gun rights of actor and Trump supporter Mel Gibson, who had been convicted of domestic violence.   Mark Osler, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas, said it's unclear whether the formal process is currently resulting in clemency grants in any significant numbers. \"Right now we know that there's still a mailbox, and that there are petitions going into that mailbox,\" he said. \"What we don't know is what happens after that.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                In 2018, Trump commuted the sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, after she served 21 years in prison for cocaine trafficking. He later pardoned Johnson and made her his \"pardon czar.\"\n                \n                    Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images North America\n    \n\n   \n   Osler said concerns about the clemency application process — or lack thereof — predated Trump's second term. He said Biden also issued pardons to political allies and personal connections he thought Trump may target, including his son Hunter.   \n   \"So those norms were being strained and broken before Trump took office, but he certainly has continued that trend,\" he said.   Osler, who runs a clinic where he and his students file petitions for people seeking clemency, said it's raising questions among those seeking clemency about their odds of success by following the traditional path to obtain a pardon or commutation.   \n   \"I think people are focusing very much on how upset they are about who's receiving grants,\" he said. \"But we need to focus as well on who's not getting grants — those people who have done a long term in prison, who have rehabilitated themselves, often done incredible things in prison. And they're being ignored in their plea for mercy.\"   Trump appointed Alice Johnson as his \"pardon czar\" in February. Johnson was pardoned for a nonviolent drug offense by Trump during his first term after her story got the attention and advocacy of celebrities such as Kim Kardashian.   Johnson said she was going to \"fight for those who are still incarcerated, who don't have a voice like I have right now.\" She told Fox News in May that she'd sent more than 100 clemency petitions to the White House and \"over 46 people really were able to get a second chance in life.\"\n",

Al-Sharaa led the rebel forces that toppled former Syrian President Bashar Assad last December and was named the country's interim leader in January.   \n   Trump and al-Sharaa — who once had ties to al-Qaida and had a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head — first met in May in Saudi Arabia. At the time, the U.S. president described al-Sharaa as a \"young, attractive guy. Tough guy. Strong past, very strong past. Fighter.\" It was the first official encounter between the U.S. and Syria since 2000, when former President Bill Clinton met with Hafez Assad, the father of Bashar Assad.   White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday's visit is \"part of the president's efforts in diplomacy to meet with anyone around the world in the pursuit of peace.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa looks on during a press conference in Ankara, Turkey, Feb. 4.\n                \n                    Francisco Seco/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Francisco Seco/AP\n    \n\n   \n   Trump has recently said al-Sharaa is \"doing a very good job so far\" and that a \"lot of progress has been made with Syria\" since the U.S. eased sanctions.   \n   One official with knowledge of the administration's plans said Syria's entry into the global coalition fighting the Islamic State group will allow it to work more closely with U.S. forces, although the new Syrian military and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the country's northeast had already been fighting the group.   Before al-Sharaa's arrival in the U.S., the United Nations Security Council voted to lift sanctions on the Syrian president and other government officials in a move that Mike Waltz, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said was a strong sign that Syria is in a new era since the fall of Assad.   \n   Al-Sharaa comes into the meeting with his own priorities. He wants a permanent repeal of sanctions that punished Syria for widespread allegations of human rights abuses by Assad's government and security forces. While the Caesar Act sanctions are currently waived by Trump, a permanent repeal would require Congress to act.   \n   One option is a proposal from Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, that would end the sanctions without any conditions. The other was drafted by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a hawkish Trump ally who wants to set conditions for a sanctions repeal that would be reviewed every six months.   But advocates argue that any repeal with conditions would prevent companies from investing in Syria because they would fear potentially being sanctioned. Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, likened it to a \"hanging shadow that paralyzes any initiatives for our country.\"\n",

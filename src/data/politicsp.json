He grew up and became a doctor, and these days, he heads to a shooting range in Maryland each week for target practice with his Smith & Wesson .380.   Charles, who is Black, says he bought the handgun after the Trump administration did things that scared him, including arresting a foreign student who criticized her university's policy on Israel and handcuffing a U.S. senator who was forcibly removed from a Homeland Security news conference.   \n   \"What I'm talking about is protecting myself from a situation where there may be some kind of civil unrest,\" says Charles. Like most people who spoke with NPR for this story, he asked that his last name not be used for fear of retribution.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Charles, a doctor in Maryland, wasn't even allowed to have toy guns as a kid. Now, he says he's so concerned about his family's safety because of the Trump administration's actions and rhetoric, that he trains weekly at a shooting range.\n                \n                    KT Kanazawich\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        KT Kanazawich\n    \n\n   \n   Charles says he worries that some of President Trump's supporters may feel emboldened someday to target minorities like him and his family.   \"He could dispatch citizens or the government,\" Charles says. \"I'm not saying that's what's going to happen. What I'm saying is none of this is out of the question any longer.\"   Changing face of American gun ownership   For decades, the image of gun ownership in America was white, rural and Republican, but that's been changing, according to gun clubs, trainers, Second Amendment advocates and academic researchers.   They say more liberals, people of color and LGBTQ folks have been buying guns for years and particularly since Trump's reelection in 2024. This story was based on more than 30 interviews. David Phillips is on the training team of the Liberal Gun Club, which has chapters in more than 30 states and provides a haven for liberals to train and learn about guns. He says club membership has grown from 2,700 in November to 4,500 today. Requests for training, he says, have quintupled.   \n   \"The concern is about the supporters of the right-wing who feel that they have been given permission to run roughshod at least, if not commit outright violence against people they don't like,\" Phillips says.   Asked about these concerns, the White House dismissed NPR's reporting.   \"Instead of covering Americans exercising their Second Amendment Right and trying to disingenuously blame President Trump, NPR should highlight the dangerous language from elected Democrats that has driven leftists to commit actual violence against Republicans – including the recent assassination of Charlie Kirk,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement.   Jackson said stories like this one are why NPR no longer receives federal funding. \"That's something we can all celebrate,\" she added.   Trump has also blamed what he calls \"the radical left\" for demonizing him and his supporters and inspiring political violence.   But many liberals who spoke for this story say it's the other way around. They say the president dehumanizes others with his rhetoric. For instance, Trump has said undocumented immigrants are \"poisoning the blood of our country.\" The president has also called his political opponents, \"radical left thugs that live like vermin.\"   Despite White House claims to the contrary, there is ample anecdotal evidence that more people are buying guns because some of the administration's policies frighten them.   \"Never seen a surge like this before\"   \"As everyone knows, there has been a huge surge in fear and panic since the election,\" said Tom Nguyen, speaking on YouTube to his LA Progressive Shooters gun club just a few weeks after Trump's inauguration. Nguyen said the club's Pistol 101 classes were already booked out for nine months.   \"I've never seen a surge like this before,\" said Thomas Boyer, spokesperson for the San Francisco Chapter of the Pink Pistols, whose motto is: \"Armed gays don't get bashed.\"   \n   Even traditional Second Amendment groups say more liberals are seeking gun training.   \"It's definitely common knowledge at this point,\" said Taylor Rhodes, communications director for the National Association for Gun Rights.   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Charles's daughter, Charley, practices with her father. The day after President Trump's election, a man drove onto her college campus and hurled racial slurs at Black students.\n                \n                    KT Kanazawich\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        KT Kanazawich\n    \n\n   \n   There's no way to measure just how many people are buying guns because the political environment scares them, but the phrase \"How do I buy a gun?\" spiked a number of times in the past year, according to Google Trends.   Those spikes happened around the time of Trump's 2024 election, his inauguration, the first immigration enforcement blitz in January and the day when Trump held a military parade in Washington, D.C.   This recent surge in liberals buying guns is the latest in a years-long trend. For instance, a University of Chicago study found that gun ownership by Democrats or Democrat-leaning people rose by 7 percentage points between 2010 and 2022.   David Yamane, a professor of sociology at Wake Forest University in North Carolina, says the events of 2020 and early 2021 – the pandemic, the murder of George Floyd and the Jan. 6 Capitol riot – were particular drivers.   \"We do know that in that year that new gun owners were disproportionately African American (and) disproportionately female,\" Yamane said.   Only for self-protection   Like the vast majority of gun owners, those who spoke to NPR said they would use the weapons only for self-protection and would not engage law enforcement.   \"All the language that we use is absolutely not about rallying together to arm and go assault anyone,\" says MJ, a member of a liberal, self-defense group in the Midwest who asked NPR not to use his full name because he feared retribution. \"If anyone even talks like that, I or someone else would probably boot them out of the group.\"   Bill Sack, director of legal operations with the Second Amendment Foundation, which challenges gun control legislation, says he's glad to see more liberals exercising their right to self-defense – but he isn't happy about why.   \n   \"Is it a good thing that people are scared?\" he says. \"No, of course not.\"   Every new gun owner who spoke to NPR said they thought it was highly unlikely they would have to defend themselves because of civil unrest. But they also said that if they ever had to, they'd regret not having a gun.   \"As a man, as a father, as a husband, how remiss and derelict would it be for me to not be prepared?\" says Charles, the Maryland doctor.\n",

    "body": "\n      NPR's Scott Detrow speaks with former White House ethics lawyer Richard Painter about gifts from foreign governments or corporations that President Trump has accepted.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  The corner of the internet interested in wristwatches was the first to spot the new desktop clock. It appeared in recent photographs of President Trump at work in the Oval Office. The watch-watching websites Watches Of Espionage and Hodinkee were able to confirm this was a gift from the CEO of Rolex. Last week, Trump met with him and several Swiss business executives at the White House, where the Swiss newspaper Blick reported a different CEO gifted Trump an engraved gold bar. And today, the White House announced that tariffs on Swiss imports had been dropped from 39% to a more manageable 15%.Now, it was the governments of Switzerland and the United States that hammered out this deal, not business leaders, but this is not the first time that foreign gifts to the U.S. president have lined up with foreign policy. And this felt like a good time to take stock of the trends that we have seen this year. Richard Painter is a law professor at the University of Minnesota and was former chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush. Welcome to the program.RICHARD PAINTER: Well, thank you for having me.DETROW: What did you make of the president of the United States being given a Rolex and a gold bar by executives who had a lot to gain from lower tariffs?PAINTER: I certainly view this as inappropriate. It appears as if there's a quid pro quo of a gift from foreign interests to the president in return for a concession on tariffs, and once this precedent is set, we'll have other countries and industries offering the same. And this is a matter of grave concern for the United States. It's unconstitutional in the United States to - for the president or anyone else in a position of power to receive anything of value from a foreign government. That is unconstitutional. But if the gift is from a foreign corporation or a private interest, we - it's not technically prohibited under the emoluments clause of the Constitution. But it's still a very, very dangerous precedent to set that foreign interests can give gifts to the president and then get a concession on tariffs or anything else.DETROW: There's also something we've seen with both Trump administrations that other presidents put guardrails around them. They followed norms. They followed accepted practices. And President Trump has just often made it clear he's not interested in following that. Is that an accurate way to frame it?PAINTER: That is a very accurate way to frame it. And the president feels he has the wind at his back because the Supreme Court has ruled that a president can never be prosecuted for a criminal act within his core constitutional powers. And President Trump believes that just about everything is within his core constitutional powers. And we also have a Congress that won't do anything about this - that won't hold the president to account.DETROW: What normally happens under standard procedure when an executive or another world leader gives the president of the United States an official gift? - especially an expensive gift, which I'm sure happens all the time, especially during a meeting talking about a policy change that could benefit that company or that country.PAINTER: In the Bush White House, when I was the chief White House ethics lawyer, when gifts were given to the president, it was brought to my attention, and only in very, very rare circumstances did the president accept the gift. And the president would never accept a gift in his personal capacity from a foreign power in excess of that which has been authorized by Congress, and the maximum there now is $480. Anything else cannot be a gift to the president. Could be potentially a gift to the United States from the foreign country, like the French gave us the Statue of Liberty and so forth, but the president in his personal capacity, the maximum is $480.DETROW: The Rolex clock in question, which I'm quite sure is over that threshold, was technically a gift to the American people. Does that matter to you? Is that a technical difference? Is that an important difference?PAINTER: Well, technically, let's see where it ends up. Is it going to end up like the 747 airplane from Qatar, in the presidential library of Donald Trump, which will be a private organization? That's not a gift to the American people. And, quite frankly, we don't need a clock. That's not what the United States needs.DETROW: What is your pitch to the most skeptical listener out there that these types of regulations and norms matter?PAINTER: The integrity of our government matters. We have a government that spends a trillion dollars on defense alone, on our military. This is a government which we have the right to expect to serve the interests of the United States and its citizens. And it's really to put America first, not to simply repeat the America First slogan and then turn around and have foreign or economic policy influenced by the private financial interests of those who have power.DETROW: That was Richard Painter, law professor at the University of Minnesota and the former chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush. Thank you so much for talking to us.PAINTER: Well, thank you. Thank you.\n    Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Trump, who was friends with Epstein for years, didn't explain what supposed crimes he wanted the Justice Department to investigate. None of the men he mentioned in a social media post demanding the probe has been accused of sexual misconduct by any of Epstein's victims.   \n   Hours before Bondi's announcement, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he would ask her, the Justice Department and the FBI to investigate Epstein's \"involvement and relationship\" with Clinton and others, including former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and LinkedIn founder and Democratic donor Reid Hoffman.   Trump, calling the matter \"the Epstein Hoax, involving Democrats, not Republicans,\" said the investigation should also include financial giant JPMorgan Chase, which provided banking services to Epstein, and \"many other people and institutions.\"   \n   \"This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats,\" the Republican president wrote, referring to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of alleged Russian interference in Trump's 2016 election victory over Bill Clinton's wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.   Asked later Friday whether he should be ordering up such investigations, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One: \"I'm the chief law enforcement officer of the country. I'm allowed to do it.\"   In a July memo regarding the Epstein investigation, the FBI said, \"We did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\"   The president's demand for an investigation — and Bondi's quick acquiescence — is the latest example of the erosion of the Justice Department's traditional independence from the White House since Trump took office.   \n   It is also an extraordinary attempt at deflection. For decades, Trump himself has been scrutinized for his closeness to Epstein — though like the people he now wants investigated, he has not been accused of sexual misconduct by Epstein's victims.   None of Trump's proposed targets were accused of sex crimes   A JPMorgan Chase spokesperson, Patricia Wexler, said the company regretted associating with Epstein \"but did not help him commit his heinous acts.\"   \"The government had damning information about his crimes and failed to share it with us or other banks,\" she said. The company agreed previously to pay millions of dollars to Epstein's victims, who had sued arguing that the bank ignored red flags about criminal activity.   Clinton has acknowledged traveling on Epstein's private jet but has said through a spokesperson that he had no knowledge of the late financier's crimes. He also has never been accused of misconduct by Epstein's known victims.   Clinton's deputy chief of staff Angel Ureña posted on X Friday: \"These emails prove Bill Clinton did nothing and knew nothing. The rest is noise meant to distract from election losses, backfiring shutdowns, and who knows what else.\"   Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, but was spared a long jail term when the U.S. attorney in Florida agreed not to prosecute him over allegations that he had paid many other children for sexual acts. After serving about a year in jail and a work release program, Epstein resumed his business and social life until federal prosecutors in New York revived the case in 2019. Epstein killed himself while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.   \n   Summers and Hoffman had nothing to do with either case, but both were friendly with Epstein and exchanged emails with him. Those messages were among the documents released this week, along with other correspondence Epstein had with friends and business associates in the years before his death.   Nothing in the messages suggested any wrongdoing on the men's part, other than associating with someone who had been accused of sex crimes against children.   Summers, who served in Clinton's cabinet and is a former Harvard University president, previously said in a statement that he has \"great regrets in my life\" and that \"my association with Jeffrey Epstein was a major error of judgement.\"   \n   On social media Friday night, Hoffman called for Trump to release all the Epstein files, saying they will show that \"the calls for baseless investigations of me are nothing more than political persecution and slander.\" He added, \"I was never a client of Epstein's and never had any engagement with him other than fundraising for MIT.\" Hoffman bankrolled writer E. Jean Carroll's sexual abuse and defamation lawsuit against Trump.   After Epstein's sex trafficking arrest in 2019, Hoffman said he'd only had a few interactions with Epstein, all related to his fundraising for MIT's Media Lab. He nevertheless apologized, saying that \"by agreeing to participate in any fundraising activity where Epstein was present, I helped to repair his reputation and perpetuate injustice.\"   Bondi, in her post, praised Clayton as \"one of the most capable and trusted prosecutors in the country\" and said the Justice Department \"will pursue this with urgency and integrity to deliver answers to the American people.\"   Trump called Clayton \"a great man, a great attorney,\" though he said Bondi chose him for the job.   Clayton, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission during Trump's first term, took over in April as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York — the same office that indicted Epstein and won a sex trafficking conviction against Epstein's longtime confidante, Ghislaine Maxwell, in 2021.   Trump changes course on Epstein files   Trump suggested while campaigning last year that he'd seek to open up the government's case files on Epstein, but changed course in recent months, blaming Democrats and painting the matter as a \"hoax\" amid questions about what knowledge he may have had about Epstein's yearslong exploitation of underage girls.   On Wednesday, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released three Epstein email exchanges that referenced Trump, including one from 2019 in which Epstein said the president \"knew about the girls\" and asked Maxwell to stop.   \n   White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt accused Democrats of having \"selectively leaked emails\" to smear Trump.   Soon after, Republicans on the committee disclosed a far bigger trove of Epstein's email correspondence, including messages he sent to longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon and to Britain's former Prince Andrew, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. Andrew settled a lawsuit out of court with one of Epstein's victims, who said she had been paid to have sex with the prince.   The House is speeding toward a vote next week to force the Justice Department to release all files and communications related to Epstein.   \"I don't care about it, release or not,\" Trump said Friday. \"If you're going to do it, then you have to go into Epstein's friends,\" he added, naming Clinton and Hoffman.   Still, he said: \"This is a Democrat hoax. And a couple, a few Republicans have gone along with it because they're weak and ineffective.\"\n",

Marjorie Taylor-Greene, R-Ga., presides over a House Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, Feb. 12, 2025, in Washington.\n                \n                    Rod Lamkey/AP\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Rod Lamkey/AP\n    \n\n   \n   President Donald Trump has publicly called it quits with one of his most stalwart MAGA-world supporters, calling Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene \"'Wacky' Marjorie\" and saying he would endorse a challenger against her in next year's midterms \"if the right person runs.\"   \n   The dismissal of Greene — once the epitome of \"Make America Great Again,\" sporting the signature red cap for President Joe Biden's 2024 State of the Union address and acting as a go-between for Trump and other Capitol Hill Republicans — appeared to be the final break in a dispute simmering for months, as Greene has seemingly moderated her political profile. The three-term U.S. House member has increasingly dissented from Republican leaders, attacking them during the just-ended federal government shutdown and saying they need a plan to help people who are losing subsidies to afford health insurance policies.   \n   Accusing the Georgia Republican of going \"Far Left,\" Trump wrote that all he had witnessed from Greene in recent months is \"COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!\" adding, of Greene's purported irritation that he doesn't return her phone calls, \"I can't take a ranting Lunatic's call every day.\"   In a response on X, Greene wrote Friday that Trump had \"attacked me and lied about me.\" She added a screenshot of a text she said she had sent the president earlier in the day about releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files, which she said \"is what sent him over the edge.\"   Greene called it \"astonishing really how hard he's fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level,\" referencing next week's U.S. House vote over releasing the Epstein files.   Writing that she had supported Trump \"with too much of my precious time, too much of my own money, and fought harder for him even when almost all other Republicans turned their back and denounced him,\" Greene added, \"I don't worship or serve Donald Trump.\"   Trump's post seemingly tied a bow of finality to fissures that widened following this month's off-cycle elections, in which voters in the New Jersey and Virginia governor races flocked to Democrats in large part over concerns about the cost of living.   \n   Last week, Greene told NBC News that \"watching the foreign leaders come to the White House through a revolving door is not helping Americans,\" saying that Trump needs to focus on high prices at home rather than his recent emphasis on foreign affairs. Trump responded by saying that Greene had \"lost her way.\"   Asked about Greene's comments earlier Friday as he flew from Washington to Florida, Trump reiterated that he felt \"something happened to her over the last month or two,\" saying that, if he hadn't gone to China to meet leader Xi Jinping, there would have been negative ramifications for jobs in Georgia and elsewhere because China would have kept its curbs on magnet exports.   \n   Saying that people have been calling him, wanting to challenge Greene, Trump added, \"She's lost a wonderful conservative reputation.\"   Greene's discontent dates back at least to May, when she announced she wouldn't run for the Senate against Democratic incumbent Jon Ossoff, while attacking GOP donors and consultants who feared she couldn't win. In June, she publicly sided with Tucker Carlson after Trump called the commentator \"kooky\" in a schism that emerged between MAGA and national security hardliners over possible U.S. efforts at regime change in Iran.   \n   That only intensified in July, when Greene said she wouldn't run for governor. Then, she attacked a political \"good ole boy\" system, alleging it was endangering Republican control of the state. Greene embarked on a charm offensive in recent weeks, with interviews and appearances in media aimed at people who aren't hardcore Trump supporters. Asked on comedian Tim Dillon's podcast if she wanted to run for president in 2028, Greene said in October, \"I hate politics so much\" and just wanted \"to fix problems\" — but didn't give a definitive answer.   That climaxed with an appearance on Bill Maher's HBO show \"Real Time,\" followed days later by a Nov. 4 appearance on ABC's \"The View.\" Some observers began pronouncing Greene as reasonable as she trashed Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana for not calling Republicans back to Washington and coming up with a health care plan.   \"I feel like I'm sitting next to a completely different Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" said \"The View\" co-host Sunny Hostin.   \"Maybe you should become a Democrat, Marjorie,\" said co-host Joy Behar.   \"I'm not a Democrat,\" Greene replied. \"I think both parties have failed.\"\n",

The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday night passed a Senate-approved spending package, ending the congressional deadlock that led to the longest government shutdown in American history.\n                \n                    Hu Yousong/Xinhua via Getty Images\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Hu Yousong/Xinhua via Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   The government is back open.   It was the longest shutdown in U.S. history at 43 days.   There are lots of questions about what this means, how we got here and where we go from here. Let's answer some:   Why did it start?   The Democratic base has been urging its leaders to show more fight. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer caught tremendous blowback in March for doing an about-face and going along with Republicans to keep the government open despite what the left saw as an odious spending bill.   When the latest funding fight came up, Schumer this time showed a united front with House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries. Arm in arm, they refused to go along with continuing to fund the government, and made the key issue extending health care subsidies, which, if not extended, would mean tens of millions of Americans would see their health care costs increased.   \n   How did it end?   It ended without the health care extensions Democrats were fighting for. Eight moderate senators crossed the aisle and indicated Sunday night that they had struck a deal with Senate Republicans to reopen the government.   The reason they didn't hold out longer, this group said, was because it was obvious President Trump and congressional Republicans weren't going to negotiate, and too many people were suffering. The Trump administration — correctly — gambled that enough Democrats would not be able to stomach the amount of pain the administration was willing to inflict on the 42 million recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and more than 3 million federal workers.   So what does the bill do?   The bill passed by Congress and signed by Trump funds the government until Jan. 30 with carveouts for SNAP, benefits targeted at women, infants and children, or WIC, the Department of Veterans Affairs and Congress. Those will all be funded until the end of September 2026.   It notably also tries to rectify the firings and loss of pay to federal workers, although it's a leverage point the Trump administration could use again if the government were to shut down again after Jan. 30.   There is also money for increased security for members of Congress, executive branch officials, judges and Supreme Court justices. Several Republican members were outspoken about this after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.   \n   If the government is only funded until Jan. 30, does that mean there could be another shutdown soon?   It's possible. It depends on a few things. What lessons do Democrats take out of the shutdown? Does the fire within the base subside some between now and then? And is there an actual vote on health care subsidies?   OK, so what about those health care subsidies?   It's not clear yet, but the lack of a negotiation on them likely means they will expire unless enough moderate Republicans, feeling pressure in their districts, cross over to strike a deal with Democrat — and Republican leadership, including and especially Trump, go along with it.   But that seems highly improbable — and tens of millions of people would see their premiums go up.   If that's the case, what was the point of the shutdown?   That's a question a lot of people, especially those left of center, are asking. They see what moderate Democrats did as caving to Republicans.   The reality is, though, the 8 moderate senators, who caucus with Democrats and took this deal, didn't want to see regular people feel more unnecessary pain — and they saw no hope for Republicans to compromise after what became the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.   Democrats did accomplish something in this shutdown, though. They elevated the issue of health care, and if Republicans block the extension of subsidies, then they will likely own increased health care costs in voters' minds.   What does this mean for federal workers and flight delays?   Government workers will get back to work, and recent mass layoffs are to be reversed. Furloughed workers were missing paychecks.   As far as airports, there are already signs of easing, but it will likely be several days or more until everything will get back to normal. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy noted that more air traffic controllers are heading back to work, but in the very short term, flight reductions at some major airports will continue.   \n   Were there any surprises?   Yes, there were a few. First, there's drama around a provision slipped in the bill that would allow senators to sue the Justice Department for $500,000 each, if they were subject to subpoenas or had their phone records accessed as a result of DOJ's Jan. 6 investigation.   House Republicans pledged to pass a resolution repealing that provision, but there's no guarantee of that or that the Senate will go along.   There was also a clash about hemp regulation between two Republican senators from the same state. The disagreement between Kentucky Sens. Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul got pretty heated.   The bill also shines a light on how hundreds of local projects are funded — from the purchasing of equipment for a college in the Virgin Islands, the establishing of a veterinary doctorate program in Maryland, urban forest conservation in Texas and asbestos abatement in Alaska to funding for local hospitals, rural community facilities, youth centers, fire stations, and so, so much more. It's earmarks — funding not voted on or allocated through the formal appropriations process but tacked on in spending bills — that pay for all of these things.   One day, there will be a vet that will say he or she got a degree from the University of Maryland, Eastern Shore — and it'll all be because of the funding deal to reopen the government.   Ah, democracy.   Is there a guarantee on a health care vote?   No. The moderate Senate Democrats, who crossed over to open the government, thought so, but House Speaker Mike Johnson said shortly after the deal was reached that he wouldn't commit to a vote.   Whether the vote happens or not, if health care subsidies are not extended, it will be because of Republicans — and that will mean they will own higher health care costs heading into an election year.   \n   What does this mean for the Epstein files?   The end of the shutdown meant the swearing in of Adelita Grijalva, a Democrat, who won a special election in Arizona replacing her late father.   That's key because she signed onto a discharge petition trying to compel the Justice Department to release the files associated with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and her support gave a majority to those who want to see them released. Johnson, who is close to Trump, has argued compelling the release is not necessary — though the president has made clear he does not want them released in full and his Justice Department has not taken public steps to do so.   Even if it passes, though, it will largely likely be symbolic. The Senate is unlikely to get the required 60 votes. Trump would, of course, like it to fail in the House. Colorado Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert, one of three Republicans who have also signed the discharge petition, met in the White House Situation Room, apparently about Epstein. Boebert did not remove her name even after the meeting.   The day the shutdown ended, more investigative materials were released from the House Oversight Committee, including a leak from committee Democrats pointing specifically to emails from Epstein's estate, showing Epstein implying that Trump knew about the girls.   Any day Trump is talking about Epstein is not a good day for the White House.   Who winds up with the political advantage out of the shutdown?   Democrats really upset their base — again. Progressives continue to feel like they get rolled by party leaders. At the end of the day, though, Democrats are likely the ones who got the most out of the shutdown and will have the advantage in the midterm elections.   Consider that Democrats are coming off huge wins across the country earlier this month in the off-year elections. The central issue in those elections was affordability. And through the shutdown, they elevated the issue of health care.   \n   The party and its candidates will likely be able to campaign on both of those issues next year, and with Republicans in charge, that will help Democrats — if they can mend fences with their base, that is.\n",

Instead, it will shift money toward transitional housing that requires work and addiction treatment.   In a statement, the Department of Housing and Urban Development said the new policies will \"restore accountability\" and promote \"self-sufficiency\" by addressing the \"root causes of homelessness, including illicit drugs and mental illness.\" It also noted that overall homelessness funding is going up, from $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion.   170,000 people could be at risk of losing their housing    Critics warn the major overhaul could put 170,000 people at risk of losing their housing again. And they say the timing is terrible. Normally, funding notices go out months earlier, but now programs around the country will have little time to start applying for new funding. And in many places, it will leave a months-long gap after current funding runs out and before new money flows.   \n   \"We'll move very, very fast,\" said HUD policy expert Robert Marbut, in response to such concerns. He also noted the federal shutdown delayed the funding notice, though homelessness advocates say it was already behind schedule before that.   In another change, HUD will no longer automatically renew existing programs – creating the possibility that formerly homeless people who've lived in subsidized housing for years will be forced out. In fact, Marbut said the agency expects some programs to no longer receive funding because it will go to others instead. The agency also says it's opening up more funding for faith-based groups.   The National Alliance to End Homelessness says the new policies could upend life for people who've found stability in permanent housing programs, many of them seniors or disabled.   \"HUD's new funding priorities slam the door on them, their providers, and their communities. Make no mistake: homelessness will only increase because of this reckless and irresponsible decision,\" CEO Ann Oliva said in a statement.   The new policies could also shift more funding to places that enforce bans on homeless encampments.   \"Donald Trump's approach to homelessness does nothing to address the sky-high cost of rent, which remains the main cause of homelessness,\" Jesse Rabinowitz of the National Homelessness Law Center said in a statement.   \n   The funding shift reflects a conservative backlash to longstanding policies   For two decades, federal funding has prioritized getting people into permanent housing and then offering them treatment. That policy is called Housing First and has long had bipartisan support. Backers say the approach has a proven track record of keeping people off the streets.   But critics counter that it has failed to stem the steady rise of homelessness to what are now historic levels.   Those critics include President Trump, who has long pushed cities to clear homeless encampments from streets and parks. The new funding shift reflects an executive order he signed in July, which also sought to make it easier to confine unhoused people in mental institutions against their will.   \n   Marbut, the HUD policy expert, also said Housing First policies have failed to address rising death rates among unhoused people from meth and fentanyl addiction.   \"The influence of Housing First just became too powerful,\" says Stephen Eide, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think-tank. He calls it a top-down approach, and says for years it was hard to get funding unless a program followed that policy. Eide says that left out a large group of people who may not need permanent housing or who may want the enforced sobriety it does not offer.   \"I think what we're going to be looking for is a reinvestment in transitional housing,\" he says. That means places people can stay for 18 months or so to get sober, or recover in other ways, and then — ideally — move out and succeed on their own.   There's broad agreement that the U.S. needs more of every kind of support for homeless people: permanent housing, rehab and mental illness treatment. But critics of HUD's shift fear this may make it harder for some to get help.   \n   \"It is moving away from trauma-informed care, and that's problematic,\" says Stephanie Klasky-Gamer, president and CEO of LA Family Housing in Los Angeles.   For example, she thinks this will lead more shelters to bar people unless they're already sober or enrolled in recovery or mental health care. But that's a high bar for many people, she says, and it could backfire.\n",

Not much of anything, according to some of the right-wing influencers who have long been clamoring for the government to release more information about Epstein and his crimes.   \n   \"To me, these are nothingburgers. If they're even real,\" pro-Trump podcaster Jon Herold said on his Badlands Media Rumble livestream on Wednesday. Herold gained an audience in the wake of the 2020 election after spreading QAnon-adjacent conspiracy theories.   His fellow Badlands Media personality, Brian Lupo, took a slightly different view on his own livestream this week. The emails didn't exactly say nothing, he claimed, but they show that Trump was informing on Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison term for helping Epstein sexually abuse underage girls. (Epstein died by suicide while in jail during the first Trump administration.)   \n   \"My take on this is Epstein and Maxwell are trying to figure out who's a mole or a rat or an informant in their circle of friends,\" Lupo said, referring to an email in which Epstein called Trump a \"dog that didn't bark.\" (The White House has denied that Trump was an informant.)   Epstein looms large for many conspiracy theorists, including QAnon believers. He's seen as a prime example of the satanic cabal of pedophiles they believe are entrenched among the world's most powerful people. QAnon adherents think Donald Trump is destined to defeat that cabal.   \n   Trump has acknowledged he and Epstein were once friendly but fell out decades ago. He's denied any knowledge of Epstein's trafficking of underage girls.   \n   While one of the newly released emails suggests Trump did know about Epstein's behavior, some right-wing media figures say the new disclosures prove Trump did nothing wrong.   \"They're claiming it's a hoax, they're claiming that the Democrats are cherry-picking the things that make Trump look the worst, and that these things prove that he didn't actually do anything wrong and that he's not a criminal and that he was actually gathering information for the FBI on Epstein,\" said Mike Rothschild, an independent journalist and author who has written extensively about conspiracy theories and QAnon.   \n   He said that is \"very different from the song they were singing for years before that, which is that if we just bring down the Epstein ring, all of the Democrats are going to go down with him.\"   Many prominent Democrats are shown communicating with Epstein in the newly released emails. Still, another common thread on the right is that the release is a distraction by Democrats.   \"They think that the Epstein thing is something that is going to distract you from their failures, although the Epstein thing, all it's really doing is exposing more Democrat failures,\" Vince Coglianese, a radio host and the editorial director of the Daily Caller, said on his Rumble livestream on Thursday.   \n   That echoes President Trump's Truth Social posts accusing Democrats of using Epstein to deflect from fallout over the government shutdown. On Friday, he called on the Justice Department to investigate Democrats mentioned in the emails. Attorney General Pam Bondi said she was appointing a federal prosecutor to lead a probe.   Meanwhile, some prominent influencers and conservative media outlets are essentially ignoring this week's release of documents.   \"They already know that their fans are on board 100% with whatever Trump does,\" Rothschild said. \"There's nothing for them here.\"   At the same time, the emails are fueling new speculation on both the right and the left as people race to interpret Epstein's often cryptic language.   To Rothschild, that is a fool's errand.   \"Jeffrey Epstein was, like, not the most trustworthy person…You're taking him at his word because you want to believe him when he says things that are either good about Trump or bad about Trump,\" he said. \"It's absolutely maddening circular discourse and it gets us absolutely nowhere.\"   NPR's Huo Jingnan contributed reporting to this story. \n",

But even in a state that went for Trump by 16 percentage points in 2024, Republicans could not rally enough support this fall for a special session on redistricting.   \"I haven't heard a good reason yet to vote for it,\" said Mark Schreiber, one of 10 Republican holdouts in the Kansas state House. \"To me that's not the purpose of redistricting. It's not used as a political tool to increase your majority, it's to adjust for population changes.\"   \n   Other Republican-led states — like Missouri, North Carolina and Texas — have heeded Trump's call for new congressional maps boosting the GOP. Last week, California voters approved new districts favoring Democrats.   \n   But Kansas' false start was just one example of lawmakers pushing back against a new round of partisan gerrymanders.   On Friday afternoon, Indiana's state Senate president announced there wasn't enough support for redistricting among the chamber's Republicans. Democrats in Maryland have faced scorn from party leaders for speaking out against proposed redraws. And in Ohio, where many expected Republicans to enact a severe gerrymander, a bipartisan deal resulted in a map that moderately advantaged the GOP.   Why do some lawmakers oppose redistricting that would help their party?   Lawmakers' reasons for bucking their party leaders appear to vary widely, including those who object to gerrymandering on philosophical grounds — and some who simply fear the maneuvers could backfire.   \"The particulars might be a little idiosyncratic to every state,\" said Patrick Miller, a political science professor at Kent State University in Ohio.   \n   Miller said some states, like New York and Colorado, have filing deadlines for congressional candidates that place an impossibly short timeline on potential redistricting efforts, given the steps needed in the states to craft a new map.   Meanwhile, lawmakers in Kansas and Indiana raised eyebrows at the six-figure sums required to pay legislators outside of a regular session.   Republican leaders in Kansas also faced a unique challenge. The state GOP would need to marshal nearly the full strength of its supermajorities in the state House and Senate to override a veto from the Democratic governor.   \n   Overall, Miller said, opposition to redistricting has not necessarily come from a place of righteous objection to gerrymandering.   \"I'm sure that there are some Republican legislators out there who are opposed to Trump, who are principled about … redistricting,\" Miller said. \"But I don't see this as a pushback on Trump at all.\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                The Kansas Statehouse is seen in Topeka.\n                \n                    Zane Irwin/Kansas News Service\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Zane Irwin/Kansas News Service\n    \n\n   \n   Kansas state Rep. Clark Sanders said gerrymandering is a \"fact of life\" in politics. But he opposed hastily redrawing Kansas' 3rd District — held by the state's lone Democrat in Congress, Sharice Davids — because he thought it could backfire on Republicans.   \"If we weren't careful, we might end up redistricting and making it difficult to also win in the 2nd District,\" he said.   Sanders said he expressed the same concern when he received a call from the White House several weeks ago, to talk about redistricting.   Last week, Republican House Speaker Dan Hawkins stripped Sanders of a leadership position for refusing to sign off on a special session. He was one of seven committee chairs and vice chairs who were demoted for failing to toe the party line on redistricting.   \"It's unfortunate that we lost our positions,\" Sanders said. \"We just … felt like we needed to do what we needed to do.\"   Similar objections have sparked infighting in other states. Maryland's state Senate president, Democrat Bill Ferguson, has stood in opposition to his governor by publicly opposing redistricting.   Ferguson has argued a legal challenge could place redistricting in the hands of the conservative-leaning state Supreme Court — resulting in new maps that hurt Democrats, rather than giving them a leg up.   \"Ready to ride\"   \n            \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n\n\n    \n        \n                Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Republican, demoted seven lawmakers for failing to toe the party line on redistricting.\n                \n                    Zane Irwin/Kansas News Service\n                \n                hide caption\n            \n            toggle caption\n    \n    \n        Zane Irwin/Kansas News Service\n    \n\n   \n   Despite those setbacks, redistricting proponents in several states are still trying to convince holdouts — under the watchful eyes of the national parties.   Democratic Maryland Gov. Wes Moore recently formed a redistricting advisory commission, despite state Sen. Ferguson's pushback.    \n   And Kansas Republican leaders have vowed to put maps before lawmakers when their regular session begins in January.   \"I learned a long time ago that when you get thrown by the bull, you dust yourself off and you climb back on,\" House Speaker Hawkins wrote in a newsletter after his chamber rejected a special session.   When lawmakers return to Topeka early next year, he said, \"House Republicans will be ready to ride.\"   Even some holdouts in Kansas, like Republican state Rep. Adam Smith, said they had not ruled out the possibility of voting to redistrict in the future.   \"If there's another map that's drawn that looks a little bit more representative for my folks, I'd probably seriously consider voting for that,\" he said.\n",

Seen here from left to right: Democratic Rep. Jared Golden in Washington, D.C., on July 17, Independent Sen. Angus King in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 9, Republican Sen. Susan Collins in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 7, and Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree in Westbrook, Maine, on Oct. 4, 2024.\n                \n                    Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images, Nathan Posner/Anadolu via Getty Images, J.

Scott Applewhite/AP, Gregory Rec/Getty Images\n    \n\n   \n   AUGUSTA, Maine — This week's vote to end the federal government shutdown sharply divided Congress along partisan lines. Yet the bill to reopen the government was reliant upon Democratic lawmakers of both chambers who joined Republicans, exposing rifts within the Democratic Party.   That political divide was clearly evident in Maine's congressional delegation — and the public's reaction to how they voted.   \"Well, Angus really hurt us in Maine,\" said Donna Doucette who, like many folks in Maine, refers to Sen. Angus King by his first name. King — an independent who caucuses with Democrats — was among eight minority party senators who negotiated a deal with Republicans to reopen government.   \n   Doucette was one of about two dozen protesters holding signs along a busy street in Waterville on a recent cold and blustery November afternoon. The protesters, many of whom are part of the local Indivisible chapter, were opposed to the deal ending the government shutdown.   \"I've supported him from the beginning and I think he sold us out. Especially when I'm retired, still dealing with cancer — I don't need that now. Nor does my husband, who is even older than me,\" she said.   As part of the deal, Senate Republicans promised a future vote on extending subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.   But critics say they betrayed the Democratic cause by failing to secure an actual extension of the tax credits that roughly 20 million ACA users rely upon to lower their premiums. Without congressional action, the average premium is expected to more than double after December 31st.   Some protesters brought signs calling King a coward. Cindy Burke said he caved.   \"We held out for 40 days, I think, and I just feel that we got nothing from it,\" said Burke. \"And a promise to have a vote on the ACA, I don't believe that is going to happen. I don't trust the Republicans.\"   \n   A small delegation with a significant split    Maine's four-person congressional delegation is one of the smallest in the country. Yet their mixed votes on the bill to reopen the government reflect the national divide over the fraught issue.   Maine's Republican Sen. Susan Collins blamed the shutdown on Democrats and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. Yet as chairwoman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, Collins helped broker the compromise that funds the government through January 30 and fully funds some agencies through September 30.   \n   Maine Rep. Jared Golden, a Democrat, supported extending the ACA subsidies but blasted his party's shutdown strategy. He cast one of his party's six House votes to end the shutdown.   His fellow Maine Democrat, Congresswoman Chellie Pingree, views the compromise as a \"capitulation,\" particularly after the Democratic victories nationwide during the Nov. 4 election.   \"Many of us felt like there was a lot of momentum behind us,\" said Pingree. \"And the Republicans are feeling these concerns. They are losing court battles and they are getting the same calls that we are. We should move them to a decision, not the promise of a vote.\"   Angus King said in an interview with Maine Public Radio earlier this week that he's surprised by the ferocity of the backlash, although he understands the sentiment.   \"I understand because millions of people in this country are gravely worried and angry and frankly scared about the future of their country because of what Donald Trump is doing,\" King said. \"I'm with them. I've been to the 'No Kings' rallies here in Maine.\"   But King defended his decision, saying Republicans made clear they would not negotiate on the ACA until the government reopened. Government shutdowns rarely secure policy concessions for the minority party.   \n   Although he supports extending the subsidies, King said the shutdown harmed Americans — and empowered Trump. That's why King voted with Republicans more than a dozen times to avoid or end the shutdown.   \"And I get it: people want some place to stand up and they felt this was it,\" King said. \"But it's backfiring in a sense that it is hurting a lot of people without getting what we want.\"   Independents play a key role in upcoming elections   It's unclear how shutdown partisanship will impact next year's elections in Maine — a state where 30 percent of voters are independents. And Maine could play an outsized role in control of Congress after 2026.   \n   Golden isn't seeking reelection in a House district that Trump won twice, giving Republicans an opportunity to flip the seat. And the shutdown is already popping up in the heated Democratic primary to challenge Collins, one of the Senate's most vulnerable Republicans. Collins has not yet announced that she is running for reelection, although she is aggressively fundraising.   \"I want to reiterate my call for Leader Schumer to step down,\" said Democratic Senate candidate Graham Platner, a Marine Corps veteran and oysterman whose anti-establishment message has drawn huge crowds, despite recent controversy over past online comments and a tattoo widely recognized as a Nazi symbol. Platner has said he didn't realize the connection when he received the tattoo as a young infantryman and recently had it covered.   Platner denounced the shutdown deal, blaming Schumer — who opposed the deal but couldn't keep his party unified against it. But he also took a not-so-subtle jab at Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who was recruited by Schumer to run for the Senate.   \"The governor has Chuck Schumer's phone number. She should give him a call and have a chat about that.\"   For her part, Mills said this week that she strongly disagrees with the deal to end the shutdown.   \"I appreciate Senator King's efforts here, but it's not going to work,\" Mills said on MSNBC. \"The mere promise of taking it up, putting it on the calendar, talking about it in December . . . Maine people can't wait.\"   Back in Waterville, protest organizer Karen Heck said she's frustrated — with King, with her Democratic Party and with politicians, in general.   \"I just think that most people are tired of a government that doesn't work for them,\" Heck said. \"Whether that's a schism in the Democratic Party or not, I think that this old system, the old system is not working for us. And a lot of people are angry about that.\"   \n   Heck added that she thinks people will demand a change — possibly starting in next year's primaries.\n",

    "body": "\n      The government reopened, more files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were released, and the White House is shifting some attention to affordability.   \n\n    SCOTT DETROW, HOST:  The government is back open after a 43-day shutdown, the longest in U.S. history. But that wasn't the only story in politics this week. House Democrats released more files related to Jeffrey Epstein, and consumers still seem concerned about high prices. It's been a busy week, so we have invited senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro as well as White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben on. Nice to talk to both of you again. How's it going?DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Great. Good to talk to you.DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Great to be with you, Scott.DETROW: Domenico, let me start with you. Last week, we were talking about all the ways Democrats were winning. People in the party seemed excited. This week, Democrats are mad about the vote to end the shutdown. Is that as dramatic as a reversal as it seems?MONTANARO: Well, it's certainly a lot of whiplash for Democrats. I mean, progressives feel let down by the party again. It's yet another time when they feel steamrolled by leadership. But it's not all doom and gloom for the party coming out of the shutdown with really nothing to show for it. They elevated the issue of health care as a major issue, and that's forcing Republicans on the defensive here. And coming off Democrats' sweeping victories earlier this month in the off-year elections, affordability was the big issue there. So Democrats clearly now have these two issues to run on, especially if Republicans in Congress block the extension of health care subsidies in this promised vote that could take place next month.KURTZLEBEN: And if those subsidies are blocked, there would be real consequences beyond partisan politics. Insurance premiums could go super high for people in those ACA marketplaces if they lose their subsidies. According to KFF, a nonprofit health policy think tank, premiums could go up by 114% on average, so that's more than double. That is hundreds of dollars a month for some people, and that is money they could be spending on rent or groceries or gas money.DETROW: I mean, that is notable. It's only been a few days since that vote, but it kind of seems like the White House is trying to move on from the shutdown already. Is that fair?KURTZLEBEN: Yeah, and trying is the operative word there. But really, all of Washington is moving on from the shutdown, but for different reasons. Now, the White House, for its part, they seem totally fine to keep talking about the shutdown. Vice President JD Vance talked quite a bit about it on Fox News last night, and he was delivering the message we've been hearing from the White House for weeks, which is the Democrats caused this, and now they've caved, so this all happened for nothing.But now you have two things happening that are nudging the White House past all of this. One is that Trump's approval, especially on the economy, has been falling and is still falling. And two, House Democrats released those Jeffrey Epstein emails that just look really bad for the president. One of them, for example, says that Trump, quote, \"knew about the girls.\" Now, this raises the perennial question about the relationship between Trump and Epstein. What exactly was the nature of their relationship, and what did Trump know?DETROW: Domenico, walk us through a little more about what were in these files and how all of this affects Trump politically.MONTANARO: Well, I mean, look, we've always said that Trump has a high floor and a low ceiling when it comes to his approval ratings. You know, this is unlikely to be the thing that has Trump's base abandon him. You know, that hasn't happened with any number of controversies over the decade that Trump has been on the political scene, but this does keep the pressure on Trump, something Democrats are happy to do. It's irritating for Trump. He doesn't want to talk about it. Any day Trump is having to talk about Epstein really is a bad day for him and the White House.Trump is reverting to a typical playbook here, calling it a Democratic hoax. But let's remember, he promised to release these files during the 2024 presidential campaign, and when a big part of his base believes this conspiracy that there's a cabal of high-powered people who are pedophiles in the government, then this is not something Trump wants to have to be talking about or explaining away. He wants it to go away, but the drip drip drip makes it hard to do that.DETROW: But it's a lot of drip drip drip, and it is incredibly hard to keep track of.KURTZLEBEN: Yeah. So to be super clear on all of this, what was released this week by Congress was not the Epstein files we keep talking about. The DOJ has those, and the House still has to vote on releasing those. But even if they do, the Senate might not even take it up. And if they do, it's almost certain they'll vote it down. And even if they didn't, the president could veto it. Now, given all of that, you might ask why there's so much attention on this vote. Well, part of it is that attention has just been snowballing during the long wait for the House to even vote on this, not to mention given how hard the White House is fighting it. But on a basic human level, there were very real victims of Jeffrey Epstein, and they're fighting for this, and sympathizing with them isn't partisan.DETROW: All of this is happening at a time the White House is trying to talk about affordability. We noted earlier that Trump's approval on this issue is not great. Danielle, have they made any headway with that message?KURTZLEBEN: Well, that's going to remain to be seen. For now they are talking once again about trade and tariffs. They announced on Thursday, for example, some frameworks of trade deals that they're going to work out with some Latin American countries. Now, a framework means nothing is implemented yet, but it's in the White House's interest to show they're doing things, so they're sure talking about it.Now, tariffs have raised the price on some groceries, and Americans are feeling it. So what the White House is saying they're doing is they're removing tariffs on some goods that can't be grown in the U.S., like coffee and bananas. So the White House would, by removing those tariffs, be lowering prices that they themselves helped to increase. And also the White House will likely be trying to announce more trade moves before the Supreme Court rules on whether a bunch of their tariffs are even lawful.MONTANARO: Look, affordability is probably going to be the big issue for next year, and if it continues to be the main issue, that's good for Democrats since Republicans are in charge. And that's an ironic twist considering it's exactly the issue that hurt former President Biden and Democrats in the last years of his presidency and in the 2024 election.DETROW: That is NPR's Domenico Montanaro and Danielle Kurtzleben.
